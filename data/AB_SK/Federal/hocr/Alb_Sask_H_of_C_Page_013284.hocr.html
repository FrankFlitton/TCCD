               its schools, and Wherever it is taught or spoken 
               <br />
               in Canada. Sir, during last summer, in a speech 
               <br />
               which I addressed to a number of my constituents, 
               <br />
               I uttered a few Words which I will take the liberty 
               <br />
               of repeating here as an answer to the threats 
               <br />
               against the French Canadians, contained in the 
               <br />
               speeches of the hon. member for North Simcoe. 
               <br />
               After having given some explanations with regard 
               <br />
               to the Jesuit question, which had been debated in 
               <br />
               this House last Session, I referred to the threatsut- 
               <br />
               tered by the hon. member for North Simcoe in his 
               <br />
               Stayner speech, and also to newspaper articles con- 
               <br />
               taining the most violent, abusive, injurious, of- 
               <br />
               fensive, provoking and threatening language 
               <br />
               against my French Canadian countrymen; and I 
               <br />
               told them: My friends, notwithstanding those 
               <br />
               threats, I strongly believe that we have nothing to 
               <br />
               fear from that quarter. The enjoyment of our 
               <br />
               rights and our peculiar institutions is guaranteed 
               <br />
               to us by the constitution of this country, and by 
               <br />
               what I consider to be a greater power—the 
               <br />
               good sense and love of liberty and fair play of 
               <br />
               the vast majority of our English speaking 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen. They will never permit the 
               <br />
               peace of this country to be disturbed and its pros— 
               <br />
               perity jeopardised by any fanatical action. But, 
               <br />
               I added, after all, we do not know what may 
               <br />
               happen in the life of a people, and history 
               <br />
               teaches us that sometimes damagogues have 
               <br />
               succeeded by appeals to passion and popular pre- 
               <br />
               judice in throwing their country into revolutionary 
               <br />
               convulsion and causing a great deal of evil. If such 
               <br />
               should be our misfortune, if this country should be 
               <br />
               thrown into a civil war, we should be placed in 
               <br />
               the cruel alternative, either of submitting cowardly 
               <br />
               to the annihilation of our race, and all the institu- 
               <br />
               tions that are dear to our hearts, or of standing up 
               <br />
               like men in their defence ; we should have to appeal 
               <br />
               to our courage and to the (protection of the British 
               <br />
               ﬂag. But if chance shoul turn against us, if the 
               <br />
               British ﬂag should be found to be powerless to offer 
               <br />
               us adequate protection, then, my friends, there 
               <br />
               Would be no other alternative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> to us than 
               <br />
               to turn our eyes towards the stars and stripes, 
               <br />
               which would, I believe, offer to us full pro- 
               <br />
               tection against the rage of our enemies. Sir, 
               <br />
               for having uttered these words I was denounced 
               <br />
               by part of the public ress of this country as 
               <br />
               an annexationist ; but I old that there is nothing 
               <br />
               in the lan age I used to justify the charge. An

               annexationist I am not, although I am one of 
               <br />
               those who believe that this country is not destined 
               <br />
               to remain forever in the clothes of childhood. Sir, 
               <br />
               I do not hesitate to say that it would be my pride 
               <br />
               to see my country taking rank among the nations 
               <br />
               of the globe. But the annexationists, those who 
               <br />
               push towards annexation, are to be found among 
               <br />
               those turbulent men who, being never satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               the actual state of the country, would not hesitate, 
               <br />
               for the satisfaction of a mere prejudice, to throw 
               <br />
               their country into a civil war, which could end in 
               <br />
               nothing less than the breaking down of Confede- 
               <br />
               ration and the dismemberment of this country. 
               <br />
               NOW, Sir, the hon. member for North Simcoe ﬁnds 
               <br />
               fault with the French Canadians because they 
               <br />
               endeavor to perpetuate their language and their 
               <br />
               literature, while he says they should understand 
               <br />
               that the best interests of the country require 
               <br />
               that they should abandon their own language and 
               <br />
               speak the English language. Sir, does he sup- 
               <br />
               pose that the French Canadians, just to suit his 
               <br />
               fancy, will become renegades to their language, 
               <br />
               to their literature and to their peculiar insti- 
               <br />
               tutions? Indeed, Sir, they cultivate their own 
               <br />
               language, but at the same time they do their 
               <br />
               best to acquire a knowledge of the English 
               <br />
               language, knowing, as they do, that any man 
               <br />
               to-day, who wants to do some business, must 
               <br />
               know that language; and you have a good evi- 
               <br />
               dence of this fact in this Chamber, where the 
               <br />
               French representatives speak the English language 
               <br />
               tolerably well. No young man in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec considers that his education is suﬁiciently 
               <br />
               complete until he can speak, read and write the 
               <br />
               English language. But the hon. member considers 
               <br />
               that the French language in this country is a 
               <br />
               danger to the state, and that so long as the French 
               <br />
               Canadians are allowed to cultivate their language 
               <br />
               they cannot be assimilated to the Anglo-Saxon 
               <br />
               element of our community. On this point the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has been well answered by several hon. 
               <br />
               members who mentioned different countries where 
               <br />
               two or three ofﬁcial languages exist, and which, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding that fact, are inhabited by a 
               <br />
               homogeneous people living together in a perfect. 
               <br />
               political union. But the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               seemed to cherish particularly the policy 
               <br />
               suggested by Lord Durham in his celebrated 
               <br />
               report on the cause of the troubles in 1837. 
               <br />
               It is said in that report that the cause of those 
               <br />
               troubles was not misgovermnent, but a feeling of 
               <br />
               hostility existing between the two races; and 
               <br />
               Lord Durham suggested as a remedy that the 
               <br />
               French language should be suppressed as an oﬁi- 
               <br />
               cia-l language in Lower Canada. How long did 
               <br />
               that policy last? The right hon. gentleman at 
               <br />
               the head of the Government informed the House. 
               <br />
               the other night that it lasted but during the short 
               <br />
               period of three or four years, and that it was set 
               <br />
               aside at the request or the prayer of those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who.</span> 
               <br />
               were most interested in the question, the Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada, under the Union, in which there 
               <br />
               were as many English as French members. Now, 
               <br />
               supposing such a. policy were adopted to-da , how 
               <br />
