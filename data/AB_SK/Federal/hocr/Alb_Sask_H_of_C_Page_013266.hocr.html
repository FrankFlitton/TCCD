               Sir J OHN A. MACDONALD. The Government 
               <br />
               think that the resolution moved by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice is a measure of peace, and 
               <br />
               .a means of getting over this unfortunate feeling of 
               <br />
               irritation which has grown up between the two 
               <br />
               great races that make the strength and power of 
               <br />
               Canada. This resolution is for the purpose of 
               <br />
               getting rid of the temporary feeling—because it 
               <br />
               will only be temporary—which threatens for the 
               <br />
               moment to disturb the quiet of Canada, and there- 
               <br />
               by to hurt its prestige and its credit and to hamper 
               <br />
               its development. This resolution of the Minister 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«of</span> Justice is, as I have said, a measure of peace, 
               <br />
               and I implore and urge all my hon. friends on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House who look with anxiety for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">future</span> peace of Canada to accept it as such. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for \Vest Durham (Mr. Blake), in his 
               <br />
               speech, and in the resolution which he suggested, 
               <br />
               stated that the time had not arrived for the solu- 
               <br />
               tion of this question and that it ought to be post- 
               <br />
               poned. In my short reply I stated that while I 
               <br />
               accepted the greater part of his resolution, yet I 
               <br />
               thought that while the ﬁrst portion of it would 
               <br />
               quiet the irritated feelings of the people in the 
               <br />
               eastern part of Canada, the postponement of this 
               <br />
               question for an unspeciﬁed time would, 
               <br />
               perhaps, arouse feelings of irritation in the 
               <br />
               western portion of this Dominion. I sug- 
               <br />
               gested across the ﬂoor that for the sake of 
               <br />
               peace we ought, after the people of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest had an opportunity of expressing their 
               <br />
               opinion, throw the responsibility upon them. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for \Vest Durham (Mr. Blake), cast— 
               <br />
               ing aside all partisan desire of triumph, accepted—~— 
               <br />
               although,perhaps,against his own opinion—the pro— 
               <br />
               position that I then made. If we examine and 
               <br />
               compare the resolution which my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice has moved with the suggested 
               <br />
               motion of my hon. friend for \Vest Durham (Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake) it will be seen that the ﬁrst portion of it is 
               <br />
               in his exact language, a little condensed, and it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concludes</span> with the proposition which I made and 
               <br />
               which that hon. gontleman accepted. It was a

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compromise,</span> and in a question of this kind in—

               <br />
               ing a sense of pride of race and nationality, such a 
               <br />
               course is wise and patriotic. I hold that this 
               <br />
               resolution is one which meets the case, and I 
               <br />
               implore the House that it may be accepted. Some 
               <br />
               of my hon. friends think that the power to deal with 
               <br />
               this subject should be at once given to the 
               <br />
               Assembly of the N orth-VVest Territories. Now 
               <br />
               there are reat political considerations against that 
               <br />
               course,an , looking to the future,I think it would be 
               <br />
               a mistake. As my hon. friend from West Durham 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'(Mr.</span> Blake) says, the present Legislature of the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Territories had no commission from 
               <br />
               the people to pronounce upon this subject of the 
               <br />
               ‘tW‘O languages ; they had no means of knowing 
               <br />
               what the opinion of the oople was upon that 
               <br />
               point, and therefore, they id not speak with the 
               <br />
               authority of representatives in regard to the wishes 
               <br />

               the press of Canada how much this question has 
               <br />
               excited the attention of the people of the Dom-

               <br />
               with this question, having made up their minds

               what they will instruct their representatives to 
               <br />
               carry out. Then, Sir, not before, ought we to act

               upon the representations of the Legislative As-

               <br />
               will be taken, I have no doubt, to the fact that 
               <br />
               this resolution of my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice does not allude at all to the printing of the 
               <br />
               ordinances of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—“lest.</span> Sir, it ought not 
               <br />
               in any way to allude to that, or to bring that sub- 
               <br />
               ject into the consideration of this question; and 
               <br />
               why? Because the printing of the ordinances of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Assembly is no matter of concern 
               <br />
               to that assembly. It has no more authority With 
               <br />
               respect to the printing of those ordinances than 
               <br />
               this House of Commons of Canada has with respect
