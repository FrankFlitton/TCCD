               formerly. It is also well known that in those four

               Junction Railway, but he abandoned that position 
               <br />

               000 a year salary; but it is stated that three or 
               <br />
               four gentlemen friends of his divided somewhere 
               <br />
               in the neighborhood of $700,000 or $800,000 
               <br />
               between them. That should satisfy almost any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span>

               dividual, particularly one who, like the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man, is in favor of economy. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has stated that there is a parti <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">national</span> in 
               <br />
               Quebec, led by Mr. Mercier, and he is sup-

               ported by the leader of the Opposition in this 
               <br />
               House. But what is the hon. gentleman himself

               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman? We desire a great national 
               <br />
               party in Canada, but the hon. gentleman is not going

               to obtain it in that way. VVealldesire tohavea great

               nation, and I hope the time will come when we 
               <br />
               will untie the apron strings and go out on our own 
               <br />
               account, but at present it is best to maintain our 
               <br />
               present relations. The hon. gentleman is not going 
               <br />
               to work in the right way. As he wishes to be 
               <br />
               leader of a great national party, he should not col- 
               <br />
               lect around him a small circle of Protestants of 
               <br />
               Ontario and a few Conservatives and endeavor to 
               <br />
               draw them away from his leader. That is not the 
               <br />
               correct course, and the hon. gentleman should be 
               <br />
               actuated by higher motives in such matters. He 
               <br />
               should endeavor to earn a reputation as a great 
               <br />
               constitutional lawyer and legislator. His name 
               <br />
               should be handed down to posterity, but I am 
               <br />
               afraid he is sailing in a boat that will carry him 
               <br />
               down there degraded. Much has been said about 
               <br />
               the different creeds in this country, about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pro</span> 
               <br />
               testants, Orangemen and Roman Catholics. But 
               <br />
               I say this, that in Quebec the English speaking 
               <br />
               people are one-tenth of the entire population, and 
               <br />
               yet they have ten English speaking members in 
               <br />
               their House. I think that is a very liberal provi~ 
               <br />
               sion on the part of the French Canadian people 
               <br />
               towards the minority. In Ontario, where we have 
               <br />
               a large Protestant majority, one-sixth of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation are Roman Catholics, and yet there are 
               <br />
               only six Roman Catholics in the Ontario Legisla— 
               <br />
               ture. It appears to me that there is a good deal 
               <br />
               more liberality among the Roman Catholic French- 
               <br />
               men of Lower Canada than there is among the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to its preamble. Although the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), in the second speech he 
               <br />
               delivered in this debate, has told us that he would 
               <br />
               assent to have that preamble set aside if it did not 
               <br />
               suit the House, and in order as he said not to

               <br />
               bers, yet the fact remains that the Bill would 
               <br />
               be voted, on account of the principle laid down in 
               <br />
               the preamble, and invoked by the hon. member and 
               <br />
               propounded in his speeches. It has been already 
               <br />
               said, and correctly said, by several hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               that if you couple the preamble of that Bill with the 
               <br />
               speeches the hon. gentleman has delivered in this 
               <br />
               House,and outside of this House, you are forcibly led 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that this Bill must be regarded as 
               <br />
               only the ﬁrst step in a crusade against the French 
               <br />
               Canadian race. Any man who reads that preamble,

               <br />
               tion with the Bill, can come to no other conclusion 
               <br />
               than that the hon. member does not intend to

               ritories. By the enacting clause of this Bill he 
               <br />
               proposes to suppress the French language in these 
               <br />
               Territories, but by the spirit he has evinced, and 
               <br />
               by the speeches he has delivered, he gives notice, 
               <br />
               as I understand it, that it is his intention to con- 
               <br />
               tinue the same warfare against the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage Wherever it is spoken in this Dominion. In 
               <br />
               his second speech in this House, the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) complains that 
               <br />
               he has been misunderstood, that his speeches have 
               <br />
               not been fairly read, and that his intentions have 
               <br />
               been misinterpreted. The hon. gentleman, however, 
               <br />
               has repudiated nothing of what he had previously 
               <br />
               said, and told us that whilst he admitted that 
               <br />
               the time might come when the French language 
               <br />
               should be suppressed in the Parliament of Canada, 
               <br />
               yet he would not interfere with vested rights 
               <br />
               which are guaranteed to the people of Quebec by 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. Has the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman forgotten so soon the bearing of the 
               <br />
               ch which he pronounced in introducin this 
               <br />
               Bill? Has he forgotten the meaning 0 the 
               <br />
               speeches he has delivered on this question outside 
               <br />
               this House, and notably his speech at Stayner, in 
               <br />
               which he is reported to have said : .
