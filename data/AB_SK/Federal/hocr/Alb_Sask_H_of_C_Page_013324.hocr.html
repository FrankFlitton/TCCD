               said, there has arisen a dark cloud on our political

               I can only compare some of the speeches of the 
               <br />
               hon. members, who have endeavored to raise pre-

               North Simcoe against the French Canadians and

               what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> there is between an Anglo—Saxon

               the same Empire, and as such we ought to have 
               <br />
               equal rights. Great use has been made, Mr.

               Speaker, of the word “ British, ”during this debate; 
               <br />
               and I have remarked, especially, that the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Albert (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’eldon),</span> in moderate yet 
               <br />
               unjust language, has, in awa ,profaned this noble 
               <br />
               expression. Every subject 0 the British Empire, 
               <br />
               to whatever race or nationality he may belon , can 
               <br />
               claim the same title. The hon. member for orth 
               <br />
               Simcoe and the member for Albert have pretended 
               <br />
               that if French were spoken in the North-West it

               would no longer be a British country. And, say 
               <br />
               they, the French Canadians ought not to delude 
               <br />
               themselves to the point of believing that the North- 
               <br />
               West ought not to be a British country. No, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, we have never been under this impression, 
               <br />
               we have never asked for it, and we would be the 
               <br />
               most grieved parties in the Dominion, if the 
               <br />
               North-VVest was not going to continue for- 
               <br />
               ever a British country. We wish, just as 
               <br />
               much as the hon. member for Albert 
               <br />
               does, or the hon. member for North Simcoe, 
               <br />
               that the North-W’est should continue to be a 
               <br />
               dependency of the Dominion of Canada, or rather 
               <br />
               form a portion of the Dominion, and that it may 
               <br />
               be a British country, if it should not be like the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec, it would be such to the same 
               <br />
               extent as is the country whence comes the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Albert. But what do they mean to 
               <br />
               say, when using the expression “ British ? ” Does 
               <br />
               this mean exclusion for some of the subjects of the 
               <br />
               Empire ‘3 Do we understand by that, unequal 
               <br />
               rights for certain subjects of the Empire, or again 
               <br />
               the rights of certain subjects of the Empire entirely 
               <br />
               ignored ‘2 Does this mean short-sightedness ? N 0, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, I have always held the highest 
               <br />
               opinion of British subjects and of British countries. 
               <br />
               I have always understood that the British language 
               <br />
               was a. noble language ; that a British country was 
               <br />
               a noble country in which liberty and equal rights 
               <br />
               reigned supreme. But, as the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Simcoe understands it, Would it be a case of equal 
               <br />
               rights if all the subjects of the Empire were obliged 
               <br />
               to adopt the customs and the religion as well as the 
               <br />
               language of the hon. members for North Simcoe and 
               <br />
               Albert? Do these hon. members understand by 
               <br />
               equal rights that one ought not to do anything but 
               <br />
               what they do, to think only as they think, and to 
               <br />
               act only as they act? This liberty is a liberty 
               <br />
               which is not British. The hon. member for Simcoe 
               <br />
               profanes this noble expression, degrades this noble 
               <br />
               title, of which every subject of the Empire is proud. 
               <br />
               He desires to give it a narrow meaning, at which, 
               <br />
               no matter What English subject, if he but under— 
               <br />
               stands the importance of the title 0 “ British 
               <br />
               subject,” would blush. The hon. gentlemen, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, who share the opinion of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe, seem to believe that without 
               <br />
               unity of language the country is exposed to every 
               <br />
               plague, and that with unity of language a country is 
               <br />
               secure against all disorders and all misfortunes. 
               <br />
               They have cited <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thragreat</span> American Republic as 
               <br />
               being a country which has prospered extremely, and 
               <br />
               they have attributed, so to speak, all this pros- 
               <br />
               perity to the fact that American subjects enjoy 
               <br />
               this great prerogative, this grand privilege which 
               <br />
               is the hobby of the hon. member for North Simcoe, 
               <br />
               namely, unity of language. But why, I ask the 
               <br />
               hon. member, did a civil war break out in the 
               <br />
               heart of this same great Republic, which according 
               <br />
               to him enjoys unity in language? Why did this 
               <br />
               great civil war, which has had no equal in the 
               <br />
               annals of modern nations, this great civil war which 
               <br />
               has been one of the greatest scourges of the Ameri- 
               <br />
