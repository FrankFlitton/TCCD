               Mr. KIRKPATRICK. I would suggest that

               the number of days for the banks to make their 
               <br />
               returns should be left twenty as it was before. 
               <br />
               The law has worked satisfactorily and there is no 
               <br />
               reason for changing it. If anything caused a delay 
               <br />
               of a day or twu, the bank would be subject to a 
               <br />
               heavy penalty.

               Mr. FOSTER. With reference to this clause 
               <br />
               and the sub-sections contained in it, I have aword 
               <br />
               to say which will, to some extent, modify what I 
               <br />
               stated upon the introduction of the Bill, and upon 
               <br />
               its second reading. There were tw0 things included 
               <br />
               in section 89. The ﬁrst part of the section, and a 
               <br />
               vital part, was that which provided for publicity 
               <br />
               being given to unclaimed dividends and balances 
               <br />
               in the bank. The second part was to provide that 
               <br />
               these unclaimed dividends and balances, or 
               <br />
               deposits, should, after a certain time, revert to- 
               <br />
               the Government and be held by them for the 
               <br />
               public uses of the country. It will be remembered 
               <br />
               that I stated that we proposed to hold by this 
               <br />
               clause in its essence, but I foreshadowed at the 
               <br />
               time that certain amendments might be made. 
               <br />
               The change which I propose to ask the Committee 
               <br />
               to make in that is this : Thatwe shall hold by the 
               <br />
               principle embodied in the ﬁrst part of this 
               <br />
               section, and that we shall give up to a very 
               <br />
               large degree the principle that we contended 
               <br />
               for in the second part. With regard to the 
               <br />
               unclaimed dividends and balances in the hands 
               <br />
               of the bank after a certain period returns shall 
               <br />
               be made of them to the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               and Receiver General; but these balances shall 
               <br />
               remain in the hands of the banks with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘pub-</span> 
               <br />
               licity given by the return enabling those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who.</span> 
               <br />
               have a right to claim them to know that they are- 
               <br />
               there, and to proceed to claim them and make 
               <br />
               What disposition they please with regard to them, 
               <br />
               saving that, with reference to banks which become 
               <br />
               insolvent, I shall have a clause to submit to the 
               <br />
               Committee which will provide that unclaimed 
               <br />
               dividends and balances in these respects shall re- 
               <br />
               vert to the Government.
