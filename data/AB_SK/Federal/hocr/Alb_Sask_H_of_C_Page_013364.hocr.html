               North~\\'est affairs than any previous Bill. For 
               <br />
               instance. under this Bill the Assembly will have 
               <br />
               power to deal with its own elections, and there is 
               <br />
               a clause that gives the Assembly the power of de- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the principle we should go upon is to give that 
               <br />

               Act places within provincial control. always except-

               ing the powerof borrowing money which the people 
               <br />
               do not desire. I think that a great deal more might. 
               <br />
               with propriety and with great advantage to the 
               <br />
               North-West be blaced in the hands of the Lieute- 
               <br />
               nant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governor</span> and the Assembly. For instance, I 
               <br />
               have been pressing on the attention of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span> 
               <br />
               ment and of the Hon. Mr. Carling the propriety of 
               <br />
               placing funds at the disposal of the North-West 
               <br />
               Government to enable them to deal with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inunigratitm.</span> 
               <br />
               There is no reason why a sum should not be given 
               <br />
               to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Assembly to enable them to 
               <br />
               supplement the action of the Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> 
               <br />
               in bringing immigrants into the North-\Vest. The 
               <br />
               Dominion Government very properly takes control 
               <br />
               of the immigration for the whole of this country, but 
               <br />
               in addition to that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> provinces put forth 
               <br />
               exertions of their own. British Columbia can put 
               <br />
               forth exertions of its own, so can Manitoba, so can 
               <br />
               Ontario, and so can all the provinces, becauSe they 
               <br />
               get a lump sum paid to them by the Dominion 
               <br />
               which is based on certain calculations. Probably 
               <br />
               we may have the census returns in our hands be 
               <br />
               fore we get through with this Bill, and I believe 
               <br />
               that, if you take the population of the North-\Vest 
               <br />
               Territories and the fact that we have no public 
               <br />
               debt whatever. and take all the circumstances into 
               <br />
               account, you will find that we are entitled to a far 
               <br />
               larger sum than we receive at present from the 
               <br />
               Dominion treasury. Therefore, there is nothing 
               <br />
               unreasonable in asking that a sum shall be place(

               <br />
               been up in the territories looking at the develop-

               <br />

               peg, that the country near Regina was barren.

               <br />

               <br />
               posit in the Regina basin as they found there. 
               <br />
               Yet this gentleman was told that there was 
               <br />
               nothing but barrenness around Regina. \\'e,

               <br />
               Assiniboia and some from Alberta, so that they may 
               <br />
               go either to Dakota, or to England, Ireland or Scot.-

               any of those territories, some of which have since
