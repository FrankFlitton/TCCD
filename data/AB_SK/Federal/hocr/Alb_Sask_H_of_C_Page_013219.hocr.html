               <br />
               there. It is true that they send a worthy represen-

               speaking colleagues? In New Brunswick, there 
               <br />
               are 56,000 French people, but, where they could 
               <br />
               send three representatives of that nationality to 
               <br />
               represent three counties there, what do you ﬁnd? 
               <br />
               Your humble servant is the only representative of 
               <br />
               the French race from the Province of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick. Does that show that the promoter of the 
               <br />
               Bill (Mr. McCarthy) and his friend from North 
               <br />
               Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) were right in trying to im- 
               <br />
               press upon the people of Ontario that the object of 
               <br />
               the French people of this Dominion is to dem- 
               <br />
               inate and to combine together in order to get a 
               <br />
               dominant inﬂuence and use it to the detriment of 
               <br />
               English speaking people and to their own advantage ? 
               <br />
               I say, when you look at the three Maritime Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in the elections I have mentioned, we do 
               <br />
               not see any such desire to form a combination ; 
               <br />
               they have not acted in the spirit which is attri- 
               <br />
               buted to them. Then let us go a little further 
               <br />
               and look at the Province of Quebec in the last 
               <br />
               election, and what do we see ? The facts show us 
               <br />
               that, instead of combining, the people divided. In 
               <br />
               that large Province, so exclusively French, if I 
               <br />
               may say so—although there are a large number of 
               <br />
               English speaking people—if the French Canadians 
               <br />
               had been actuated by the motives attributed to 
               <br />
               them by the hon. gentlemen, we would not have 
               <br />
               seen the result which actually took place. If my 
               <br />
               memory serves me well, I think that 26 French 
               <br />
               speaking members were returned from that Pro— 
               <br />
               vince to support the Opposition in this House, and 
               <br />
               25 were returned to support the Government. 
               <br />
               Does that look as if there was no division among 
               <br />
               the French people ? Does that look as if there 
               <br />
               was unanimity of feeling of a hostile character 
               <br />
               against the English people? Does that look as if 
               <br />
               they were isolating themselves from the rest of the 
               <br />
               community, and working in harmonyfor the purpose 
               <br />
               of obtaining things prejudicial to the English peo- 
               <br />
               ple and advantageous to themselves ? The facts do 
               <br />
               not show that they were actuated by any such spirit; 
               <br />
               on the contrary, they were divided nearly half and 
               <br />
               half between the two great parties of this Domi- 
               <br />
               nion, and, Sir, have you observed in their votes in 
               <br />
               this House that feeling which is spoken of ? I say 
               <br />
               you cannot point to a single vote upon the records 
               <br />
               of this House since 1867 that supports the as- 
               <br />
               sertion made by my hon. friend. If there ever 
               <br />
               was a question upon which the people of the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Qu‘ec</span> and the French speaking people 
               <br />
               of this Dominion could be united by national feel- 
               <br />
               ings, and, if you will, national prejudices, it was 
               <br />
               the Riel question, that came up in 1886. And 
               <br />
               what was the result of that vote? Speaking from 
               <br />
               memory again, I think there were twenty—four 
               <br />
               French members voting one way, and twenty- 
               <br />
               seven voting the other way. Does that show that 
               <br />
               there was a combination of the French people for 
               <br />
               any purpose hostile to the rest of the Dominion? 
               <br />
               Sir, you will appeal in vain to the records of any 
               <br />
               of the elections held in the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               since 1867, to ﬁnd any proof whatever of the asser-

               tions made by my hon. friend who is pro-

               <br />
               our common country, it is a fact which he asks the
