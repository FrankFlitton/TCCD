               I would point out to these hon. gentlemen who

               spoken thus in the Province of Quebec, and those

               hon. gentlemen Who have spoken on that subject 
               <br />
               in this House, have made these speeches, so far as 
               <br />
               I have read them, only in self defence. The pur— 
               <br />
               port of their speeches have been this: If the 
               <br />
               English people attack us We are prepared to resist 
               <br />
               them; if these people attack our nationality we 
               <br />
               are prepared to resist them ; if these people attack 
               <br />
               our language we are prepared to resist them; if 
               <br />
               these people attack our school system we are pre- 
               <br />
               pared to resist them; if they attack our religion 
               <br />
               we are prepared to- resist them. But they have 
               <br />
               never gone so far as to say: We must go to Ontario 
               <br />
               and pluck from the English speaking people the 
               <br />
               rights and privileges which they enjoy. Their 
               <br />
               speeches have always, so far as I have seen, been 
               <br />
               in answer to attacks made upon them by those 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(entlemen</span> speaking in the Province of Ontario. 
               <br />
               ut the speeches of these gentlemen promoting 
               <br />
               this Bill have not been on the defensive. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe and his friends, on 
               <br />
               the contrary, have spoken in an aggressive

               tone, as aggressive as the preamble of the Bill of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend is aggressive. It is not necessary 
               <br />
               that I should quote from the speeches delivered 
               <br />

               <br />
               to emphasise my view, that I should read from 
               <br />
               the preamble of the Bill, which is as fOIIOWs :—

               <br />
               which I have alluded. Some hon. gentlemen did

               not appear to wish to go so far, and they stated 
               <br />
               they had no intention of interfering with vested 
               <br />
               rights. That is not the attitude taken by the hon.

               member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), who intro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and follow it up by attacking the Separate School 
               <br />

               <br />
               injustice to one is a menace to all. If it is an 
               <br />

               number. Holding those views, I consider it is not

               <br />
               the Bill. I do not think I am prepared to vote for

               should keep it in our own hands, and when the 
               <br />
               proper times comes for legislation, we should,

               belieVe to be right for the N orth-VVest and for the 
               <br />
               great Provinces to be established there, and we 
               <br />
               should consider the circumstances, the population, 
               <br />

               legislate in the best interests of all. Believing that

               Opposition. I have waited for four days in the 
               <br />
               hope that some English-speaking representative of 
               <br />
               the Provinces by the sea, older in parliamentary 
               <br />
               experience than I am, who could have spoken with 
               <br />
               more authority regarding the feeling of the eastern

               haps, in the course of remarks occupying a few

               moments, I may be able to contribute some points 
               <br />
               to this discussion which will enable us to arrive at 
               <br />
               a mutual understanding. The questions before the

               vant and a comparatively narrow question; the 
               <br />
               other, which seems to be irrevelant, is one which 
               <br />
               has taken a very broad range. In the very few re-

               <br />
               these two questions ; one of Which grows out of the

               enacting clause of the Bill of the hon. member for 
               <br />

               out of the inconsequential and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ill-cozﬁructed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre~</span> 
               <br />
               amble of the Bill. The ﬁrst is with respect to the 
               <br />
               simple and narrow question as to whether, all things 
               <br />
               considered, in this year of our Lord 1890, it is 
               <br />
               wise in this Parliament to strike out section 
               <br />
               110 of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories Act, which 
               <br />

               <br />
               with such apreamble, and heralded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> such a
