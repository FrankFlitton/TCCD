               Earlier than that time, a little over six years ago, Calgary 
               <br />
               had no existence-it was merely Fort Calgary; Medicine 
               <br />
               Hat had no existence, Moose Jaw had no existence, 
               <br />
               and none of the ﬂourishing little towns that stretch 
               <br />
               across the prairie now, had any existence. The 
               <br />
               prairie itself was practically virgin of the plough. Now 
               <br />
               it produces millions of bushels of grain, and we ex- 
               <br />
               ported such quantities of grain the car before last, as to 
               <br />
               almost embarrass the Canadian Paci 0 Railway. Not only 
               <br />
               so, but coal mines have come into existence, sawmills, ﬂour 
               <br />
               mills, cheese factories, dairies. Banehing and horse raising 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> carried on to a very large extent, and the day is at 
               <br />
               hand when we shall have smelting and reducing works 
               <br />
               there, and there is no reason why, at this moment, we 
               <br />
               should not have tanneries ﬂourishing in Regina, Moose 
               <br />
               J aw and Calgary. Every year at Calgary you have 10,000 
               <br />
               hides, and 3,000 sheep-skins, so tanning could be carried 
               <br />
               forward successfully. The council has, within ashort time, 
               <br />
               owing to the action of Parliament last year, grown into a 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly. That Assembly sat last year, and I 
               <br />
               am only echoing the language of persons who visited it from 
               <br />
               the east, when it was in session, in stating that that As- 
               <br />
               sembly need not fear comparison with any Provincial As- 
               <br />
               sembly in the Dominion in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">personnel</span> of its members, 
               <br />
               in their intelligence, and in the zeal with which they give 
               <br />
               themselves to legislation. During that time the Minister of 
               <br />
               Interior presided over the destinies of that country, and took 
               <br />
               a deep interest in its welfare, and it is due to him to say, 
               <br />
               that the educational progress we have made has been largely 
               <br />
               due to the great interest he took in education in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. I ask without fear the attentiOn of members of this 
               <br />
               House for that portion of the Dominion, because I 
               <br />
               think this House is now sensible that in that vast and 
               <br />
               fertile region we have the solution of the difﬁculty in the 
               <br />
               way of Canada becoming one day, however distant, a self- 
               <br />
               contained nation. As regards the settlers who are in that 
               <br />
               prairie region, I will say this for them, that there are not 
               <br />
               in the whole Empire men more calculated by reason of 
               <br />
               their intelligence, morality and business qualities to lay the 
               <br />
               foundations of a great and prosperous community. They 
               <br />
               are all energetic, most of them are reading men, some are 
               <br />
               cultured men, and there is no doubt whatever, that the free 
               <br />
               and independent hearing which characterises the men in 
               <br />
               the N orth-West is due in part, Possibly wholly, to their 
               <br />
               free surroundings. It may be that even the associations of 
               <br />
               the N orth-West have some inﬂuence on them. The associa- 
               <br />
               tions connected with the North-West are of the most 
               <br />
               inspiring kind, for though a new land, it is a land which 
               <br />
               has historical associations of which people can never read 
               <br />
               or think of without enthusiasm. Some 150 years ago Pierre 
               <br />
               Gauthier de Varennes traversed those very regions, and 
               <br />
               Forts Du Pas, Fort du Grands Rapide, at the Ra ids of the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, Fort LaCorne, and other places amiliar to 
               <br />
               North-West travellers, are among their footmerks that are 
               <br />
               living yet. That prairie region alone contains 123,000 square 
               <br />
               miles, reaching up from the arid plateau of the Missouri to the 
               <br />
               forests of the Saskatchewan and stretching away from Mani- 
               <br />
               toba to the foot of the Rocky Mountains. That whole region 
               <br />
               maybe described as one vast wheat mine. There can be no 
               <br />
               doubt in the mind of any man who knows that country 
               <br />
               that it is destined to be the great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wheatproducing</span> region 
               <br />
               of the future. My hon. friends from Hamilton visited the 
               <br />
               country last year. Both of them went north and south and 
               <br />
               saw what sort of a country was there. The correspondent of 
               <br />
               the Empire, Professor Dawson, visited the country, and pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0011111517;</span> but my hon. friends from Hamilton, with visitors 
               <br />
               from Ontario, at an earlier period, saw with wonder
