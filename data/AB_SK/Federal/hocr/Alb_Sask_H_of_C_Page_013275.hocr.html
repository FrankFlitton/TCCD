               is the Bill? Simply that the 110th section of the

               <br />
               there can be no ambiguity about the enacting

               possible moment. The authority I have quoted 
               <br />

               <br />
               of Parliament, although a particular mischief is recited, 
               <br />
               the legislative pro visions extend beyond it. The reamble 
               <br />
               is often no more than the recital of some of t e incon- 
               <br />
               veniences, and does not exclude any others for which a

               <br />
               But it may be said that in this case the preamble 
               <br />
               is more extensive than the enacting clause, and, if 
               <br />
               I stop there, it would be said that I had not 
               <br />
               answered the question as to the importance of the 
               <br />
               preamble. But, on page 62, I ﬁnd : 
               <br />

               effect of the latter, when otherwise free from doubt.” 
               <br />

               Minister of Justice, I prefer to take the views of 
               <br />
               Maxwell as to the meaning of the preamble to an 
               <br />
               Act. Let me give the House an instance where 
               <br />
               the preamble to an Act proved entirely inefﬁca- 
               <br />
               cious. There was a statute under which the ques- 
               <br />
               tion was raised as to the legality of the Orange 
               <br />
               Association in England, in or about the year 1832. 
               <br />
               The preamble to the Act recited that it was 
               <br />
               “directed against secret or oath-bound societies,” 
               <br />
               and the argument was made that by reason of that 
               <br />
               statute, 29 George III, and by reason of that pre- 
               <br />
               amble, the Orange society was illegal. But it was 
               <br />
               found that the enacting clause did not go to the 
               <br />
               extent of the preamble, and the opinion was given by 
               <br />
               such gentlemen as Sergeant Lewis, Sir Wm. Howe, 
               <br />
               Sir Robert Gifford, Mr. Gurney, Mr. Gasalee and Mr. 
               <br />
               Adolphus, men, some of whom afterwards adorned 
               <br />
               the bench, and reached high positions in the ser- 
               <br />
               vwe of their country; all of them gave the opinion 
               <br />
               that by reason of the enacting clause not going to 
               <br />
               the extent of the preamble, therefore the society 
               <br />
               itself was not illegal. Now, the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice proposes an amendment, and I must say 
               <br />
               that it struck me that that amendment was as 
               <br />
               inconsistent and as incongruous as the far-famed 
               <br />
               autumn leaves of Vallambrosa ; but after all, what 
               <br />

               covenants on that subject embodied in the British North

               Now, it seems to me that the lion. member for

               North Simcoe has never disputed these premises. 
               <br />

               member for North Simcoe attempted in any way 
               <br />

               <br />
               men in the Province of Quebec, so far as the use of 
               <br />
               the French language is concerned, I would resist 
               <br />
               that attempt to the utmost. But we have heard 
               <br />
               it here declared by the member for North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Siiiicoe,</span>

               ducing this Bill and in his speech the other night, 
               <br />
               that that was not his intention, and, therefore, it 
               <br />
               seems to me that we may agree with these premises.

               the gislative Assembly of the North-West Territories 
               <br />

               Sir, I was prepared to take the objection that that 
               <br />
               amendment did not go far enough, that it did not 
               <br />
               include the ordinances, it did not include the 
               <br />
               statutes, it did not include the proceedings in the 
               <br />
               courts ; but this objection, on my part, was 
               <br />
               anticipated by the First Minister when he spoke 
               <br />
               to-night, and explained that it was no matter, that 
               <br />
               the reason they were not included in this amend- 
               <br />
               ment was that the ordinances were published by 
               <br />
               this Parliament, or were under the control of this 
               <br />
               Parliament, and, therefore, this amendment went 
               <br />
               far enough. I confess that that answer of the 
               <br />
               First Minister is a complete answer to the objec- 
               <br />
               tion I would have raised to this amendment not 
               <br />
               including the ordinances and the statutes. But 
               <br />
               the Bill of the hon. member for Simcoe may be 
               <br />
               passed, and still the ordinances and statutes will 
               <br />
               be published in both languages. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Why</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘5</span> Because, 
               <br />
               What the Bill of the member for North Siincoe 
               <br />
               proposes is simply to repeal the 110th section 
               <br />
               of the North - West Territories Act , which 
               <br />
               has nothing whatever to do with the public- 
               <br />
               ation of the ordinances and the statutes which, 
               <br />
               as the First Minister stated this afternoon, 
               <br />
               were under the control of this Parliament, and 
               <br />
               therefore would be published in both la ages. 
               <br />
               Now, if the Bill of the member from North imcoe 
               <br />
               were to become law the statutes and the ordinances 
               <br />
               relating to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Fest</span> Territories would still
