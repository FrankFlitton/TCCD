               I am not going to discuss the ancillary point, 
               <br />
               as to whether the Minister of the Interior

               <br />
               his denial. We start out with the fact that 
               <br />
               an Act was passed ten years ago for the 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> worked pretty well. The Min-

               is given to those persons whose names are

               <br />
               duct on the part of the enumerator. There 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> room for partiality and bias and

               asks us to assume that all the enumerz‘itors 
               <br />
               will do even-handed justice. He knows 
               <br />
               well, and every member of this House 
               <br />
               knows. that of the two or three hundred 
               <br />
               revisers appointed to revise the lists 
               <br />
               throughout Canada. with all the security 
               <br />
               given by the fact that many of them are 
               <br />
               judges and lawyers, it takes an immense 
               <br />
               deal of time and money to make even an 
               <br />
               approximately accurate list. In the North— 
               <br />
               west Territories you have no revision at all. 
               <br />
               but suddenly, after the writ is out the 
               <br />
               enumerator is asked to make a list. He 
               <br />
               posts that list. One of his friends goes to 
               <br />
               him and asks that his name should be put 
               <br />
               on, anti he can arbitrarily refuse to do it 
               <br />
               if he likes, or he may tell the man he will 
               <br />
               do it and when the man turns his back. 
               <br />
               he does not do it. There is no security to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the’voter.</span> There is no court held, no means 
               <br />
               of compelling the enumerator to put it on. 
               <br />
               The one and only safeguard the electors 
               <br />
               had was, that if their names were emitted 
               <br />
               by the enumerator, they could go to the polls 
               <br />
               on election day and by pledging their oaths 
               <br />
               exercise their right to vote. The Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior says that that provision 
               <br />
               worked admirably well, and he challenges 
               <br />
               criticism upon the practical working of that 
               <br />
               Act. I am willing to accept his statement 
               <br />
               that the Act as it did stand worked practi- 
               <br />
               cally fairly well, but what we are seeking 
               <br />
               to do now is to put back that safeguard 
               <br />
               and put the Act where it was before the 
               <br />
               Senate foolishly amended it, we propose to 
               <br />
               restore the security to the electors which they
