               And that consolation was, to my mind, a very great 
               <br />
               one. But although I did so believe, as I shall still 
               <br />
               venture to entertain that hope, I knew well that 
               <br />
               all this time there were great masses of prejudice 
               <br />
               and suspicion, of ancient hates and misconceptions,

               <br />
               of an event we must all deeply deplore. The 
               <br />
               great institution, the crown and glory, I may 
               <br />

               ﬂames; and we know not how small a spark

               may have kindled the great ﬁre which is con-

               toleration and of our advance in higher education,

               <br />
               a State institution on non-sectarian principles, 
               <br />
               where all were gathered together as fellow-subjects

               to acquire the highest training that the land afforded 
               <br />

               <br />
               were questions of prejudice and of misconception, 
               <br />
               of passion ahd of bigotry, of ancient hate and 
               <br />
               ancient difﬁculties <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;’</span> but I knew more. I am not of 
               <br />
               those who take the optimistic view that in all 
               <br />
               respects our path is easier and smoother because of 
               <br />
               our peculiar conditions in Canada ; I am not of 
               <br />
               those who believe that our path is made plainer and 
               <br />
               straighter by the circumstances of different nation- 
               <br />
               alities and of different creeds. I have recognised 
               <br />
               the fact that our situation, such as it is, presents 
               <br />
               problems of very considerable difﬁculty—perhaps 
               <br />
               problems of very considerable danger—and that 
               <br />
               we might have, if Providence had so ordered our 
               <br />
               lot that we were a homogeneous people,all of one race, 
               <br />
               one tongue, and one creed, an easier path, a plainer 
               <br />
               road in which to travel. I have recognised those 
               <br />
               difficulties with which we may have to grapple 
               <br />
               some day ; though I hope, if we are to succeed, at 
               <br />
               some other time and in some different spirit and on 
               <br />
               some other lines than are proposed to-day. I knew 
               <br />
               that those real difﬁculties added great force and 
               <br />
               strength to the baser elements which form the 
               <br />
               greater part, after all, of the troubles with which 
               <br />
               we were and are encompassed ; I knew the risk and 
               <br />
               the loss which was to be encountered in the Province 
               <br />
               which I may call an English and Protestant Pro-

               vince—the province of Ontario—by acting for those 
               <br />
               whom we served on the path on which we were then 
               <br />
               travelling ; and we encountered it deliberately at 
               <br />
               that time. Nor shall we, I hope shrink from it to-

               day. The right will triumph in the end. There is an 
               <br />
               old proverb in the lan uage which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               would prescribe : “ out cwsse, tout lasse, tout 
               <br />
               passe ; ” and even this storm, this agitation, though 
               <br />
               its proportions may be as great as my hon. 
               <br />
               friend expects and perhaps justly expects, will 
               <br />
               pass away; With serious consequences may be to 
               <br />
               those who are engaged in the contest, but it 
               <br />
               will pass away in the end ; and What is right and 
               <br />
               true will in the end prevail, though some of us 
               <br />
               may fall in the struggle. On what conditions, 
               <br />
               circumstanced as we are, can we live and thrive 
               <br />
               and grow in Canada? Certainly not on the lines 
               <br />
               which are being laid down by those engaged in 
               <br />
               this agitation. I would ask them to put them- 
               <br />
               selves in the French Canadian’s place. You may 
               <br />
               selﬁshly wish that he had agreed to be suppressed ; 
               <br />
               you may have a profound conviction of the incom- 
               <br />
               parable superiority of your tongue, your laws, 
               <br />
               your creed ; you may earnestly desire for all men

               speech, of Protestant religion. But still, after all, 
               <br />
               cannot you put yourself in his place? And can you 
               <br />
               not, must you not, admire the courage, the ﬁdelity, 
               <br />
               and the determination with which, at great odds, 
               <br />
               he fought in all fields—in the legislature, before the

               people, and in even sterner ﬁelds than these—for 
               <br />
               what to him was as dear as what you call your

               and deeper and broader feelings of justice and

               <br />
               disadvantages, he obtained the victory long ago? 
               <br />
               Surely if it were a conquest in which he was in the 
               <br />
               wrong, you have the right to struggle still ; but his 
               <br />
               victory after all was for equal rights—rights equal 
               <br />

               obliterated ; it is inimical to the Constitution that 
               <br />
               it should continue ; you must teach him your 
               <br />
               tongue ; he must forget his own ; he must not have 
               <br />
               What he regards——and, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> his point of View,

               rightly regards—as equal rights with you, the
