               lutely essential ; that is not the proposition. I 
               <br />
               say, it is expedient, and every gentleman who has 
               <br />
               spoken on this question has admitted its expedi- 
               <br />
               ency. Even the hon. member for West Durham 
               <br />
               said that if we were all of one race and one 
               <br />
               nationality, speaking one tongue, the task before 
               <br />
               us would be simpler and easier, and, therefore, the 
               <br />
               proposition before us is not incorrect and un- 
               <br />
               founded. But to any hon. gentleman who objects 
               <br />
               to it, all I can say is, when the Bill goes to Com- 
               <br />
               mittee, should it pass the second reading, let him 
               <br />
               object to the preamble, and I shall be the ﬁrst to 
               <br />
               withdraw it. I want the body of the Bill, and do 
               <br />
               not care for the preamble, and if there be a member 
               <br />
               of this House who desires the Bill and objects to the 
               <br />
               preamble, there shall be no opposition, as far as I 
               <br />
               am concerned, to this preamble being obliterated, 
               <br />
               or expunged, to use any term you please. I will 
               <br />
               say more. I did not in the least dream that the 
               <br />
               words should be taken up in an offensive sense, 
               <br />
               and I can only most heartily express my regret 
               <br />
               that any of my French Canadian friends should be 
               <br />
               offended by this clause in the Bill, or that I should 
               <br />
               have hurt the sentiments of French speaking mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House, or the French Canadians 
               <br />
               throughout the country—for such was far from my 
               <br />
               intention. But what was the proposition of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) ? 
               <br />
               It was that the Bill be not now read a second 
               <br />
               time. That is, he does not want the dual language 
               <br />
               expunged, nor does he want to give the power to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> Territories to expunge it.

               <br />
               the Bill is not read a second time, there it stops.

               <br />
               the French-speaking people as possible. Then, the 
               <br />
               way to do that is to pass the Bill, rejecting the 
               <br />
               preamble, and inserting the clause of the hon.

               pinnacle of greatness which he has occupied for 
               <br />

               <br />
               deal with this subject in a simple way. Punish 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Opera House, and because I ventured to claim 
               <br />
               that the English language should rule in this coun- 
               <br />
               try, but pass the Bill. The way to pass the Bill 
               <br />
               is to go to a second reading and then to expunge 
               <br />
               what is in the preamble. Do not pas the Bill, if it 
               <br />
               suits your pleasure, but vote the amendment of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Berthier. That is honest and 
               <br />
               straightforward, and that, at all events, we can 
               <br />
               understand. We can understand the views and

               <br />
               Opposed to any change. But hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               wish to get rid of this question by a side issue, who 
               <br />
               try to do and not to do it, will not, although they

               may deceive this country. That they may depend 
               <br />
               upon. I listened to the argument of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Kent (Mr. Landry), and I listened to 
               <br />
               the argument of my hon. friend from Rouville (Mr.

               from Quebec; it was arguments, not abuse. It 
               <br />
               was a reason for us to pause in our course, and 
               <br />
               was not simply denunciation of those who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> 
               <br />
               from the views which those hon. gentlemen both 
               <br />
               take. But I say their view is the correct View. It 
               <br />
               is this Parliament, and it is this Parliament alone, 
               <br />
               which has the power to deal with this question. It 
               <br />
               is this Parliament which put that clause in, unin- 
               <br />
               vited. It is this Parliament which has the 
               <br />
               authority to take that clause out. Why should 
               <br />
               we abnegate our duties or our functions on 
               <br />
               the ground of expediency or to get rid of a tempor- 
               <br />
               ary difﬁculty? Will we, in the interest of our 
               <br />
               country, be doing a service ‘2 Will we not be 
               <br />
               keeping open that running sore of which the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman from South Oxford (Sir Richard 
               <br />
               Cartwright) spoke? We put the trouble on the 
               <br />
               people of the N orth—VVest, but, although we should 
               <br />
               denude ourselves of our authority and endeavor to 
               <br />
               get rid of this question for the moment, it will 
               <br />
               remain a burning question in old Canada and in the 
               <br />
               new Provinces, more especially, if on postpone 
               <br />
               the decision of this question until a ter the next
