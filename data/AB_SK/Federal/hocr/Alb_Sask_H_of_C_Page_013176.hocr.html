               away. Now the Anglo—Saxon was placed in the as— 
               <br />
               cendancy ; it was the decree of fate that this should 
               <br />
               be the case ; and what does he proceed to do ‘3 Why 
               <br />
               he sets to work to carry into effect with all possible 
               <br />
               haste his purposes. He intends that this whole con- 
               <br />
               tinent shall have freedom and free institutions ; he 
               <br />
               intends that it shall have religious tolerance; he 
               <br />
               intends that the history of the race on this continent 
               <br />
               shall be marked by the most wonderful material 
               <br />
               development of this or any other age ; he intends to 
               <br />
               build up a great power on this continent ; and he has 
               <br />
               done it. Already the second power in the world 
               <br />
               is the Republic to the south of us ; the greatest of 
               <br />
               Britain’s colonies is the one in which we live ; and 
               <br />
               the power of these two countries is increasing 
               <br />
               in a ratio which almost dazzles the imagination. 
               <br />
               The Anglo-Saxon may be somewhat aggressive, but 
               <br />
               his purpose is nevertheless a beneﬁcent one, and 
               <br />
               he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intends~it</span> is his ﬁxed determination~that 
               <br />
               assimilation and homogeneity shall be the charac- 
               <br />
               teristics of every part of the land over which he 
               <br />
               bears sway. That is his ﬁxed intention, and 
               <br />
               whether he can accomplish it or not, I am unable 
               <br />
               to say ; but that he expects to occupy this contin- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               he will do with Mexico ? He will do with Mexico just 
               <br />
               what he did with the French in Louisiana and the 
               <br />
               S aniards in California. He will say to them :

               will not take them in all at once, as the Whale 
               <br />
               swallowed Jonah, but he will take them little by

               little, and will ultimately assimilate the Whole

               <br />
               ﬁnd our French friends, genial, tractable, indus- 
               <br />
               trious, naturally law-abiding. I cannot tell how 
               <br />
               potent will be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuences</span> that will be brought 
               <br />
               to bear on them, or how rapid the assimilation 
               <br />
               will be; but I do not believe that the position of 
               <br />
               isolation which the French race occupy now they 
               <br />
               will see ﬁt to occupy forever. On the contrary, I 
               <br />
               believe they will ultimately see it to their interest 
               <br />
               to join this great tide, to share this great pros- 
               <br />
               perity, to become a portion of this Anglo-Saxon 
               <br />
               race which occupies this continent—to submit, in 
               <br />
               fact, to the decree of fate. They may not do it in 
               <br />
               this or in the next generation, and we must leave 
               <br />
               natural causes and forces to work their natural 
               <br />
               fruit ; we cannot bring about the change by violent 
               <br />
               measures ; we cannot do it either by this measure 
               <br />
               or by any subsequent one we may introduce. It 
               <br />
               is a matter in regard to which our French friends 
               <br />
               must be left to exercise their free choice. So long 
               <br />
               as they wish to remain as they are, they must be 
               <br />
               free to do so. In the evolution of affairs, when 
               <br />
               they see that some change will be beneﬁcial to 
               <br />
               them, it is for them to choose it or not ; they will 
               <br />
               act according to their own wishes, and be governed 
               <br />
               by their own free choice, be the result what 
               <br />
               it may. That the French race in Canada is 
               <br />
               capable of reaching the highest stage of intel- 
               <br />
               ligence and development goes without saying. 
               <br />
               That they will play an important part in the 
               <br />
               history of this continent is certain, but they

               Now, I repeat what I have said several times, 
               <br />
               as I wish to make this oint clear, that we 
               <br />
               have no intention to medd c with vested rights. 
               <br />
               It would not be prudent to do so. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               says, the use of the French as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> language 
               <br />
               in the North-West is a vestéd right. I say it is not. 
               <br />
               It is not guaranteed by the Act of British North 
               <br />
               America, but it is a right which exists by means 
               <br />
               of the surreptitious interpolation of a clause in the 
               <br />
               statute. That matter we are considering now, and 
               <br />
               it is competent for us to repeal that statute. 
               <br />
               We are not dealing with the constitution of this 
               <br />
               country at all. It is not necessary to conceal 
               <br />
               what the sympathies of the English~speaking 
               <br />
               people of this country are. While we do not pro- 
               <br />
               pose to meddle with vested rights or to make 
               <br />
               ourselves ofﬁcious or offensive in any sense to our 
               <br />
               French Canadian citizens, we do not deny 
               <br />
               that we consider medievalism a little behind 
               <br />
               the age. We do not deny that we would 
               <br />
               like to see the French race rid themselves 
               <br />
               of it, not, as in France, in the ﬂames and smoke of 
               <br />
               revolution, but by peaceful legislation. We do not 
               <br />
               deny that we would like to see them rid of their 
               <br />
               system of tithes, fabrique assessments and the 
               <br />
               other antiquated abuses under which they labor, 
               <br />
               but while they have our sympathy and While

               we bid them God-speed in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effort</span> they may

               make to unburden themselves of this system,

               we do not propose to initiate any movement to

               that end. I shall feel sorry if the spirit of back-

               wardness continues, and shall feel glad that some- 
               <br />
               thing else should take its place. I feel free to 
               <br />
               make this statement,, because it is my conviction 
               <br />
               that the condition of things in Quebec can be im—

               The question may be asked : Why not take the 
               <br />
               amendment of the hon. member for Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin)? It may be said the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories are sure to remove the dual language, 
               <br />
               and that the result I aim at will then be reached 
               <br />
               any way. Why not, then, take the amendment of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Assiniboia, and shift from 
               <br />
               our own shoulders the responsibility of dealing 
               <br />
               directly with this question? Well, I answer that 
               <br />
               I prefer, as the more manly and honest course, 
               <br />
               that we should undo the thing we have done. It 
               <br />
               is my belief that it is incumbent upon this House 
               <br />
               either to afﬁrm that the principle embodied in the 
               <br />
               110th clause is right or that it is wrong. We do 
               <br />
               not want to shift the responsibility to other shoul- 
               <br />
               ders. If the inhabitants of the North-West want 
               <br />
               the dual language, they can have it‘ after they get

               this power. It will be competent for them then to 
               <br />
               adopt it, but let us leave them perfectly nntram- 
               <br />
               melled in this matter. Let us declare whether it is 
               <br />
               our opinion that the 110th clause of the North- 
               <br />
               West Act is a proper or an improper clause. Let 
               <br />
               those who believe it is a proper clause, vote for its 
               <br />
               retention, and let those who believe it is not, vote 
               <br />
               for its repeal. I am free to say that I would not 
               <br />
               vote to grant a dual language to the North-West 
               <br />
               under any circumstances. I do not believe it is 
               <br />
               our business to do so. I repeat if they want it 
               <br />
               they can have it when they have Provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insti‘</span> 
               <br />
               tutions; but it is not our business to saddle it 
               <br />
               upon them. We have no business to make any 
               <br />
               enactment of that kind.
