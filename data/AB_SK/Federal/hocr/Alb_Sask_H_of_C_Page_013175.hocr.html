               in the North-West Territories it was necessary 
               <br />
               and more convenient to have the two languages ; 
               <br />
               in fact he went so far as to say that because 
               <br />
               there were a few thousand French in the North- 
               <br />
               West it was a matter of absolute necessity to have 
               <br />
               the two languages. I wonder how they get along 
               <br />
               in Massachusetts without two ofﬁcial langua es, 
               <br />
               where there are 75,000 French Canadians, or in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Igew</span> 
               <br />
               Hampshire where there are said to be about 40,000 ‘? 
               <br />
               It seems they get along quite conveniently with the 
               <br />
               English language there, and it seems that the French 
               <br />
               go there out of choice, and keep on going there and 
               <br />
               staying there, without feeling any hardship placed 
               <br />
               on them for the lack of their own language in these 
               <br />
               States. If the French can go to Massachusetts, 
               <br />
               Maine, Vermont and otherNew England States, why 
               <br />
               the same class of people cannot go to the North-West 
               <br />
               if there is no French language there, is more than 
               <br />
               I can understand. We are told further that we 
               <br />
               have no speciﬁc information or expressed request 
               <br />
               from the North-VVest for this change. We have 
               <br />
               all the information we want. We are dealing with 
               <br />
               this question on the basis of our own duty towards 
               <br />
               the North-VVest. We took it upon ourselves some 
               <br />
               years ago—it was done by the Senate—to insert a 
               <br />
               clause with reference to the use of the French 
               <br />
               language in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test,</span> and when that Bill 
               <br />
               came back from the Senate to the House, the mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the Government responsible for the Bill, the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior at that time, assumed the 
               <br />
               responsibility for that clause in not insisting that it 
               <br />
               should be expunged' from the Bill. No doubt this 
               <br />
               clause did not attract the attention it ought to have 
               <br />
               done then, and I do not suppose that the hon. the 
               <br />
               ex-Minister of Interior gave the matter any 
               <br />
               particular consideration. He was somewhat 
               <br />
               annoyed at the insertion of the clause, but as it 
               <br />
               was late in the Session he permitted it to pass. We 
               <br />
               have this matter now brought before the House, 
               <br />
               and we begin to realise that it is a question of 
               <br />
               some importance. The question is, shall we undo 
               <br />
               a certain piece of mischief that we did unwittingly 
               <br />
               a few years ago ? I do not care what the North- 
               <br />
               West Will think of this matter. I do not care a 
               <br />
               farthing whether we have speciﬁc information or 
               <br />
               expressed requests, or not ; the question for me is, 
               <br />
               is it a provision that this House of Commons, as 
               <br />
               the original source of authority charged with the 
               <br />
               management of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁans</span> of the North-West, 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled.</span> to insert in that Bill, in the interest of 
               <br />
               the North-West and of the country at large ‘3 If it 
               <br />
               is, let it stand there. If it is not, I maintain that, 
               <br />
               without any reference to expressed requests, or 
               <br />
               Without consulting the Wishes of the North-VVest, 
               <br />
               it is the duty of this Parliament to remove it. 
               <br />
               Then, the hon. gentleman says, let the people of the 
               <br />
               North-West legislate upon this when they become a 
               <br />
               Province. I say so, too, and I say further : let them 
               <br />
               be placed in a perfectly untrammelled position to 
               <br />
               do with the question as they think proper. 
               <br />
               And when the N orth-West in due time 
               <br />
               obtains Provincial Government, let them pro- 
               <br />
               ceed de novo and determine whether they are 
               <br />
               to have French an ofﬁcial language or not. We 
               <br />
               will thus wash our hands of the question. 
               <br />

               That is perhaps all I have time to say this after—

               Sir, the discussion on this question has taken a. wide 
               <br />
               range. It has covered the whole of the colonial his-

               of the House for a few moments while I refer to 
               <br />
               some of the more interesting features with regard to 
               <br />
               this struggle which is taking place on this continent 
               <br />
               for supremacy between the French and the English 
               <br />
               races. We have had colonial establishments in 
               <br />
               America for three hundred years. Three of 
               <br />
               the nations of Europe laid their plans for the 
               <br />
               foundations of empire here—Spain, France and 
               <br />
               England. Spain colonised Mexico and South 
               <br />
               America, but all her colonial possessions 
               <br />
               have dropped from her grasp except Cuba and 
               <br />
               some insigniﬁcant possessions in the West Indies. 
               <br />
               France colonised Canada, and the history of French 
               <br />
               enterprise, French courage, French genius, and 
               <br />
               French daring in connection with the exploration 
               <br />
               of the vast interior regions of America reads like 
               <br />
               a romance. We have in the careers of La Salle, 
               <br />
               Joliette, Marquette, Hennepin, Tonty, and Du- 
               <br />
               quesne, a story of adventure which, I repeat, reads 
               <br />
               more like a romance than the veritable records <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of'</span> 
               <br />
               history. I have often thought, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               when crossing over the prairies of Illinois, how 
               <br />
               magniﬁcent was the conception of La Salle as to 
               <br />
               the foundation of an empire in that region; I 
               <br />
               have thought of his discovery of Illinois, of his 
               <br />
               voyage down the Mississippi to its mouth, of his 
               <br />
               knowledge of the vast resources of that great 
               <br />
               country, of the enterprise which led to the plant- 
               <br />
               ing of military posts at Detroit, Mackinaw, and 
               <br />
               other favorable points in the west and north-west. 
               <br />
               The French of that day were singularly adven- 
               <br />
               turous. The young Frenchmen preferred leaving 
               <br />
               his home on the St. Lawrence and going to the 
               <br />
               wilds of the west. taking a dusky bride of 
               <br />
               the forest rather than one of the marriageable 
               <br />
               daughters of his own people. In this spirit the 
               <br />
               French penetrated the far interior of the con- 
               <br />
               tinent, and surrounded the thirteen colonies with 
               <br />
               a cordon of posts, and, in their magniﬁcent 
               <br />
               conception, took possession of some of the ﬁnest 
               <br />
               portions of this continent. On the other hand, 
               <br />
               we had the thirteen colonies planted by the 
               <br />
               English, a more slow-going, methodical people, 
               <br />
               without that dash and spirit of adventure which 
               <br />
               characterised the French; but these Englishmen 
               <br />
               sat down and began the founding of states, the 
               <br />
               building up of institutions and the formation of 
               <br />
               constitutions ; and the result of their labor in due 
               <br />
               time was embodied in the American Republic, 
               <br />
               with such men as Washington, Franklin, Alex- 
               <br />
               ander Hamilton, and other great fathers of the 
               <br />
               American Confederacy, standing sponsors of the 
               <br />
               work. But before this consummation had reached 
               <br />
               a close, the possessions of France in the north had 
               <br />
               passed away from her. In 1759, on the Plains of 
               <br />
               Abraham, the French power gave place to the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish ﬂag, and that event was one having a more 
               <br />
               important bearing on the destiny of this contin- 
               <br />
               ent than any other event in the history of America. 
               <br />
               That event led unquestionably to the American 
               <br />
               Revolution. But for the conquest of Canada, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the»</span> 
               <br />
               thirteen colonies would not have thought of revolt- 
               <br />
               ing at the time they did. The capitulation of Quebec
