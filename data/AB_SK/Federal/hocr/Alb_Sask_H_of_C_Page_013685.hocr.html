               The feature that concerns this autonomy

               question is this—that upon the creation

               <br />

               safeguard the company in the exemptions 
               <br />
               granted in the contract. The language 
               <br />
               of the contract means plainly that the Do-

               in other words, parliament contracted with

               This feature of the autonomy problem

               tends to prove the wisdom of the words used

               by the Minister of the Interior last year 
               <br />

               against the people of the new province, and 
               <br />
