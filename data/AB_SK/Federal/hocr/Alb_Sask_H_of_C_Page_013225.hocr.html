               the Tory organs, that the French race should 
               <br />
               disappearfrom Canada. The hon. the First Minister 
               <br />
               was a Tory then, as he is now, and he was at the

               <br />

               <br />
               the Council Chamber ; they drove out the members; 
               <br />
               they broke the desks and chairs ; they carried off

               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). And 
               <br />
               who, setting aside Mr. Lafontaine, took up the

               whose name will live in the history of our country. 
               <br />
               It was the father of the Hon. Mr. Blake, who, in a

               most eloquent speech, demanded, as a good patriot, 
               <br />
               as a philosopher, their rights for the French

               <br />
               within the last few days, that the son of this 
               <br />
               great patriot has followed the traditions of his 
               <br />
               father, and has adopted the same line of conduct 
               <br />
               by praising the French Canadians. He has placed 
               <br />
               himself above the considerations of party ; he has 
               <br />
               taken the side of the persecuted, and the French 
               <br />
               Canadians will owe him an eternal acknowledg—

               ment, as they preserve a precious remembrance of 
               <br />
               his illustrious father. I am perfectly convinced, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, that the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) does not hope to obtain 
               <br />
               the result which he has in view, when proposing 
               <br />
               the measure which is now offered for our consi- 
               <br />
               deration. He knows that it is impossible to secure 
               <br />
               the abolition of the French language in the North 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Est,</span> and still less in the Province of Quebec; 
               <br />
               and I tell him frankly that he is dashing his head 
               <br />
               against stone walls by endeavoring to secure the 
               <br />
               adoption of this measure. Before abolishing the 
               <br />
               French language, and taking from us the privileges 
               <br />
               which we enjoy, he will ﬁnd, if need be, thousands 
               <br />
               upon thousands of breasts presented as a defence 
               <br />
               for the liberties which we enjoy. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               recriminations are indulged in against the hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister of the Province of Quebec. I do 
               <br />
               not know why they are continually attacking a 
               <br />
               man who is not in this House to defend himself ; 
               <br />
               it Would appear that there is a mad rage against 
               <br />
               him ; it would appear that he has excited the pre- 
               <br />
               judices and the hatred of certain persons in the 
               <br />
               House. I am not commissioned to take up the 
               <br />
               defence of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Mercier; but when they accuse 
               <br />
               him 0f fanaticism; when they 'state that the 
               <br />
               Government of Quebec desires to ostracise the

               English minority in that Province, I say that a 
               <br />
               statement is made which is not true. Let us 
               <br />
               examine the facts as they really are : There are in 
               <br />
               the Province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec,</span> ten members speaking the 
               <br />
               English language out of sixty-ﬁve who form the 
               <br />
               total membership of the Legislature. There are 
               <br />

               in the Ministry two English Protestant Ministers. 
               <br />
               Consequently these two English Ministers represent- 
               <br />
               one-third of the membership. If Mr. Mercier had 
               <br />
               only granted to the Protestant minority the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">num-'</span>

               regard to the population and the body of represen-

               testant Minister. Now, let any one cite one single 
               <br />
               act,——I do not refer to a word spoken in a patriotic 
               <br />
               speech where one may go beyond the usual bounds 
               <br />
               of prudence, -—let them cite one case where Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier has not done justice to the Protestant 
               <br />
               minority, then I will admit that he has made 
               <br />
               himself blameworthy. Again, lately, during the- 
               <br />
               session now in progress, he has shown his justice 
               <br />
               towards the Protestant minority. Mr. Hall pre- 
               <br />
               sented a Bill to the Legislature asking for a privi- 
               <br />
               lege favoring the Protestant minority, in the 
               <br />
               matter of the admission to the study of law of the 
               <br />
               bearers of University degrees. The Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier was the ﬁrst to impress upon his followers- 
               <br />
               his own personal ideas, and he in this way made 
               <br />
               the Bill of Mr. Hall to pass in triumph. This is 
               <br />
               what the Sherbrooke <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gazette</span> says on the subject:

               <br />
               commence the study of the law. Prejudice—blind irra— 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Legislature to such a degree, that the chief of such a 
               <br />
               party as the National Party must have a large ortion of 
               <br />
               moral courage to rise above the narrow and pa try ideas 
               <br />

               <br />
               This is what Mr. Mercier has done in the case <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be»</span>

               <br />
               That is what an English newspaper said, quite 
               <br />
               recently, on the position taken by the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier towards the Protestant minority. This is 
               <br />
               not all: during the past few days a question of 
               <br />
               privilege was raised before this House by making 
               <br />
               allusion to certain disorders which have taken 
               <br />
               place in Hull. One hon. member allowed himself 
               <br />
               to make a furious tirade, not only against Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier, but against French Canadians in general ; 
               <br />
               he took advantage of the occasion to hurl upon the 
               <br />
               French Canadians an insult which I will not .re-

               so far as to recall the sad remembrances of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vaferloo.</span> He went so far as to tell us that the 
               <br />
               time would come when great Salvation Armies- 
               <br />
               would march through the streets of Quebec. Why 
               <br />
               provoke in this manner the French Canadians, who 
               <br />
               only ask to live like brothers, hand in hand with 
               <br />
               their fellow-citizens of whatever race or origin ‘3'

               This brand of discord is hurled in order to create a 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               to say about the Salvation Army nor the battle of 
               <br />
               the Plains of Abraham. If the history of our 
               <br />
               fellow-citizens of English origin has some dates of 
               <br />
               honor and victory, I can say that we French <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cana‘</span>
