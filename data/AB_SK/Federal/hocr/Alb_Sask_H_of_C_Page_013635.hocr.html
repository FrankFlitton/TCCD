               Mr. OLIVER. The understanding in re-

               gard to this debt account which prevails 
               <br />

               not the same as has been voiced so far in

               <br />
               me and others in the west is : that at confed- 
               <br />
               eration the original provinces were heavily. 
               <br />
               involved in debt, and when other provinces 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">added</span> to confederation which were not 
               <br />
               so involved in debt, they received a credit 
               <br />
               from what was called the debt account, to 
               <br />
               put them on an equal footing with the 
               <br />
               original provinces in respect to the in- 
               <br />
               debtedness of these original provinces. It 
               <br />
               it under that head that the territories would 
               <br />
               claim a credit at the hands of the Dominion 
               <br />
               when the time for provincial organization 
               <br />
               comes. Believing that the territories would 
               <br />
               be entitled to such a credit under the 
               <br />
               fundamental arrangements of confederation, 
               <br />
               they consider that they have a right to an 
               <br />
               advance on that account, if required and as 
               <br />
               required. That debt account is based on 
               <br />
               the population of the provinces at the time 
               <br />
               each entered confederation, and because of 
               <br />
               that there is not that unanimous and ur- 
               <br />
               gent demand for provincial organization 
               <br />
               in the territories that some of our friends 
               <br />
               seem to think. The larger the population 
               <br />
               of the territory at the time it enters confed- 
               <br />
               eration as a province, the larger the debt 
               <br />
               account in favour of the territories will be, 
               <br />
               and therefore the greater the advantage to 
               <br />
               the territories, the longer it waits and the 
               <br />
               larger its population is.
