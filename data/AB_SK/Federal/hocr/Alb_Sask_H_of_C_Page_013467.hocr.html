               that those who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conscientiously</span> believe that

               the people of the North—west Territories. 
               <br />
               and who think that the people of the North-

               west Territories ought to have the right to 
               <br />
               say whether they wish for separate schools 
               <br />
               or not. should at all events he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> 
               <br />
               as tolerant as those who desire that separate 
               <br />
               schools should exist there, and are unwilling 
               <br />
               to let the people of the Territories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decide</span> 
               <br />
               for themselves. For my part I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span>

               <br />
               in the former than in the latter view. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) 
               <br />
               has spoken of our desiring to make this 
               <br />
               Parliament :1 battle ground for sectarian 
               <br />
               differences. and he spoke of our desiring to 
               <br />
               settle the’ question here whether there were 
               <br />
               to be separate schbols in the North—west 
               <br />
               Territories. Now. surely my hon. friend was 
               <br />
               unintentionally unfair when he said so. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause I am sure he did not wilfully mean to 
               <br />
               be unfair. There is no proposal that separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools should be forced upon the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the North-west Territories. No one 
               <br />
               is saying by this resolution whether there 
               <br />
               should be separate schools in the North—west 
               <br />
               Territories or not. The proposal of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from North Simcoe is that the people 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories should have the 
               <br />

               <br />

               ing of children into separate camps in this

               one which, if persevered in. would eﬂectually

               build up a nation in Canada. I think it

               would be a policy to cause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heart-binning.</span>

               to cause dissension, and thus to cause very

               great evil in this country.

               Mr. DAVIN. I shall not at this late hour 
               <br />
               discuss at any length a subject which now 
               <br />
               has been exhaustively discussed. I wish to 
               <br />
               state. however, what I consider to be the 
               <br />
               question before the House. I do not think 
               <br />
               we have before the House the. question of the 
               <br />
               relative merits of separate or public schools ; 
               <br />
               the question is whether it shall be left to 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly of the North-

               <br />
               I may say here, as I have said once or

               twice before, is no question at all in the
