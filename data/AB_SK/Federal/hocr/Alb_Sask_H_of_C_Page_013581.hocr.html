               ing the present leader of the government,

               admitted that under the terms of union,

               the representation of British Columbia 
               <br />
               could not be decreased below six. It was 
               <br />
               not contended then that the representation

               method of readjustment. And therefore, Sir, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that, as a matter of fact, as a 
               <br />
               matter of law, of the two provinces, both 
               <br />
               of which came in under orders in council, 
               <br />
               in the case of one it is guaranteed that the 
               <br />
               number of its members can never be less 
               <br />
               than six, while the other may be reduced 
               <br />
               to one or none. And yet, the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, in this report on so important a 
               <br />
               question, a report which if followed, may 
               <br />
               lead to a state of affairs never contemplated, 
               <br />
               and which never could be desired, says that 
               <br />
               these new provinces were admitted to the 
               <br />
               union with practically equal rights. I sub— 
               <br />
               mit to this House could anybody on either 
               <br />
               side contend for a moment that when one 
               <br />
               province comes in with six members which 
               <br />
               number cannot be decreased, and another 
               <br />
               comes in with six members which can be 
               <br />
               decreased, it is not a mere abuse of language 
               <br />
               to say that the two provinces came in with 
               <br />

               And I would refer to another part of the 
               <br />
               report <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Minister of Justice. At the 
               <br />
               beginning of his report he refers to the 
               <br />
               contention on the part of the parliament 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick that Canada under the 
               <br />
               51st section, is Canada as originally con- 
               <br />
               stituted by the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               and he shows, on the other side, the con- 
               <br />
               tention which the government supports, 
               <br />
               that Canada means Canada as it exists to- 
               <br />
               day. We know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatvCanada</span> means under 
               <br />
               the British North America Act—the original 
               <br />
               four provinces. And we know what Can- 
               <br />
               ada means as it exists to—day, stretching 
               <br />
               from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc. And the 
               <br />
               difference between the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick on the one side and the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion of Canada on the other is which of 
               <br />
               these interpretations is correct. The fourth 
               <br />
               subsection of section 51 is the clause which 
               <br />
               is under discussion and concerning which 
               <br />
               the question arises whether it means Can-

               ada as it was constituted under the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, or Canada as it exists

               I think the hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) will admit that that is a fair 
               <br />
               reading of clause 5 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act as amended by his argument, 
               <br />
               that as each new province came into the 
               <br />
               Dominion it acquired all the powers of the 
               <br />
               original provinces, and that the clauses of 
               <br />
               the Act were to be read as if it had been 
               <br />
               admitted as part of the Dominion originally. 
               <br />
               But this would make Canada consist only 
               <br />
               of the seven provinces enumerated. If I 
               <br />
               had not had the pleasure of meeting the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman in the North-west Territories 
               <br />
               last fall, I would have thought that he was 
               <br />
               under the impression that a person stepped 
               <br />
               from Manitoba directly in to British Co- 
               <br />
               lumbia. Under his argument, the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories form no part of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion of Canada, for Canada consists only 
               <br />
               of the seven provinces. Under that argu- 
               <br />
               ment, when we seek to ﬁnd what each pro- 
               <br />
               vince should be arrayed against in order 
               <br />
               to calculate its representations, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               it would be Ontario, or whatever other pso- 
               <br />
