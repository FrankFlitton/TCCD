               <br />
               French people are in such an immense majority, 
               <br />
               the Local Legislature has been liberal enough to 
               <br />
               provide that in exclusively English or almost

               <br />
               Sir, the amendment, as I understand it, proposes 
               <br />
               that the same principle shall be extended to the 
               <br />
               North—VVest—that the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               shall have the opportunity of declaring their will 
               <br />
               through their representatives as to whether the 
               <br />
               French language shall be continued in use there or 
               <br />
               not. Now, the hon. member for Muskoka (Mr. 
               <br />
               O’Brien) is a good deal disturbed by the fear that 
               <br />
               the amendment, if adopted, 'will fail of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> ; but 
               <br />
               he must know that it is a distinct instruction of 
               <br />
               the House to the Government, and if the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment fail to act on this instruction they must resign 
               <br />
               office. The hon. member tells us also that it is not 
               <br />
               desirable to throw a bone of contention among the 
               <br />
               people of the North-VVest, but he has no objection 
               <br />
               to a bone of contention being thrown among the 
               <br />
               people of the whole Dominion. Is it not a very 
               <br />
               much greater source of objection and irritation for 
               <br />
               the Parliament of Canada to impose a language 
               <br />
               upon a people of any Province than it is to 
               <br />
               allow that people to say what language or how 
               <br />
               many languages shall be used in their legislature ? 
               <br />
               Those people pay the taxes and they have the 
               <br />
               right to say what expenses shall be placed upon 
               <br />
               them. Up to this time the people of the North—

               West have not had much to complain of in this 
               <br />

               principally, last summer, I doubt whether the 
               <br />
               subject now under discussion would ever have been 
               <br />

               <br />
               where. Certain it is that from the time the

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> Territory Act of 1877 down to the summer 
               <br />
               of 1889, when these unhappy religious differences 
               <br />
               were brought into the political arena in the 
               <br />
               Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, not one complaint 
               <br />
               was made, so far as I am aware, by any newspaper 
               <br />
               or anybody in the North-West Territory that it 
               <br />
               was a hardship upon them and inimical to their 
               <br />
               Well-being as a national community that the French 
               <br />
               should be recognised as an ofﬁcial language. It 
               <br />
               is only since it occurred to some gentlemen that 
               <br />
               political capital might be made out of it that this 
               <br />
               question has been agitated at all. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) answered in 
               <br />
               every particular, I think, the speech made by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe in introducing his 
               <br />

               <br />
               with one quotation bearing upon the case, and it is 
               <br />
               from the author selected by the hon. member him- 
               <br />
               self. I refer to Professor Freeman. He says in

               one of his lectures, speaking of the Swiss Con- 
               <br />
               federacy—and I may say that Professor Freeman 
               <br />
               maintains that in many important particulars the 
               <br />

               many respects superior to that of Great Britain 
               <br />
               and the United States. There is not an hon.

               to the View that if it were possible to have one 
               <br />
               language it would be an advantage, but it is use- 
               <br />
               less to-day to lay down that view as an argument.

               If we could all be by a process of reasoning made 
               <br />
               English, it might be to the general advantage, but 
               <br />
               the day has gone by, when anything can be gained 
               <br />
               by insisting on the suppression of a language 
               <br />
               spoken by a large minority in this country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> We 
               <br />
               have to deal with facts as they exist. Without doubt 
               <br />
               under our present system the assimilation of the 
               <br />
               people is being gradually brought about. From 
               <br />
               personal knowledge I may say that in the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, throughout the Eastern Townships and 
               <br />
               the Montreal districts, there are more French 
               <br />
               people speaking English than English people 
               <br />
               speaking French. In fact it is worthy of remark 
               <br />
