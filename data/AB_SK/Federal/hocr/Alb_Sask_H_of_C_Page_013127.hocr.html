               Mr. O’BRIEN. In the very few words that I 
               <br />
               shall address the House on this occasion, I shall 
               <br />
               be conscious that, perhaps, I may have as little 
               <br />
               sympathy from the great body of this assembly as I 
               <br />
               had upon a certain occasion during last Session ; but 
               <br />
               if What is said in this debate upon the side which I 
               <br />
               propose to advocate, has as much weight in the 
               <br />
               country as the agitation which was set on foot last 
               <br />
               winter, then I for one will be perfectly content. 
               <br />
               Not because it has had, as alleged, the effect of stir- 
               <br />
               ring up strife and setting race against race and creed 
               <br />
               against creed, but because it has had the whole- 
               <br />
               some effect of leading the people distinctly to 
               <br />
               understand the position in which they are placed, 
               <br />
               and to understand the tendency and necessary 
               <br />
               consequences of the policy which has been pursued 
               <br />
               for so many years past. I say, if we accomplish 
               <br />
               that result, we are doing a good thing, even if we 
               <br />
               may irritate the feelings of people less sensitive to 
               <br />
               the facts of history than to declamation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> such 
               <br />
               language as we have heard from the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who has just taken his seat. I neither propose to 
               <br />
               emulate his declamation, nor to wander over as 
               <br />
               many subjects as he has touched upon, and in the 
               <br />
               end to say nothing whatever on the subject at 
               <br />
               issue. The hon. gentleman has said a good deal 
               <br />
               about his reading and learning. If all the effect 
               <br />
               of his reading has been to enable him to speak 
               <br />
               for one hour and say nothing, then I for 
               <br />
               one do not care to have that sort of learning. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With“</span> respect to the remarks made by the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman in regard to the hon. gentleman for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), I can well leave them to 
               <br />
               my hon. friend, in whose hands the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has very foolishly placed himself. I shall endeavor, 
               <br />
               after one or two observations on the historical re- 
               <br />
               ferences made by the hon. gentleman, to go to the 
               <br />
               question at issue in this matter. He has talked 
               <br />
               about Switzerland, and has endeavored to draw 
               <br />
               the inference that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> languages may be‘ 
               <br />
               spoken and ofﬁcially used in one country, and yet 
               <br />
               it be one nation. I meet that statement by the 
               <br />
               simple declaration that Switzerland, or Austro- 
               <br />
               I-Iungary which he might have cited, is a federation 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> races and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> nations. Now, I say 
               <br />
               there is no analogy whatever between that and 
               <br />
               Canada. I say we have not, we cannot have, and 
               <br />
               never will have in this country two nationalities. 
               <br />
               I deny that there are two nationalities in the sense in 
               <br />
               which the term is applicable either to Austro- 
               <br />
               Hungary or to Switzerland, and, therefore, the 
               <br />
               analogy does not hold good. Coming to the 
               <br />
               question really before us, there are two methods 
               <br />
               by which it is proposed to deal with it. It 
               <br />
               is admitted by the hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               moved the amendment that a change is required. 
               <br />
               If achange is not required there is no object in 
               <br />
               moving his resolution. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               proposes to deal with it from a local point of view, 
               <br />
               the point of view from which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />

               says it should be dealt with. The other method is

               <br />
               put forward by the hon. gentleman who intro- 
               <br />
               duced the Bill, and that is the national point of 
               <br />
               view. I will ﬁrst deal with the local point of 
               <br />
               View. We have before us evidence which clearly 
               <br />
               shows the opinion of the people in the North-VVest. 
               <br />
               If we take the press of that country we ﬁnd, from 
               <br />
               a little examination of it, that of all the news— 
               <br />
               papers published in the North-VVest there is not 
               <br />
               a single one which advocates, the retention of the 
               <br />
               dual language. I may remark that, in speaking 
               <br />
               of the newspapers, I do not include the illustrious 
               <br />
               journal to which reference was just made, for 
               <br />
               either one of two reasons—and of these two the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman can take his choice~either that journal is 
               <br />
               so well represented in this House that it is unneces— 
               <br />
               sary that the editor should read his own articles for 
               <br />
               our beneﬁt, or else, if he chooses to take the other 
               <br />
               alternative, a newspaper so largely subsidised by 
               <br />
               public money as is the Regina Leader is hardly to 
               <br />
               be considered as an independent organ of public 
               <br />
               opinion. The hon. gentleman did not tell us 
               <br />
               what the opinion in the North—\Vest is ; he did 
               <br />
               not venture to do that, because if so, he would 
               <br />
               have been obliged to admit that public opinion 
               <br />
               there demands such a Bill as that introduced and 
               <br />
               advocated by the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
