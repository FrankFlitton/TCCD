               political or social <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs,</span> in a more marked degree 
               <br />
               than it was used a hundred years ago. If we look 
               <br />
               at our neighbours across the border we ﬁnd that. 
               <br />
               when Louisiana was acquired by the United 
               <br />
               States, the French language was spoken, and the 
               <br />
               Government so far from interfering with the use of 
               <br />
               the French, allowed the people to speak either, was 
               <br />
               they saw proper, and it is only some 1'2 or 15 years 
               <br />
               ago that the French language ceased to be used as 
               <br />
               a public language in the State of Louisiana. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> If we 
               <br />
               look, again, at the territory that was acquired from 
               <br />
               Mexico in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1844,</span> and a portion of which was convert- 
               <br />
               ed into the State of California, we ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               Spanish language was spoken in the scuthern part 
               <br />
               of the state and used as an ofﬁcial language amongst 
               <br />
               that section of the population that could only speak 
               <br />
               Spanish. until, I think, 1876. And when you go 
               <br />
               into some of the noi'tllern states <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> where 
               <br />
               the population is largely Norwegian, I believe that 
               <br />
               the Norwegian language is spoken in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools,</span> 
               <br />
               that Norwegian teachers are employed, and that 
               <br />
               Norwegian books are used, simply because the 
               <br />
               children have but a short period of time to spend 
               <br />
               in the public schools, and unless they are permitted 
               <br />
               to do that, the recent comers from the northern 
               <br />
               portion of Europe would be unable to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">five</span> their 
               <br />
               children an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effective</span> education at all. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span> the 
               <br />
               people of the United States have so far proceeded 
               <br />
               upon the assumption that the question of the 
               <br />
               uniﬁcation of the population and their use of their 
               <br />
               own language, or of the English langua e, isa 
               <br />
               matter whic 1 will regulate itself if it is le t. alone. 
               <br />
               I have no doubt that that will be the case with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-</span> 
               <br />
               gard to the North-West Territories. If there isa large 
               <br />
               inﬂux of French population therefrom the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, they will carry the French langua <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Te</span> with 
               <br />
               them, and it will be perpetuated for an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">int</span> eiinite 
               <br />
               riod. If but a small number go, and if they dif- 
               <br />
               use themselves among the other portions of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> population, then they will, in the ‘course of a few 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Years,</span> cease to speakFrench, because the use of a 
               <br />
               ranguage is a matter of convenience, and whether 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> the people use the one or the other, will depend 
               <br />
               ‘ entirely upon the solution that convenience gives to 
               <br />
               the question. I should think that Canada has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties</span> enough without undertaking to put for- 
               <br />
               ward any active exertion, as it seems to me is being

               done here, for the purpose of creatin new, or of

               I am not going to say more on the subject- of

               very much discussion. I believe the. experienceof 
               <br />
               civilized men everywhere has been the same, that this 
               <br />
               is aquestion with which no Government can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effectu-</span>

               ally deal, and every attempt to deal with it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> 
               <br />
               only effect Serious injury on the population. I . 
               <br />
               should like to know what has been held out to 
               <br />
               every person where civilization exists to-day as one 
               <br />
               of the strongest evidences of the despotism, of the 
               <br />
               barbarism of Russia, but her treatment of Poland, 
               <br />
               her attempt to force the Russian language on the 
               <br />
               Polish people. And when England a few years 
               <br />
               ago entered into a discussion with Denmark to pre- 
               <br />
               vent a conﬂict between De11mark on the one side 
               <br />
               and Austria and Prussia on the other, she pressed 
               <br />
               on the Government of Denmark not to attempt to 
               <br />
               force the use of the Danish language on those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in which the German language was spoken, 
               <br />
               and they pointed out in that correspondence what 
               <br />
               an unfavourable impression on the public mind of 
               <br />
               the world Denmark would make if she undertook 
               <br />
               to deal with her subjects in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Schleswig-Holstein</span> in 
               <br />
               the way she had attempted. That is not simply 
               <br />
               the opinion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> of Great Britain alone. It is the 
               <br />
               opinion on which civilized men and statesmen have 
               <br />

               away from this subject of language, because there 
               <br />
