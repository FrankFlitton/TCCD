               <br />
               vote taken last night, why I make the motion. I 
               <br />
               had intended. at some stage of the debate, to speak

               members also desired to speak on it as well. 
               <br />
               principal object in moving this motion. however, is 
               <br />
               to direct attention to the practice which prevails in 
               <br />
               this House, without in the slightest degree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intend:</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               this occasion, and indeed on other occasions. One

               side of the House cried “ carried " and the other 
               <br />

               that the yeas and nays might be. recorded. I called
