               Mr. MACLEAN. Here is another Libe— 
               <br />
               ral doctrine abandoned, the Liberal doctrine 
               <br />
               of self-government. Now the doctrine 
               <br />
               preached is that of arbitrary government, 
               <br />
               the greater government ruling the smaller 
               <br />
               one. So, one by one, all these pledges and 
               <br />
               professions of the past are going by the 
               <br />
               board. There is a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy and the kind of gov- 
               <br />
               ernment they have in the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories to-day. The people of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories feel that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence.</span> The 
               <br />
               difference is that the provinces have some- 
               <br />
               thing by right, but the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west must come here and take what is given 
               <br />
               to them by what the Prime Minister calls 
               <br />
               an act of grace or benevolence. The peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the North—west do not wish to be in 
               <br />
               the position of suppliants seeking favours; 
               <br />
               they wish their rights, and they wish, above 
               <br />
               all, the sacred right, which Liberals say 
               <br />
               they fought for so many years in this coun- 
               <br />
               try, the right of self-government. I appre- 
               <br />
               ciate this demand of theirs; I know that the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west do wish to be 
               <br />
               erected into a province and have an endow— 
               <br />
               ment and have the status and the rights of 
               <br />
               the people of the rest of Canada. Here 
               <br />
               we have an autocratic Czar telling them: 
               <br />
               Oh, leave yourselves in our hands; forget 
               <br />
               all about self-government and we will look 
               <br />
               after you. That is not Liberal doctrine, 
               <br />
               that is not what the Canadian people ex- 
               <br />
               pect. There are reasons why the provinces 
               <br />
               have not been created. But an election is 
               <br />
               near at hand, and these hon. gentlemen feel 
               <br />
               constrained to make an apology for their 
               <br />
               neglect to erect these territories into pro- 
               <br />
               vinces.

               need not expect self-government in the near

               <br />

               the territories should be divided, one or

               <br />
               way; the government can soon settle it. 
               <br />
               Let them give the people a plebiscite, as 
               <br />
               they did on the liquor question, though I 
               <br />
               hope not with a similar result. Let the 
               <br />
               people decide this matter. This will be an 
               <br />
               easy way of settling the question whether 
               <br />
               there shall be one province only or more 
               <br />
               than one. The Prime Minister says also 
               <br />
               that they have almost every liberty that 
               <br />
               they would have if provincial autonomy 
               <br />
               were conferred upon them, all except the 
               <br />
               one of borrowing money, and that it was a 
               <br />
               good thing not to trust them lest they 
               <br />
               should rush into debt to their own injury. 
               <br />
               I think the people of the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories are as well able to govern themselves 
               <br />
               as the people of the Dominion are. They 
               <br />
               are among the most intelligent people of 
               <br />
               Canada. They are largely from eastern 
               <br />
               Canada, and eulogies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(have</span> been heaped upon 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain’s government by people in this

               House and elsewhere for the way it is man- 
               <br />
               aging the affairs of the territories. So, 
               <br />
               no valid reason can be given on that account. 
               <br />
               It was a rather indeﬁnite reply given by 
               <br />
               the Finance Minister to the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Bothwell (Mr. Clancy) as to Whether 
               <br />
               they were going to set aside the land or 
               <br />
               sell the lands and set aside the funds, to 
               <br />
               pay for the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc. If I 
               <br />
               mistake not, the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Hon. Mr. Sifton) stated that this latter was 
               <br />
               the intention. We have heard a great 
               <br />
               deal from the government to the effect 
               <br />
               that we are giving no land grant to this 
               <br />
               railway. But what is the difference if 
               <br />
               we are going to sell the lands and hand 
               <br />
               the proceeds over for the construction 
               <br />
               of the railway line <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> Fifty millions 
               <br />
               of acres of land the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior estimated would be released by his 
               <br />
               arrangement with the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. Putting it at $3 per acre. which is 
               <br />
               a very low estimate, that would mean $150,- 
               <br />
               000,000 to go into a sinking fund to con- 
               <br />
               struct a line of railway that the Prime 
               <br />

               000,000. So, I think the Finance Minister 
               <br />
               was not so candid as he might have been 
               <br />
               in answering the hon. member for Bothwell. 
               <br />
               As a western man, I am in favour of grant- 
               <br />
               ing the territories powers of local self—gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. The inﬂux of population into 
               <br />
               that country is going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> throw heavy liabi- 
               <br />
               lities upon the territorial exchequer to keep 
               <br />
               pace with the requirements of the country. 
               <br />
               The education of these new-comers must 
               <br />
               be looked after. And the territories have 
               <br />
               no local revenue except the small tax upon 
               <br />
               the land for school purposes. Thus. they 
               <br />
               are dependent entirely upon votes of this 
               <br />
               parliament to keep up improvements. I 
               <br />
               believe that in some years what is spent for 
               <br />
               public works and education has more than 
               <br />
