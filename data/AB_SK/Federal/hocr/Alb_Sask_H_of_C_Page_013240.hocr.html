               all outward seeming, at any rate, the policy 
               <br />
               of that right hon. gentleman has been to be-

               little, in every possible way, the rights of the

               <br />
               out so strong and stout a champion. In the

               case of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy), we can all remember that last year 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman was not apparently <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposed.</span> 
               <br />
               to pay any very great respect to the provincial 
               <br />
               rights of one of the oldest and most important 
               <br />
               Provinces of this Dominion, although now he is 
               <br />
               suddenly smitten with the most extraordinary re- 
               <br />
               gard for the declarations—not of a Provincial 
               <br />
               Assembly in the proper sense of the term——but of 
               <br />
               the representative council of a ﬂedgling territory 
               <br />
               of this Dominion. For my part, I much suspect 
               <br />
               the fervent zeal which new born converts evince 
               <br />
               on these occasions. I may say to this House, 
               <br />
               without respect to parties, that while we are here 
               <br />
               bound by every obligation to see that the rights of 
               <br />
               the Provinces are maintained, it may be as well for 
               <br />
               us to recollect that we are also here as Dominion re- 
               <br />
               presentatives, and that the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               has its rights in this and other matters as well 
               <br />
               as the Provinces. This debate, as I have said, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isi</span> 
               <br />
               one of a remarkable character, but I must add that 
               <br />
               I, for one, think that every true friend of Canada 
               <br />
               must regret that this subject has been forced upon 
               <br />
               us at this time. I say that no good has come of 
               <br />
               this Bill ; I say that no good can come of it, and 
               <br />
               I am sorry to have to add that, in my judgment, 
               <br />
               speaking without prejudice or malice, I cannot 
               <br />
               but believe that no good was intended to come 
               <br />
               out of the proposal which we are now discussing. 
               <br />
               Whatever may be the motives which have caused 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman (Mr. McCarthy) to assume the 
               <br />
               grave responsibility of throwing on the ﬂoor of 
               <br />
               this House What he well knew must be an apple 
               <br />
               of discord, calculated to set friend against friend, 
               <br />
               race against race, and religion against religion, 
               <br />
               I admit that this question having been raised, 
               <br />
               and the judgment of this House having been 
               <br />
               challenged, we are, in my opinion, bound to 
               <br />
               pass upon the question. Of all the faults and of all 
               <br />
               the follies which this House could commit in dealing 
               <br />
               with this question the worst, in my opinion, would 
               <br />
               be to leave it as afestering and ever-open sore. 
               <br />
               We are asked to decide on this question, and we 
               <br />
               should decide. In that I agree with the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman and some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> his friends. This House 
               <br />
               is called upon to pass judgment, and this House 
               <br />
               should pass such judgment as will set this ques- 
               <br />
               tion ﬁnally at rest, if such a thing can be. At 
               <br />
               all events, it should be set at rest so far as this

               Sir, that preamble is in no way necessary to the 
               <br />
               Bill, it should never have been there, and was 
               <br />
               intended to affront and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offend</span> my friends of the 
               <br />
               French nationality; and small blame to them if 
               <br />
               if they felt affronted and offended when asked to 
               <br />
               consider a Bill introduced by a preamble like that. 
               <br />
               But I have a more important objection to make to 
               <br />
               that preamble : I say that on the plainest grounds 
               <br />
               of common sense and common prudence, the asser- 
               <br />
               tion contained in it that the best way to produce 
               <br />
               unity among us is to do what is known to be 
               <br />
               affronting to one—third or one—fourth of the people 
               <br />
               of this Dominion is entirely false and incorrect. 
               <br />
               That is not the way to produce national unity 
               <br />
               among Canadians ; it is not the way to build up a 
               <br />
               nation here. The way to make Canadians proud 
               <br />
               of their country is to say, clearly and distinctly, to 
               <br />
               every race in Canada, that they may expect fair 
               <br />
               play and honest dealings at the hands of their 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen, whether they are English, 
               <br />
               French, Scotch, Irish, Canadian or any other 
               <br />
               nationality. Looking at this matter, Sir, as a 
               <br />
               practical man, as one who hopes to end his life in 
               <br />
               Canada, I say that the hon. gentleman, be his 
               <br />
               motives or intentions what they may, is attempting 
               <br />
               a downright impossibility, if he hopes by legisla- 
               <br />
               tive enactment to wipe away the French language 
               <br />
               and to induce a million or a million and a-quarter of 
               <br />
               our people to abandon their mother tongue, sol- 
               <br />
               emnly guaranteed to them by treaty and in every 
               <br />
               possible way that a government or a nation can 
               <br />
               guarantee, that it shall be left undisturbed in their 
               <br />
               native Province or in the Dominion of Canada. I 
               <br />
               say it is absurd. It might have come to pass— 
               <br />
               though I do not know but the hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               his friends have now rendered it impossible—not

               <br />
               cating and dealing with each other in the prevailing 
               <br />
               tongue of North America might have induced the 
               <br />
               people of Quebec to adopt that language, as has 
               <br />
               been done in Ireland, where, in many places, a 
               <br />
               number of years ago, the bulk of the population 
               <br />
               spoke Irish and Irish alone, but Where now 
               <br />
               the English tongue has practically superseded the 
               <br />
               Irish language. But I tell the hon. member for

               <br />
               cannot conceive of a case, where such result has 
               <br />
               been brought about by legislative enactment.

               that religion, belong to that race, or speak that
