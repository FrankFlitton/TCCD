               NOW, Sir, if it was important to establish by this 
               <br />
               Act that the two languages should be used in the

               <br />
               vinces, it is just as important that the Parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada to-day should decide the question for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“7est</span> Territories. If it were left to the

               people of the North-VVest Territories to decide 
               <br />
               whether it would be in their interest or not to use 
               <br />
               both languages, what would be the result? The 
               <br />
               result would be that all the excitement consequent 
               <br />
               on the decision of a question of this kind would be 
               <br />

               <br />
               The spirit of our laws has not been to leave such

               <br />
               Then, why leave this question to the people of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“rest</span> Territories? Let us suppose that 
               <br />
               their decision would be that they do not want the 
               <br />
               dual languages ; then we should be bound to enact 
               <br />
               laws here in pursuance of that decision, and to 
               <br />
               carry out the will of the people as expressed by 
               <br />
               them at the polls, and if the time came, as it must 
               <br />
               come, when the North-West Territories will be 
               <br />
               divided into Provinces, should we not be bound by 
               <br />
               that decision, in framing the constitution of those 
               <br />
               Provinces, whether there Were three or four or ten 
               <br />
               -—because the territory is very large—to give to 
               <br />
               each one of those Provinces a constitution such 
               <br />
               as decided upon by the present population of the 
               <br />
               North-West? My impression is that we should 
               <br />
               be bound to act by the decision the people of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> should give on this question today, 
               <br />
               in framing the constitutions of all those future 
               <br />
               Provinces. If it were then thought in the interest 
               <br />
               of one Province that it should have the use of 
               <br />
               the dual languages, and in the interest of another 
               <br />
               Province that it should not, depending entirely 
               <br />
               on the number of French people who might be 
               <br />
               there, I do not think that is the proper course 
               <br />
               to follow now to leave that decision to the people 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Territories. I say that the 
               <br />
               right policy is to retain in the hands of this 
               <br />
               Parliament the power of dealing with this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. When the Provinces come to be formed, 
               <br />
               we should look to the conditions then existing, 
               <br />
               to the number of people there, and give them

               Now, Sir, there was another question considered 
               <br />
               by the Fathers of Confederation as one of great 
               <br />
               difﬁculty, on which the people might divide with 
               <br />
               a great deal of animosity and feeling, and they took 
               <br />
               it entirely out of the power of the Provinces and 
               <br />
               placed it, not even in the hands of this Parliament 
               <br />
               —because this Act cannot be disturbed by a vote 
               <br />
               of this House. If it was considered so important 
               <br />
               with regard to these Provinces, why is it not of 
               <br />
               equal importance with regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> 
               <br />

               lature of Quebec: Provided, that it shall not be lawfu to 
               <br />
               present to the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, for assent 
               <br />
               any Bill for altering the limits of any of the electoral div-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">isions</span> or districts mentioned in the second schedule to

               this Act, unless the second and third readings of such 
               <br />
               Bill have been passed in the Legislative Assembly with

               assent shall not be given to such Bill, unless an address

               Lieutenant Governor stating that it has been so passed.” 
               <br />
               So jealous were the framers of this Act of the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority, that in the case of some 
               <br />
               twelve counties in the Province of Quebec which 
               <br />
               were considered Protestant counties, it was not 
               <br />
               left even in the hands of the Legislature of that 
               <br />
               Province to alter the limits of these counties at any 
               <br />
               time thereafter. And yet to-day it is said that we 
               <br />
               must relegate to the people of the North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tories the authority to legislate upon this question 
               <br />
               which is similiar in fact to the question dealt with 
               <br />
               so judiciously in the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               At that time and previous to Confederation there 
               <br />
               were in what were then called Upper and Lower 
               <br />
               Canada questions similar to the one now being dis- 
               <br />
               cussed, and these questions were debated with, 
               <br />
               perhaps, even greater animosity than is the present 
               <br />
               one, and the differences of opinionthey excited had a. 
               <br />
               great deal to do with bringing about Confederation; 
               <br />
               and I will take this opportunity of refe ‘ to the 
               <br />
               questions then at issue, not so much for t e pur- 
               <br />
               pose of recallin the discussions thereon, as for 
               <br />
               the purpose of i ustrating the position I take, that 
               <br />
               the questions which are raised <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> are similar 
               <br />
               to those which created excitement then, and 
               <br />
