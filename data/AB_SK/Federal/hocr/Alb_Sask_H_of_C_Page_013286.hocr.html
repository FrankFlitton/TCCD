               House, whom he called the band of Nationalists, 
               <br />
               he stated that he did not expect and did not want 
               <br />
               any sympathy from them. Well, that is a mat- 
               <br />
               ter of mere personal inclination, and surely no 
               <br />
               man would be guilty of such folly as to expect 
               <br />
               from his fellow men more sympathy than he feels 
               <br />
               disposed to grant in return, and thereby inspire. 
               <br />
               But the hon. member seemed to think that this 
               <br />
               National party has been formed in opposition to 
               <br />
               the English speaking population of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               There is nothing of the kind. It is well 
               <br />
               known that Mr. Mercier, when in Opposition, led 
               <br />
               the Liberal party in the Quebec Legislature, and 
               <br />
               that, a short time before the elections of 1886, he 
               <br />
               made an alliance with a certain portion of the old 
               <br />
               Conservatives, who had repudiated their former 
               <br />
               leaders ; but, as these gentlemen Would not call 
               <br />
               themselves Liberals, they took the name of National 
               <br />
               Conservatives. Since Mr. Mercier has taken pos- 
               <br />
               session of power, as he had one wing of his party 
               <br />
               composed of Liberals and another Wing composed 
               <br />
               of those who called themselves National Conserva- 
               <br />
               tives, they agreed to call the party in Quebec the 
               <br />
               National party. But that has no other signiﬁcance 
               <br />
               or hearing. The hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) must not think that the old Liberal 
               <br />
               party in the Province of Quebec is dead. Our 
               <br />
               leader, our illustrious leader in this House, still 
               <br />
               calls himself a Liberal. I see my colleagues sitting 
               <br />
               around me, repreLenting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_.</span> Province of Quebec, 
               <br />
               who still call themselves Liberals. I see my old 
               <br />
               friend from the county of Vercheres (Mr. Geoffrion), 
               <br />
               who has been in Parliament for about twenty-ﬁve 
               <br />
               years, who has been a Minister of the Crown, and 
               <br />
               whostill continues to call himself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a‘Liberal</span> and not 
               <br />
               a Nationalist. Here is my venerable friend the 
               <br />
               member for St. Johns (Mr. Bourassa), who has 
               <br />
               passed thirty-six years in Parliament. What does he 
               <br />
               call himself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> A Liberal. He was born a Liberal, he 
               <br />
               has lived a Liberal, and, depend upon it, he will die 
               <br />
               a Liberal. Your humble servant, after twenty-two 
               <br />
               years passed in this House, still continues, and in- 
               <br />
               tends to continue in the future, to call himself a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Liberal,</span> The old Liberal party in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, as represented in this House, still exists, 
               <br />
               and you may be sure that it will not disap- 
               <br />
               pear from the sphere of action. Before I sit down 
               <br />
               I want to refer to a regret expressed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in his ﬁrst 
               <br />
               speech on this question. He said he regretted, or 
               <br />
               it was to be regretted, that England, after the 
               <br />
               cession, had adopted so liberal a policy towards 
               <br />
               the French Canadians ; and, if another policy had 
               <br />
               been adopted, we would not have in this country 
               <br />
               the evils which he thought were created by the 
               <br />
               existence of two ofﬁcial languages. On this ques- 
               <br />
               tion he was well answered by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), who told him that if a dif- 
               <br />
               ferent policy had been adopted this country would 
               <br />
               not have long remained a British colony. Sir, the 
               <br />
               liberal policy of England on that occasion conquered 
               <br />
               the hearts of the French Canadians, and in her 
               <br />
               days of trial they stood by her and remained 
               <br />
               faithful to their allegiance. Less than twenty 
               <br />
               years afterwards they resisted the seducing ap- 
               <br />
               peals of the American patriots and of General 
               <br />
               La Fayette to join in the great revolutionary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">move«</span> 
               <br />
               ment for liberty and independence. In 1812 the 
               <br />
               same temptation was again held out to them, and 
               <br />
               again they resisted those allurements ; they did more, 
               <br />
               they gallantly shed their blood on battle-ﬁelds for 
               <br />

               <br />
               most responsible positions in those Territories for 
               <br />
               some years, I might speak with some authority 
               <br />
               in reference to some portions of the matter which 
               <br />
               is now before this honorable House. As you are 
               <br />
               aware, I went to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Territoriesin 
               <br />
               1879 as Indian Commissioner. During that year I 
               <br />
               travelled through the length and breadth of the 
               <br />
               land, for the purpose of visiting the Indians who 
               <br />
               were under my special charge. When I arrived in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> Territories the Hon. Mr. Laird 
               <br />
               was then Governor of that country. At that time 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Council was composed of the 
               <br />
               stipendiary magistrates of the Territories, With 
               <br />
               one or two unofﬁcial members who were appointed 
               <br />
               by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governor.,</span> The meetings of Council in 
               <br />
               those days were held in the Government House at 
               <br />
               Battleford ; the proceedings were of a very limited 
               <br />
               character. The Council sat for a fe weeks, 
               <br />
               passed a few short ordinances, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Khen</span> ad- 
               <br />
               journed. For two or three years this continued, 
               <br />
               and year after year, as opportunity offered, the 
               <br />
               Government had the ordinances printed in French. 
               <br />
               In 1881, when I became Lieutenant Governor of 
               <br />
               that Province, the headquarters of the Government 
               <br />
               were removed to Regina. When I took charge of the 
               <br />
               administration of affairs the Council which met 
               <br />
               me was composed of the gentlemen I have just 
               <br />
               mentioned. Settlers were coming into the country, 
               <br />
               which was settling up from one end to the other, 
               <br />
               and although up to that time the population had 
               <br />
               been principally French, or people of French ex- 
               <br />
               traction, when I took char e the majority was 
               <br />
