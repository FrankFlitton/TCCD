               Mr. DAVIN. It may be a bad sign, but it shows that 
               <br />
               the people there are a very prosperous peeple, and can 
               <br />

               <br />
               friend, in reply to a question, told me a few days ago that 
               <br />
               he did not intend to bring in a Bill this year giving full 
               <br />
               responsible government to the Territories; but, in passing, 
               <br />
               I wish to say that when that Bill is brought in, or probably 
               <br />
               it might be done now, a large portion of territory should be 
               <br />
               given to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Load</span> Government to be used by it fer subsidiz- 
               <br />
               ing branch lines of railway. I am not fond, as this House 
               <br />
               knows of drawing comparisons with what is done in the 
               <br />
               United States; but I may state that when they organise a 
               <br />
               territory in the United States, they pay out of the Federal 
               <br />
               treasury all the expenses that we do, they give the territories 
               <br />
               the school lands and the swamp lands, as we have done in the 
               <br />
               case of Manitoba; but they do more than that. When Minne- 
               <br />
               sota, Wyoming, Dakota and Montana were organised, each of 
               <br />
               these Territories got a large extent of territory for subsi- 
               <br />
               dieing branch lines. Minnesota, with 83,000 square miles 
               <br />
               (Assiniboia has 93,000 square miles), received land for sub- 
               <br />
               sidising 1,800 miles of railway, and with the swamps, started 
               <br />
               in possession of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">onevthird</span> of the Territory. What does that 
               <br />
               policy enable these Territories to do? It gives them, while 
               <br />
               young, that nutriment and vital force, without which any- 
               <br />
               thing young cannot thrive. As the right hon. the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister is now acting Minister of Railways, I should like 
               <br />
               to call his attention to this fact. At this hour the Govern-

               rhetorical exaggeration. We sometimes hear it said in this

               <br />

               “freedom ” or the adjective “ free ” is used in this manner, 
               <br />
               it is used in a purely rhetorical sense and not in the broad

               si nitieation, in which constitutional writers use it.

               is that their liberty cannot be interfered with, without their

               that we are familiar with, we have in the North-West, but 
               <br />
               I do not think we have all the advantages that you have

               do not suffer fram, but I regard our position as a tree 
               <br />
               and liberal condition. Every man can there speak the 
               <br />
               thing he will. I believe the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-West</span> Territories will 
               <br />
               develop at a rapid rate. I see by the report of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> that a far larger number of homesteads 
               <br />
               were taken up last year than the year before. In 1886, 
               <br />
               2 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)4,960</span> acres in homesteads. were taken up ; in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:87,</span> 
               <br />
               319,500 ; in 1888, 420,333. From that you see the pro- 
               <br />
               gressive rate of increase at which homesteads have been 
               <br />
               taken up. Now, with the crOp we had last year and the 
               <br />
               report of that crop going all over the world—for we have 
               <br />
               had visits from men from every part of the world—I believe 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that next year, instead of 420,000 acres being 
               <br />
               taken up, that number will be greatly increased. I believe 
               <br />
               that certainly 700,000 or 800,000 acres in homesteads will 
               <br />
               be taken up, and the increase will go on at the same 
               <br />
               rate. There are many documents to which I might 
               <br />
               refer to show the progress made by the N orth-West. 
               <br />
               I have not said one word about what the committee of 
               <br />
               Senator Schu‘tz, now Lieutenant Governor, showed we 
               <br />
               possessed in the Mackenzie River Basin; and in the present 
               <br />
               report of the Interior Department, I see that Mr. Burgess 
               <br />
               refers in glowing terms to the Yukon River district. Take 
               <br />
               the report of two years back in which there is an account 
               <br />
               given of the Yukon River, and you will ﬁnd that men make 
               <br />
               as much as 8500 a day mining gold in that district. They 
               <br />
               have made 8:100 and 8350, and some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">8500</span> in one day. I do 
               <br />
               not say that happened as a general thing, but still it shows 
               <br />
               the value of that region. In the N orth-West Territories we 
               <br />
               have a large area of prairie land, most fertile and most 
               <br />
               abundant in its yield; we have gold, iron, coal, all the fruits 
               <br />
               of the earth, the forest, and the ﬁnest cattle raising country 
               <br />
               in the world. I say that there is the place that the means 
               <br />
               will be found to make this country a great and contented 
               <br />
               nation. I always regret when, in regard to this country, 
               <br />
               anything like sectional feeling, arising <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> race or religion 
               <br />
               or from any other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">source,</span> is developed; and it is a great 
               <br />
               consolation to me to know that up in the North-West, we 
               <br />
               are freer than in any other part of Canada from those pre- 
               <br />
               judices of race and religion which are really more inimieal 
               <br />
               to our progress than anything else. I desire to see this
