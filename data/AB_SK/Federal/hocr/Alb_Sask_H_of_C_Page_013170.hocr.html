               no Anglo-Saxon element of any consequence. It 
               <br />
               was necessary for the Government of the United 
               <br />
               States to give to the French citizens of Louisiana 
               <br />
               institutions and laws, and they made it a funda- 
               <br />
               mental principle to be carried into effect at the earli- 
               <br />
               est practicable moment, that the English language 
               <br />
               should be used through the territory as an ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               language, that the Legislature of Louisiana in its 
               <br />
               records of proceedings should use that tongue, and 
               <br />
               that the laws of Louisiana should be published in 
               <br />
               that tongue. Upon that basis the State of Louisiana 
               <br />
               was organised as speedily as possible, and upon 
               <br />
               that basis the French citizens of Louisiana became 
               <br />
               American citizens ; and in course of time they have 
               <br />
               become so throughly assimilated that they are to- 
               <br />
               day American citizens in every sense of the word. 
               <br />
               Many eminent men come from this French element 
               <br />
               in Louisiana, such as General Beauregard, Pierre 
               <br />
               Soule, and scores of others, who ﬁgure in Ame- 
               <br />
               rican history and have acquired prominence in 
               <br />
               American politics and literature. Any one going 
               <br />
               through New Orleans, as I did a short time ago, 
               <br />
               will see that there is one quarter of the city 
               <br />
               called the French quarter and another the Eu- 
               <br />
               glish quarter. The old quarter which was occu- 
               <br />
               pied by the French is still called the French 
               <br />
               quarter, but you hear the English language 
               <br />
               everywhere, and you cannot discover any marked 
               <br />
               indication that you are among a people of foreign 
               <br />
               descent, so thoroughly Americanised have they 
               <br />
               become. That has been done in Louisiana, and 
               <br />
               the condition of things which exists there to-day 
               <br />
               is more desirable, certainly, to the American people 
               <br />
               than if they had a Quebec planted at the mouth 
               <br />
               of the Mississippi, just as we have one planted at 
               <br />
               the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Suppose the French 
               <br />
               language were extended over that vast territory 
               <br />
               comprising Louisiana and that great land west of 
               <br />
               the Mississippi, now comprising ten states and two 
               <br />
               territories, would that be a desirable state of things <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> 
               <br />
               Was not the wisdom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the American people 
               <br />
               shown in deciding that the French language should 
               <br />
               not be an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> language either in the State of 
               <br />
               Louisianaas it exists at present or in any part of 
               <br />
               that vast territory west of the Mississippi extend— 
               <br />
               ing from the Gulf of Mexico to the British line ? 
               <br />
               Was not wisdom shown in excluding the French 
               <br />
               as an ofﬁcial language from that vast territory? 
               <br />
               Beyond question it was; and American example 
               <br />
               in that respect is an example we would do wisely 
               <br />
               to follow in dealing with the same question here.

               There are other instances besides the one I have 
               <br />
               alluded to in the history of America. There is the 
               <br />
               example of the treatment of the Spaniards in Flo— 
               <br />
               rida when that country was acquired by the Ameri- 
               <br />
               cans. The use of the vernacular language of the 
               <br />
               people was denied to them as an ofﬁcial language ; 
               <br />
               the laws were not published in that language ; the 
               <br />
               proceedings of the courts were not held in that 
               <br />
               language, but it was imperative that English should 
               <br />
               be used ; and the consequence was that the Spanish 
               <br />
               population of Florida became speedily thoroughly 
               <br />
               assimilated with the Saxon population of the rest 
               <br />
               of the United States. We have another example. 
               <br />
               The United States, as a result of the war with 
               <br />
               Mexico, became possessed of the territory of Cali- 
               <br />
               fornia, which had a considerable S nish popula- 
               <br />

               lation the use of the Spanish tongue, as an ofﬁcial

               one, and made English the ofﬁcial language of the 
               <br />
               Legislature and the Courts. As a. consequence

               <br />
               great assimilating maelstrom, and now, in a second

               <br />
               Spanish nationality in the population of California. 
               <br />
               The Spanish element have become thoroughly 
               <br />
               assimilated with the American element, and 
               <br />
               thoroughly Americanised, and that has been 
               <br />
               accomplished by virtue of this rule, which the

               We have another case that of Texas. Texas was

               <br />

               <br />
               W est, and an independent nationality was erected 
               <br />
               there after a ﬁerce struggle, characterised by such 
               <br />
               events as that of San Antonio, where the Alamo, de- 
               <br />
               fended by one hundred and ninety-two men, was 
               <br />
               captured by 7,000 Mexican troops after 1,600 of 
               <br />
               the assaulting force were killed, and not a soul left 
               <br />
               in the garrison. The bravery of the garrison is 
               <br />
               commemorated by the inscription on the monument 
               <br />
               in the square of San Antonio: “ Thermopylae

               sent its messengers of defeat; the Alamo sent 
               <br />
               none.” The courageous spirit of these defenders re- 
               <br />
               sulted in wresting Texas from the control of Mexico, 
               <br />
               and they made English the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁElcial</span> language ; and

               Then my hon. friend instances the case of Cape

               language is an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> language in that colony. 
               <br />
               Well, the circumstances of Cape Colony are quite 
               <br />
               similar to our own. The Dutch were the original 
               <br />
               settlers of the country. It was conquered by 
               <br />
               England, and it was wise probably to give to the 
               <br />
               Holland element of Cape Colony the use of their 
               <br />
               language. But Cape Colony is extending its 
               <br />
               bounds ; English inﬂuence has crossed the Kahalari

               pathway in his early explorations, has reached the 
               <br />
               Zambesi. England has taken possession of Lake
