               His present proposal is like the sting of a gnat—a 
               <br />
               sort of irritation which can be of no use, and could 
               <br />
               not carry out the avowed object of my hon. friend. 
               <br />
               There is scarcely any French spoken in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest. There are a few French Canadians there, 
               <br />
               and a scattered population of French half-breeds, 
               <br />
               and the whole effect of this Bill would be to deprive 
               <br />
               these poor people of reading or knowing the laws 
               <br />
               to which they are subject. I say the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man commenced at the wrong end. If the butcher 
               <br />
               goes to kill an ox, he goes to strike him on the 
               <br />
               head, and does not cut a little piece off the tail, 
               <br />
               which, after all, is the only effect of the measure of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend. But he is such an able man that 
               <br />
               one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wonders~I</span> wonder, with my limited appre-

               measure.

               <br />
               plains to change their language from French to 
               <br />
               English. Unless it be that my hon. friend has a 
               <br />
               dislike to the language—and I am not aware that

               <br />
               why he has pressed this Bi 1. It is on record that 
               <br />
               an English sailor, returning from France, was 
               <br />
               asked what kind of people the French were. “Oh,” 
               <br />
               said the sailor with an expletive, “ they are a bad 
               <br />
               lot.” “ What is the matter with them ?” “ 0h,” 
               <br />
               he said, “ they call a hat a chapeau ; why the deuce 
               <br />
               could they not call it a hat at once, and be hanged 
               <br />
               to them?” And that is very much the spirit of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend. I did not intend to speak on this 
               <br />
               matter at all after having heard the exhaustive 
               <br />
               speeches which have been made on the other side, 
               <br />
               and I must say, With the little exception of the 
               <br />
               slight touch of partisanship in the speech of my 
               <br />

               <br />
               resolution now before the House, moved by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil), have 
               <br />
               been already given by the hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Durham (Mr. Blake). Without entering into the 
               <br />
               general discussion of the resolution, it is in my mind 
               <br />
               sufﬁciently condemnatory of it to call u on the 
               <br />
               House to reject it, that, if it means anyt ing, it 
               <br />
               means the continuation of the present state of 
               <br />
               things must be perpetual. It says that any alter- 
               <br />
               ation will cause a distrust, a suspicion, a doubt of 
               <br />
               the stability of our laws. If that is any reason 
               <br />
               against giving to the Legislature in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> 
               <br />
               now the power to deal with this matter, the same 
               <br />
               reason will exist twenty years hence, and it would 
               <br />
               keep the question permanently a source of disquiet 
               <br />
               and agitation and discomfort, not only in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, but in Ontario and other Provinces, amongst 
               <br />
               all those who take a warm interest in this matter. 
               <br />
               I think also the resolution of which we had some 
               <br />
               information from the hon. member from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W'est</span> 
               <br />
               Riding (Mr. Blake) is liable to almost a similar 
               <br />
               objection. It leaves the case undecided, and 
               <br />
               while these two resolutions have that effect, 
               <br />
               we must remember that this is a subject of great 
               <br />
               agitation in different parts of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               Lower Canada is agitated on account of this attack 
               <br />
               on their language ; the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> will be agitated 
               <br />
               if it is supposed that they are deprived of the 
               <br />
               right of judging on this subject ; and we must take 
               <br />
               great care, Mr. Speaker, that while we are calming 
               <br />
               the agitation and soothing the agitated feelings of 
               <br />
               the people of. Quebec, we are not arousing the 
               <br />
               feelings of the freemen of the North-VVest by 
               <br />
               passing a resolution which postpones for an indeﬁ- 
               <br />
               nite time, it may be for a long period, a question 
               <br />
               in which we can-see, from the resolution they have 
               <br />
               adopted, that they are greatly interested. Ithink, 
               <br />
               therefore, Mr. Speaker, that the true solution of 
               <br />
               this question, a solution that will quiet the feelings

               of the East and that will be satisfactory to the

               people up there judge for themselves, after having 
               <br />
               had a commission from the people to deal with the

               subject. I think if that were adopted it Would

               satisfy the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North~\Vest,</span> and the amende <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honorable</span>

               that was made in this House by that resolution 
               <br />
               would quiet the insulted feelings of the people 
               <br />
               of the Province of Quebec, and we would have 
               <br />
               peace, through the benign inﬂuence of this reso-
