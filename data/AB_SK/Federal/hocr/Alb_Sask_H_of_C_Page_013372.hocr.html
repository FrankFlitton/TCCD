               and for each province the Legislature may make 
               <br />

               established by the Legislature of the province, an appeal 
               <br />
               shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any act 
               <br />
               or decision of any provincial authority affecting any right. 
               <br />

               of-the Queen’s subjects in relation to education.” 
               <br />
               This provides fer where the-legislation has provided 
               <br />
               for separate sch ools,or where separate schools existed 
               <br />
               when the province was brought into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> 
               <br />
               I do not understanu‘l there was any law to provide 
               <br />
               for separate schools in the North-West Territories 
               <br />
               when they came into Confederation, and therefore 
               <br />
               I say that this cannot fairly apply.
