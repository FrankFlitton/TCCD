               <br />
               that declaration from the hon. gentleman, it is im- 
               <br />
               possible for any person to put but one interpreta- 
               <br />
               tion on the clause in the preamble regarding unity 
               <br />
               of language, namely, that it is expedient and his 
               <br />
               desire that it should be so, not only in the Territories 
               <br />
               of the N orth~VVest, but in the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               and in all the Provinces thereof. We might ask, 
               <br />
               if that is not the meaning of the preamble, why 
               <br />
               was it placed there? It has been whispered in the 
               <br />
               corridors that the hon. gentleman has stated that 
               <br />
               it was only introduced for the purpose of ﬁlling out 
               <br />
               the Bill and making it a little larger, as it looked 
               <br />
               too small without it. But I can hardly think that 
               <br />
               was the hon. gentleman’s intention. If he wanted 
               <br />
               to extend the Bill and make it larger, he had 
               <br />
               many facts which he could have used in the 
               <br />
               preamble for the purpose. He could have stated 
               <br />
               that the North-\Vest Territories Act had passed 
               <br />
               the House without the clause in question in it. 
               <br />
               and without any request to place it there; he 
               <br />
               might have stated that that clause was placed in 
               <br />
               the Bill by the Senate, and that when the Bill 
               <br />
               came back from the Senate, the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior, who had charge of the Bill, expressed 
               <br />
               regret that it was there; he might have quoted 
               <br />
               from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hansard</span> of that time the Whole speech of 
               <br />
               the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hlinister</span> of the Interior; if he wished 
               <br />
               still further to swell his preamble, he might have 
               <br />
               placed in it the resolution of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> 
               <br />
               Council and the petition founded on that resolu- 
               <br />
               tion. These would have been matters of fact, and 
               <br />
               fair material to put in the preamble. They would 
               <br />
               have had the effect of strengthening the hon. gen— 
               <br />
               tleman’s hands and of assisting him in passing his 
               <br />
               Bill, instead of the effect which the preamble he 
               <br />
               has placed there is likely to have, namely, that of 
               <br />
               preventing its passing. The hon. gentleman says 
               <br />
               he is willing to abandon the preamble, after he has 
               <br />
               made a speech saying that he would not abandon 
               <br />
               the cause until he had attained‘ his object. He 
               <br />
               said he would abandon it, after having made a 
               <br />
               speech introducing his Bill based entirely on 
               <br />
               that preamble. It is too late, however, for 
               <br />
               him now to say that he will abandon it. He 
               <br />
               says he will abandon it, not now, but after 
               <br />
               the Bill passes its secon dreading. He wishes 
               <br />
               the House to put itself in the false position 
               <br />
               of passing the preamble, which he said would 
               <br />
               amount to nothing, although I think'it is generally 
               <br />
               admitted that passing the measure is endorsing 
               <br />
               its principle. The hon. member for North Victoria 
               <br />
               (Mr. Barron) referred to the expressions used by 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Justice in the debate on the 
               <br />
               Jesuit Estates Act last Session, in which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> 
               <br />
               tended the hon. Minister had held an entirely 
               <br />
               different view with regard to the importance of a

               Victoria were certainly very diﬁ'erent last Session 
               <br />
               from what they are this Session. They then laid 
               <br />
               great stress on the preamble, while they make 
               <br />
               little of it to-day ; but it is impossible for those 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen to suppose that this House will not 
               <br />
               take account of the great difference in the two cases. 
               <br />
               It may be very interesting to place on record 
               <br />
               the legal argument of the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Victoria, that in a decision on the interpretation 
               <br />
               of a statute, the preamble has no ‘weight or effect ; 
               <br />
               but it is equally true that a preamble is often refer-

               <br />
               and I think every hon. gentleman in this House 
               <br />
               can see, a very great distinction between those two 
               <br />
               cases. In the one case the Government were asked 
               <br />
               to disallow a Bill because it had an offensive pre- 
               <br />
               amble, and the answer to that was that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Admin-</span> 
               <br />
               istration, in reviewing the Bill, had to consider its 
               <br />
               meaning and its consequences, and not statements 
               <br />
               contained in the preamble. In this case we are asked 
               <br />
               to enact a Bill containing a preamble, and in enact- 
               <br />
               ing that Bill we are enacting the principles set 
               <br />
               forth in that preamble. The preamble of that Bill 
               <br />
               is as much a resolution of this House as the amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the hon. Minister of Justice or any other 
               <br />
               resolution formally put before us. Therefore, when 
               <br />
               this House is asked to pass that Bill to a second 
               <br />
               reading, we are asked to vote for the resolution 
               <br />
               contained in the preamble. That is an entirely 
               <br />
               different thing from the Administration dealing 
               <br />
               with a Bill which had been passed by a Local Legis- 
               <br />
               lature. I am not going to follow that part of 
               <br />
               the discussion any further, because I wish to be 
               <br />
               brief, and I am willing to admit at the 
               <br />
               outset what I think is admitted by a ma- 
               <br />
               jority of this House, that it would have been 
               <br />
               better if the clause in question had not been 
               <br />
               inserted in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\V’est</span> Territories Act ; but it 
               <br />
               was inserted, and a gift, a privilege, a right was 
               <br />
               given to the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Territories 
               <br />
               by that enactment. Now, a gift once given, I 
               <br />
               hold, cannot be ruthlessly taken away ; a gift once 
               <br />
               given remains in the donee until he chooses to 
               <br />
               relinquish it; and, therefore, those people, being 
               <br />
               granted this privilege, whether rightly or wrongly, 
               <br />
               wisely or unwisely, should be allowed to retain 
               <br />
               it until they voluntarily abandon it. Now, it has 
               <br />
               been said by some that this Parliament, having 
               <br />
               given the power, has certainly the right to take it 
               <br />
               away. That can onlybe done by treatingthe Parlia— 
               <br />
               ment as paternal to the North-VVest Territories, and 
               <br />
               in that View I suppose, they would say that a father 
               <br />
               mighttake from his child the gift he had given him. 
               <br />
               He might give his child a toy, and then, when he 
               <br />
               found that child making too much noise with it, 
               <br />
               he might take it away from him. That right may 
               <br />
               be granted, but the gift, even such a one as that, 
               <br />
               is never taken back without a pang ; and I do not 
               <br />
               think it would be wise, even if lawful, for us to 
               <br />
               take back a privilege of that kind which has been 
               <br />
               given. There are certain distinctions though 
               <br />
               which must be drawn. There may be things 
               <br />
               which should be taken back, and there may be 
               <br />
               things that we ought properly not to have given. 
               <br />
               The people in this case have been granted a privi- 
               <br />
               lege, and these people, I submit, should be con- 
               <br />
               sulted before this privilege is taken away. It is 
               <br />
               said, however, that they have already expressed 
               <br />
               themselves on this subject. Well, I think the 
               <br />
               remarks of the hon. member for West Durham 
               <br />
               (Mr. Blake) are conclusive on that point. I think 
               <br />
               that every legal mind must agree that his reason— 
               <br />
               ing in that case was perfectly correct, that these 
               <br />
               members, not having been elected to deal with 
               <br />
               this subject, are not, as regards it, the constitu- 
               <br />
               tional mouthpiece of the people of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest. When they were elected there was no
