               I think, on reﬂection and consideration. the

               <br />
               as full as that which the provincial bodies 
               <br />
               enjoy under the scheme of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, by which a certain portion 
               <br />
               of legislative authority is vested in the

               <br />
               ity is retained by this Parliament. But we 
               <br />
               did not confer on them any additional au- 
               <br />
               thority to that they already enjoyed in the

               <br />
               that subject I propose to draw the attention 
               <br />
               of the House this evening. It cannot too 
               <br />
               ﬁrmly be kept in mind that, according to

               the scheme of the distribution of legislative 
               <br />
               authority, the subject of education was de- 
               <br />
               clared to be a matter of local concern, and.

               therefore. properly belonging to the pro- 
               <br />
               vince; and my argument will be that, as 
               <br />
               we have conferred upon the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly of‘ the North-west Territories 
               <br />
               nearly all the power and authority which 
               <br />
               have been conferred upon the provinces, 
               <br />
               this power or right to deal with the matter 
               <br />
               of education should not be withheld. Let 
               <br />
               me, for a moment. draw the attention of 
               <br />
               the House to the provisions of the North-
