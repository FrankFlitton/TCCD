               L’Etendard said the other day, if efforts are made

               to antagonise our fellow-citizens, the French

               Canadians, if they are to be deprived of what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span>

               <br />
               exclusive than they have ever been in the past. 
               <br />
               What has been the teaching of the ast? We 
               <br />
               know that down to the rebellion of 1837 the French 
               <br />
               held themselves completely aloof from their Eng- 
               <br />
               lish speaking fellow-subjects, whom they regarded 
               <br />
               as an alien and hostile race ; but after the rebellion 
               <br />
               and after the union of the two Canadas in 1841, a 
               <br />
               different feeling began to set in, and a different 
               <br />
               state of affairs began to prevail. The French 
               <br />
               speaking people obtained the measure of self- 
               <br />
               government they desired, and according to the 
               <br />

               no distrust of them was evmeed by the Government and 
               <br />
               that the Government really was to be carried on strictly

               in the spirit of the constitution without any preference

               became on their side reconciled to the Imperial authority

               loyalty and attachment they manifested to the Crown. 
               <br />
               So soon and so decidedly were the healing effects of this 
               <br />
               policy experienced, that when the news of the French 
               <br />
               revolution of February, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1848,</span> reached the Province, it 
               <br />
               occasioned no disturbance or alarm. In the state of pub- 
               <br />
               lic feeling and opinion which Lord Elgin found prevailing 
               <br />
               on his arrival in Canada little more than a car before, 
               <br />
               there can be no doubt that the intelligence of t is startling 
               <br />
               event would have produced most formidable excitement, 
               <br />
               if not actual disturbance. Instead of this there was a 
               <br />
               most perfect tranquility and security. All efforts to 
               <br />
               create Opposition to the Government amongst the French 
               <br />
               Canadians utterly failed ; they heartily and steadily sup-

               conciliation and fair play, and every chapter in the 
               <br />
               history of Canada shows that where efforts have 
               <br />
               been made to antagonise the sentiment of French- 
               <br />
               Canadians, or to compel them to speak a foreign 
               <br />
               tongue, they have become only the more exclusive 
               <br />
               and refused the more obstinately to assimilate with 
               <br />
               their fellow-citizens of British origin, but that 
               <br />
               when, on the contrary, a policy of fair play, con- 
               <br />
               ciliation and justice is pursued, they have mani- 
               <br />
               fested the most unswerving loyalty to the British 
               <br />
               Crown and Canada. Sir George Cartier called 
               <br />
               himself an Englishman speaking French, and I 
               <br />
               believe there are to-day more French Canadians 
               <br />
               who are proud to call themselves English-speaking 
               <br />
               Frenchmen than ever before, and that the number 
               <br />
               will steadily increase if a policy of fair play and 
               <br />
               equal justice be continued. The events of the 
               <br />
               past year, however, have not tended to encourage 
               <br />
               this assimilation, and every fair-minded man must 
               <br />
               :regret the agitation which has been made in this 
               <br />
               House and out of iton this race and languagequestion. 
               <br />
               .I believe in the policy of provincial rights in a 
               <br />
               matter of this kind. The question of a dual 
               <br />
               language is to be dealt with by this Parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada so far as federal affairs are concerned, but 
               <br />
               I believe that, so far as provincial aifairs are con- 
               <br />
               cerned, it should be dealt with by the Provinces, 
               <br />
               .and to the Provinces I am prepared to relegate it.

               brought before this House. It concerns not only

               inﬂuences the peaCe and prosperity of the country,

               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) is, on the face of it,

               I can in no way accept. I am of the opinion of 
               <br />
               those who assert that this is not a mere local ques- 
               <br />
               tion ; but that it is a question of the gravest 
               <br />
               moment and which concerns the whole Dominion. I 
               <br />
               am also opposed to the amendment made by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), because I 
               <br />
               see in it only an attempt to obtain by an oblique 
               <br />
               course what they do not dare to ask for directly. 
               <br />
               The Bill of the hon. member for North Simcoe is 
               <br />
               supposed to be based upon a resolution passed by 
               <br />
               the Council of the North~VVest Territories, asking 
               <br />
               that the use of the French language, before that 
               <br />
               body and before the courts, be prohibited. If there 
               <br />
               is any justification in this House taking up the ques- 
               <br />
               tion it is evidently the fact that the Council of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> should represent the opinion of the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—W'est,</span> and that, consequently, 
               <br />
               there would be a moral obligation for this Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to carry out the wishes so expressed by that 
               <br />
               Council. Now, Mr. Speaker, if, relying on this 
               <br />
               fact, this House is of the opinion that the French 
               <br />
               language ought to be abolished,——if we decree its 
               <br />
               use to be forfeited because we believe these resolu- 
               <br />
               tions to represent the views of the people, it is 
               <br />
               evident that by surrendering to this same Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture the right to decree the abolition of the French 
               <br />
               language, we act exactly as if we had decreed it 
               <br />
               ourselves. If they wish to abolish the French 
               <br />
               language, let them say so plainly. If they believe 
               <br />
               that it is in the interest of the peace of the coun- 
               <br />
               try that a single language should be spoken in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
