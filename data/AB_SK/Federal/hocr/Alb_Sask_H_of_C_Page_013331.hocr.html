               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). Some years ago this 
               <br />
               matter was discussed, and it was agreed that, 
               <br />
               wherever it was proposed to amend a section, the 
               <br />
               section should be reprinted in the amendin Act 
               <br />
               with the changes inserted in it, and shou d be 
               <br />
               altogether repealed in the original Act. That is 
               <br />
               certainly a much more convenient system to adopt, 
               <br />

               Sir RICHARD CARTVVRIGHT. I remember 
               <br />
               the discussion referred to by my hon. friend, and 
               <br />
               there is no question whatever that very great i11- 
               <br />
               convenience arises to laymen, at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> rate, if not to 
               <br />
               lawyers, from the practice to which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               has alluded. I forget who was the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice at that time, but I understood that the 
               <br />
               Government then promised to set a good example 
               <br />
               in Bills of their own, and to reprint the amended 
               <br />
               clause in the Bill. It seems to me that reason and 
               <br />
               common sense are wholly in favor of that course.

               is a very undesira le clause. We ﬁnd in this 
               <br />
               proviso that any individual who, through no fault 
               <br />
               of his own, may have purchased an article that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> 
               <br />
               ultimately found to be more or less adulterated, 1s 
               <br />
               placed in a'position that unless he can show that 
               <br />
               he sold the article as he received it, and that he 
               <br />
               has at the same time a. warranty from the party 
               <br />
               from whom he purchased this article, he is liable 
               <br />
               to a heavy fine. But the clause does not even stop 
               <br />
               there; for if he has a warranty, if he shows that 
               <br />
               he purchased this article in good faith and under- 
               <br />
               stood that it was pure when he purchased it, after 
               <br />
               proving all this, he is still liable to a ﬁne. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Why</span> 
               <br />
               should a man be placed in that position unless It 
               <br />
               can be shown that he was in some way responsible, 
               <br />
               and knew he had an article in his possession that 
               <br />
               was not pure, and sold it knowing that it was not 
               <br />
               pure? In that case he should be held responsible ;
