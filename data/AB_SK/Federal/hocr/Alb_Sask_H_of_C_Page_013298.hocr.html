               We see by this article how very unjust was the 
               <br />
               statement of the hon. member in wishing to excite 
               <br />
               prejudices in the Province of Quebec, by making it 
               <br />
               believed that this newspaper reﬂected the opinion 
               <br />
               of the great majority of a population of the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec, and that it reﬂected, above all, 
               <br />
               the opinion of the Government of Quebec. And, 
               <br />
               ﬁnally, La M <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ine'rve,</span> addressing itself to La, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ve’rité</span> 
               <br />
               asked it several questions with regard to the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of Quebec. And what did Mr. Tardivel 
               <br />
               answer in his journal? He said that he accepted 
               <br />
               Mr. Mercier as the lesser evil. He paid us the 
               <br />
               compliment of saying that we were worth more 
               <br />
               than our adversaries,—which is, by the way, but 
               <br />
               a poor compliment. I can cite, Mr. Speaker, a 
               <br />
               more recent example of the liberality of Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier towards the Protestant minority of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               days, a representative in the Legislature of Quebec, 
               <br />
               Mr. Hall, presented a Bill on the subject of uni— 
               <br />
               versity degrees. This Bill could only have passed 
               <br />
               the Assembly and the Council through the grace 
               <br />

               <br />
               which the Hon. Mr. Mercier is held; a neWspaper

               what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mail</span> said three or four days ago :

               respectable as this young woman is, she has made

               <br />
               in any public oﬁice in the Province of Ontario did they 
               <br />
               dream of bringing from Quebec or Montreal a French 
               <br />
               Canadian woman to ﬁll any employment whatsoever. Are

               we bound to be more generous, more complaisant than our 
               <br />
               neighbors. es eeially when we possess already persons 
               <br />
               who are ﬁtte to do the work required in the present

               case? ” 
               <br />
               Well, I must say this to the hon. member: The 
               <br />
               gallantry of Frenchmen is proverbial ; and cer- 
               <br />
               tainly there is nobody among us who would not 
               <br />
               have been delighted to keep within our walls this 
               <br />
               Miss Maybee, who, by the way, they say is very 
               <br />
               pretty, as are, moreover, all English ladies. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I!</span> my 
               <br />
               hon. friend, the member for North Simcoe, would 
               <br />
               visit our Province he would discover that the 
               <br />
               English and the French Canadians live on the best 
               <br />
               possible terms ; he would see that in many cases 
               <br />
               Englishmen marry French Canadian women and 
               <br />
               that French Canadian men marry English women. 
               <br />
               If one may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judeby</span> the fruit of their affections, it 
               <br />
               is certain that they make good 'matches, for it does 
               <br />
               not appear that, either on the one side or the other, 
               <br />
               they are disposed to break the bonds of union. In 
               <br />
               order to conceal somewhat the sentiment which 
               <br />
               overrules him—and this sentiment is nothing else 
               <br />
               but fanaticism—the member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               tells us that it is necessary that the nation should 
               <br />
               speak but one language, if it wishes to become 
               <br />
               homogeneous. He has quoted, to this effect, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several</span> 
               <br />
               extracts from newspapers in Ontario and elsewhere. 
               <br />
               I will quote for him a work which, I think, possesses 
               <br />
               fully as much authority as these newspapers. This 
               <br />
               is what on this point the great dictionary, of 
               <br />
               Larousse says at the word “ nationality ” :
