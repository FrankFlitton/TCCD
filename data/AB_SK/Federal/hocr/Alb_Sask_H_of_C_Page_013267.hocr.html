               choose to limit them, to the English language. 
               <br />
               This resolution, if passed, gives them the whole

               <br />
               But, Sir, as here, so there; from the moment the 
               <br />
               Bills are passed, and presented to the Governor 
               <br />
               for his sanction, from that moment all their 
               <br />
               authority over them ceases. Here we pass Bills, 
               <br />
               we send them to the Senate, and then, so far as we 
               <br />
               are concerned, our power is ended. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'e</span> know we 
               <br />
               could have them, if it were not for the clause in the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, printed in any 
               <br />
               language we like; but after they are sent up to 
               <br />
               the Senate and the Senate passes them, they are 
               <br />
               then handed over to the representative of the 
               <br />
               Sovereign, and from that moment they cease to be 
               <br />
               the property of the Legislature, and become the 
               <br />
               laws of the land, to be published by the Governor. 
               <br />
               Our statutes, when they are published, are pub- 
               <br />
               lished not by virtue of the authority of this House 
               <br />
               or both Houses together; they are published by 
               <br />
               the representative of the Sovereign, who, after 
               <br />
               having given his sanction to them, publishes them 
               <br />
               under- constitutional rule. So in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“'est.</span> 
               <br />
               We will suppose that under the authority given by 
               <br />
               this resolution the Acts of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nortli-VVest</span> Assem- 
               <br />
               bly are presented to the Lieutenant—Governor in 
               <br />
               English, and in English alone ; he gives his assent, 
               <br />
               and then, and not before, do they become ordin- 
               <br />
               ances, and the moment they become ordinances, 
               <br />
               it is the Crown that publishes them, and the 
               <br />
               Legislative body, which initiated the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion, has nothing more to do With it. The con- 
               <br />
               sequence is that, so far as that Legislature is 
               <br />
               concerned, it can carry out its wishes by print- 
               <br />
               ing its measures in one or in both languages. 
               <br />
               Let them adopt their ordinances under the present 
               <br />
               system, and the Lieutenant-Governor, being a 
               <br />
               Dominion oﬂicer, will see that they are published 
               <br />
               certainly in the language in which they are 
               <br />
               presented. The Assembly, however, Will have no- 
               <br />
               thing to say as to whether they may not, by in- 
               <br />
               structions from the Government here or the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion Parliament, be published in half-a-dozen 
               <br />
               languages. This resolution, Sir, is a measure of 
               <br />
               peace. This House will, by a large majority, I 
               <br />
               believe, reject the measure, presented as it has 
               <br />
               been, the harsh measure of my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               North Simcoe. Then, if this resolution be adopted, 
               <br />
               the matter will stand over for the opinion of the 
               <br />
               people of the North-West. If they declare that 
               <br />
               all the proceedings of their Legislature are to be in 
               <br />
               English, so let it be, and so it will be if this House 
               <br />
               adopt this resolution. But, after they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exer-</span>

               cised their full right of limiting their documents,

               an amended warrant from the people. Now, I 
               <br />
               must again say that it is of the very greatest im- 
               <br />
               portance that we should bury this question as soon 
               <br />
               as possible. It is quite true, as the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Durham (Mr. Blake) said, that a small spark 
               <br />
               may kindle a great conﬂagration, and we will be 
               <br />
               wilfully, on a question of sentiment—011 a question 
               <br />
               of feeling, which does not deserve to be digniﬁed 
               <br />
               by the name of sentiment—hazarding the future of 
               <br />
               the country, arousing the feelings of race against 
               <br />
               race, which I hoped had been forever buried in 
               <br />
               1867, and ruining the credit of Canada in foreign 
               <br />
               countries. Aye, and in the mother country too. 
               <br />
               For, what credit can we, ﬁnancially or otherwise, 
               <br />
               hope to obtain if it is known in England, if it is 
               <br />
               known especially on the Stock Exchange—the most 
               <br />
               fearful and timorous of all bodies—that the two 
               <br />
               races which inhabit Canada are drawn up against 
               <br />
               each other, on matters of sentiment, feeling and 
               <br />
               prejudice, which are more important and less 
               <br />
               easy to be soothed than mere material questions. 
               <br />
               It will stop the development of this country. It 
               <br />
               will prevent its future progress, and if this coun- 
               <br />
               try should fall from the proud position it now 
               <br />
               holds in the eyes of the world, it will be because 
               <br />
               by our own insensate conduct we have destroyed 
               <br />
               our credit, destroyed our prestige, and ruined our 
               <br />
               future. In the few remarks I made the other 
               <br />
               night I intended to have called the intention of 
               <br />
               my hon. friends from the Province of Ontario to 
               <br />
               what was the action of the Province of Upper 
               <br />
               Canada in 1793, but I was tired, and held it over 
               <br />
               for another opportunity. I will call attention to 
               <br />
               it now, to show what was the feeling of the people 
               <br />
               of Upper Canada a century ago. By a very unwise 
               <br />
               measure, although introduced by a very great man, 
               <br />
               Mr. Pitt, in 1790, the old Province of Quebec was 
               <br />
               divided into two—Upper and Lower Canada. It was 
               <br />
               thought that matters would be simpliﬁed by keeping 
               <br />
               the French in one corner of this vast country, and the 
               <br />
               English in another, and they divided the Prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Quebec into two provinces. From that 
               <br />
               unwise measure came most of our troubles. The 
               <br />
               Legislature met in 1791 at Newark, afterwards 
               <br />
               Niagara, and was composed of En lishmen. They 
               <br />
               were severed from the French, ut they had a 
               <br />
               colony of French on the western frontier of the 
               <br />
               Province of Canada, what is now the County of 
               <br />
               Essex. These Frenchmen were few in number,
