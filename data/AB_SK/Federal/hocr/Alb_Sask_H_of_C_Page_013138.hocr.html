               the debate yesterday, there seemed to be some 
               <br />
               reference made and some distinction drawn as to 
               <br />
               whether certain languages in different countries 
               <br />
               were used ofﬁcially or by toleration. Whilst there 
               <br />
               is quite a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> yet, so far as the attitude of 
               <br />
               the member for North Simcoe is concerned, that 
               <br />
               distinction does not enter into the question, because 
               <br />
               he proposes to obliterate a language, not to have 
               <br />
               it tolerated, and his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts</span> seem to be dir- 
               <br />
               ected to prevent us from even thinking in a 
               <br />
               foreign tongue. Although I think there is 
               <br />
               little difference in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treating</span> the question as a 
               <br />
               matter of philology or politics, I will mention a few 
               <br />
               of the great nations in Europe in which, as a matter 
               <br />
               of permission, various languages are freely tolerated 
               <br />
               and exist according to law. First of all, we have 
               <br />
               Spain. In Spain there are two languages tolerated, 
               <br />
               the Spanish and the Basque. In Sweden there are 
               <br />
               four languages, the Swedish, the German, the 
               <br />
               ’Finnick and the Latin. In Switzerland there are 
               <br />
               four languages, French, German, Italian and Rou- 
               <br />
               mansche. In France, the French, Italian, Breton 
               <br />
               and Basque ; and in the Netherlands, Flemish, 
               <br />
               Dutch, French ; and in Great Britain, although 
               <br />
               the different languages have largely disappear- 
               <br />
               ed, yet still there are traces of those that 
               <br />
               have been tolerated there. We have in the Channel 
               <br />
               Islands the French language, and in the Island of 
               <br />
               Man the Manx language. The remains of the Erse 
               <br />
               language, I am glad to see, is being revived in Old 
               <br />
               Ireland; and the Gaelic, in Scotland, was until 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recently</span> the only language spoken in some parts of 
               <br />
               the north and north-west. We have these lang- 
               <br />
               uages in addition to the dominant Anglo-Saxon 
               <br />
               in Great Britain. For the purposes of this illustra— 
               <br />
               tion I think we can fairly draw on the history of 
               <br />
               our own land, and prove from our own experience 
               <br />
               that a common language is not absolutely necessary 
               <br />
               to a nation’s greatness.

               Mr. MULOCK. The hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Perth (Mr. Trow) reminds me not to forget the 
               <br />
               Welsh. I am glad he reminded me, for the \Velsh 
               <br />
               is a language which is not only tolerated, but which 
               <br />
               is also the ofﬁcial language of Wales up to the 
               <br />
               present day. Then, we come to Austria. While 
               <br />
               German is the dominant tongue in Austria, she 
               <br />
               tolerates a vast number of languages other than the 
               <br />
               dominant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one—~for</span> instance, the Hungarian, the 
               <br />
               Bohemian, the Czech, and others. In fact, next to 
               <br />
               Russia, there are a greater number of different 
               <br />
               languages and dialects spoken and tolerated ac— 
               <br />
               cording to law, in Austria, than in any other 
               <br />
               country in Europe. Let us take Germany, which has 
               <br />
               undergone many changes philologically. Although 
               <br />
               the dominant tongue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is German, there are 
               <br />
               many dialects of the old Sclavonic, the Polish and 
               <br />
               other languages. Russia permits, according to law, 
               <br />
               about 100 languages—among others, the Finnish, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> the Caucasian and the Sclavonic. So, we therefore 
               <br />
               see that those nations of Europe which I have 
               <br />
               mentioned are nations in which at no time has 
               <br />
               there been a common language as a matter of 
               <br />
               law or custom. If my hon. friend’s proposition is 
               <br />
               right, and if he is correct in his contention, then 
               <br />
               these nations have all been failures and not one of 
               <br />
               them is working out its own destiny properly. I 
               <br />
               will now state to the House those nations of 
               <br />
               Europe which may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> said to have a homogeneous 
               <br />
               language. They are but four—Italy, Portugal,

               Denmark and Greece. These are the only nations 
               <br />
               in Europe to-day in which we may say there is but 
               <br />
               one language. I am giving part of my case away 
               <br />
               when I admit that these four countries are homo- 
               <br />
               geneous in regard to language. Whilst I may say 
               <br />
               that Italy has been homogeneous in language for 
               <br />
               1,200 years, many tongues have come and gone, but 
               <br />
               the Italian is a sort of a compromise which has 
               <br />
               come to be the dominant tongue. But there was 
               <br />
               no Italian unity because of the uniformity of the 
               <br />
               Italian language. Italian unity is but yet in its 
               <br />
               infancy, and if the unity of language is destined to 
               <br />
               develop a nation, as my hon. friend says, how 
               <br />
               comes it that for 1,200 years unity of language in 
               <br />
               Italy entirely failed to develop such a result. I 
               <br />
               have given these facts from a philological stand- 
               <br />
               point, and now I will address myself to the subject 
               <br />
               from a political point of view. More than one 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language is tolerated in the following coun- 
               <br />
               tries: Switzerland has the French and German, 
               <br />
               and Spain the Spanish and Basque. The latter is 
               <br />
               spoken in several provinces in the north of Spain 
               <br />
               and the south of the Pyrenees. The Basques are a 
               <br />
               hardy race, and even in Spain, which is so far 
               <br />
               behind us in political advancement, they allow the 
               <br />
               Basques to maintain their own separate Parliament, 
               <br />
               and conduct their own deliberations in the Basque 
               <br />

               for the history of language so far as Europe is 
               <br />
               concerned, which I think sufficiently sustains the 
               <br />
               proposition I have laid down, that unity of lang— 
               <br />
               uage is not essential to national greatness, I go a 
               <br />
               step further, and I say that unity of language does 
               <br />
               not necessarily produce national unity or national 
               <br />
               greatness. In support of that proposition I will 
               <br />
               call attention to the state of Greece. Greece is a 
               <br />
               country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Which,</span> I think, will specially illustrate 
               <br />
               the proposition of my hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friegd</span> (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               if such a proposition as his can be established at 
               <br />
               all. Greece is composed of many little provinces, 
               <br />
               but at all times the people spoke the Greek dialect, 
               <br />
               and Greek was substantially the language of 
               <br />
               Greece for all time. But yet, Sir, there was no 
               <br />
               unity of national spirit in Greece at any time. 
               <br />
               Greece from time to time was welded together by 
               <br />
               outside inﬂuences; but there was no cohesion in 
               <br />
               Greece itself by reason of language or anything 
               <br />
               else; and whenever some stron inﬂuence from With- 
               <br />
               out was withdrawn, the Gree s fell to destroying 
               <br />
               each other. Did you ever hear of a Greek boast-
