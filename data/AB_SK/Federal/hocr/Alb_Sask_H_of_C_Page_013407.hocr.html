               <br />
               this is the law now. For example, if a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subptena</span>

               must say that I could notunderstand altogether 
               <br />
               what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.’</span> gentleman stated. He spoke on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span>

               question of education in the North-West, and he

               gave his own views. But the hon. gentleman does 
               <br />
               not seem to understandthat this, in the Catholic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               faith, is a matter of principle. The hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               for West Middlesex introduced a motion and said 
               <br />
               at the beginning of his remarks that he did not

               want to interfere with the French language or the ‘

               <br />
               warmed up and proceeded with the subject he soon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               did away with the separate school system there. 
               <br />
               He said that there had been opposition also to the

               system of separate seliools bein‘ introduced into

               how, having had an experience of the system of 
               <br />
               separate schools in Ontario, he has any more reason 
               <br />

               satisﬁed with the result of the experience of these

               schools? Only a. few years ago a battle was waged 
               <br />
               in Ontario on the lines of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Question,</span> and
