               believe, for all that, that if there were even a 
               <br />
               sprinkling of French members in the Local Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture, the majority would act with the same spirit 
               <br />
               of fairness towards them that the Legislature of 
               <br />
               Upper Canada evinced in 1793, as shown in the in- 
               <br />
               cident to which our attention was directed by the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister yesterday. I believe that they 
               <br />
               would act in the same spirit of fairness towards the 
               <br />
               minority which was evinced by the Legislature of 
               <br />
               Canada in 1845. As I said a moment ago, I am 
               <br />
               not at all surprised that some of my fellow-country- 
               <br />
               men should feel strongly upon this question, and 
               <br />
               that they should propose to adhere to their present 
               <br />
               intention. As for myself I must say it is a matter 
               <br />
               of deep anguish to me that upon this question I 
               <br />
               have to sever my connection with such a life-long 
               <br />
               friend as the hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Bean- 
               <br />

               <br />
               -of his country accordin to his lights, and I am 
               <br />
               sure he will give me <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">credit</span> that in voting as I shall

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1%</span> not out of any love to the Government, but with

               Mr. IVES. I desire to occupy the time of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iHouse</span> only for a moment, in order to say that I 
               <br />
               .am against both the spirit and intention of the 
               <br />
               Bill of the hon. member for Simcoe. For my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">own</span> part, I think it would have been far preferable 
               <br />
               if this House had deferred the settlement of this 
               <br />
               whole question until such time as the increase of 
               <br />
               population in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">N0rth~lVest</span> Territories had made 
               <br />
               it necessary that portions of that territory should 
               <br />
               be organised into Provinces. I believe it is im- 
               <br />
               possible at the present moment for any member of 
               <br />
               this House to know what will be the position 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> character of the population which may settle 
               <br />
               in that vast domain. We may perhaps have on 
               <br />
               the Saskatchewan a territory large enough for a 
               <br />
               Province, including in its population a large 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘majority</span> of people speaking the French language, 
               <br />
               and we may perhaps have in Alberta a population 
               <br />
               purely English ; and when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ‘erent</span> parts of 
               <br />
               that territory are organised into Provinces, the 
               <br />
               question could be very easily settled by this 
               <br />
               Parliament without annoyance to the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories, and without straining unduly the 
               <br />
               principle of local autonomy to which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend who last addressed the House has referred. 
               <br />
               In that way we might perhaps arrive at a settle- 
               <br />
               ment of this whole question without this debate 
               <br />
               or this agitation. For these reasons, and because 
               <br />
               I would not see the French language abolished 
               <br />
               in this House or in the country, any more than I 
               <br />
               would see the French Canadians obliged to leave 
               <br />
               the country, I supported the amendment of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil). But 
               <br />
               that motion has been disposed of, and we have 
               <br />
               now to choose between the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice and the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), and when I 
               <br />
               have to choose between these two amendments I 
               <br />
               naturally choose that which least disturbs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre«</span> 
               <br />
               sent conditions. Therefore, I intend to support 
               <br />
               the amendment of the hon. Minister of Justice. If 
               <br />
               I could be assured that an amendment would be 
               <br />
               carried in this House to defer the Whole question 
               <br />
               until the organisation of Provinces in the North- 
               <br />

               Mr. MCCARTHY. I quite appreciate the 
               <br />
               desire of the House that this debate should close, 
               <br />

               <br />
               it had not been for the personal attack which, even 
               <br />
               at this late hour, the leader of the Opposition could 
               <br />
               not forbear to make upon me. I desire to repudi- 
               <br />
               ate the statement he has made with regard to my 
               <br />
               saying anything in Manitoba which I have not 
               <br />
               said here. My reference in Manitoba was not to 
               <br />
               the French language in the Province of Quebec; 
               <br />
               but there, as in Montreal, it was to the possibility—— 
               <br />
               which I then thought was within reach, and which 
               <br />
               I do not yet deny to myself the hope of being 
               <br />
               accomplished—that the tithe and fabrique ques- 
               <br />
               tions may yet be settled in the Province of Quebec, 
               <br />
               and settled I dare say with the aid of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend who now leads the Opposition. That was 
               <br />
               the question I referred to, and not the question of 
               <br />
               the French language, as my hon. friend will see if 
               <br />
               he will do me the justice to read the deliberate 
               <br />
               statement I made in Montreal. Having troubled 
               <br />
               the House again, I would like to say this with 
               <br />
               regard to the amendment before us. It has been 
               <br />
               stated here that this amendment is a measure of 
               <br />
               peace; but I wish this House to understand that 
               <br />
               what may be a measure of peace here, between the 
               <br />
               hon. members on both sides of this House, may 
               <br />
               be anything but a measure of peace in this country. 
               <br />
               For my part, I see in this amendment every 
               <br />
               possible evil which we have had suggested to us 
               <br />
               throughout this debate. It relegates a portion of 
               <br />
               this difﬁcult and disturbing subject to the people 
               <br />
               of the North-VVest. That certainly is not a 
               <br />
               measure of peace, so far as they are concerned. 
               <br />
               It leaves the remaining part to be dealt with 
               <br />
               by this Parliament ; and the House very much 
               <br />
               mistakes, no matter what its vote may be to- 
               <br />
               night, if it thinks that this Parliament has heard 
               <br />
               the last of this question; for I can assure this 
               <br />
               House that if the matter is disposed of here to— 
               <br />
               night by the adoption of the amendment of the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice, I shall bring it up again 
               <br />
               at the earliest opportunity. If this is so—and that 
               <br />
               is certainly within my right, as the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Queen’s, P. E. I. (Mr. Davies) said last evening, 
               <br />
               and not only within my ri ht, but within my duty 
               <br />
               ——then where is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefgit</span> of postponing, or de- 
               <br />
               laying, or procrastinating on a question which we 
               <br />
               are told involves so many difﬁculties? This may 
               <br />
               or may not be a. matter for the Territories to settle 
               <br />
               themselves, or for this Parliament to settle; but 
               <br />
               this measure raises no question between the right 
               <br />
               of the Territories and the right of this House to 
               <br />
               deal with it ; because every member of this House 
               <br />
               knows perfectly well that ' if the Bill I have intro- 
               <br />
               duced passes this House, it will be with thefull 
               <br />
