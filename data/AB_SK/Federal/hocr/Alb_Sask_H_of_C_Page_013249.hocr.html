               Now, let us see where we stand in regard to this 
               <br />
               question, considered as a local one. The members 
               <br />
               of the North-\Vest Council were elected two years 
               <br />
               ago, if my memory serves me, since the members 
               <br />
               of this House who sit for that district were elected. 
               <br />
               They are twenty-two in number. They are spread, 
               <br />
               of course, and come much more in contact with 
               <br />
               the people of their respective territories than do 
               <br />
               the members who sit here, whose districts are so 
               <br />
               much larger. They have unanimously, or with 
               <br />
               practical unanimity, petitioned this House to 
               <br />
               abolish this clause in the North—W'est Territories 
               <br />
               Act. On the motion being made here, and the 
               <br />
               matter being brought before Parliament, and it 
               <br />
               appearing that certain cut-and-dried petitions were 
               <br />
               presented here from certain places in that Terri- 
               <br />
               tory, the people there at once set about getting up 
               <br />
               counter-petitions which I have had the honor to 
               <br />
               present to the House. They are not petitions pur- 
               <br />
               porting to be signed by the chairmen and secretaries 
               <br />
               of public meetings, which may conceal the fact that 
               <br />
               no such meetings were held, but they are signed 
               <br />
               by the leading men in the places from which they 
               <br />
               come. For instance, in Calgary, the petition was 
               <br />
               signed by the mayor at the head, by two ex-mayors 
               <br />
               and over 500 others; and, in another place, the peti- 
               <br />
               tion is signed by a French Catholic gentleman, who, 
               <br />
               I think must be the gentleman who grows <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coffee,</span> to 
               <br />
               whom the member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) 
               <br />
               referred to the other night, though of that I am 
               <br />
               not quite sure. Then we have a public meeting at 
               <br />
               which a vote of 250 to 7 was recorded in favor of 
               <br />
               this change ; and yet we are told that we do not 
               <br />
               know what the feelings of the people of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest are in regard to this question, and that we 
               <br />
               ought to give them time for consideration, and to 
               <br />

               There are many other questions which come before

               <br />
               I said, as to the dual language I shall move in Par- 
               <br />
               liament, Whether you petition or not ; I look upon 
               <br />
               that question as a matter of national importance, 
               <br />
               as a matter affecting the whole Dominion, as a 
               <br />
               matter which is proper to be dealt with in 
               <br />
               Parliament and not by a Local Legislature. 
               <br />
               I found at the same time, in the organ of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman which is published in the city 
               <br />

               North-West signiﬁed their desire to abolish the 
               <br />
               use of that language ofﬁcially, effect would be 
               <br />
               given to their Wish. When the Assembly met, al- 
               <br />
               most their earliest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">act~and</span> I think not their least 
               <br />
               important act—was to adopt this petition, which 
               <br />
               placed on two grounds their desire to abolish the 
               <br />
               use of that language : one, that it was not required 
               <br />
               in the interest of the country ; and the other, that 
               <br />
               it was contrary to sound public policy that two 
               <br />
               languages should prevail. Follow that up by the
