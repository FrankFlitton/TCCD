               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in connection with the subject. It was during last

               summer that the matter was ﬁrst brought to the 
               <br />

               that I had seen the child myself, and while she 
               <br />
               appears to have white blood in her veins, it never 
               <br />
               struck me that she was a White child. The woman 
               <br />
               has another child, about three years of age, who is 
               <br />

               believe a e is a white child, but we are making full

               <br />
               anxiety that I heard the beginning of this debate. 
               <br />

               expressing the sincere hope that, after all, it will 
               <br />
               be for the better that the debate had taken place, 
               <br />

               adian representatives, the good credit of the

               <br />
               will lose in their expectations. It was thought,

               <br />

               Dominion would soon be all in a blaze ; let us hope— 
               <br />
               and it looks so, fortunately—let us hope that those 
               <br />
               inﬂammable elements, suspicion, prejudice and 
               <br />
               rivalry, will all be consumed and nothing will be 
               <br />
               left but the ﬁne, solid, sterling gold frame of our 
               <br />
               young Confederation, more solid and brighter than 
               <br />
               ever, inviting the admiration of the world as it in- 
               <br />
               vites the covetous eye of our powerful nei hbor. 
               <br />
               Were it not for that hope, were it not for the appy 
               <br />
               turn that the discussion has taken, I'would say that 
               <br />
               it is with a sense of deep regret that I have seen 
               <br />
               the Bill placed before the House by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">horth</span> Simcoe. I thought, and I had hoped 
               <br />
               the day had gone by when we would be called upon 
               <br />
               to discuss questions conducive to no public good, 
               <br />
               irritating in their nature and unjust in their object. 
               <br />
               It was to be expected that in the latter end of the 
               <br />
               nineteenth century, ideas which savor of what 
               <br />
               are considered by many as dark ages, would not 
               <br />
               be advocated in a British Canadian Parliament, 
               <br />
               advocated by one of the most eminent members of 
               <br />
               a profession where forbearance, liberality and 
               <br />
               good fellowship are so universally ractised. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Simcoe has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argued)</span> very strongly 
               <br />
               against the propriety of enacting the right to 
               <br />
               dual language in the North-West from the fact 
               <br />
               that, at the time of the cession of Canada, no such 
               <br />
               clause was inserted in the Articles of Capitulation, 
               <br />
               in the Treaty of Paris, in the Quebec Act of 1774, 
               <br />
               and in the Act of 1791. Discouragingly blind in 
               <br />
               the perception of historical facts, in the apprecia- 
               <br />
               tion of signiﬁcant events, the hon. member has not 
               <br />
               seen that the law of nations secured that right to 
               <br />
               a people who had against them the fate of war, 
               <br />
               but who were not conquered, in the strict sense 
               <br />
               of the word, since the last regular 9 age- 
               <br />
               ment of that war, the battle at Ste. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.1150513,</span> 
               <br />
               was a brilliant _ victory for the French ;
