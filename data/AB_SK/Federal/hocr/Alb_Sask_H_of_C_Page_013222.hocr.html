               range of Government in our happy country—there 
               <br />
               is no force so subtle, so insidious, so powerful 
               <br />
               to effect this unity of races as the force of language. 
               <br />
               It is like the primary forces of nature. It makes 
               <br />
               a people like each other who did not like each

               other before. I agree with so many French

               members that it is a pity we cannot all speak the 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’ELDON</span> (Albert). Far from it. I will 
               <br />
               deal with that remark of my hon. friend later on. 
               <br />
               I do not wish to recall past memories. I do not 
               <br />
               wish to speak of the events of 1877, but I do feel, 
               <br />
               in all soberness, that he who threw the apple of 
               <br />
               discord was not the hon. member singled out for 
               <br />
               condemnation by my friend from Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Davin). It Was that man who inserted in the 
               <br />
               Upper House, late in the Session of 1877, that ill- 
               <br />
               fated section of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories Act, 
               <br />
               which provided for the ofﬁcial use of the two lan- 
               <br />
               guages. It was he who planted the baleful 
               <br />
               cypress tree by the cradles of those young common- 
               <br />
               wealths between the Red River and the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains. A few words more and I have done. 
               <br />
               I will refer now to the somewhat irrelevant and 
               <br />
               larger question as to Whether we should not con- 
               <br />
               sider that this Act is only a wedge by which its 
               <br />
               promoters commence to break up the institutions 
               <br />
               of the French Canadians, and that after they have 
               <br />
               succeeded in this, they are to go on and petition 
               <br />
               the Imperial Parliament to strike out section 133 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act which guarantees 
               <br />
               the French language in this chamber, that they 
               <br />
               will go further and agitate for the repeal of the 
               <br />
               civil law in Quebec, and possibly endeavor to strike 
               <br />
               out that portion of the Act of Confederation which 
               <br />
               guarantees the freedom of the Roman Catholic re- 
               <br />
               ligion in the Province of Quebec. Coming from 
               <br />
               the Lower Provinces as I do, and without any au- 
               <br />
               thority to speak for any but myself and the county 
               <br />
               which I represent, as one who has been in the habit 
               <br />
               of meeting the public men of New Brunswick and 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia and studying the opinions of the press 
               <br />
               in that country, I desire to say, that, so far as I 
               <br />
               know, the one million people of the Lower Prov- 
               <br />
               inces sending forty-three members to this House 
               <br />
               are an absolute unit in believing that when we 
               <br />
               came into the Confederation there were agree- 
               <br />
               ments between the two Canadas and the Lower 
               <br />
               Provinces which should not be broken. The 
               <br />
               understanding was that our people were called in 
               <br />
               to keep the peace between those people on the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence. We knew that a treaty in substance 
               <br />
               had been made. We knew that treaty has been 
               <br />
               crystallised and made lawful and bindin upon us 
               <br />
               by the Parliament at Westminster. Ve know 
               <br />
               that that treaty guaranteed the perfect freedom of 
               <br />
               the Catholic religion in Quebec, the use of the 
               <br />
               French language, the perpetuity of the civil law of 
               <br />
               Rome included, and I desire to say that the people 
               <br />
               down there, who are mostly English, love the 
               <br />
               truth and keep their faith. Long ago our old 
               <br />
               King Alfred was called the “ truth teller,” 
               <br />
               and we English people boast that we are

               thank the House for its patience in indulging me

               <br />
               namely, that whatever we desire to do in the

               <br />
               in the courts ; for section 133 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act reads as follows :—

               out this debate ; and if the hon. member who 
               <br />
               leads the Opposition will forgive me for saying so, 
               <br />
               and not think it improper, I should like to express 
               <br />
               the delight I have, as a peace lover, to see the 
               <br />
               increased dignity of debate and the elevated tone 
               <br />
               of discussion in this chamber during the four years 
               <br />
               that I have been here, for which I think the unfail- 
               <br />
               ing urbanity of the hon. gentleman himself is 
               <br />
               largely to be credited.
