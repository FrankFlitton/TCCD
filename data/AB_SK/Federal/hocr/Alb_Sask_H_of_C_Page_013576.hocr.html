               <br />
               was very strong in the position he took that 
               <br />
               the Bill of 1892 was unfair to the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. He dwelt on that to the extent 
               <br />
               of two or three columns of ‘ Hansard.’ I do 
               <br />
               not think that my right hon. friend, looking 
               <br />
               at the result in his own province to-day, can 
               <br />
               fairlyregard it as a gerrymander in the in- 
               <br />
               terest of the Conservative party at least. 
               <br />
               I have been looking at the ﬁgures and I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that in the province of Quebec at the

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vote</span> was 133,121 and that ﬁfty—eight Liberal

               members were returned while the popular 
               <br />
               Conservative vote was 104,522 and that 
               <br />
               seven Conservative members were returned. 
               <br />
               Each Liberal member represents on an ever- 
               <br />
               age 2,300 Liberal electors while each Con-

               <br />
               15,000 Conservative electors. I think my

               regarded the province of Quebec as having

               There is another matter I would like to

               bring to the attention of the House and it 
               <br />

               a word about the very important legal point 
               <br />
               which was raised by two of his colleagues 
               <br />
               in 1892—Mr. Davies and Mr. Mills. These 
               <br />
               were very eminent men in their profession, 
               <br />
               so eminent that they have since been ap-

               <br />

               <br />
               ally. stating that they had no doubt upon it, 
               <br />
               that parliament was not competent to do 
               <br />
               this work at all, that it must appoint an

               Mr. Mills professed himself to be without

               to be in agreement with Mr. Mills and Mr.

               would it not be worth the attention of the

               government to consider whether or not that 
               <br />

               that can be laughed out of court when

               Now, Mr. Speaker, there is one other mat-

               ter about which I would like to say a word 
               <br />

               <br />
               i drew to the attention of the House on the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst reading of this Bill. I have been very 
               <br />
               kindly favoured by the hon. Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice (Hon. Mr. Fitzpatrick) with a copy of the 
               <br />
               memo. which he presented to council and I 
               <br />
               am bound to say that I think he has with 
               <br />
               his usual ability made the very best possible 
               <br />
               case <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ihat</span> he could for the position of those 
               <br />
               who hink that there is no ground for the 
               <br />
               contention which has been raised by the 
               <br />
               law oﬂicers of the Crown for the province of 
               <br />
               New Brunswick. I have had a great deal 
               <br />
               of doubt in my own mind as to what the true 
               <br />
               answer to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> is. At one time when 
               <br />
               I iirst examined the question, I was very 
               <br />
               strongly impressed with the opinion which 
               <br />
               has been given by the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice although I reached the conclusion by 
               <br />
               a somewhat different mode of reasoning. It 
               <br />
               seemed to me, looking at the provisions 
               <br />
               of sections three and four of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act that you might say that 
               <br />
               Canada was as much constituted under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act when it had 
               <br />
               seven°provinces as when it had four. That 
               <br />
               at first blush seemed to be the true solution 
               <br />
               of the case for the reason that the Dominion 
               <br />
               01‘ Canada was not formally constituted by 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, but _it was 
               <br />
               constituted under the British North America 
               <br />
               Act by the Queen’s proclamation. and inas- 
               <br />
               much as section three gave power to the 
               <br />
               Queen to proclaim the four provinces to be 
               <br />
               one union and as section 146 gave power to 
               <br />
               the Queen, upon certain conditions precedent 
               <br />
               having been complied with, to make a simi- 
               <br />
               lar proclamation in regard to other of Her 
               <br />
               Majesty’s colonies in North America I was 
               <br />
               inclined to think at ﬁrst that the words ‘as 
               <br />
               constituted under this Act’ in section four 
               <br />
               would be just as much applicable to Canada 
               <br />
               at the present time as they were in 1867. I 
               <br />
               do not say that there is not some force in 
               <br />
               that answer to the argument which has been 
               <br />
               put forward by the law officers of the pro-
