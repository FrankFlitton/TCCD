               single race into a single state. The speech of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, shows how very general and sweep- 
               <br />
               ing is the revolution he proposes to accomplish, and 
               <br />
               yet there can be no doubt whatever about the very 
               <br />
               humble beginning of this new policy that is suggested 
               <br />
               in the Bill which the hon. gentleman has sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to the House. Where a people are without 
               <br />
               education, literature or history, the experiment of 
               <br />
               doing away with a language might be made with 
               <br />
               more success, and I tell the hon. gentleman he had 
               <br />
               better begin his experiment with the aborigines of 
               <br />
               this country, rather than with our French popula- 
               <br />
               tion. He will have no literature to contend 
               <br />
               against, and, if the hon. gentleman’s view is correct, 
               <br />
               he should make it a crime to publish a book, news— 
               <br />
               paper, or periodical, in, say, the Algonquin language. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman might insist that all the Indian 
               <br />
               children should learn English instead of Cree or 
               <br />
               Ojibbeway or some other Indian tongue. He 
               <br />
               might make it a crime to give them instruction in 
               <br />
               any language except English. But if the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man is going to succeed even with the Indian 
               <br />
               population he would require to make it a criminal 
               <br />
               offence for a missionary to undertake to learn the 
               <br />
               Indian language with a View to speaking it. He 
               <br />
               ought to insist on his speaking English and nothing 
               <br />
               else to the Indians. What does the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man propose ? If he applies the same principle 
               <br />
               to the Indian population as he proposes to apply 
               <br />
               to the French population, he will have mission- 
               <br />
               aries, traders and schoolmasters speaking to In- 
               <br />
               dians only English. And by that process he would 
               <br />
               expect to make Indians Englishmen. I think the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman might discover some impediment 
               <br />
               in the way. I know no reason why the school- 
               <br />
               master and missionary should be allowed to talk 
               <br />
               Algonquin and state ofﬁcials should be denied that 
               <br />
               privilege. I do not know why men should learn 
               <br />
               their duty to their Creator in Algonquin and be 
               <br />
               compelled to learn their duty to the State only in 
               <br />
               the English. It would indeed be a mock- 
               <br />
               ery to pretend you were going to convert the 
               <br />
               Indian into an Englishman by providing that the 
               <br />
               magistrate who tries him for some petty crime shall 
               <br />
               conduct the proceedings in English. It seems to 
               <br />
               me that if the hon. gentleman is to succeed he must 
               <br />
               adopt a policy more thorough than that marked 
               <br />
               out in his Bill. I do not know, but I am inclined 
               <br />
               to think, that the hon. gentleman will scarcely be 
               <br />
               able to get all his ordinary supporters to sustain 
               <br />
               him in adopting such a policy as I have indi- 
               <br />
               cated, and yet it is not an unreasonable one, 
               <br />
               if the experiment is to be tried at all with 
               <br />
               any hope of success. If the hon. gentleman can- 
               <br />
               not succeed where there is no history, no press, no 
               <br />
               literature, no philosophy, daily read and studied 
               <br />
               to be overcome, how can he hope to succeed when 
               <br />
               these subjects ﬁll the minds of old and young, delight- 
               <br />
               ing the one and affording solace to the other? The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman says that language makes the 
               <br />
               nation. I do not agree with him. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man confuses cause and effect. The same forces 
               <br />
               which operate through 8. Ion period of years, 
               <br />
               which serve to change people 0 different races or 
               <br />
               tribes into one nation, also serve to modify their 
               <br />
               language in the same way. The two things have 
               <br />
               a common origin and are operated upon by the 
               <br />
               common cause, so that which makes a new nation 
               <br />
               also, at the same time, makes a new langua e. I 
               <br />
               should like to know Whether the hon. gent eman 
               <br />
               supposes that he could bring about the fusion of

               take to bring about fusion of races, you will simply 
               <br />
               apply that law to a condition of things in the 
               <br />

               wholly different from that which existed in the

               one case or the other. There is an illustration of 
               <br />
               this in Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter 
               <br />
               tells us of the inﬂuence of Norman and Saxon 
               <br />
               upon each other, and\how out of their fusion 
               <br />
               modern English came forth. He shows that certain 
               <br />
               Norman words take the place of certain Saxon 
               <br />
               words and the reverse; and how the names of 
               <br />
               animals used for the purposes of food repeat the 
               <br />
               history of the early relation of the two races. 
               <br />
               They are in the care of the Saxon when they are 
               <br />
               in the ﬁeld and receive Saxon names. When they 
               <br />
               are slaughtered and brought to market and ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               Norman consumer they have Norman names. And 
               <br />
               so thepigbecomes pork, the ox becomes beef, the calf 
               <br />
               veal, and the sheep mutton, and these words repeat 
               <br />
               the history of the relation of these two races quite 
               <br />
               as well as the ordinary history of these races. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman forgets that it was a whale 
               <br />
               and not a cod that swallowed Jonah, and so if he 
               <br />
               will insist upon three millions of people in this 
               <br />
               country, swallowing two I am afraid that the indi- 
               <br />
               vidual who attempts that feat would be a different 
               <br />
               looking personage afterwards from what he was 
               <br />
               before. Now the inadequacy of the means that are 
               <br />
               employed, and that the hon. gentleman’s Bill 
               <br />
               suggests, becomes perfectly obvious. The ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               use of a language is limited and that oﬂicial use 
               <br />
               cannot secure that unity of races which the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman seeks and without which he says there 
               <br />
               cannot be political cohesion. The business of the 
               <br />
               modern state is so restricted that the ofﬁcial use 
               <br />
               or disuse of a language can have no appreciable 
               <br />
               effect upon its general vitality. Suppose the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman were entrusted with the power to do 
               <br />
               what he thinks ought to be done, suppose he goes 
               <br />
               into a French settlement for the purpose of admi- 
               <br />

               <br />
               English, he is among a people who speak and know 
               <br />
               only French; the causes are heard, witnesses are 
               <br />
