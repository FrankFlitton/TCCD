               and ask to have the change made. 
               <br />
               It was only when the Bill came up for 
               <br />
               discussion, and only upon the third reading

               <br />
               very strong appeal was then made by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) to 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior to right the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> 
               <br />
               rage that had been perpetrated. More than 
               <br />
               that, I went to the hon. Minister in his seat 
               <br />
               and discussed the matter with him and urged 
               <br />
               him very strongly. as a matter of fair-play 
               <br />
               to the Liberals in the Territories, not to in- 
               <br />
               sist upon this change in the old law. But he 
               <br />
               took a ﬁrm stand, and said it was the policy 
               <br />
               of the Government to insist upon the Act 
               <br />
               as it had been amended. So I think the 
               <br />
               hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“’est</span> Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Davin) was not justiﬁed in ﬁnding fault 
               <br />
               with me for putting the case against the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister as I did. The hon. Minister 
               <br />
               assumed the responsibility of the change at 
               <br />
               that time, and he defends it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> And 
               <br />
               for what purpose ‘3 What other purpose can

               who considers the. matter, that, under the

               <br />
               most gigantic frauds to be perpetrated in 
               <br />
               these elections. As I have said, it is pos- 
               <br />
               sible for the Government to elect every mem— 
               <br />
               ber for the North-west: Territories in the 
               <br />
               next general election, through the operation 
               <br />
               of this changed law. The hon. Minister, of 
               <br />
               course. repudiates the suggestion that he in- 
               <br />
               tends to do any such thing. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'he</span> has no 
               <br />
               such intention, why. then, does he take the 
               <br />
               power to do it ? He offers only one reason. 
               <br />
               and that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1that,</span> in 1891. under the old law, 
               <br />
               certain frauds were perpetrated. If that is 
               <br />
               all, let him make some change which will 
               <br />
               right the wrong he speaks of, without taking 
               <br />
               the power to inﬂict this great wrong upon 
               <br />
               us. Surely, he can remedy one without 
               <br />
               causing the other. Let the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               take any course he likes, but I am going to 
               <br />
               protest, as I said before, against the Govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               have under this Act. And I hold the hon.

               Minister of the Interior wholly reSponsible 
               <br />
               for it. I think I was quite justiﬁed, after 
               <br />
               the stand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"he</span> took in 1895, in assuming, as "l

               upon that point. But, when those amend-

               childish argument of the Minister of the In-

               <br />
               would do no harm. His argument was that 
               <br />
               the old law worked well, and. therefore. the 
               <br />
               new law would work well. The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man must surely think there is neither sense 
               <br />
               nor reason in this House. In effect. he says 
               <br />
               that there is no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between a list 
               <br />
               that means nothing and a. list that is ﬁnal

               and binding. When a list is made up which 
               <br />
               binds nobody, who cares what becomes of 
               <br />
               it or how it is made up. But if. in the mean-

               time, you change the law so that the list.

               list for convenience, to save time on elec- 
               <br />
               tion day, and make that list ﬁnal and bind- 
               <br />
               ing, surely you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eifect</span> a complete change. 
               <br />
               You could perpetrate any fraud you liked in 
               <br />
               1887 or 1891 in keeping men’s names off the 
               <br />
               prepared lists. and we did not need to care. 
               <br />
               because we had privileges under the Act 
               <br />
               which countervailed all that wrong. But. if 
               <br />
               you attempt to perpetrate a fraud in 1896 
               <br />
               which the Act gives you the power to per- 
               <br />
               petrate. we have no protection. The only 
               <br />
               course of safety is to have this vile iniquity 
               <br />
               purged from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statutefbook.</span> The hon. 
               <br />
               member for North York (Mr. Mulock) says 
               <br />
               this Bill cannot pass. Well. Mr. Speaker, I 
               <br />
               hope it will pass. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North York appeals to the Government in 
               <br />
               favour of the Bill. We tried that in 1895. 
               <br />
               But in 1895, unfortunately. when we ﬁrst 
               <br />
               learned of this wrong, the Government busi- 
               <br />
               ness was done, and we had no chance of 
               <br />
               emphasizing our appeal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">edectually.</span> We are
