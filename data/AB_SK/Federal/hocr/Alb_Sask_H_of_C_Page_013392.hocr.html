               <br />

               clause that limits section l3. The Bill reads :

               <br />

               <br />
               attention of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government-</span> to this, as I thought it 
               <br />
               was unwise to limit the power of the Legislative 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly</span> in regard to railway or tramway, and 
               <br />
               other such companies. and, if I may refer to what 
               <br />
               I said on the motion for the first reading of the 
               <br />
               - .l)ominion Lands Act, I may say that I pointed out- 
               <br />
               that- the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> accustomed to give 
               <br />
               grants of lands for railway purposes to these terri- 
               <br />
               tories and I instaneed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">especially</span> Minnesota. An 
               <br />
               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> who is always well informed on 
               <br />
               railway matters. and who is especially well 
               <br />
               informed on matters connected with the United 
               <br />
               States, questioned the accuracy of the statement. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now-.Sir,</span> as a matter of fact the Territory of 
               <br />
               Minnesota ohtaincd grants of lands from Congress 
               <br />
               to the extent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LOSILl-ﬂl</span> acres for the purpose of 
               <br />
               giving lands to railways, and the advantage that 
               <br />
               has aCerued to them is very great, because 
               <br />
               Minnesota derives a large revenue at the present 
               <br />
               time from a certain percentage which that State 
               <br />
               is entitled to on the net profit. I do not intend 
               <br />
               to move in this matter, but I call the attention of 
               <br />
               the Government to it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> perhaps we err on the 
               <br />
               side of not giving more power to the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assemhly. I do not see. that it would be any harm 
               <br />
               to give it the power to incorporate railways, tram- 
               <br />
               ways and irrigation companies. I call the attention 
               <br />
               of the Government- to it hecause they may have to 
               <br />
               deal with the territories at some future session, and 
               <br />
               I think it would be well to consider whether the 
               <br />
               power to incorporate small railway companies 
               <br />
               should not he given to the Assembly ; and whether 
               <br />
               it- would not be well, also, to do what was done in 
               <br />
               the case of Minnesota, and place at their disposal 
               <br />
               a certain amount- of land which they could give to 
               <br />
               the railways.
