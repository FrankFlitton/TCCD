               The British North America Act is the

               We have no power to decide whether any

               <br />
               who are the custodians of that Act are the 
               <br />
               imperial authorities and their representa-

               exercised that authority already on the

               Governor General to consult the law ofﬁcers

               curity in the promise which the right hon.

               <br />
               will be submitted to the Supreme Court; I 
               <br />
               also feel a security in the fact that the im-

               Now let me refer to the question which is 
               <br />
               particularly before the House as to whether 
               <br />
               there is the right to deprive Ontario or New 
               <br />
               Brunswick of the number of members which 
               <br />
               they at present send as representatives to 
               <br />
               this House. I do so with a good deal of

               ditﬁdence. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice that when the British 
               <br />
               North America Act was pass-ed it contem- 
               <br />
               plated the present and it contemplated the 
               <br />
               future, but I will ask the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice what <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> the meaning of clause 8 in 
               <br />
               that British North America Act in which it 
               <br />
               states that the four provinces of Canada 
               <br />
               shall have a separate census taken and then 
               <br />
               I shall deal with clause 51 of the Act. My 
               <br />
               contention is that clause 51 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act has no application to 
               <br />
