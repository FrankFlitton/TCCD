               <br />

               would outgrow the subsidy so quickly that

               if there were a ﬁxed subsidy, instead of 
               <br />
               proving advantageous it would be distinctly 
               <br />
               disadvantageous. That is the reason why 
               <br />
               they do not want a ﬁxed subsidy which 
               <br />
               would be the equivalent of a provincial sub-
