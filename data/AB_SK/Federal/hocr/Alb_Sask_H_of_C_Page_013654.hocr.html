               the matter with the members of the House 
               <br />

               <br />
               them to consider whether it would be advisable 
               <br />
               to have such legislation introduced this year. 
               <br />
               We are, as you know, introducing a redistribu-

               <br />
               giving to the territories a much larger repre-

               sentation in the House of Commons than they 
               <br />
               would be entitled to, were they to become a 
               <br />
               province. In fact the Bill which we have 
               <br />

               sentation in the House of Commons of ten

               as a. province they would be entitled to only 
               <br />

               Well, my right hon. friend has at last 
               <br />
               given a reply to the Prime Minister of the 
               <br />
               territories and it does not seem to me to 
               <br />
               be a reply which ought to carry very great 
               <br />
               weight. He does not take up any of the 
               <br />
               reasons for delay which have been urged 
               <br />
               during the past two sessions by the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. The right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister in this letter conﬁnes him- 
               <br />
               self almost entirely to the fact that ‘under 
               <br />
               the Redistribution Bill which was introdu— 
               <br />
               ced during the present session the territories 
               <br />
               are to receive a representation of ten mem- 
               <br />
               bers, whereas, if we went strictly on popu— 
               <br />
               lation, they would be entitled to only six 
               <br />
               members. Is that really an answer to the de- 
               <br />
               mand of these people that they should be 
               <br />
               accorded a provincial status? It is not an 
               <br />
               answer, certainly, even if the contention 
               <br />
               could be supported for a moment. It could 
               <br />
               not be supported for a moment, because, 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman only yesterday ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that it would be fair to regard the 
               <br />
               territories as having a population of over 
               <br />
               300,000 and as the unit of population for Can 
               <br />
               ada is something less than 25,000, if the
