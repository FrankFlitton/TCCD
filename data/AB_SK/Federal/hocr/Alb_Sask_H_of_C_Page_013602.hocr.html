               Mr. Haggart). Of course he realizes that 
               <br />
               there is a difference between the case of a

               <br />
               the case of a territory the Dominion parlia- 
               <br />
               ment has jurisdiction to bring the territory

               ing representative institutions, it is entirely 
               <br />
               different. In that case there must be 
               <br />
               an address from the province that seeks 
               <br />
               entrance into the Dominion and there 
               <br />
               must be an address from the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament. Both these addresses from the 
               <br />
               province coming in and from the Dominion 
               <br />
               parliament must go to the imperial author- 
               <br />
               ities, and there by Order in Council sanction- 
               <br />
               ing the address the province is allowed in 
               <br />
               upon the terms fixed in the address. The 
               <br />
               address of course must be in the same 
               <br />
               terms from the province and from the Dom-

               passed, and has the effect of imperial legis-

               sideration which has been addressed from

               this side and which he has perhaps not 
               <br />
               fully appreciated. He has said that it would 
               <br />
               be quite possible, by means of addresses 
               <br />
               passed by the provinces and by this parlia-

               ment upon the admission of these provinces, 
               <br />
               to so far alter the effect of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act as to reduce the repre-

               <br />
               is deﬁnitely ﬁxed and stated in that Act. 
               <br />
               Now, I submit to the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               that that would lead to a very extraordinary 
               <br />
               condition of affairs, if his argument is pur- 
               <br />
               sued to its logical conclusion, and for this 
               <br />
               reason: So far as Rupert’s Land is con- 
               <br />
               cerned there is to be no address from Ru- 
               <br />
               pert’s Land because Rupert’s Land possesses 
               <br />
               no representative institutions. Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land was to be admitted on an address from 
               <br />
               no other body than from the House of par- 
               <br />
               liament of Canada. The statute says:

               And on address from the Houses of parlia-

               Then the British North America Act of 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment to deal with the representation of 
               <br />
               Rupert‘s Land; and the point to which I 
               <br />
               invite the attention of the minister is this—- 
               <br />
               he says that by means of this address, 
               <br />
               coupled with the Queen’s proclamation you 
               <br />
               can cut down the representation of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec. I do not agree with the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice at present; I may 
               <br />
               change my mind upon further considera-

               <br />
               it not lead to this inevitable conclusion: 
               <br />
               You have so far as Rupert’s Land is concern-
