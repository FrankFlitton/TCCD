               <br />
               the question. This question of the dual language 
               <br />
               has been discussed in the North~VVest Legislature. 
               <br />

               which I will not read because it is already on record.

               That address was prepared by a. sub-committee of

               the Council, and upon receiving that address the 
               <br />
