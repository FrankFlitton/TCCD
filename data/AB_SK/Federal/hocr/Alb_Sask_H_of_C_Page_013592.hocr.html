               <br />
               sidered settled, because it has been argued 
               <br />
               that the parliament can itself do what, under 
               <br />
               this section, it was empowered to authorize 
               <br />
               others to do. But I would call the attention 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Justice to the fact that if 
               <br />
               the construction that we are now putting 
               <br />
               forward is to have effect, it may be neces- 
               <br />
               sary to reconsider whether that view of its 
               <br />
               authority is correct. It might be that if the 
               <br />
               minister’s view that section 51 applies to the 
               <br />
               whole Dominion, was correct, the parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada might possibly be argued to have 
               <br />
               power to do what it could authorize some- 
               <br />
               body else to do. But a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> construc- 
               <br />
               tion might be reasonable and proper 
               <br />
               if the parliament of Canada is only to 
               <br />
               authorize somebody to adjust the repre~ 
               <br />
               sentation of these particular four provinces. 
               <br />
               It does not at all follow that the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada would be a proper 
               <br />

               <br />
               whether, if we took the view that I am now 
               <br />
               putting forward, parliament has authority 
               <br />
               at all to distribute, or whether it is not 
               <br />
               bound to depute that authority to somebody

               Mr. BARKER. There has been no time, 
               <br />
               as I understand it, when such a readjust- 
               <br />
               ment of the population was necessary as 
               <br />
               would raise this contention. This is the

               be said in favour of the view taken on that

               dealing with the readjustment of the whole 
               <br />
               of Canada, but when it is dealing with only 
               <br />
               a section of Canada I think there may be a 
               <br />
               grave doubt as to whether other authority 
               <br />
               has been given to it than to depute some-
