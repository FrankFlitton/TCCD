               <br />
               wearied of the debate tO-night. Notwithstanding

               the great attention the House has given to this 
               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁve days, and that wehave already reached midnight

               the hon. member for Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell),

               Before stating the view which I wish to present to 
               <br />
               the House as the decision which ought to be ar- 
               <br />
               rived at on this question, I may be permitted to 
               <br />
               make some observations with regard to certain 
               <br />
               arguments which have been put forward in defence 
               <br />
               of the preamble of this Bill. Some members have 
               <br />
               stated in the course of this debate that a different 
               <br />
               doctrine was laid down last Session in reference to 
               <br />
               another measure, from that which has been pro- 
               <br />
               nounced by those who have declared that the 
               <br />
               preamble of the Bill now before us is offensive to 
               <br />
               the good taste of the House and menaces the per- 
               <br />
               manency of institutions established by law. They 
               <br />
               have stated that that doctrine is inconsistent with 
               <br />
               the doctrine laid down last Session, which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Toronto (Mr. Cockburn), by mistake, 
               <br />

               <br />

               proposition, was put before the House last Session. 
               <br />
               When I had the honor to address the House in 
               <br />
               regard to the Bill, then under discussion, I was 
               <br />
               speaking on a set of facts which were then before 
               <br />
               the House. I was speaking not of preambles in 
               <br />
               general, but of the preamble to a statute which was 
               <br />
               under our consideration ; I was calling the at- 
               <br />
               tention of the House to the fact that the part 
               <br />
               of that preamble to which most exception had 
               <br />
               been taken was merely the recital of a 
               <br />
               correspondence which had taken place, and 
               <br />
               had no immediate connection with the enact- 
               <br />
               ing part of the Bill. More than that, when we 
               <br />
               come to consider the position in which we are 
               <br />
               now placed with regard to the preamble of the 
               <br />
               present Bill with the position which the House 
               <br />
               occupied last Session, voting yea or nay, on a 
               <br />
               motion to disallow the Act of another Legislature, 
               <br />
               because there was something in the recital <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Offensive</span> 
               <br />
               to the good taste of the House, there is this funda- 
               <br />
               mental diﬂ'erence that, in voting for this Bill, we 
               <br />
               are not merely criticising the action of another 
               <br />
               Legislature, we are not criticising a preamble which 
               <br />
               might or might not have inﬂuenced the adoption 
               <br />
               of a statute in another Parliament, but we are now 
               <br />
               called on to vote, yea or nay, on this preamble which 
               <br />
               has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Offered</span> to us by the member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). I submit, therefore, that 
               <br />
               the comments made by some members, in regard 
               <br />
               to our action of last Session are not founded on 
               <br />
               reasons which apply to the present case, and 
               <br />
               that the objection taken to this preamble is not 
               <br />
               inconsistent with the observations made last 
               <br />
               Session by myself, or by any other person, who 
               <br />
               then took the view I had the honor to express. In 
               <br />
               hurrying forward so as to detain the House only for 
               <br />
               as short a time as possible let me call attention to a 
               <br />
               subject from which attention has somewhat wan-

               dered in the course of this heated debate. Let me 
               <br />
               ask the calm consideration of the House to the very 
               <br />
               few points which are involved in the section of the

               <br />
               to repeal. Section 110 provides, in relation to four 
               <br />
               subjects. First of all as to the debates of the Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Assembly of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories, and 
               <br />
               the provision in respect of these debates is that 
               <br />
               either the French or English language may be used. 
               <br />
               In the second place the provision relates to the 
               <br />
               records and Journals in that Assembly, and it is 
               <br />
               that the French and English languages must both 
               <br />
               be used in the records and Journals. We have 
               <br />
               ﬁrst of all the provision that the use of either of the 
               <br />
               two languages is optional as regards the debates 
               <br />
               and compulsory as regards the printing and record- 
               <br />
               ing in the Journals of that Assembly. But we 
               <br />
               have in the next branch of this subject two other 
               <br />
               questions, both of which were touched upon by the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State this afternoon, and both of 
               <br />
               which, in my humble opinion—and I shall ask the 
               <br />
               opinion of the House upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it~are</span> of far greater 
               <br />
               importance, as regards this question of language 
               <br />
               than the mere question of what language shall be 
               <br />
               used in the debates of the Assembly or the records 
               <br />
               or Journals of that body. As my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Secretary of State says, it is a matter of little con- 
               <br />
               sequence What rule is applied as to the mode 
               <br />
               in which the debates shall be conducted in 
               <br />
               the Assembly. If the population in the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories of French origin and French 
               <br />
               speech is sufﬁciently numerous to send to that body 
               <br />
               intelligent and active men, capable of taking part 
               <br />
