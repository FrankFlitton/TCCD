               have stated. Now, I stated in the opening of my

               remarks that I would be compelled to refer brieﬂy

               ham (Mr. Blake), and in doing so let me state that 
               <br />
               no one has any idea of the reluctance with which I do 
               <br />
               so, because I have such an unbounded respect and 
               <br />
               high admiration for that hon. gentleman, and I am 
               <br />
               always ready and willing, so far as I can, to bend 
               <br />
               my will to the will of the hon. member for West

               <br />
               judgment allow me to do so. But upon this occa- 
               <br />
               sion I am unable to do so, and I want to refer to 
               <br />
               one or two matters upon which he has spoken, and 
               <br />
               upon which, to my mind, he appeared to me to 
               <br />
               take up a wrong position. He said that the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> Council had no right to speak upon this im- 
               <br />
               portant matter, and he used this language : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               “ The North-West Assembly had no permission or

               <br />
               this question at all, and the electors to that Assembly had 
               <br />
               not before them, when the Assembly was elected, any pro- 
               <br />

               <br />

               Now, Mr. Speaker, there can be no possible doubt 
               <br />
               of the truth of that proposition, nobody ever denied 
               <br />
               it ; but at the same time, to say that the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories had no right to speak out upon 
               <br />
               this matter, is setting forth a proposition which 
               <br />
               cannot possibly be accepted. Why, Sir, if it is 
               <br />
               correct that the North-W’est Council had no right 
               <br />
               to speak out upon the subject—matter of this Bill, 
               <br />
               then how much more are we stultifying ourselves 
               <br />
               in this House in the action we have taken, when, 
               <br />
               during my short period in Parliament, we have 
               <br />
               already spoken out upon matters relating to the 
               <br />
               entire Empire, more especially the subject of Home 
               <br />
               Rule. Sir, if the hon. member is right in his con- 
               <br />
               tention, then we never had the right to do that ; 
               <br />
               still we did it, and if we did that, with still greater 
               <br />
               reason may the representatives of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthJYest</span> 
               <br />
               Assembly speak out upon that question which 
               <br />
               peculiarly affects themselves. But in addition to 
               <br />
               the fact that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-V'Vest</span> Council have, by the 
               <br />
               resolution forwarded to the member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe and placed upon the Table of this House, 
               <br />
               spoken out in very strong and plain language upon 
               <br />
               this subject, we have also other means of 
               <br />
               information whereby we know that it is the 
               <br />
               almost unanimous wish of the people of the N orth~ 
               <br />
               West Territories to abolish the dual language. The 
               <br />
               hon. member from North Simcoe read, I believe, 
               <br />
               some telegrams the other night which were ques~ 
               <br />
               tioned by the hurried interruption of the Secretary 
               <br />
               of State. He read one, I believe, signed by a 
               <br />
               gentleman named McCaul. I happen to have the 
               <br />
               pleasure of knowing that gentleman, and I am 
               <br />

               The latter cost $3.000 for three years. Of 500 copies of

               So I think we have sufﬁciently heard from the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories as to their views regard- 
               <br />
               ing this important matter. But I have heard it 
               <br />
               said that there have been counter-petitions pre— 
               <br />
               sented by the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. Davis), 
               <br />
               petitions purporting to be very numerously signed, 
               <br />
               asking for the retention of the dual language. I 
               <br />
               do not doubt that if any one takes the trouble to 
               <br />
               examine these petitions he will be very much im- 
               <br />
               pressed with some of them. There is a great sim- 
               <br />
               ilarity of writing between the signatures to those 
               <br />
               petitions, and I think we all know that about the 
               <br />
               easiest thing in the world is to get up a petition. 
               <br />
               I recollect perfectly well that petitions were 
               <br />
               sent here very numerously signed against the Fran- 
               <br />

               <br />

               of petitions addressed to the House of Commons

               petitions contained only two or three different forms
