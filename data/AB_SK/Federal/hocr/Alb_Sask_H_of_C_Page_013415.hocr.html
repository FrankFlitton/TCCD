               think, looking at how extremely sensitive a large

               course. It is one not in the public interest and one 
               <br />
               that certainly cannot promote harmony and the 
               <br />
               well-being of the population of the Territories. Sir, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman, if he will take the trouble of 
               <br />
               examining into the solution of this question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.the</span>

               results elsewhere, will ﬁnd that the course taken in 
               <br />
               the Province of Ontario on the whole produced the 
               <br />
               most- satisfactory results on this continent on the 
               <br />
               educational question. I do not think that he should 
               <br />
               come here simply as a political theorist to advocate 
               <br />
               views of abstract political philosophy and under- 
               <br />
               take to shape them into law. We ought to look at 
               <br />
               practical results, we ought to look at the character 
               <br />
               of our population, we ought to look not merely on 
               <br />
               what we believe would in the abstract be best for 
               <br />
               every person, but we ought to look to the prejudices 
               <br />
               of the people as well as to their principles in so far 
               <br />
               as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we‘can</span> avoid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> ground of friction and of 
               <br />
               irritation. So far as Ontario is concerned she has 
               <br />
               recognized the principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> separate schools. She 
               <br />
               has given to the Protestant minority and to the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic population where they demand it, 
               <br />
               the privilege of establishing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.a</span> separate school. 
               <br />
               That has not been done in the various states of the 
               <br />
               Union ; and I wish to call the attention of the House 
               <br />
               to the fact that to-day in the Province of Ontario 
               <br />
               there is a smaller percentage of the Catholic 
               <br />
               population in the separate schools than there is 
               <br />
               in the State of New York in the parish schools 
               <br />

               enough, they organize themselves voluntarily into

               a parish school. They employ their own teacher, 
               <br />
