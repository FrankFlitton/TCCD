               cheaper to get incorporation in the Nortli-\\'est

               they could in the Assembly. One object I have in 
               <br />
               view in saying that this House should keep the 
               <br />
               power of incorporating these railways is thatI think 
               <br />
               it would teach this Parliament what its responsi- 
               <br />
               bilities and duties are to the North-West. The 
               <br />
               incorporation of railway companies is one of the 
               <br />
               most important things connected with these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terri.</span> 
               <br />
               tories. and Ithink that when a Bill connected with 
               <br />
               the incorporation of railway companies passes 
               <br />
               through this House hon. gentlemen will perhaps 
               <br />
               appreciate their responsibilities to the territories 
               <br />
               more than at present.

               Mr. TISDALE. There is another objeCtion to 
               <br />
               this. If this power is given to them they would 
               <br />
               have to pass a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span> Railway Act, which would 
               <br />
               involve very heavy machinery. until they are in- 
               <br />
               corporated into provinces, and we would have 
               <br />
               another set of railway Acts to come in contact 
               <br />
               with the Railway Act of the Dominion. I think 
               <br />
               that until the territories become provinces they 
               <br />
               should not have this power.

               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). I think that the power 
               <br />
               to incorporate Railway Acts in that territory, as 
               <br />
               long as it remains an undivided territory, would be 
               <br />
               far more extensive than the power to incorporate a 
               <br />
               railway in the provinces. You do not know what 
               <br />
               extent of territory you will assign to a province in 
               <br />
               that country yet. Suppose you were to make a 
               <br />
               province of the Saskatchewan district at this mo- 
               <br />
               ment, the majority of the people living in that dis- 
               <br />
               trict could incorporate a railway extending all the 
               <br />
               way to the North Saskatchewan, at the foot of the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains. A railway of immense extent 
               <br />
               could be incorporated in a territory although the 
               <br />
               vast majority of the inhabitants may reside in a 
               <br />
               very limited district. 'I do not think, however, 
               <br />
               that would apply to tramways, which are in their 
               <br />
               nature local, and extend to a very short distance ; 
               <br />
               nor do I think it would apply to telephone com- 
               <br />
               panies in towns. I do not see why, if you confer 
               <br />
               any municipal institutions upon them, you should 
               <br />
               not confer the power to incorporate a telephone 
               <br />
               company. You have given them powers implying 
               <br />
               a much larger degree of responsibility, and it 
               <br />
               seems to me that powers relating to tramway and 
               <br />
               telephone companies might safely be entrusted to 
               <br />
               the Legislature of the territories.

               do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> agree with the hon. member for Saskatche— 
               <br />
               wan that it is necessary to subsidize every railway 
               <br />
               in that country. I think men might have sutlicient 
               <br />
               interest there, they might acquire sufﬁciently large 
               <br />
               tracts of land or c0al~ﬁelds, as to justify them in 
               <br />
               building a railway without coming here for a 
               <br />
               subsidy : and I would prefer seeing the hon. mem-

               Mr. MACDOWALL. I think I can remove 
               <br />
               some of the surprise of the hon. member. He 
               <br />
               represents the small Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of'</span> Manitoba, and, 
               <br />
               when I say the small province, I speak compar- 
               <br />
               atively. The North-West Territories are immense, 
               <br />
               and, compared with them, the Province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba is of small area though thickly populated; and 
               <br />
               it has a much larger revenue, because the total 
               <br />
               revenue of the North-\Vest Territories, from all 
               <br />
               territorial sources, does not exceed about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">320,1“).</span> 
               <br />
               Therefore, it would be premature to grant the 
               <br />
               North-West Assembly those extensive powers. It 
               <br />
               is in the interest of the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> 
               <br />
               that we should make the hon. members of this
