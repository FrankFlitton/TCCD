               <br />
               would see a larger movement of settlers to the North-West 
               <br />
               than we have in the last nine years. We would not have 
               <br />
               in the next nine years the beggarly showingwhich we have 
               <br />
               for the last nine years, of an inﬂux of 132,000 peeple to 
               <br />
               Manitoba and 40,000 to the N orth-West. I believe that We 
               <br />
               have not, by 25 per cent., as many native-born Canadians in 
               <br />
               the North-West as there are in the Territory of Dakota in 
               <br />
               the United States. The reason is that the settler in Dakota 
               <br />
               has had greater inducements held out to him, while the 
               <br />
               policy of this Government has been such as to repel him 
               <br />
               from our N orth-West. It is time that a change should be 
               <br />
               made, and I hope that the hon. gentleman who now oc- 
               <br />
               cupies the position of head of the great Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior, who has lived in the North-West and must neces 
               <br />
               sarily know the wants of that country and the feelings of 
               <br />
               the settlers in that country, will administer the affairs of 
               <br />
               that department in a different spirit, in a spirit favorable 
               <br />
               to the settlers, and that, under his ad ministration, we may 
               <br />
               secure for that great country the inﬂux of a great body of

               Mr. MACDOWALL. As this is a question Which interests 
               <br />
               particularly those members who come from the N orth-West, 
               <br />
               I will ask permission to occupy a few minutes of the time 
               <br />
               of the House in regard to it. The range which has been 
               <br />
               opened before us is extremely wide, as the memorials of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorlhoWest</span> Assembly embrace a great many subjects, but 
               <br />
               these are all of great interest to the settlers in the N orth- 
               <br />
               West. The question of the Dominion lands, to which the 
               <br />
               member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) has referred, is 
               <br />
               one of great importance, because, of course, the settlers 
               <br />
               come in there With the intention of settling 0n the land, and 
               <br />
               making their living upon it as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmers.</span> I do not think, 
               <br />
               however, that we can ﬁnd very great fault with the land 
               <br />
               laws as they stand, 01‘, at any rate, With the new regulations 
               <br />
               which I understand the Minister of the Interior is likely to 
               <br />
               introduce, in order that things be made so much easier and 
               <br />
               better for the settler so that it would be difﬁcult to improve 
               <br />
               upon them. Of course, it is a matter of very great i mport- 
               <br />
               ance to have the land for the settlers as cheap as possible, 
               <br />
               but at the same time, we have to bear in mind that 
               <br />
               a great deal of money is being spent on the develOp 
               <br />
               ment of the North-West, and that country must bear 
               <br />
               to some extent, its share of the cost. The price of land at 
               <br />
               82 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3.50</span> an acre is not too high. If land is worth 20 
               <br />
               cents an acre, it is certainly worth $2, and I do not think 
               <br />
               any settler who has occupied what he considers a good 
               <br />
               location, when he has got his patent, would sacriﬁce it for 
               <br />
               such a small sum as 8. an acre. In addition to this, the 
               <br />
               only thing the members from the N orth-West would urge 
               <br />
               upon the Government is this. As a rule, the people who come 
               <br />
               inthere are not very rich. They have hard times before 
               <br />
               them for the ﬁrst few years, and, if they are not abfe to pay 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fer/their</span> land within the stipulated three years, they should 
               <br />
               be given a certain time within which to pay, and the in- 
               <br />
               terest should not be too high. For my part, I should like 
               <br />
               to see the interest thrown off altogether, but this cannot be 
               <br />
               done, because the sale of land, whether it is by the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, or by individuals, is a business transaction, and must 
               <br />
               be carried on in a business manner. While on this land 
               <br />
               question, I must refer to the remarks made by the mover of 
               <br />
               the resolution (Mr. Davin), in regard to second home- 
               <br />
               steading. He referred to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion</span> which took place in 
               <br />
               this House on that subject in 18:57, and he urged that the 
               <br />
               granting of second homesteads should be extended for a 
               <br />
               longer period to settlers now in the North-West. 
               <br />
               I should be sorry to see this done. In 1887, when this 
               <br />
               matter was before the House, I took the same stand, and, 
               <br />
               when I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">returred</span> to the d <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S'rict</span> of Saskatchewan, I found 
               <br />
               that my conduct was endorsed by the people there. What 
               <br />
               we on ht toconsider is what is the proper spirit of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and who mean to make their homes in the country, and to 
               <br />
               reside there with their families, but, if you give a homestead 
               <br />
               to one man and allow him to throw it up and to take another 
               <br />
               homestead in another place, you are creating a class of specu- 
               <br />
               lators. When this was before the House, I comparel two 
               <br />
               of the prominent cities of the N orth-West, Winnipeg on the 
               <br />
               one hand and Prince Albert on the other—and I compared 
               <br />
               the country which surrounded those cities. The hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Marquette (Mr. Watson) smiles at the idea of com- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iaring</span> Winnipeg with Prince Albert, but I think that I 
               <br />
               compared the two cities which were most ﬁt for comparison. 
               <br />
               If you go out from Winnipeg for many miles around, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd a large proportion of the country unsettled. These 
               <br />
               lands were scriped by speculators, and the land <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remaini</span> un- 
               <br />
               settled, but, in the country surrounding Prince Albert, you 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd that it is occupied by men who are 
               <br />
               making improvements on their farms, and I do 
               <br />
               not think there is any comparison at all between 
               <br />
               the country surrounding these two cities. I know 
               <br />
               that the peeple of Winnipeg have endeavored, to the best 
               <br />
               of their ability, to get the lands immediately surrounding 
               <br />
               the city into the market. Winnipeg has to depend now, to 
               <br />
               a great extent, on its wholesale business. The retail busi- 
               <br />
               ness is small, because there are so few people surrounding 
               <br />
               the city, and it is principally conﬁned to those who live in 
               <br />
               the town. I believe that, if you wish to have prosperous 
               <br />
               towns, you must have the country settled close up to the 
               <br />
               town, so as to give a retail business ﬁrst and a wholesale 
               <br />
               business afterwards. One of the memorials from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North.</span> 
               <br />
               West Council, to which I desire to call special attention, is 
               <br />
               a memorial to the Dominion Government praying them to 
               <br />
               make such arrangements as to ensure the immediate con- 
               <br />
               struction of a railway to the settlements on the North Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan. I am in hearty sympathy and accord with that 
               <br />
               memorial. In the preamble they ﬁrst state that the build- 
               <br />
               ing of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway had cut off the markets 
               <br />
               of those settlements, and that, in consequence of that, the 
               <br />
               people were unable to ﬁnd means of getting rid of the pro- 
               <br />
               duce which they raised. The consequence was that they 
               <br />
               were being brought into a most undesirable state of poverty. 
               <br />
               I do not want to enter into great details at this time on that 
               <br />
               subject, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span> I am happy to state that arrangements are 
               <br />
               being carried on by a certain railway company pointing 
               <br />
               towards the construction of the road to Prince Albert and 
               <br />
               Battleford,which I hope will be concluded next month, and 
               <br />
               which will give the needed railway communication. If 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> arrangements are not concluded at that time, I shall 
               <br />
               have a motion to lay before the House, and shall then have an 
               <br />
               Opportunity to go further into details in regard to the subject. 
               <br />
               I will simply say now that I cannot urge too strongly on 
               <br />
               the Minister of Interior and his colleagues that there is a 
               <br />
               great necessity, in fact an immediate necessity, that the 
               <br />
               land grants for railways in that country should be located 
               <br />
               at once, if any work is to be carried out. It is absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary that those who invest their money in these under- 
               <br />
               takings should know exactly what security they have got, 
               <br />
               and it is impossible for them to tell what the security is 
               <br />
               worth until they know where these lands are, the lands 
               <br />
               being security for building the railways. Another question 
               <br />
               towhich I wish to refer is that of granting scrip to the 
               <br />
               half-breeds of the North-West. This question has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raised</span> a 
               <br />
               great deal of discussion in the House before. The half- 
               <br />
               breeds in the N orth- West have petitioned to the North- 
               <br />
               West Assembly, and the North-West Assembly has 
               <br />
               petitioned the hon. gentlemen who form the Government of 
               <br />
               this country, that scrip should be granted to the children of 
               <br />
               all halt-breeds who were born before March, 1885. 
               <br />
               They consider that they are justly entitled to it, 
               <br />
               because an arrangement was not made with the half- 
               <br />
               breeds in the North-West until 1885, when scrip was issued 
               <br />
