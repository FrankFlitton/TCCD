               tion on that point. I have never been able to see

               in the Conference and elsewhere I have always

               against sectarian public schools. I am bound to ad-

               the admission of the sectarian principle was there,

               <br />
               fessedly one of the concession from our side that 
               <br />
               had been made to secure this great measure of 
               <br />
               reform. But assuredly I for one have. not the 
               <br />
               slightest hesitation in accepting it as a necessary 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> condition of the scheme of union, and doubly ac-

               opposite, who were the authors of the Bi 1 of 1863. 
               <br />
               But it was urged that though this arrangement 
               <br />
               might- perhaps be fair as regards Upper Canada, it 
               <br />
               was not so as re ards Lower Canada, for there 
               <br />
               were matters of w ich the British population have 
               <br />
               long complained and some amendments to the 
               <br />
               existing School Act were required to secure them 
               <br />
               equal justice. Well, when this point was raised 
               <br />
               gentlemen of all parties in Lower Canada at once 
               <br />
               expressed themselves prepared to treat it in a frank 
               <br />
               and conciliatory manner, with a view to removing 
               <br />
               any injustice that might be shown to exist : and on 
               <br />
               this understanding the educational clause was 
               <br />
               adopted by the Conference.

               One of the ﬁrst acts done by the Local

               has proved satisfactory to the Protestant
