               minority there. which was Protestant at the

               time. was protected in a broad and states- 
               <br />
               manlike manner. At that time. the minority

               was comprised of Protestants for the major-

               <br />
               But things have changed since. In Manitoba

               When such articles are published in the 
               <br />
               public press, is it a wonder that a minority 
               <br />
               so small as this is represented to be by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bic»</span> 
               <br />
               Carthy) should be alarmed and should look 
               <br />
               to this Parliament for protection, protection 
               <br />
               which we are in duty bound to give them ? 
               <br />
               It has been contended that the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, the constitution under 
               <br />
               which we are governed, does not give as 
               <br />
               separate schools. It is true the constitution 
               <br />
               does not impose the system of separate 
               <br />
               schools, but it protects that system where- 
               <br />
               ever- it has existed prior to the entry of a. 
               <br />
               province into Confederation or wherever it 
               <br />
               is afterwards created by the province. 
               <br />
               Therefore. I say that according to the spirit 
               <br />
               of the, constitution such a 'system should 
               <br />
               exist, because the constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protects</span> it 
               <br />
               and, in fact, maintains it and renders it

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unassutilable</span> from the moment it has been
