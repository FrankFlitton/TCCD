               This proclamation was circulated broadcast among 
               <br />
               the people of the Province. In every household, 
               <br />
               in every hamlet, this insidious document found its 
               <br />
               way, to induce them to throw <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁ"</span> their allegiance. 
               <br />
               But they resisted—they resisted at the point of the 
               <br />
               bayonet, which is to be their fate in the next gene— 
               <br />

               <br />
               to their loyalty, we ﬁnd old France itself sending 
               <br />
               out an emissary to beseech them in the name of 
               <br />
               France, in the name of the land they came from, 
               <br />
               in the name of the literature which, he says, makes 
               <br />
               them unworthy citizens, in the name of all that 
               <br />
               is dear to them ; the King of France beseeches the 
               <br />
               people to throw in their allegiance to the American 
               <br />
               colonies. They did not do so, but they drove the 
               <br />
               invaders from the country, with the help of the 
               <br />
               English people. For some twenty years, until 1812, 
               <br />
               they continued quietly to enjoy the blessings of 
               <br />
               peace under the British ﬂag; and if ever their 
               <br />
               loyalty was tested it was in 1812. On that occa- 
               <br />
               sion the peculiarities of the situation were marked. 
               <br />
               England was engaged in a European war and a war

               selves by the side of Great Britain, and by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               I ﬁnd nothing in French Canadian history, since 
               <br />
               their union with Canada, to justify the charge 
               <br />
               that they cannot be considered loyal and worthy 
               <br />

               <br />

               languages will come and go, languages will die, 
               <br />
               and perhaps it may be, in the ﬂight of time, that 
               <br />
               the French Canadian language will disappear 
               <br />
               from this country. But, if is to disappear, 
               <br />
               let it disappear in a way that will be a

               <br />
               not as the outcome of force and violence, but as 
               <br />
               other languages in the past have disappeared. If

               <br />
               their inﬂuence decayed, so their language decayed. 
               <br />
               Sir, the fact that the growth of language, the 
               <br />
               development of language, appears to be an incident 
               <br />
               to a nation’s supremacy, to a nation’s energy, proves 
               <br />
               to my mind, that its existence depends upon the 
               <br />
               people themselves, it does not depend upon 
               <br />
               coercive measures. Sir, I think the very fact 
               <br />
               that there is a diversity of language is not a 
               <br />
               danger, but it is a circumstance that must give 
               <br />
               value to the language itself, as an institution prized 
               <br />
               by a people. They must consider it a prize calcu- 
               <br />
               lated to induce them to redouble their energies 
               <br />
               and their resources in all these directions that will 
               <br />
               make their country great, and with the decline 
               <br />
               of their greatness their language must also decline. 
               <br />
               Therefore if languages have to go down, let them 
               <br />
               go down as they have done in the past—go down 
               <br />
               as nations have gone down. But let them remain 
               <br />
               as incentives to people and to races to develop 
               <br />
               their energies, and, in this light, I conceive that 
               <br />
               diversity of language, instead of being a source of 
               <br />
               weakness, may be made an occasion of great 
               <br />
               national strength, developing, to make an applica- 
               <br />
               tion of the theory, a spirit of emulation amongst 
               <br />
               our French Canadian people, amongst all our people 
               <br />

               inﬂuence that their language may maintain its 
               <br />
               permanency. Entertaining these views I am not 
               <br />
               prepared to consent, as far as my voice goes, to 
               <br />

               Canada. If the hon. gentleman, in introducing 
               <br />
               this measure had limited the Whole case to the 
               <br />
               question involved in the enacting clause of the 
               <br />
               Bill, I think he would have done his cause in— 
               <br />
               ﬁnitely more good than by the manner he has 
               <br />
               adopted, and to a great extent he would have 
               <br />
               avoided much of the bitterness that has been im- 
               <br />
               ported into this country. If I may venture, even 
               <br />
               at this late hour, to read him a bit of advice, it 
               <br />
               would be that, if his motive is, as I am bound to 
               <br />
               assume that it is, the welfare of Canada, then, 
               <br />
               before this debate is closed, and before it is too 
               <br />
               late, let him make clear exactly where he stands 
               <br />
               upon this question, let him make clear any 
               <br />
               ambiguity as to his ulterior object, and deny 
               <br />
               that this is the commencement only of a war 
               <br />
               upon a race that is not entitled to be so treated; 
               <br />
               or admit that it is, as he declares, and seems 
               <br />
               to say, an attempt to obliterate the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage and the French literature from Canada ‘3' 
               <br />
               f so, Mr. Speaker, there should be but one answer 
               <br />
               from the people’s representatives here. We are 
               <br />
               sent here to save the Union, not to destroy it. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman says—and I Wish to give him
