               some extent. For four or ﬁve years it has 
               <br />
               amounted annually to $30,000 or $40,000,

               <br />
               this on the local revenue will not be less 
               <br />
               than perhaps $80,000 or $90,000, which is 
               <br />
               largely derived from a small <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">direct,</span> tax

               which has been placed upon land. But

               - while the total expenditure in 1899 amounted 
               <br />
               to $414,000, and the total .grant from this 
               <br />
               parliament was only $283,000, the explana- 
               <br />
               tion is that in that year the Yukon was 
               <br />
               still to a certain extent within the admin- 
               <br />
               istration of the local authorities of 
               <br />
               the North—west Territories, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,and</span> from the 
               <br />
               Yukon a revenue of about $160,000 was 
               <br />
               obtained. That local revenue enabled the 
               <br />
               North-west government with fair adequacy 
               <br />
               to meet the wants of the country for 
               <br />
               that year. In the year 1900 the grant 
               <br />
               from this parliament was increased to $424,- 
               <br />
               000, and with the local revenue the North- 
               <br />
               west government had $465,000 at their dis- 
               <br />
               posal. For the year 1901 the estimates 
               <br />
               which the North-west government present- 
               <br />
               ed to Ottawa amounted to $600,000. That 
               <br />
               amount, on a close calculation by the North- 
               <br />
               west government was deemed to be neces- 
               <br />
               sary to cover the actual needs of local gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. The grant which they received 
               <br />
               from parliament for that year was only 
               <br />
               $357,000, the same amount as we ﬁnd in 
               <br />
               the present estimates. The local authori- 
               <br />
               ties of the North—west Territories represent- 
               <br />
               ed to the powers at Ottawa that the needs 
               <br />
               -of that country for the year 1901 demanded 
               <br />
               $600,000, and they received only $357,000. 
               <br />
               What was done last year by the local au- 
               <br />
               thority to cover the evident deﬁciency was

               <br />
               December to 31st December following. The 
               <br />
               vote made by this parliament last year was 
               <br />
               intended to cover the period until June 
               <br />
               30th, 1902, but the local g vernment found 
               <br />
               that unless they took the hole vote that 
               <br />
               was made here last year and expended it 
               <br />
               within their calendar year of 1901, they 
               <br />
               could not commence to properly meet the 
               <br />
               needs of the people of that country, the 
               <br />
               cost of education and the cost of necessary 
               <br />
               public works. The position in which the 
               <br />
               North-west government ﬁnds itself to-day 
               <br />
               is, that an ordinary vote does not put them 
               <br />
               in the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position'nas</span> they were in last

               this present calendar year. Suppose we vote

               <br />
               half of it, or a little over $175,000. Now, if

               We had a discussion in the House yester- 
               <br />
               day upon the subject of immigration. It 
               <br />
               is unnecessary for me to say that at the 
               <br />
               present time the population in the whole 
               <br />
               of western Canada is increasing very 
               <br />
               largely. From a national point of view that 
               <br />
               is very encouraging, but from the point of 
               <br />
               view of the local government it is not an 
               <br />
               unmixed blessing to see hundreds of people 
               <br />
               literally pouring into that country daily, 
               <br />
               because ev’ery new settler means an addi- 
               <br />
               tional tax upon the ~ local governing 
               <br />
               authority. It means that increased expendi- 
               <br />
               ture will have to be made upon the con- 
               <br />
               struction of roads and bridges, because the 
               <br />
               greater the number of people in that coun- 
               <br />
               try the greater the area settled, and it was 
               <br />
               found in practice last year that many of the 
               <br />
               new comers went upon areas which had 
               <br />
               not been before that time settled, and thus 
               <br />
               rendered necessary the construction of new 
               <br />
               roads and the building of culverts and 
               <br />
               bridges by the local authorities. Conse- 
               <br />
               quently, the local government of the North- 
               <br />
               west cannot look upon this inﬂux of im- 
               <br />
               migration as an unmixed blessing from their 
               <br />
               point of view ; while from the larger point 
               <br />
               of view it is indeed a very encouraging cir- 
               <br />
               cumstance that immigrants are coming into 
               <br />
               Canada to—day in larger numbers than they 
               <br />
               ever came in any previous time. In fact 
               <br />
               every newspaper one takes hold of from the 
               <br />
               western part of the country is half ﬁlled; 
               <br />
               with accounts of new settlers coming in with 
               <br />
               large quantities of settlers’ effects, bringing 
               <br />
               added riches to the country. I had a note 
               <br />
               a couple of days ago from a gentleman at 
               <br />
               North Portal, who stated that in the pre-
