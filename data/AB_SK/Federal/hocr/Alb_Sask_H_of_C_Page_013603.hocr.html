               are exactly equivalent to the address from 
               <br />
               the Dominion and from the province of

               possibly the argument which the Minister

               of Justice made in that regard may lead 
               <br />
               to a very awkward result if carried as far

               The MINISTER OF JUSTICE. What I

               said was that the legislative supremacy of 
               <br />

               from the constitutional point cf view, that 
               <br />
               the imperial authorities had no right at all 
               <br />

               <br />
               plication of his argument was that when the

               <br />

               perial law and affected our position to that 
               <br />
               extent. I pointed out that addresses from 
               <br />

               to the imperial authorities, if approved by 
               <br />
               the Sovereign, might alter the representa~

               cannot be contradicted, that if it were not

               twentieth provision in subsection four of 
               <br />
               section ﬁfty-one did not affect the position 
               <br />
               of any of the provinces at that time.

               I have looked very carefully into the pro- 
               <br />
               visions of the British North America Act. I 
               <br />
               was at ﬁrst impressed by the opinion of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice that subsection four of 
               <br />
               section ﬁfty-one referred to Canada as it is 
               <br />
               constituted at present, but looking at all the 
               <br />
               surroundings of the Act and having regard 
               <br />
               especially for the opinion cited by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) of Sir 
               <br />
               Henry Strong on the subject. I am con- 
               <br />
               vinced that section ﬁfty-one was not at all 
               <br />
               intended to apply to the provinces or terri~ 
               <br />
               tories to be subsequently admitted. The 
               <br />
               principles which are laid down by Sir Henry 
               <br />
               Strong, I think, apply particularly to that 
               <br />
               clause :—
