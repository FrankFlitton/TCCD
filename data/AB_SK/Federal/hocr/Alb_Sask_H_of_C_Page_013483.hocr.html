               Mr. MARTIN. On this side of the House 
               <br />
               the Franchise Act of the Dominion has been 
               <br />
               very much opposed. It has been opposed 
               <br />
               for this reason. that we do not believe it. 
               <br />
               is right for the Government to appoint an 
               <br />
               otiicer of their own to make up the voters 
               <br />
               list. But let we refer to the protection there 
               <br />
               is under the Franchise Act so far as get- 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:3</span> of the Act provides that the revising 
               <br />
               oiiicer shall on 1st August prepare to com- 
               <br />
               mence to make. his list. He continues to 
               <br />
               make up that list up to 1st October. 1 am 
               <br />
               taking the Act as it is at present: it has 
               <br />
               been changed in regard to time. but there 
               <br />
               has always been an opportunity to add

               them if they are .properly sworn to and 
               <br />

               <br />
               tuency commences to prepare the list. On 
               <br />
               1st October the list is closed. It. is 
               <br />
               immediately printed. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> It is then posted 
               <br />

               <br />
               will take the trouble to go over the list 
               <br />
               and examine it. whether his name is on the 
               <br />
               list. If he ﬁnds that his name is not on 
               <br />
               that list. a reasonable delay is granted in 
               <br />
               order that he. may get his name placed 
               <br />
               there. because after the list has been posted 
               <br />
               the revising ofﬁcer holds the court of re- 
               <br />
               vision. which must be held at least five 
               <br />
               weeks after the closing of the list. Note 
               <br />
               the difference in time. Weeks and months 
               <br />
               in the one case; days. hours and minutes 
               <br />
               in the other. Then any personwhose name 
               <br />
               is not there may put in his appeal. if he 
               <br />
               gets it in within two weeks before the 
               <br />
               day of revision. He goes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> there and 
               <br />
               gives his evidence and after all these 
               <br />
               proceedings have ta ken place the judge gives 
               <br />
               notice that he will make up the list ﬁnally. 
               <br />
               and both parties have a right to be. present. 
               <br />
               So far as time. is concerned. an opportunity 
               <br />
               is given. under the Dominion Franchise Act. 
               <br />
               for both sides’ to be present. and to ﬁnd

               cessary. so far as the Act is concerned. is to 
               <br />
               get some one to put up the lists in two places

               <br />
               the list has been posted in some place. may 
               <br />
               travel ﬁfteen or twenty miles. and he may 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the list has been torn down in the 
               <br />
               meantime. In fact. the enumerator himself 
               <br />
               may tear it down immediately after he. has 
               <br />
               put it up. for there is nothing in the law to 
               <br />
               prevent it. The list having been printed and 
               <br />

               <br />
               there is no possibility of the elector being 
               <br />
               able to get his name placed there. 
               <br />
               In this case what is the provision ? The 
               <br />
               provision is that he could go and ask the 
               <br />
               enumerator to have his name on ; that is all. 
               <br />
               The enumerator is not bound to put his name 
               <br />
               on, and if he does not put his name on the 
               <br />
               unfortunate elector has no means whatever 
               <br />
               of ﬁnding out that it has been left off; ex— 
               <br />
               cept that he goes on polling day, and after 
               <br />
               having driven again ﬁfteen or twenty miles 
               <br />
               he ﬁnds that this enumerator has obeyed 
               <br />
               the instructions he received from those who 
               <br />
               appointed him and has not put his name on
