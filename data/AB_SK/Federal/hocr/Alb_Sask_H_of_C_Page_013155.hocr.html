               <br />
               it is persisted in, events may occur which may 
               <br />
               cause this House to regret its action for many 
               <br />
               years. We have created this Confederation ; we 
               <br />
               have prospered under it. We may have disagreed 
               <br />
               as to the methods of raising money—that is a 
               <br />
               matter of opinion ; nevertheless we have prospered 
               <br />
               under this Constitution. We have large prospects. 
               <br />
               We have become an united people from the Atlantic 
               <br />
               to the Paciﬁc. Up to the time of Confederation 
               <br />
               we did not even know the leading men of other 
               <br />
               Provinces, and they hardly knew more than two 
               <br />
               or three men from our Province. We had no 
               <br />
               intercourse with them ; there were barriers between 
               <br />
               them and us. All these have disappeared. 
               <br />
               Now, men in Halifax call themselves Canadians as 
               <br />
               do the men in British Columbia. I went to British 
               <br />
               Columbia when they were just getting the political 
               <br />
               machine into operation. They were uncertain as 
               <br />
               to the future, and did not know what was coming. 
               <br />
               I went there for the purpose of assuring them ; I 
               <br />
               went there for the purpose of knowing the people 
               <br />
               in the country. I succeeded to this extent, that 
               <br />
               they accepted the new Government with pleasure ; 
               <br />
               they knew there must be something good in it for 
               <br />
               them when they became a member of this great 
               <br />
               Confederation. I hope we will show that good 
               <br />
               feeling among ourselves, that union and harmony 
               <br />
               which will induce our neighbors in Newfoundland 
               <br />
               to unite their fortunes with ours. I hope the time 
               <br />
               Will come when they will do so, and then this great 
               <br />
               Confederation will comprise all British soil from 
               <br />
               the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc. But in order to accom- 
               <br />
               plish this result we must not tyrannise over one 
               <br />
               race or another. Let our neighbors speak the lan- 
               <br />
               guage they think proper. We are all subjects of 
               <br />
               the Queen, and we are equally loyal whether we 
               <br />
               speak one language or another. We do not want 
               <br />
               to change our relations, but we desire to maintain 
               <br />
               British institutions. Our constitution is modelled 
               <br />
               on the constitution of Great Britain. We have the 
               <br />
               same Queen, the same ﬂag, the same aspirations. 
               <br />
               Why, then, should we make a large portion of our 
               <br />

               interest to the French Canadian people that I feel

               <br />
               a silent vote on this matter. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) in introducing this 
               <br />
               Bill, gave a history of the establishment of the 
               <br />
               French language in this country. He quoted from 
               <br />
               old documents, and went as far back as the time 
               <br />
               of the cession of this country to England. He 
               <br />
               might have completed his history by saying that 
               <br />
               this language, which he seeks to wipe out, was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">es</span> 
               <br />
               tablished here two centuries before the time of the 
               <br />
               cession. This language was the language of the 
               <br />
               country in the 16th century. The hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               in speaking of the Treaty of Paris of 1763, told the 
               <br />
               House that this treaty did not contain any pro- 
               <br />
               vision which guaranteed us the use of our language. 
               <br />
               But he has told us that since the cession, we have 
               <br />
               practically enjoyed the use of that language,

               <br />
               different conclusion from them. If we have enjoyed 
               <br />
               those rights for a century, if they have been 
               <br />

               <br />
               have a perfect title. I know the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               does not profess a great deal of love for us. He 
               <br />
               admits that being bound by the treaty we should 
               <br />
               enjoy the rights which were guaranteed to us by 
               <br />
               Great Britain and no more. Very likely if the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman had been employed to assist in 
               <br />
               making the treaty, he would not have granted the 
               <br />
               rights we obtained. He woujd rather have favored 
               <br />
               deportation, and our fate would have been the one 
               <br />
               allotted to the Acadians. Fortunately for us the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman came too late into this world. The 
               <br />
               British Crown thought it their bounden duty to 
               <br />
               deal fairly with us and treat us generously, and it 
               <br />
               was part of their policy to give us the rights to which 
               <br />
               we were fully entitled, for they well knew that 
               <br />
               if they wished to form a nation here, the people 
               <br />
               must be allowed to use their own language. 
               <br />
               In fact, Sir, although the French people were not 
               <br />
               very numerous and were scattered over the country 
               <br />
               it was impossible to govern them without allowing 
               <br />
               them their own language. It is very sure that if 
               <br />
               these rights had been refused to them, the Union 
               <br />
               Jack which now ﬂoats on the Citadel of Quebec 
               <br />
               would have been removed not very lon after the 
               <br />
               cession and the Stars and Stripes Wou d have re- 
               <br />
               placed it. I say, Sir, that although the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man, Mr. McCarthy, said it was a bi mistake on 
               <br />
               their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">part</span> to grant those privileges, yet I maintain 
               <br />
               that from a. British standpoint it was an act of 
               <br />
               wisdom that the British should have done what 
               <br />
               they did. We have enjoyed these rights for over 
               <br />
               a. century, we have grown to be a people of over 
               <br />
