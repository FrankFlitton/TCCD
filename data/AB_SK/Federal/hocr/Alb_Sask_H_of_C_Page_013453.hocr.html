               ritories were organized. . The question then 
               <br />
               sprung up, and I well recollect what took 
               <br />
               place at that time. When Mr. Mackenzie 
               <br />
               introduced the Bill there were no provisions 
               <br />
               in it regarding the question of education. As

               soon as the Premier sat down. Mr. Blake.

               of the Administration. rose and made some 
               <br />
               remarks. Speaking of the general power of 
               <br />
               the Legislature, he went on to say :

               <br />
               regarded it as essential under the circumstances 
               <br />
               of the country, and in view of the deliberation 
               <br />

               should be laid down in the Bill with respect to 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the fact that, as far as we could expect at pre-

               sent, the general character of that population 
               <br />
               would be somewhat analogous to the population of 
               <br />
               Ontario, that there should be some provision in the 
               <br />
               constitution by which they should have conferred 
               <br />
               upon them the same rights and privileges in regard 
               <br />

               ought to be the cardinal principles of the measure.

               This provision was introduced at that time. 
               <br />
               Not a word of dissent was expressed. it 
               <br />
               became the law of the country. and is the

               provision which the hon. gentleman desires 
               <br />
               to remove from the Statute-book. I will 
               <br />
               not discuss with the hon. gentleman hero

               the subject of sepa 'ate schools. There are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> views as to those schools. This 
               <br />
               question does not, however, come up for 
               <br />
               discussion on the ﬂoor of this House to-dny. 
               <br />
               I have noted all the objections brought for- 
               <br />
               ward to the separate school system in the 
               <br />
               North-west. It is alleged that it is very ex- 
               <br />
               pensive, more expensive than the system of 
               <br />
               public schools. So be it—I will not discuss 
               <br />
               the matter with the hon. gentleman. Let 
               <br />
               me, however. observe this, that if the system 
               <br />
               of separate schools is more expensive than 
               <br />
               the system of public schools, the minority 
               <br />
               will suffer, and not the majority, in fact. it 
               <br />
               will be so much worse for the minority ; but 
               <br />
               if the minority are willing to pay that price 
               <br />
               in order to have their own schools and their 
               <br />
               own system of education. why should this 
               <br />
               be a matter of offence. or a subject even of 
               <br />
               objection on the part of the majority ? But 
               <br />
               I will not discuss the question with the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman. and I will not discuss the ob- 
               <br />
               jections he has raised. I ask: is it advis- 
               <br />
               able, let separate schools he objectionable,
