               citizen and separate schools train the youth

               ity which is necessary for true citizenship. 
               <br />
               Therefore. I maintain that children trained

               as those trained in public schools. Another 
               <br />
               point. I am pleased to say that not only 
               <br />
               do we ﬁnd several branches of the Christian 
               <br />
               church to-day denying the right of the state 
               <br />
               directly or indirectly to recognize any church. 
               <br />
               but we ﬁnd many individuals in other religi- 
               <br />
               ons bodies which do not take the same stand. 
               <br />
               stepping out and refusing to accept from the 
               <br />
               state any recognition of churches. I trust 
               <br />
               that it will not be long before all the 
               <br />
               clnu-ches. both Protestant and Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic. will take. the same line. and agree to 
               <br />
               abolish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sepa</span> °ate schools. not only in the 
               <br />
               North-west. but in these provinces. An- 
               <br />
               other point. In separate schools the control 
               <br />
               of the youth is abdicated to the theologians—- 
               <br />
               there is no getting round that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">point—and</span> in 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> the children are brought up not 
               <br />
               to recognize the parental authority and the 
               <br />
               state authority as supreme. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but'to</span> recognize 
               <br />
               the church as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overshadowing</span> both the state 
               <br />
               and the home. and as the great fountain of 
               <br />
               authority. The church to—day has a high 
               <br />
               recognition. owing to the respect we all 
               <br />
               show the clergy. from the position they oc- 
               <br />
               cupy: and if their doctrines are as they 
               <br />
               should be. they should not ask for more. 
               <br />
               They have a certain amount of superstitious 
               <br />
               regard—I do not use the word improperly-— 
               <br />
               tendered to them by people of all denomina- 
               <br />
               tions. so that the utterances from the clergy 
               <br />
               go further. and are received with less criti- 
               <br />
               cism. than the utterances of ordinary citizens. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I maintain that they should not 
               <br />
               ask for any special privilege in relation to 
               <br />
               the schools of this country. on account of 
               <br />
               the position they already hold in the minds 
               <br />
               of the people. Separate schools. Sir. create 
               <br />
               a nation inside of a nation. Before separate 
               <br />
               schools existed in this country the youth of 
               <br />
               all creeds and doctrines were loyal to the 
               <br />
               core; but today we ﬁnd. unfortunately. 
               <br />
               springing up in various localities a spirit 
               <br />
               which looks to the church before it looks to 
               <br />
               the state. In other words. we ﬁnd the ul- 
               <br />
               tramontane spirit growing up in many parts 
               <br />

               <br />
               separate schools, then all must have them. 
               <br />
               The schools of the North-west are wrong, 
               <br />
               even on the basis of sepa -ate schools. for 
               <br />
               they are recognized simply as Protestant and 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic schools. But if one creed 
               <br />
               is entitled to Separate schools, then all are : 
               <br />
               the Methodist, the Presbyterian, the Angli- 
               <br />
               can, the Baptist and all other denominations 
               <br />
               have an equal right to demand them. There- 
               <br />
               fore, I maintain that the present basis for 
               <br />
               separate schools, if separate schools are to 
               <br />
               be recognized. is entirely wrong. I advance 
               <br />
               these arguments to show the absurdity of. the 
               <br />
               whole principle of separate schools. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> Now. 
               <br />
               there is another aspect of this matter. If 
               <br />
               the older provinces seek to force the system 
               <br />
               of separate schools on the North-West <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ter-</span> 
               <br />
               ritories. I feel satisfied that the day is not 
               <br />
               far distant when those territories will be 
               <br />
               peopled with a 'acc that will not tolerate 
               <br />
               separate schools. It does not require much 
               <br />
               of a prophet to foresee that in the near 
               <br />
               future the North—west Territories will have. 
               <br />
               a much more predominant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">impulation</span> than 
               <br />
               they have to-day, and it is well for us in the 
               <br />
               older provinces to consider. if We seek to 
               <br />
               impose separate schools on the people of 
               <br />
               those territories at the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> 
               <br />
               they will not in the near future come down

               here and say : <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> will abolish your separate

               <br />
               is this : Every session in Canada, so long as

               God according to the dictates of his own 
               <br />
               conscience. and that there should be entire 
               <br />
               separation of church and state in all matters. 
               <br />
               and that can only be brought about by 
               <br />
               abolishing all separate schools. Another 
               <br />
               objection to separate schools is this: You 
               <br />
               may remember that the American revolu- 
               <br />
               tionary war was brought about because the 
               <br />
               people were taxed without representation. 
               <br />
               They were free men, and they refused to 
               <br />
               pay taxes without representation. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con.</span> 
               <br />
               trary principle, I maintain. should hold good. 
               <br />
               that no taxation should carry with it no 
               <br />
               representation. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> find. however. that the 
               <br />
               separate schools in Ontario. and also in the 
               <br />
               North-west, are governed by the clergy. and 
               <br />
               the clergy in both Ontario and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Xorth-</span> 
               <br />
               west are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> exempt from taxation. There- 
               <br />
               fore, we ﬁnd a set of men. we may almost

               say a sovereign body. governing without 
               <br />
               being taxed. That principle is wrong. We 
               <br />
               also ﬁnd the other principle in this fact : that 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic people of the country 
               <br />
               are taxed. while they have not their share of
