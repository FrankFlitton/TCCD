               undertaking of the hon. member with regard to 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec ; whereas without us, I do 
               <br />

               <br />
               owes them to the French element, which the hon. 
               <br />
               member ﬁghts against with so much vigor. I do 
               <br />
               not understand how they can require that we 
               <br />
               should be at the same time loyal subjects of Her 
               <br />
               Majesty, and that we should be disloyal towards 
               <br />
               our mother tongue. We must defend it with all 
               <br />
               our powers; it is our right, and it is our duty. 
               <br />
               And I declare that the man who voluntarily 
               <br />
               surrenders his mother tongue, is nota good citizen,

               at this period, these gentlemen raised objections

               conclude. I know that the House is anxious 
               <br />
               to close this debate ; but I was surprised 
               <br />
               at the remarks which some of my colleagues 
               <br />
               speaking the English language made. And I can- 
               <br />
               not pass them over in silence. It has been ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that the hon. the Minister of Public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'orks</span> 
               <br />
               (Sir Hector Langevin), was moderate as respects 
               <br />
               the expressions used in his speech on the present 
               <br />
               question, but it is alleged that he was too vigorous 
               <br />
               in its utterance. I cannot conceive how these 
               <br />
               hon. members can reproach the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works with having testiﬁed by a degree of 
               <br />
               vivacity in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speedy—he,</span> one of the fathers of

               statesman, Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">George</span> Etienne Cartier. I think 
               <br />
               that he would have been wanting in his duty if he 
               <br />
               had not borne witness against the resolution of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe, with some-

               <br />
               me who would blame him for it. It is to my 
               <br />
               knowledge that several of my English colleagues,

               <br />
               which are now being discussed, displayed much

               Mr. DUPONT. The speech of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for West Durham, as well as the other s eakers 
               <br />
               who have spoken in defence of our cause, wi I dwell 
               <br />
               in the shrine of history ; they will serve as lessons 
               <br />
               for our successors in this House, and for our pos- 
               <br />
               terity ; they are founded in reason and on justice, 
               <br />

               acknowledgment ; and you all know, moreover, 
               <br />
               that he is no political friend of mine, I did not, in
