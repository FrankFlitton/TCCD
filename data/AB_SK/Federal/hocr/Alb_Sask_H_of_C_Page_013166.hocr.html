               NOW, the hon. gentleman proposes a half century 
               <br />
               later to try the same experiment in a British colony. 
               <br />
               I do not believe, if his experiment could be carried 
               <br />
               out, that it would be a Whit more successful than 
               <br />
               the experiment of the Dutch King in the United 
               <br />
               Kingdom of the Netherlands. I may say that the 
               <br />
               revocation of 1848 made a great change in the 
               <br />
               treatment of nationalities. They then came to the 
               <br />
               front. States were based on dynastic and class 
               <br />
               interests and paid no regard to race in ﬁxing terri- 
               <br />
               torial boundaries. But since 1848, no attempt 
               <br />
               has been made to mould different races into 
               <br />
               one except in Austria, and she fell into line 
               <br />
               after disasters of Sadowa. About thirteen years 
               <br />
               ago this clause of the Bill which the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman proposes to repeal, was introduced for 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time. The opinion I then expressed, I 
               <br />
               think, is an opinion that ought to have some force 
               <br />
               to-day. Of course, it is only a question of time 
               <br />
               with regard to the matter, because it is one about 
               <br />
               which thepeople of the North-VVest Territories must 
               <br />
               legislate when they become a Province. The pre- 
               <br />
               sent assembly of the North-VVest is not a constitu- 
               <br />
               ent assembly, it is simply a legislative assembly. 
               <br />
               It has no power to alter the constitution under 
               <br />
               Which it carries on the limited amount of legisla- 
               <br />
               tion that it may at present accomplish. But I 
               <br />
               could not help observing that the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Muskoka (Mr. O’Brien), instead of referring to the 
               <br />
               members from that territory in this House to ascer- 
               <br />
               tain the opinion of the country upon this subject, 
               <br />
               refers to the opinion of a Legislative Assembly in 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-V’i'est</span> Territories who have no power to 
               <br />
               deal with the question at all. Now I think that 
               <br />
               in many of these things the people must be 
               <br />
               assumed to be qualiﬁed to exercise the powers of 
               <br />
               self-government. They may go astray. I do not 
               <br />
               always approve what has been done in this House. 
               <br />
               I do not often agree with the policy of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the Treasury benches, but I do not on 
               <br />
               that account deny the right of the people of this 
               <br />
               country to self— overnment. My own opinion is 
               <br />
               that if we regar this question as a matter of con- 
               <br />
               venience, there ought to be no great diﬁiculty in 
               <br />
               dealing with it. We are seeking to settle that coun- 
               <br />
               try, we are seeking to secure immigration into that 
               <br />
               country. Hon. gentlemen on the Treasury benches 
               <br />
               occasionally issue pamphlets printed in Scandina— 
               <br />
               vian, in German, in French, for circulation upon 
               <br />
               the continent of Europe to invite people to settle 
               <br />
               there. The hon. member for Muskoka and the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Simcoe vote an appropriation for 
               <br />
               the purpose of bearing the expense of printing, 
               <br />
               translating and publishing these pamphlets. I 
               <br />
               would like to know whether those hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               say that you have a right to publish a pamphlet 
               <br />
               in Scandinavian and send it to the other side 
               <br />
               of the Atlantic for those people to read to 
               <br />
               induce them to come here, but that you have no 
               <br />
               right whatever to give them anything Scandinavian 
               <br />
               to read after they arrive in this country. Now, let 
               <br />
               me suppose that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> there are 20,000 Norweg-

               to carry on their business when they do not know 
               <br />

               <br />
               keep quiet, or are they going to speak privately to

               some one who understands English and have their

               gether, that the one readily absorbs the other. You

               may provide that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> shall not be a continuous

               <br />
               those who speak English, if you think that is the 
               <br />
               proper course to adopt. If there is a French popula- 
               <br />
               tion in the North~VVest diffused through the English 
               <br />
               speaking population, and they are in the minority, 
               <br />
               it- is impossible but that they will learn to under- 
               <br />
               stand each other. If you have several thousand 
               <br />
               peoplefrom the Province of Quebec speaking French 
               <br />
               and knowing nothing else, forming distinct colonies 
               <br />
               or settlements, it would be a matter of conven- 
               <br />
               ience to translate your public documents, and 
               <br />
               for your public proceedings in that locality to 
               <br />
               be conducted in French, and I do not believe that 
               <br />
               you delay the general use of the English language 
               <br />
               by one hour by adopting that policy. I do not see 
               <br />
               how you can, for it is the private and unofﬁcial use 
               <br />
               that determines the general use of the language. 
               <br />
               Now, the hon. gentleman knows that he has not 
               <br />
               taken even the ﬁrst step towards the unity of the 
               <br />
               population of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> from a linguistic 
               <br />
               point of view, by simply providing for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official</span> 
               <br />
               use of the English. The hon. gentleman, if he 
               <br />
               does anything, must go further, and he must pro- 
               <br />
               hibit the introduction of French books, and the 
               <br />
               circulation of French newspapers, the use in the 
               <br />
               schools public and private, he must prohibit the 
               <br />
               use in the pulpit, he must prohibit the use every- 
               <br />
               where, of the French language, or his interference 
               <br />
               is an ineffective and an impertinent interference. 
               <br />
               If the hon. gentleman is not prepared for that, then 
               <br />
               he had better leave the laws of society— those 
               <br />
               forces of which I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spoken—which,</span> after all 
               <br />
               govern these things, to operate freely in the way in 
               <br />
               which they operate most effectively. In my opinion, 
               <br />
               the question of the use of a language, or of more than 
               <br />
               one language, in a territory, depends entirely upon 
               <br />
               whether you have a mixed population or whether 
               <br />
               you have settlements separate and distinct from 
               <br />
               each other," and it seems to me that you have in the 
               <br />
               North—West Territories, no expression of opinion 
               <br />
               upon that question which would warrant legislation 
               <br />
               such as the hon. member for North Simcoe pro- 
               <br />
               poses. I think the question should be determined 
               <br />
               on the lines and according to the principles which 
               <br />
               I have mentioned. Now, Sir, I may say this : The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has delivered several speeches on 
               <br />
               this subject outside the House, and one in it. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that his labors have produced conﬂict of 
               <br />
               race, and I may go further and say, conflict of 
               <br />
               religion as well. . It is possible that a section of 
               <br />
               the population sympathises with the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in the object with which he has set out; it is 
               <br />
               possible to break 11 the union, to repel immigra- 
               <br />
               tion, to delay sett ement. It is possible to make 
               <br />
               here geographical parties and so prevent the people 
               <br />
               of this country from acting in political unison ; 
               <br />
