               I call attention to this state of things to show that 
               <br />
               the arguments then used were on a par and almost 
               <br />
               the same as those now used by the promoter of this 
               <br />
               Bill and by the hon. member for North Norfolk 
               <br />
               (Mr. Charlton). One could almost imagine, in 
               <br />
               listening to the speeches of these hon. gentlemen, 
               <br />
               that time had retraced its course, and we were 
               <br />
               back again in the old days when the Hon. George 
               <br />
               BrOwn led the Liberal party and the Toronto Globe 
               <br />
               trotted out the Protestant horse. To remedy the 
               <br />
               state of affairs which then existed and the intensity 
               <br />
               of which is shown by the Globe, Confederation was 
               <br />
               brought about, and these vexed questions were 
               <br />
               settled by the British North America Act, in the 
               <br />
               way I have pointed out. As I again repeat it, it was 
               <br />
               necessary then to put those vexed questions out of 
               <br />
               the arena of both local and Dominion politics, and 
               <br />
               it was considered that by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act they were laid at rest forever. To- 
               <br />
               day, however, a revival of the same discussions 
               <br />
               will bring about the same results that were brought 
               <br />
               about then. I would ask who received credit at 
               <br />
               the hands of the people of this country? Was it 
               <br />
               those who were engaged in the discussion of this 
               <br />
               question on the lines laid down by the Toronto 
               <br />
               Globe, or those who resisted the prejudices that 
               <br />
               were sought to be excited by the party whose 
               <br />
               views that organ represented ? Those who received 
               <br />
               credit at the hands of the people were not those 
               <br />
               who raised the issues such as are being raised to- 
               <br />
               day by the hon. member for North Simcoe and the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Norfolk, but they were 
               <br />
               those who resisted the prejudices and the appeals to 
               <br />

               tleman who leads this House. We ﬁnd him in those

               discussions always resisting the party of prejudice ; 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd him, from 1851 down to Confederation, in 
               <br />

               ment. We have found since Confederation down 
               <br />
               to the present time that he has been at the head of 
               <br />

               <br />
               twenty-three which have elapsed since then. This 
               <br />
               shows that the sound common sense of the people 
               <br />
               gave credit to him and the others who resisted 
               <br />
               these appeals to public passion and these appeals

               <br />

               <br />
               by the promoter of this Bill ; and I venture to 
               <br />
               predict that, perhaps not for six months or a year 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mbecause</span> these strong and loud appeals which are

               <br />
               who are promoting the measure, to the prejudices 
               <br />
               of the people, must run a certain course—but I say 
               <br />
               in the long run those who will resist that wave of 
               <br />
               fanatiscism and the appeals made to prejudice, are 
               <br />
               the ones who will represent the great body of the 
               <br />
               electorate just as those who resisted similar appeals 
               <br />
               in the past have represented them from 1851 down to 
               <br />
               the present time. I was sorry to hear the leader of 
               <br />
               the Opposition, in the beginning of his beautiful ad- 
               <br />
               dress this afternoon, try to make political capital 
               <br />
               out of this question, but history shows that the party 
               <br />
               who resisted these prejudices in the past and the 
               <br />
               party which resists them now is after all the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party. To-day, however, different from 
               <br />
               the past, we must give credit to some mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the Liberal party who have joined with us 
               <br />
               in opposing this fanatical crusade ; but the fact re- 
               <br />
               mains unchanged, that, in the past, it was the Con- 
               <br />
               servatives who resisted these inﬂuences to a much 
               <br />
               larger extent than did the Liberal party. From 
               <br />
               Confederation down to the present, there has been 
               <br />
               relative peace in this country. And Why “.7 
               <br />
               Because these disquieting questions were set at rest 
               <br />
               by the British North America Act, but unfortun- 
               <br />
               ately they were not settled, in so far as the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories are concerned, and, therefore, it is 
               <br />
               that they are being brought to the front again, and 
               <br />
               the attack is made on the only vulnerable and assail- 
               <br />
               able part which is left. But I will call the attention 
               <br />
               of the House to this fact, that the British North 
               <br />
               America Act of 1871 provides that while we are 
               <br />
               at liberty to make laws and constitution for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> Territories, yet when once those laws 
               <br />
               are made by this Parliament, those laws have the 
               <br />
               same force as the British North America Act itself. 
               <br />
               I will read the section. Section 6 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, chapter 28, reads as follows :— 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               “ Except as provided by the third section of this Act,it 
               <br />
               shall not be competent for the Parliament of Canada to

               alter the provisions of the last mentioned Act of the said

               This is the point I wish to make—that this Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment has the power to make laws and a constitution 
               <br />
               for the North-West Territories and to divide the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Territories into Provinces. Down to this 
               <br />
               time it has not been thought advisable to divide the 
               <br />
               N orth-VVest Territories into Provinces, perhaps 
               <br />
               because the population has not been sufﬁciently 
               <br />
               numerous, but the time will come, and it may not be
