               Mr. DEWDNEY moved for leave to introduce Bill (N o. 136) 
               <br />
               to consolidate and amend the North-West Territories Acts. 
               <br />
               He said: This Bill preposes to consolidate the three Acts 
               <br />
               on our Statute-book in reference to the North West <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terri‘</span> 
               <br />
               tories, chapter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{)0</span> of the Revised Statutes, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">short</span> Act 
               <br />
               passed in 1887, and the Act of last Session constituting the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> Assembly for the Territories. The Bill is 
               <br />
               substantially for the consolidation of the present law, and 
               <br />
               proposes to give enlarged powers to the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly. That is the principal amendment. There is 
               <br />
               also an amendment giving the Legislative Assembly power 
               <br />
               to deal with the question of the sale of liquor to the same

               introduction of such a Bill at this period. The hon. gentle-

               man cannot expect the House now to go into the subject of 
               <br />
               consolidation. If there are urgent amendments required in 
               <br />
               the North-West Territories, I am not prepared to say that 
               <br />
               we should not grant these amendments, but it is impossible 
               <br />
               at this late period to give the Bill the hen. gentleman pro-

               this side of the House is concerned, we will not consent to

               legislation of this kind at present.

               at this time of the Session to take up an Act consolidating
