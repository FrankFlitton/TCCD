               <br />
               now on hand from purely conscientious motives. 
               <br />
               I believe myself that he has done so on his own 
               <br />
               responsibility, and I, for one, think, as the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Northumberland (Mr. Mitchell) 
               <br />
               thought, that any man who occupies the position 
               <br />
               he did when he took this stand is a man of whom 
               <br />
               his country should be proud. I do not agree with 
               <br />
               everything that hon. gentleman has said, I do not 
               <br />
               agree with the Bill he has introduced, but I believe 
               <br />
               he has taken this course from purely conscientious 
               <br />
               motives. If that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon,</span> gentleman had the same 
               <br />
               ground to go over again I believe he would very 
               <br />
               likely have introduced his Bill without this pre— 
               <br />
               amble, which appears to have been unfortunate, 
               <br />
               and not in sympathy with the opinions of the 
               <br />
               majority of the members of this House. I believe 
               <br />
               also that if he had again to make the speech which 
               <br />
               he delivered in introducing this Bill he would be 
               <br />
               more moderate in his tone. But I do not believe 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman, as he stated himself, 
               <br />
               intended to hurt the feelings of any member of 
               <br />
               this House. I do think that the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               spoke rather intemperately in his ﬁrst speech, but 
               <br />
               no one can complain of the manner in which he 
               <br />
               responded to the venemous attacks made on him 
               <br />
               during the last ﬁve days of this debate. There are 
               <br />
               one or two remarks in the speech of the hon. 
               <br />
               member to which I would like to refer. He 
               <br />
               stated that the Lieutenant Governor of the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’est</span> Territories in opening the session of the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly the year before last, made 
               <br />
               a mistake in that he read his speech in French, 
               <br />
               which had never been done before. If any one can 
               <br />
               give a reason why that speech was not previously 
               <br />
               read in French I am in a position to do it. As 
               <br />
               Lieutenant Governor I opened the Assembly for 
               <br />
               the seven years previous to that, and I can give 
               <br />
               him the reason why I did not read the speech in 
               <br />
               French. Unfortunately I was not able to read the 
               <br />
               French language sufﬁciently well to warrant me in 
               <br />
               doing so. If I had undertaken that task I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that my audience would not know whether 
               <br />
               I was speaking in Blackfoot, Cree, or French, and 
               <br />
               Ithought it better to leave it alone. In my opinion 
               <br />
               Where the Lieutenant Governor made a mistake 
               <br />
               was, when last year he met his council and did not 
               <br />
               read his speech in French. The reason given by 
               <br />
               the member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) for this 
               <br />
               was that it had been reported that if the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor attempted to read his speech in French 
               <br />
               members of the Assembly would have left the build— 
               <br />
               ing. If I had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lieutenant</span> Governor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at,</span> that 
               <br />
               time I would have read that speech in French if I 
               <br />
               had to read it to my clerk and to empty chairs. 
               <br />
               It was his duty to do so and a man should never 
               <br />
               neglect that. I know every one of the representa- 
               <br />
               tives of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest</span> Assembly personally, and 
               <br />
               I can hardly believe there could be any foundation 
               <br />
               for that report. If the Lieutenant Governor had 
               <br />
               read his speech I do not believe there would 
               <br />
               have been any excitement, and if any members 
               <br />
               of the House left their seats for that reason they 
               <br />
               would not be ﬁt to represent the people who sent 
               <br />
               them to the Legislature. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) also spoke of 
               <br />
               the Lieutenant Governor getting a translator to 
               <br />
               translate the ordinances which he states created 
               <br />
               some dissatisfaction. When I was Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor the clerk of my council was a French 
               <br />
               Mr. DEWDNEY.

               this gentleman was transferred to the Indian

               Department, and the present clerk, not being a 
               <br />
               very good French scholar, is unable to do the 
               <br />
               translation. Any gentleman who knows anything 
               <br />
               of the translation of French in connection with 
               <br />
               legal work knows that a man must have a legal 
               <br />
               mind and legal experience before he can make a 
               <br />
               fair translation of such documents. Therefore the 
               <br />
               Governor had to take up some man to do the 
               <br />
               translation for him. The hon. member for West 
               <br />
               Durham (Mr. Blake) when he addressed the House 
               <br />
               the other evening referred to the spark which is 
               <br />
               liable to break out into a great blaze. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman might have gone a little further 
               <br />
               in his comparaison. If he had lived in a 
               <br />
               wooden, mossy country as I have, he would 
               <br />
               have seen that on many occasions when it was 
               <br />
               thought the ﬁre was out a small spark still re- 
               <br />
               mained working gradually and surely under the 
               <br />
               surface and when fanned by a slight breeze breaks 
               <br />
               out again and creates a conﬂagration greater than 
               <br />
               the original one. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> I want to see done in the 
               <br />
               present instance is some measure taken by this 
               <br />
               House which will extinguish the spark forever. I 
               <br />
               believe that the amendment proposed by my hon. 
               <br />
               colleague the Minister of Justice will effect that 
               <br />
               object and will be satisfactory to the people of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test.</span> I am quite certain that what the 
               <br />
               people up there require is peace and prosperity.

               <br />
               If this House can settle the question in the manner

               Mr. MASSON. At this late hour in the even- 
               <br />
               ing, and at this late stage of the debate, I would 
               <br />
               not take up the time of the House in speaking on 
               <br />
               this subject were it not that I consider it a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of very great importance, and were it not also 
               <br />
               for the fact that it has taken such a very wide 
               <br />
               and varied range. I consider it important, as a 
               <br />
               subject likely to affect the peace and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosper~</span> 
               <br />
               ity, yea, even the existence of this Dominion. It 
               <br />
               is true that the Act before the House is a very 
               <br />
               brief one, but it is also one that has a very wide 
               <br />
               scope. Especially is this Bill important when we 
               <br />
               consider it in connection with the preamble by 
               <br />
               which it is prefaced, and interpret that preamble 
               <br />
               by the speeches, made not only in this House but 
               <br />
               in different parts of the country during recess, by

               <br />
               what some hon. gentlemen say it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">does~a</span> de~ 
               <br />
               claration that the French language should be 
               <br />
               obliterated, and that we should have only one 
               <br />
               language throughout the whole Dominion, 
               <br />
               in this House, and inall the Provinces of this Domi~ 
               <br />
               nion; but if it does not mean that, I would 
               <br />
               ask, what does it mean? If it does not mean that, 
               <br />
               is it ambiguous? If it is ambiguous, read it inthe 
               <br />
               light of the speeches made by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               during the recess, and we can ﬁnd no ambiguity 
               <br />
               about it. The hon. gentleman in one of his speeches 
               <br />
               stated in emphatic words that he would not rest 
               <br />
               until the French <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘lan</span> age was stamped out. He 
               <br />
               admitted that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had:</span> great work in hand, but 
               <br />
               he said : “Let us begin with that which seems
