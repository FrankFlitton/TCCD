               and the people of Canada will not permit a few 
               <br />
               fanatical men in Quebec or Ontario to bring about 
               <br />
               so undesirable a result. Somebody has stated that 
               <br />
               the French and the English dislike each other. I 
               <br />
               deny it. The two races on the contrary like each 
               <br />
               other, and I know that in my part of the country, 
               <br />
               we would not part with our French compatriots, 
               <br />
               even if we could. We all recollect what happened 
               <br />
               a few years ago, when a great rebellion took place 
               <br />
               in the North-VVest. We remember when feel- 
               <br />
               ing ran high throughout the whole length 
               <br />
               and breadth of the land. Was there any 
               <br />
               division between the French, English and Irish 
               <br />
               then ‘3 No ; not one soldier faltered. Every 
               <br />
               Canadian, whether English, Irish or French, was 
               <br />
               ready to go forward to put down the rebellion and 
               <br />
               to protect the laws. Some histories tell us that 
               <br />
               at the battle of Marathon a light ran along the 
               <br />
               Grecian spears when the Greeks saw the enemy, 
               <br />
               and that at the battle of Salamis a light shone on 
               <br />
               the masts of the Grecian ships. So it was with the 
               <br />
               patriotic sentiments which animated our people 
               <br />
               then. A friend of mine, Major Joshua Wright, 
               <br />
               who travelled with the 65th Battalion, told me that 
               <br />
               braver soldiers and more patriotic men could not be 
               <br />
               found in the world. They vindicated the honor 
               <br />
               and glory of their country, and so it was with the 
               <br />
               people of every race throughout that awful time. 
               <br />
               And is there no word to be said for these few un— 
               <br />
               happy men, these hunters of the plains, who ani- 
               <br />
               mated by their native gallantry and believing they 
               <br />
               were injured, deceived as they were by an ignorant 
               <br />
               man who preyed upon their feelings, went down 
               <br />
               into these riﬂe pits and faced death as calmly and 
               <br />
               as bravely as ever men did? Is there not one 
               <br />
               word for these hunters who were swept away by 
               <br />

               <br />

               pleasure in the general expression which has been 
               <br />

               this House to an assertion made the other after- 
               <br />
               noon by the hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. 
               <br />
               Charlton), when he was urging to this House how 
               <br />
               well it would be for this Dominion to follow the 
               <br />
               example of the United States and their mode of 
               <br />
               dealing with the languages of the people in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> territories they acquire. _He told us that 
               <br />
               in the colonisation of Louisiana the United States 
               <br />
               of America had simply held out to that country to 
               <br />
               come with them and partake of the institutions of 
               <br />
               the United States as they existed, and that they 
               <br />
               would make no concessions to them as to their 
               <br />
               language. He told us the same applied to Florida, 
               <br />
               Texas, and I believe Mexico. I have looked at the 
               <br />
               constitution of Louisiana and what do I ﬁnd ? If 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman is as incorrect in all his other 
               <br />
               assertions as he is in reference to Louisiana then I 
               <br />
               say that no credence can be attached to his state- 
               <br />
               ments, for I think that he did not take the trouble 
               <br />
               of looking up the facts before he made the statement 
               <br />
               to this House. I ﬁnd that in the Revised Statutes 
               <br />
               of Louisiana down to 1856 a constitutional provision 
               <br />
               of the General Assembly, section 101, says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ The Secretary ofthe Senate and House of Re <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resents.-</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               French or English language.” 
               <br />
               Now, if I read aright the constitution of our Domi- 
               <br />
               nion, they went farther in Louisiana, in relation 
               <br />
               to the French language, than we do in the Domi- 
               <br />
               nion; for not only do they give the privilege of 
               <br />
               using the two languages in Parliament, but they 
               <br />
               require that the Secretary of the Senate and the 
               <br />
               Clerk of the House of Representatives should be 
               <br />
               conversant with both languages. Article 129 of the 
               <br />
               same constitution says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “The constitution and the laws of the State shall be 
               <br />
               promulgated in the English and French languages.” 
               <br />
               And that continues down to 1856. I repeat that 
               <br />
               if the hon. gentleman is as incorrect in the other 
               <br />
               statements he made as he is with reference to 
               <br />
               Louisiana, he did not take the trouble to inform 
               <br />
               himself. We were told to-day, Sir, by some gentle- 
               <br />
               man who addressed this House, that the true prin- 
               <br />
               ciple is to leave this question to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—VVest</span> 
               <br />
               Territories or to the Council. As an humble member 
               <br />
               of this House I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span> to make some sacriﬁce 
               <br />
               of my opinion in order to join the majority of this 
               <br />
               House for the purpose of securing peace and pros- 
               <br />
               perity and establishing our unity on a solid basis, 
               <br />
               but I cannot conceal the fact that my opinion is in ' 
               <br />
               an entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> direction from theirs. I believe 
               <br />
               we ought, in this Parliament, to retain the power 
               <br />
               invested in us and deal with this difﬁcult question

               of education and languages. We have done so 
               <br />
               in regard to the other Provinces, and why should 
               <br />
               we not do so in the North-West Territories? 
               <br />
               The principles laid down by the constitution 
               <br />
               and laws of this Dominion since 1867 all 
               <br />
               point in the direction in which I speak, namely, 
               <br />
               that these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficult,</span> delicate, disquieting questions 
               <br />
               the Parliament of Canada has retained the power 
               <br />
               to deal with. I do not believe it would be right to 
               <br />
               leave the Council of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Yest</span> Territories a. 
               <br />
               question so difﬁcult of solution. If a majority of 
               <br />
               this Parliament believe that it is not in the interests 
               <br />
               of the North-VVest Territories to have the use of 
               <br />
               both languages, then I say that this Parliament 
               <br />
