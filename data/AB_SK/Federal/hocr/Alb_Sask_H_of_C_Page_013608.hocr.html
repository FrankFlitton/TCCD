               Now, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that 
               <br />
               these speeches in the House of Represen- 
               <br />
               tatives of Prince Edward Island show very 
               <br />
               clearly that the principle of representation 
               <br />
               by population was not accepted by the legis- 
               <br />
               lature of that island. She contended that 
               <br />
               special terms should be conceded to her, 
               <br />
               that she should enter with six members, 
               <br />
               and as a matter of fact, I have pointed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out‘</span> 
               <br />
               that Prince Edward Island remained out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>

               basis of population at that time, under the;

               general terms, got by dividing sixty-ﬁve into‘ 
               <br />
               the population of Quebec, we get the unit 
               <br />
               18,330, and by dividing this into the popu- 
               <br />
               lation of Prince Edward Island we get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁve,</span> 
               <br />
               and a fraction, 4,207. Thus, on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">basis]</span> 
               <br />
               of population, we were only entitled to ﬁve

               members. But there is no sense or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason\</span> 
               <br />
               in the clause for giving us six unless six 
               <br />
               as a status. For any other construction 
               <br />
               would be ridiculous, after stopping out ten 
               <br />
               years, and knowing that the next census 
               <br />
               would deprive us of one, if the representa- 
               <br />
               tion was to be by population under the 
               <br />

               Our contention simply was this: We

               This, in my opinion, can only refer to 
               <br />
               an increase of population in the event of 
               <br />
               our population increasing more rapidly than 
               <br />
               Quebec, and from the foregoing no other 
               <br />
               construction seems applicable, or in the 
               <br />
               case of a reduction of our population below 
               <br />
               the population we had on entering the union. 
               <br />
               This construction is also strengthened by the 
               <br />
               cases of British Columbia and Manitoba, 
               <br />
               both coming in after confederation and 
               <br />
               upon special terms. British Columbia came 
               <br />
               in in 1879, having a population of 10,586, 
               <br />
               which would give her under the general 
               <br />
               terms one member, yet she was given six. 
               <br />
               The clause reads as follows:
