               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Territories. The 
               <br />
               majority constitutes its school and then the 
               <br />
               minority, whether Protestant or Catholic, has a 
               <br />
               separate school. This system <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differs</span> from the 
               <br />
               system prevailing in Ontario in this way, that in 
               <br />
               Ontario we have the public schools, which are the 
               <br />
               general schools, and then we have the separate 
               <br />
               schools which are the schools of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority. But in the North-W'est Territories the 
               <br />
               law is the same as in the Province of Quebec, I 
               <br />
               believe; at all events, it is that the majority 
               <br />
               having formed their school, the minority, whether 
               <br />
               Protestant or Catholic, are then entitled to form 
               <br />
               theirs. So that there are in most of the districts 
               <br />
               two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools—the</span> school of the majority, whether 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic or Protestant, and that of the 
               <br />
               minority. The intention of our Constitution is to 
               <br />
               give the Local Assemblies absolute and com- 
               <br />
               plete control over education. That is the scheme 
               <br />
               of our Constitution. In the cases of Quebec 
               <br />
               and Ontario, special restrictions were imposed 
               <br />
               011 both these Provinces; but in all the other 
               <br />
               Provinces of the Dominion there is no restriction 
               <br />
               whatever, and the question is left to be settled by 
               <br />
               the local authorities, who are the most competent 
               <br />
               to deal with it. I propose to ask the Committee, 
               <br />
               when this Bill is in committee, to place the 
               <br />
               law in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“'est</span> Territories exactly in that 
               <br />
               position. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“"</span> hen this law was passed, it was said 
               <br />
               there were only ﬁve hundred people in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories. It was passed, so far as the 
               <br />
               Senate was concerned, in opposition to a very 
               <br />
               large number of Senators. I have here the debate 
               <br />
               on the subject, and I ﬁnd that this clause of the 
               <br />
               Bill was only carried by a majority of two, it hav— 
               <br />
               ing been opposed on a motion made by Senator 
               <br />
               Aikins and strongly supported by the Hon. 
               <br />
               George Brown. The late Mr. Brown opposed it 
               <br />
               on the ground that it was contrary to the spirit of 
               <br />
               the Constitution, as the British North America 
               <br />
               Act gave the matter of education absolutely to the 
               <br />
               Provinces, and that, as at that time, the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Vest</span> Territories were being endowed with certain 
               <br />
               powers, the power should be given to them of 
               <br />
               dealing with this question. Mr. Brown spoke, 
               <br />
               according to the ofﬁcial reports of the Senate, as 
               <br />
               follows :— 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘f</span> He held this provision was uite contrary to the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. Not ing was more clear 
               <br />
               that each Provmce should have absolute control over 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">education.</span> He held that was the only principle on which 
               <br />
               the Union Act could be continued. If the Dominion 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> interfered in local matters we would get 
               <br />
               into inextricable confusion with the Provinces. The 
               <br />
               safe way for us was to let each Province suit itself in this 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter.</span> The country was ﬁlled with people of all classes 
               <br />
               and creeds, and there would be no end to confusion if each 
               <br />
               class had to have its own peculiar school system. It had 
               <br />
               been said this clause was ut in for the protection of the 
               <br />
               Protestants against the atholics, the latter being the 
               <br />
               most numerous. But he, speaking for the Protestants, 
               <br />
               was in a position to say that we did not want that pro— 
               <br />
               tection. In this case, it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> that the national 
               <br />
               machinery should be used for the imposition and collec-

               <br />

               members coming from New Brunswick that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               ing the ordinary public schools, they are suffering 
               <br />
               any great wrong. We know that in the Province 
               <br />
               of Ontario, in many places, all classes of religion 
               <br />
               attend the public schools. I know of one place in 
               <br />
               my own riding where the Roman Catholics have 
               <br />
               always refused to have separate schools, although 
               <br />
               they are a very large body in that particular town- 
               <br />
               ship. They are quite content, rather more 
               <br />
               than content, to send their children to the 
               <br />
               public schools, conﬁdent that by joining 
               <br />
               with the others they would get a much better 
               <br />
               education than by dividing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span> into two 
               <br />
               smaller bodies. The suggestions, therefore, which 
               <br />
               were made in the Senate in support of this clause 
               <br />
               of the Bill, experience has shown to be not war- 
               <br />
               ranted by the results. It is urged that this 
               <br />
               and kindred questions should not be dealt with 
               <br />
               until after the next elections, and I propose to 
               <br />
               move an amendment in that sense. The Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly has unanimously petitioned that the

               <br />
               any doubt about the propriety of asking the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-Wiest</span> Assembly to deal with this questlon at 
               <br />
               present, I am quite willing to yield to that doubt, 
               <br />
               because a year or two cannot make any great 
               <br />
               difference. Therefore, I propose to move in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Com:</span> 
               <br />
               mittee that after the next election they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall‘have</span>

               power to deal with this subject of education in an

               unrestricted manner.

               Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD. I regret I was 
               <br />
               not able to be present during the previous part of 
               <br />
               this debate, and that I had not the advantage Of 
               <br />
               hearing all the argument of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe. This Bill, however, does not pretend 
               <br />
               in any way to be either a consolidation of the laws 
               <br />
               respecting the North-VVest Territories or to make 
               <br />
               any substantial amendments, except to remove the

               clause dealing with education and leaving t0 a

               future Parliament the discussion of the Whole

               that, in a very few years, the population there 
               <br />
               will be such as to call for the division of the 
               <br />
               Territories into Provinces. Then I have no doubt 
               <br />
               a constitution will be adopted similar in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">substance</span> 
               <br />
