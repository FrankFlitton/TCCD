               land said that English alone should be used, 
               <br />
               the then Parliament of Canada passed a law 
               <br />
               to say that everything connected with the laws 
               <br />
               of the country would be translated into French. 
               <br />
               We see, therefore, that notwithstanding the 
               <br />
               English law, the French language was used in 
               <br />
               Parliament by the members, was used in the trans— 
               <br />
               lation of the laws of the country, and in 1844, or 
               <br />
               a few years afterwards, a petition was sent to the 
               <br />
               Queen in England, praying that that portion of 
               <br />
               the Union Act, which prevented the French 
               <br />
               language being used legally in Parliament, should 
               <br />
               be abrogated. That petition was granted, and the 
               <br />
               men of that day were patriotic enough, were just 
               <br />
               enough, and were liberal enough to pass a law 
               <br />
               unanimously giving that right to their fellow—sub- 
               <br />
               jects, the French Canadians. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) goes on and says that the only 
               <br />
               time when the Parliament of England permitted 
               <br />
               or allowed the use of both languages was in the 
               <br />
               Confederation Act of 1867. I am proud, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, to think and to know that I was one of 
               <br />
               the Fathers of that Confederation Act, and that I 
               <br />
               used the little inﬂuence I had with my colleagues 
               <br />
               and with the Government of England, when we 
               <br />
               were sent there as the representatives of Canada, 
               <br />
               to secure that that clause should be inserted in the 
               <br />
               Act of Confederation. It was inserted so that we, 
               <br />
               the French Canadians of this country, should have 
               <br />
               the same rights in that respect as our friends and 
               <br />
               fellow-countrymen, and that we could use the 
               <br />
               French language in Parliament, as you, the English 
               <br />
               speaking members, can use your own language. 
               <br />
               Does not the hon. gentleman now see that La 
               <br />

               <br />

               speech in French, but I know that I would not 
               <br />
               be understood by all members of this House, 
               <br />
               and I wish to be understood by them all. 
               <br />
               I wish them to understand that I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speakingr</span> this

               <br />
               my countrymen as well. If we wish to be one

               people, if we wish to be a nation, we should do 
               <br />
               what has been done in the three kingdoms. You 
               <br />

               <br />
               in the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ; but 
               <br />
               how many languages are spoken under the shadow 
               <br />
               of the great and noble ﬂag of England ‘3 It is the 
               <br />
               glory and the joy of the British Empire that all

               nationalities are welcome under that glorious ﬂag, 
               <br />
               and that it covers and protects them all. I 
               <br />
               remember reading in the history of my family of

               <br />

               <br />
               Colonel (afterwards General) Washington, and was 
               <br />
               kept there chained within his cell. But he escaped

               should ﬁght for his new Sovereign as he had fought 
               <br />
               for his old Sovereign the King of France ; and, as 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from North York (Mr. Mulock) 
               <br />
               said, he fought against the thirteen colonies which 
               <br />
               rose in revolt against England. Although a F rench- 
               <br />
               man, speaking French, and having only French 
               <br />
               blood in his veins, he fought against the French 
               <br />
               army on the frontier commanded by Lafayette, 
               <br />

               Canadians had hardly seen the French ﬂag depart

               <br />
               for their new Sovereign. They did not love their 
               <br />
               new Sovereign then; they had not time to know 
               <br />
               him 'or to love him ; but they fought like good 
               <br />
               and loyal men, and they carried the day, and 
               <br />
               this country has remained to this day one of

               French Canadians, so much despised by the hon.

               of the British Empire, where would the hon.

               <br />
               that. I cannot imagine that the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has not some other idea than fanaticism in a move- 
               <br />
               ment of this kind. He would have us believe that 
               <br />
               his object is to make this country a happy country, 
               <br />
               a country where the people from one ocean to the

               <br />

               <br />
               gentleman will have gone to his grave, and all his 
               <br />
               children, and all his grandchildren, and all his 
               <br />
               great grandchildren will have gone there too, and 
               <br />
               even after that there will be three or four million 
               <br />
               F reneh Canadians speaking French. He need not 
               <br />
               try that ; he will not succeed. It was tried before 
               <br />
               when we were a great deal feWer in number than 
               <br />
               we are now, and it did not succeed. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman spoke of the report of Lord Durham. 
               <br />
               Well, Lord Durham was a very able man, but we 
               <br />
               know how he went out of this country. He had 
               <br />
               not ﬁnished his work of examining the state of the 
               <br />
               country, and he left it in a huﬂ'because he was not 
               <br />
               sustained in England in the disposition he had 
               <br />
               made of certain political prisoners whom he had 
               <br />
               exiled to Bermuda against all law, the same thing 
               <br />
