               he may be carrying on a guerilla warfare, according 
               <br />
               to his methods, but after all, he is working for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the Conservative party. He has told us 
               <br />
               himself on more than one occasion. Not ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               days ago he said so in Collingwood, and he said so 
               <br />
               on the 12th July last, at Stayner. It is well known 
               <br />
               hat it was on the 12th July last at Stayner, 
               <br />
               amongst his own constituents, that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man started on the war path. He then stated that 
               <br />
               he was furnishing his own weapons, and that when 
               <br />
               Parliament again met he was going to give assault 
               <br />
               to the French. His ardor was such that he depre- 
               <br />
               cated the unfortunate condition of things which, 
               <br />
               under the Constitution, did not permit him to 
               <br />
               attack them wherever his ardor would impel him, 
               <br />
               but under the Constitution, he says he could attack 
               <br />
               the French language in the North-VVest Territ- 
               <br />
               ories, and attack he would as soon as the occasion 
               <br />
               oﬁered. But at the same time the hon. gentleman, ad- 
               <br />
               dressing his constituents—all of them, probably, good 
               <br />
               Tories—was careful to tell them that he was still a 
               <br />
               Conservative, that he would remain a Conservative, 
               <br />
               and that a Conservative he hoped to die ; and I 
               <br />
               have no doubt that that is true, because I do not 
               <br />
               think the hon. gentleman has the slightest particle 
               <br />
               of Liberalism in his composition. After this, some 
               <br />
               candid souls have asked if the hon. gentleman was 
               <br />
               in sympathy with the Prime Minister, or if he was 
               <br />
               starting a new movement of his own. A most useless 
               <br />
               question, for, whatever may be the aim of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, it is quite certain that he means no 
               <br />
               harm to the Conservative party, still less to the 
               <br />
               leader of the party. Upon that occasion he spoke 
               <br />
               of his attachment to the party, and to the leader of 
               <br />
               the party, in terms of gushing eﬁ'usiveness which, 
               <br />
               I must say, the hon. gentleman is not accustomed 
               <br />
               to use. I might quote several expressions of his, 
               <br />
               but here is one which is characteristic of the whole 
               <br />
               tenor of his speech : 
               <br />
               “I will treat my old chieftain with all tenderness, for 
               <br />
               I am still a member of the party. I cannot be read out, 
               <br />
               although I do not know what is in store for me.” 
               <br />
               The hon. member (Mr. McCarthy) is not here, but, 
               <br />
               if he were, I would tell him that he can keep his 
               <br />
               soul in peace. He need not fret or worry over What 
               <br />
               is in store for him, for I know the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman’s astuteness too well—not to mention his 
               <br />
               nobler qualities—not to be aware that, if the hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> brings recruits to the party, he will be 
               <br />
               orgiven ; and it is for recruits tothe partythat heis 
               <br />
               looking now. I regret that the hon. gentleman is 
               <br />
               not here, as I Would rather speak in his presence 
               <br />
               than in his absence, but, in all sincerity, I say that 
               <br />
               I believe he is looking for recruits for the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party, while, of course, not forgetting 
               <br />
               himself. The Conservative party have been in 
               <br />
               power for a long time; they have been in power 
               <br />
               nearly continuously for thirty years, and it is a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘matter</span> of history that, during that time, they have 
               <br />

               Liberals of Ontario, who, fearing perhaps for 
               <br />
               British connection, might be induced to follow the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman into the Conservative party, for 
               <br />
               which he could frame a policy and of which then he 
               <br />
               would be dictator. Well, if this movement of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman were to be terminated here, if it 
               <br />

               <br />
               with much alarm. If this measure of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman were not to be followed by any other, 
               <br />
               if it were to remain as it appears here, a measure 
               <br />
               for the proscription of the French language con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the French population is small, I say at once that 
               <br />
               I would be inclined to say : Let the measure pass 
               <br />
               and let us return to those measures of practical 
               <br />
               usefulness which demand our attention. But this 
               <br />
               is not the last movement of the hon. gentleman. 
               <br />
               This is only a preliminary skirmish, soon to be 
               <br />
               followed by a general onslaught upon the whole 
               <br />
               French race in Canada. I have before me the 
               <br />
               words of the hon. gentleman, and he has more than 
               <br />
               Once told us that his object is a hand-to-hand 
               <br />
               conﬂict with the French race of Canada. If he 
               <br />
               did not say so in so many words, there is no 
               <br />
               mistaking his meaning that his ultimate object is 
               <br />
               the annihilation of the French race as an indivi- 
               <br />
               dual people in this Dominion. In his speech at 
               <br />
               Stayner, he unfolded his whole mind, and, address- 
               <br />
               ing himself to the Eu lish section of the people of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, he sai :

               “ There isa great work cut out for us to do. Let us 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               begin with that which seems most possible of accom lish- 
               <br />
               ment. Let us deal with the dual languages in the orth- 
               <br />
               West. In the Local House let us deal with the teaching 
               <br />
               of French in the schools. When these two matters are 
               <br />
               settled,‘ we will have accom lished something, and we 
               <br />
               may be able to do something otter in future.”

               These words are quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">signiﬁcant.</span> This Bill, the 
               <br />
               introduction of this measure, is simply a pre- 
               <br />
               liminary step, and when that is accomplished it is 
               <br />
               to be followed by something better. And what is 
               <br />
               that something better which is to follow? The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has not left us in doubt as to that.
