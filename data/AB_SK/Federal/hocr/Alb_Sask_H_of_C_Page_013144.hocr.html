               The French Canadians do not want favors ; 
               <br />
               they want only the rights which are proper to 
               <br />
               every man. In the discussion of this matter we 
               <br />
               should not yield to prejudices, we should demand 
               <br />
               only the triumph of fair play, of justice, and 
               <br />
               of the principles which should guide the rulers 
               <br />
               of nations. The member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) says that he does not wish to interfere 
               <br />
               with the rights granted to the- French people under 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. Can we hope that 
               <br />
               he will be faithful to this promise ‘3 That gentle- 
               <br />
               man has twice approved of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories Act, and yet to-day he disapproves of what 
               <br />
               he approved of yesterday. If he changes so often, 
               <br />
               must we not suppose that he will forget the 
               <br />
               promises he made in his speech, and that, faithful 
               <br />
               to those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂ‘erent</span> speeches he has made in Ontario 
               <br />
               and elsewhere, he will continue on with his 
               <br />
               crusade against the French language, and against 
               <br />
               the Separate Schools. There is another strange 
               <br />
               accusation which has been made by the member for 
               <br />
               North'Simcoe. He goes so far as to say that we 
               <br />
               should not read French literature. Does he not 
               <br />
               know that we have always had here Governors and 
               <br />
               representatives of the British Empire, who are not 
               <br />
               ashamed to read French literature? If we judge 
               <br />
               them by the manner in which they speak French, 
               <br />
               we must come to the conclusion that they have 
               <br />
               read a good deal of that French literature; and 
               <br />
               yet these gentlemen have remained loyal to the 
               <br />
               Crown, have remained true friends of the British 
               <br />
               Empire, and have always been found ready to 
               <br />
               protect the best interests of Great Britain. The 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe has alluded chieﬂy 
               <br />
               to the report of Lord Durham, and he 
               <br />
               states that Lord Durham was an eminent 
               <br />
               statesman. But eminent statesmen generally make 
               <br />
               laws which remain a long time on the Statute— 
               <br />
               book. What do we see with respect to the 
               <br />
               law founded upon the report of Lord Durham on 
               <br />
               the French language? A few years after that con- 
               <br />
               stitution was adopted, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> found necessary to 
               <br />
               abro ate the clause which permitted only the use 
               <br />
               of t e Eaglish language, and that abrogation 
               <br />
               showed that Lord Durham, far from being an 
               <br />
               eminent statesman, was a short-sighted legisla- 
               <br />
               tor, whose views could not be accepted. I have 
               <br />
               heard, with a good deal of pleasure, the speech 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for \Vest Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin). The remarks which he has made are 
               <br />
               certainly such as we should all take pride in, but I 
               <br />
               cannot approve of the conclusion to which he has 
               <br />
               come. It is this Parliament which has the right to 
               <br />
               frame laws and a constitution for the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories, and so long as that right rests with 
               <br />
               this Parliament we should not shrink from the 
               <br />
               duty and the responsibility which devolves upon 
               <br />
               us. We ought to frame laws which we think just 
               <br />
               and fair. We ought not to forget that the inhabi- 
               <br />
               tants of these Territories have their eyes upon us, 
               <br />
               and Wish us to do justice to them. Some mem- 
               <br />
               bers say that the majority in this case must decide. 
               <br />
               I do not agree with that, Mr. Speaker. Justice 
               <br />
               and right-are and will be justice and right, what- 
               <br />
               ever may be the decision of the minority or of the 
               <br />
               majority, and there are certain rights and certain 
               <br />
               principles which cannot be set aside for the sake 
               <br />
               of the majority or for the sake of any decision 
               <br />
               which can be made by them. The legislation I 
               <br />
               advocate has already been sanctioned by our con- 
               <br />
               stitution. In order to protect the English minority

               in the Province of Quebec, we have made special

               provisions in the constitution to respect their feel-

               ings, and to hinder agitators from interfering with 
               <br />
               their rights. There are similar provisions in our 
               <br />
               constitution to protect the Catholic minority of 
               <br />
               Ontario, and the Fathers of our Confederation have 
               <br />
               acted wisely in putting the questions which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> 
               <br />
               these minorities in such a way that they are pro-

               tected from the passions of the people which may 
               <br />
               be inﬂamed by agitators for sordid motives. Ameni- 
               <br />
               ber of this House has rightly said that, if there had 
               <br />
               been no agitation on the Jesuit question, the dual 
               <br />
               language question would never have been agitated 
               <br />
               in the North-VVest. In fact, in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> 
               <br />
               the people were quiet until the member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) thought ﬁt to pay a visit 
               <br />
               to the inhabitants of that portion of the country. 
               <br />
               Another hon. gentleman said that if we allow 
               <br />
               foreigners to come to this country, we are not going 
               <br />
               to make laws for the purpose of rendering ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               the languages spoken by those foreigners. Does 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman contend that the French 
               <br />
               Canadians are foreigners and aliens to this country ? 
               <br />
               Does he forget that we are the members of a race 
               <br />
               which discovered and civilised this country ? 
               <br />
               Surely that hon. member, when he made that as- 
               <br />
               sertion, did not reflect and did not consider the 
               <br />
               position we have occupied in Canada. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               I will conclude my remarks. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe says that the Treaty of Paris does 
               <br />
               not secure to us the use of our language ; but there 
               <br />
               is one thing to which I can appeal for the preser- 
               <br />
               vation of that language: It is British fair play. 
               <br />
               We have appealed before to it, we have before laid 
               <br />
               our complaints at the foot of the Throne, and we 
               <br />
               have been successful enough to obtain justice. I 
               <br />
               hope that the same fair play will continue to be ex- 
               <br />
               tended to us. We have not to deal with this 
               <br />
               question as the members of a certain race or class ; 
               <br />
               we must consider and deal with it in a manner to pro- 
               <br />
               mote the best interests of this country ; and, accord- 
               <br />
               ing to British legislators, the best policy to be fol- 
               <br />
               lowed with respect to different creeds and races is 
               <br />
               to respect their feelings, and I hope that policy 
               <br />
               will continue to prevail.

               your indulgence on this occasion when a question of 
               <br />

               <br />
               I seize this opportunity to speak in the French 
               <br />
               language as one of the representatives of the Irish 
               <br />
               Catholics of the Dominion, who have also been at- 
               <br />
               tacked, in an unjustiﬁable manner, by the member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe. That gentleman sought to es- 
               <br />
               tablish by some authority that the Irish Catholics 
               <br />
               in Canada are not the friends of the French Cana- 
               <br />
               dians, and not only are we not their friends, but 
               <br />
               that we are their bitterest enemies. I think I 
               <br />
