               also to many Conservative members, that

               Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier), and I do the same 
               <br />
               on behalf of the Liberal government of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick—for I believe it calls itself Lib- 
               <br />
               eral at the present time. I resent on behalf 
               <br />
               of my own province the invidious compari- 
               <br />
               son the right hon. gentleman has madebe- 
               <br />
               tween the Liberal government of that pro- 
               <br />
               vince and the Liberal government of .the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. The right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man seems to have very peculiar ideas 
               <br />
               about this legislation. He says the unit of 
               <br />
               population in Nova Scotia, or Ontario, as 
               <br />
               the case may'be, would be smaller if you 
               <br />
               applied section 4. Well, is not the statute 
               <br />
               before us? Does the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               deny that the statute would have that opera- 
               <br />
               tion if no other provinces had come in, and 
               <br />
               would not what he claims to be an evil 
               <br />
               have existed in that case by the very terms 
               <br />
               of the statute? Assuming that no other 
               <br />
               province had joined Canada up to the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time, nnd assuming that the four pro- 
               <br />
               vinces had increased as they have during 
               <br />
               the past ten years, then the very thing 
               <br />
               which the right hon. gentleman says is a 
               <br />
               scandal would have happened under the 
               <br />
               terms of the statute. Well, is it wrong 
               <br />
               to ask that the constitution should be ob- 
               <br />
               served? In the case I have suggested, 
               <br />
               surely it should not be attributed as blame 
               <br />
               to those provinces that they have asked 
               <br />
               that the constitution should be observed. 
               <br />
               There is no necessity for heat on the part 
               <br />
               of my right hon. friend. when these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are asking for the opinion of the 
               <br />
               court as to whether this provision <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still‘re—</span> 
               <br />
               mains intact in the constitution, although 
               <br />
               other provinces have come in. That is 
               <br />
               all they are asking, and is any blame 
               <br />
