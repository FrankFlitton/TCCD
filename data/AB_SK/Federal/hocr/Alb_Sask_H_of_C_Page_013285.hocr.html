               the trouble in 1837 was an existing feeling of hos-

               <br />
               then, would we have seen among the leaders of 
               <br />

               <br />
               the real cause of the trouble was well stated by the

               so far as to spend the public money without the

               term “ mischievous old men.” The report of Lord 
               <br />
               Durham, it is well known, was never considered 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada as an impartial document with 
               <br />
               regard to the French Canadians. The hon.- mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Sir-icoe has made an assertion from 
               <br />
               which I entirely dissent. He has said that the 
               <br />
               French Canadians are not a sympathetic people, 
               <br />
               that they are exclusive in their affections, that 
               <br />
               they do not sympathise with their English- 
               <br />
               speaking countrymen ; and, in support of that 
               <br />
               proposition, he has quoted, from I do not know 
               <br />
               what obscure authority, an extract stating that 
               <br />
               the Irish Catholic and the French Canadian, 
               <br />
               although they profess the same religious faith—— 
               <br />
               a circumstance which ought to create a bond 
               <br />
               of union and of mutual sympathy between them— 
               <br />
               are the bitterest enemies ‘2 If there was a time 
               <br />
               when a feeling of hostility existed between these 
               <br />
               two elements of our people it was when they 
               <br />
               were ﬁrst brought face to face, and before they 
               <br />
               knew each other. But those days have long since 
               <br />
               gone by, and from the moment that thosepeople be- 
               <br />
               gan to know each other better, and to appreciate each 
               <br />
               other better, they have lived on terms of the best 
               <br />
               friendship, and, wherever they are seen living to- 
               <br />
               day in the same settlements, at least in the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec, their relations are of the most 
               <br />
               cordial character. It is well known that their sons 
               <br />
               and daughters frequently intermarry. But, while 
               <br />
               I am on this point, let me indulge for a moment 
               <br />
               in reminiscences of the past, by referring to a 
               <br />
               solemn period of our history, when the French 
               <br />
               Canadians displayed towards their Irish brethern 
               <br />
               the feelings of the most devoted sympathy and 
               <br />
               benevolence. Men of my age, and older than I, 
               <br />
               in this House, can well remember that during the 
               <br />
               summer of 1847 we had an Irish immigration into 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Province of Quebec. These immigrants were 
               <br />
               landed on our shores in the most destitute 
               <br />
               condition, the one-half of them suffering from that 
               <br />
               Very contagious disease, typhoid fever. When 
               <br />
               they were landed in our harbors, a feeling of 
               <br />
               Stupefaction overcame the sympathies of our people 
               <br />
               for amoment. What were they to do ‘2 Were theyto

               Into their midst? Did not the supreme law of self— 
               <br />
               Preservation seem to demand that? But suddenly 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Voice of those men who for nearly nineteen cen- 
               <br />
               turies have been repeating the words of the Gospel 
               <br />
               and preaching the divine teachings of charity was 
               <br />
               heard. Those immigrants are our brethren, ex-

               and many of them were themselves stricken down 
               <br />
               by the dire contagion. Priests, Sisters of Charity,

               <br />

               large number were preserved to life, and those who 
               <br />
               died received in their ast moments all the con-

               of their parents, became orphans, what became of 
               <br />

               acquainted with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> of them, who, thanks to

               people, endowed with generous hearts and instincts, 
               <br />

               know them, for if he did know them as they are he 
               <br />
               would change his present attitude towards them, as 
               <br />
               he would soon ﬁnd his own heart kindle with feel-

               ings of thewarmest admiration for that noble people. 
               <br />
               The hon. member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), in 
               <br />
               the two speeches he has delivered in this House 
               <br />
               since the beginning of the debate has referred each 
               <br />
               time to Mr. Mercier, and he seems to look upon 
               <br />
               Mr. Mercier as the founder in the near future of a 
               <br />
               French Canadian nation on the shores of the St. 
               <br />
               Lawrence. In order to justify his apprehensions 
               <br />
               in this regard he reports a few words which were 
               <br />
               stated to have fallen from the lips of Mr. Mercier 
               <br />
               in a speech which he pronounced at a banquet in 
               <br />
               the city of Quebec on the celebration of St. John’s 
               <br />
               Day, the 24th June last. Mr. Mercier is reported 
               <br />
               to have appealed on that occasion to his country- 
               <br />
               men, to have endeavored to induce them to give 
               <br />
               up the old party ﬂags of rouge and bleu and to 
               <br />
               rally under the tricolor, which would lead this 
               <br />
               country to the brilliant destiny which it would 
               <br />
               reach in the future, or some words to that effect. 
               <br />
               To draw from these words an inference that 
               <br />
               Mr. Mercier intends that an independent French 
               <br />
               Canadian nation can be founded in the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec is to give to these words a 
               <br />
               greater signiﬁcance and a greater importance than 
               <br />
               they have. No serious man in the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec would think of the realisation of such an 
               <br />
               idea, which he would consider as nothing but 
               <br />
               Utopian; and Mr. Mercier himself is too intelli- 
               <br />
               gent and too clever a man to have meant in pro- 
               <br />
               nouncing those words that a nation could be es- 
               <br />
               tablished in the Province of Quebec independent 
               <br />
               of the other Provinces of this Dominion, and inde- 
               <br />
               pendent of England. But we know that all men,
