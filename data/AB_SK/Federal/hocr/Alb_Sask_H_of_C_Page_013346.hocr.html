               twenty-four hours afterwards, this other amend- 
               <br />
               ment was suggested, but it was not suggested as 
               <br />
               the result of a compromise or anything of the 
               <br />
               kind. Perhaps the leader of the other House 
               <br />
               knows more about it than I do ; all I know of it was 
               <br />
               what took place on the ﬂoor of this House. But 
               <br />
               what I protest against, is that Parliament should 
               <br />
               be supposed to be bound by any arrangement come 
               <br />
               to on that occasion. I ventured to say then, and I 
               <br />
               repeat now, that that is not going to settle the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty. If this dual language discussion is 
               <br />
               calculated to arouse passions and feelings which 
               <br />
               had better not be aroused, then the proper thing 
               <br />
               for Parliament to do is to settle the question once 
               <br />
               and for all. This is no settlement of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> What 
               <br />
               does it do? It merely leaves to the Assembly of 
               <br />
               the Territories the power to say that the Journals 
               <br />
               shall be printed in the way they think ﬁt; in 
               <br />
               other words, they shall not ,be printed in both 
               <br />
               languages; and further, that but one language. 
               <br />
               if they please, shall be spoken in the Assembly. 
               <br />
               have not the slightest doubt that, without any law 
               <br />
               at all, any reasonable body of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men-«and</span> I take it 
               <br />
               that the members of the North-West Assembly 
               <br />
               are reasonable men—would permit one of its 
               <br />
               members to speak in any language which suited 
               <br />
               him, in which they could follow him. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               do not think they require any law for that. 
               <br />
               I do not think that is the grievance which was 
               <br />
               complained of. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'hat</span> the people of the Nortli~

               <br />
               their press ariglit, complain of, is that this is a 
               <br />
               perpetuation of the system of dual languages, and, 
               <br />
               therefore, calculated to do a great deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">niis-</span>

               chief, unless put an end to at an early day.

               That system ‘is still maintained in the courts.

               I do not object, nor need anybody object,

               to the printing of the laws in as many lain 
               <br />
               guages as the Assembly thinks necessary; it is 
               <br />
               not necessary to impose by this Act iiiiperatively 
               <br />
               upon the Assembly that the laws shall be printed 
               <br />
               in French and English, as that is a matter which
