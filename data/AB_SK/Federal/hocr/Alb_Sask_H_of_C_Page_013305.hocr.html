               amendment which has been offered to us. That 
               <br />
               compromise, I believe, is dictated by sincere and 
               <br />
               patriotic views. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'hether</span> I accept it or not, I am 
               <br />
               happy to see that both parties can forget their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> and join hands, in order to try to put 
               <br />
               a stop to this harmful agitation. It is true, 
               <br />
               the amendment itself attacks one of the roots of 
               <br />
               the tree of Confederation ; but I am happy to see 
               <br />
               that the chiefs of both parties can agree to this 
               <br />
               compromise, without saying whether I can sanc- 
               <br />
               tion it by my vote or not. In concluding my 
               <br />
               remarks, which I abridge so as to accommodate my 
               <br />
               hon. colleagues, I will repeat, that if we want the 
               <br />
               Confederation to go on, if we want harmony and 
               <br />
               prosperity in this country, we must cease to attack 
               <br />
               each other, we must respect the rights of each 
               <br />
               other, we must leave each one to the enjoyment of 
               <br />
               his aspirations, his religion and his language ; We 
               <br />
               must give full liberty to everyone, so that all will 
               <br />
               be free to Work for the common good of the country.

               dulgence of the House for a few minutes, while I

               refer to before this debate closes. I can endorse,
