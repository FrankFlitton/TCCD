               Such, to my mind, is the state of feeling which the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, by his speech, and by the preamble 
               <br />
               to his Bill, is doing his best to awaken. Lord 
               <br />
               Macaulay said on one occasion, that whenever he 
               <br />
               had mastered a new language he always felt as if 
               <br />
               he had acquired a new sense. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               proposes to act towards the French population of 
               <br />
               this country in much the same way that the brother 
               <br />
               of Robert, Duke of Normandy, acted towards him. 
               <br />
               He proposes to put out their eyes. He says : Forget 
               <br />
               your mother tongue, forget the orators and states— 
               <br />
               men, the novelists and historians, the poets and 
               <br />
               philosophers of France. and then you- will begin to 
               <br />
               qualify yourselves for becoming good British 
               <br />
               subjects. If you understand the language, in 
               <br />
               which they spoke or wrote, if you appreciate its 
               <br />
               beauties, if you admire its expression or its wisdom, 
               <br />
               or its elasticity, then it is impossible that you 
               <br />
               can be a loyal subject, it is impossible that you 
               <br />
               can be devoted to the maintenance of the federal 
               <br />
               union. That is the position that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man has taken. I cannot help asking myself : 
               <br />
               Does the hon. gentleman understand the character 
               <br />
               and bearings of the demands that he is making on 
               <br />
               behalf of the State? Does he know that he is de- 
               <br />
               manding of the French Canadians sacriﬁces that 
               <br />
               are dearer than life itself? Does he not know that 
               <br />
               he is asking for the destruction of one of the most 
               <br />
               important rights for the existence of which govern- 
               <br />
               ments are maintained? The state is not an end, 
               <br />
               the state is the means to an end. Part of the duties 
               <br />
               of a state is to protect life, liberty and intellectual 
               <br />
               freedom, not less than the general public welfare. 
               <br />
               It has not right to undertake to destroy the mental 
               <br />
               vision of one section of a population with the 
               <br />
               design of creating it anew. It is no part of the duty 
               <br />
               of the state to destroy the capacity for studying 
               <br />
               one ﬁeld of literature, nor to attempt to create the 
               <br />
               capacity for stud ing another ﬁeld of literature.

               There may be forces at work in a state-—social and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intellectualnwhich</span> operate to create one nation 
               <br />
               out of two or more older ones. History, however, 
               <br />
               is plain that when these changes are brought about 
               <br />
               and a new order of things is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">created</span> out of old con- 
               <br />
               ditions, there are many forces and factors which 
               <br />
               work in the direction of resisting and transforming 
               <br />
               old nationalities into new ones, but these forces 
               <br />
               operate slowly. The circumstances under Which 
               <br />
               they operate are wholly different from anything we 
               <br />
               have in modern civilised society, and that result 
               <br />
               was not to absorb one race by another, and to per- 
               <br />
               petuate one of two races, or one of three, but 
               <br />
               to form a new race, a new nationality, out 
               <br />
               of the materials which these old races furnished. 
               <br />
               It can be shown that the factor of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man is the very weakest of all the influences or 
               <br />
               forces that might be employed for the purpose 
               <br />
               of accomplishing the end which he has in view. 
               <br />
               Look at the condition of things in this country. 
               <br />
               You have three great sources from Which intellec- 
               <br />
               tual life is drawn, the United Kingdom, the United 
               <br />
               States and France. Our English speaking popula- 
               <br />
               tion receive their inspiration lar ely from the liter- 
               <br />
               ature of the mother country an of the adjoining 
               <br />
               republic. Our French fellow~countrymen rely more 
               <br />
               largely upon French sources of culture, literature 
               <br />
               and information. The time may come when one of 
               <br />
               these sources of inspiration may be dried up; I 
               <br />
               will not undertake to speculate upon it, or to say 
               <br />
               that such will be the case ; but this I do say, that 
               <br />
               no Legislature in the British Empire has any right 
               <br />
               to undertake such a task on behalf of any portion 
               <br />
               of the population. If such a state of things does 
               <br />
               come about, it certainly will come about from a 
               <br />
               condition of things wholly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from that which 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman proposes to establish. It will 
               <br />
               arise from causes very different from those which 
               <br />
               the hon. member asks us to put in operation. The

               <br />
               terminating the ofﬁcial use of French in the ﬁrst

               <br />

               Mr. MILLS (Bothwell). Forty years have 
               <br />
               elapsed since I read the book. The old gentleman 
               <br />
               invented a machine which acted upon the principle 
               <br />
               of suction and pressure. It was applied to the 
               <br />
               heads of reprobates and was designed to make them 
               <br />
               men of exemplary lives. He was a great believer 
               <br />
               in phrenology, and by the application of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">machine</span> to conscientiousness, veneration and 
               <br />
               benevolence, applying the principle of suction, he 
               <br />
               drew out those organs to their proper dimensions, 
               <br />
               and then by applying pressure to bibativeness, des- 
               <br />
               tructiveness and other carnal propensities, he press- 
               <br />
               ed them down and diminished their size to such 
               <br />
               an extent that he made every person to whom he 
               <br />
               applied his machine a perfectly model character. 
               <br />
               So complete was this machine in his estimation that 
               <br />
               he hoped practically to put an end to the contro- 
               <br />
               versy about the relative merits of faith and 
               <br />
               works. The hon. gentleman proposes something 
               <br />
               like that in his Bill. The process is equally sum- 
               <br />
               mary and simple, by which he hopes to make a 
               <br />
