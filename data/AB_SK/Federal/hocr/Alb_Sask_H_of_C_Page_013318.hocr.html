               <br />
               This is a treaty entered into between the French 
               <br />
               and English-speaking members of the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, when the 
               <br />
               French members were asked to surrender their right 
               <br />
               to the Legislative Council, which was their safe- 
               <br />
               guard, and to trust to the future, relying on the 
               <br />
               promises of the hon. members who were then re- 
               <br />
               presenting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishspeaking</span> portion of the 
               <br />
               population. What has been the result? To—day 
               <br />
               legislation is being passed, in that very Legislature, 
               <br />
               unanimously passed, by the English—speaking mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the House, to abolish the French language, 
               <br />
               and they are going to abolish the Separate Schools 
               <br />
               in the face of the agreement solemnly entered upon 
               <br />
               in the Legislature by their predecessors. In the 
               <br />
               face of that fact, can it be matter of surprise that 
               <br />
               we should be reluctant to accept anything less 
               <br />
               than the fullest guarantee that this House can 
               <br />
               give? But we have trusted the future before, and 
               <br />
               we are willing to trust it again; but I hope we 
               <br />
               will never have the same history repeated as that 
               <br />
               which we have to record with regard to the Pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba. It may be said: You will 
               <br />
               not meet with the same fate in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“est.</span> 
               <br />
               I hope such may be the case; but as all sorts of

               extraneous matters have been brought into the

               1889, published an article headed “ One people,

               one Language.” It said :

               Knowing these facts, are we to be blamed if

               debate. We are already beginningto feel the good 
               <br />
               results that will come out of it. I am to-day in 
               <br />
               receipt of a. newspaper published in Winnipeg, a 
               <br />
               paper that has always advocated the abolition of 
               <br />
               the French language in the Province of Manitoba—— 
               <br />
               the Manitoba Free Press. In the course of an article 
               <br />
               it says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ In Manitoba we have abolished,as we think,the use of 
               <br />
               the French language and are now proceeding against 
               <br />
               Separate Schools. From the light of the recent debate 
               <br />
               at Ottawa. it would not seem so sure that we have been 
               <br />
               right in assuming to settle the language question alone.” 
               <br />
               This is the beginning of the result that we are 
               <br />
               going to derive from this debate, and therefore I am 
               <br />
               not sorry that it has taken place. I shall lay aside 
               <br />
               several matters that I intended to bring before the 
               <br />
               House, and I will conclude my remarks by stating 
               <br />
               that what has been said by some hon. gentlemen

               to the effect that the French language was not 
               <br />
               recognised in the United States was erroneously 
               <br />
               so stated. I take from “The American Statute 
               <br />
               Law” the following :—— 
               <br />

               certain designated districts may be made in French. So 
               <br />
               in Missouri, certain charters, &amp;e., in the German

               language. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Soin</span> Maryland, proposed amendments to the 
               <br />
               constitution, in German.” 
               <br />
               We see from this that there are only four states 
               <br />
               where the English language is at all the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               language. From this authority (which, being the 
               <br />
               statute law of the United States, cannot be ques- 
               <br />
               tioned), we can see what takes place with regard 
               <br />
               to the language question ri ht across the lines;

               to the contrary notwithstanding. I could cite 
               <br />
               some other instances to prove the law in the 
               <br />
               United States with regard to this matter, but I 
               <br />
               think this ought to be sufﬁcient to convince 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen. Let me just quote something 
               <br />
               with regard to the French language in the Island 
               <br />
               of Jersey. So much has been said about the other 
               <br />
               British colonies that I will not refer to them. I 
               <br />
               will quote from a book written by Abraham J. 
               <br />
               LeCras, entitled “ The Laws, Customs and Privi- 
               <br />
               leges, and their Administration, in the Island of 
               <br />
               Jersey,” as follows :—

               mandy, and which operates very much to the prejudice 
               <br />
               of English suitors, whose causes are usually the most 
               <br />
               important that are brought before the local tribunals, 
               <br />
               because a sworn interpreter is not appointed. In the 
               <br />
               case of Godfray on the prosecution of the Crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:.</span> 
               <br />
               Robertson (1838), on the demand of the defendant that

               who could alter the form of proceeding in this bailiwick.” 
               <br />
               We see from this that even in an English colony 
               <br />
               the French language alone is ofﬁcial. The hon.
