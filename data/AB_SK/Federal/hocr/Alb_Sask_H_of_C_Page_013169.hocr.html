               in the 11th chapter of the Book of Genesis, he

               Evidently the Almighty recognised the power of a 
               <br />
               community of language, and frustrated the 
               <br />
               attempts that were being made by the people of 
               <br />
               that day : he scattered them over the face of the 
               <br />
               earth, and brought in more than a dual language 
               <br />
               among the peoples of the world. The hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North York tells us that Greece had a com- 
               <br />
               munity of language, and yet that out of that 
               <br />
               community rival states with their animosities and 
               <br />
               bickerings arose, and there was no such thing as 
               <br />
               a national feeling in Greece. The great trouble 
               <br />
               with Greece was that it wanted commercial union, 
               <br />
               and the day of commercial union had not yet 
               <br />
               come. If the Greeks had adopted that policy, the 
               <br />
               bickerings and animosities which existed among 
               <br />
               those states speaking the same language would 
               <br />
               gradually have disappeared In Rome, the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman tells us, there were the Greek, the Latin, 
               <br />
               and numerous other tongues ; they had no commun- 
               <br />
               ity of language in that great empire. Necessarily 
               <br />
               they had not. The Roman Empire was composed 
               <br />
               of conquered states ; it had spread from the city on 
               <br />
               the Tiber, until it had covered nearly the whole of 
               <br />
               the known world ; but does the hon. gentleman pro- 
               <br />
               pose to tell us that the debates of the Roman senate, 
               <br />
               the Roman code, or the Roman statutes, were re- 
               <br />
               produced in all the languages spoken in that great 
               <br />
               empire ? I think not. I think there was nothing 
               <br />
               in the Roman Empire corresponding to the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of things we have in Canada to-day. Latin 
               <br />
               was used in the proceedings of the Senate and was 
               <br />
               I venture to assert, the official language of the 
               <br />
               Roman Empire. Then the hon. gentleman came 
               <br />
               down to the days of modern history, and he gave 
               <br />
               us a long list of the nations having more than one 
               <br />
               language. He tells us that Spain, Italy, Sweden,

               we do not want a model from them. Then, I come 
               <br />
               to England, as the hon. gentleman proposes. He 
               <br />
               tells us that in Great Britain we have not only 
               <br />
               English, but the Gaelic, the Welsh, the Irish, and 
               <br />

               debates in the Chamber at Westminster conducted 
               <br />

               <br />
               By no means. nglish is the ofﬁcial language. The

               We next heard from our friend whose riding is 
               <br />
               Rouville (Mr. Gigault ), a gentleman to whom I 
               <br />
               always listen with the greatest pleasure, a gentle- 
               <br />
               man who is a logical speaker, and who represents 
               <br />
               his views temperately and forcibly. He accused 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from North Simcoe ( Mr. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               with being governed by American rather than 
               <br />
               by British precedent and example. No doubt 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman from Simcoe thought that 
               <br />
               American example might be as good to follow as 
               <br />
               the examples of some of the Continental States of 
               <br />
               Europe ; and I do not know but that we might in 
               <br />
               many cases, with proﬁt to ourselves, have paid 
               <br />
               more attention than we have to American example. 
               <br />
               For instance, if we had taken pains to examine 
               <br />
               American precedents with regard to the Franchise 
               <br />
               law ; if we had seized ourselves of the fact that 
               <br />

               <br />
               after full consideration of the question, had decid- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and had been in operation for a hundred years 
               <br />

               <br />
