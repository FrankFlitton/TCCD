               a change has certainly come over the hon. gentle-

               speech in this House was not quite as brave as 
               <br />
               the speech he had delivered in the opera house 
               <br />
               here; and his last speech in the House was 
               <br />
               not nearly so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aggressive</span> as the ﬁrst one he de- 
               <br />
               livered here. He has been convinced by something 
               <br />
               during the course of this debate. I do not know 
               <br />
               whether it was his opponents who convinced him, 
               <br />
               or his own friends; I think he must have heard 
               <br />
               enough from his own friends and supporters to 
               <br />
               convince him that whatever they might think or

               of Ontario one of the brilliant leaders of the bar,

               which the hon. gentleman is, back down from any 
               <br />
               position he has boldly taken ; yet the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man backs down and says he is willing to withdraw 
               <br />
               the preamble of this Bill. It is too late to say that 
               <br />
               now; he should have thought of that before; he 
               <br />
               has sown the whirlwind and must reap the storm. 
               <br />
               I am glad to have heard so much from the 
               <br />
               other side of the House in favor of Provincial 
               <br />
               rights. It is proverbial that fresh converts are 
               <br />
               always a little over-zealous, and I think we have 
               <br />
               seen a display in this debate of a good deal of zeal 
               <br />
               a little misdirected on that subject. The question, 
               <br />
               of course, I know is a new one to those hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen, and we can scarcely expect that they 
               <br />
               should understand it very well. They appear to 
               <br />
               have forgotten that there are two kinds of Provin— 
               <br />
               cial rights. There are the rights of the majority 
               <br />
               of the Legislature in the Province to pass such 
               <br />
               laws as come within the scope of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. Those are the Provincial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> of the majority. But there are rights, also, 
               <br />
               be onging to the minority, guaranteed by the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, which are just as sacred as 
               <br />
               the rights of the majorities to govern themselves. 
               <br />
               Such rights would prevent the French majority in 
               <br />
               Quebec from taking away Protestant schools from 
               <br />
               the minority, for example. That is a question of 
               <br />
               the Provincial rights of the minority, which hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, who are now advocating Pro~ 
               <br />
               vincial rights, have forgotten in their deﬁnition of 
               <br />
               that term. I think when the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) better understands 
               <br />
               this country and its citizens, he will know that 
               <br />
               Confederation, as was pointed out by the First Min~ 
               <br />
               ister and by the hon. member for Northumberland 
               <br />
               (Mr. Mitchell), is a compromise. Confederation is 
               <br />
               a compromise in itself, and without Confederation 
               <br />
               what is Canada, where is it, or where would it be? 
               <br />
               Canada, therefore, is a compromise, and I believe 
               <br />
               if Confederation were broken up into its original 
               <br />
               fragments on a ﬁnancial question, for example, 
               <br />
               it is just possible that the scattered members of 
               <br />
               the old Confederacy might remain in some sense 
               <br />
               connected with Great Britain and in some sense 
               <br />
               united to one another; but if this Confederation 
               <br />
               were torn to pieces by a war of races, there would 
               <br />
               be no hope of any harmony among its scattered 
               <br />
               members, there would be no hope of continuing 
               <br />
               the connection, which so many people desire, 
               <br />
               with Britain; and there would be no chance, 
               <br />
               which I feel to be an even more important 
               <br />
               thing, to build up a great Canadian nation. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman repudiates the idea of being 
               <br />
               an annexationist. He says, and I do not deny 
               <br />
               he thinks so too, that he is not working for annexa- 
               <br />
               tion ; but I tell him that if his speeches were not 
               <br />
               answered on this ﬂoor, if his sentiments were not 
               <br />
               repudiated by the great majority of this House, if 
               <br />
               this Bill were not voted down, he would maketens 
               <br />
               of thousands of annexationists in the Province of 
               <br />
