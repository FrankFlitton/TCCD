               <br />
               made at the time of Confederation. I felt that if 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman had not already surrendered 
               <br />

               he made his capitulation the other night. But his 
               <br />
               most extraordinary statement was that we were not 
               <br />
               informed of the opinion of the people of the N orth- 
               <br />

               <br />
               from them to take up and deal with this question. 
               <br />
               Did that hon. gentleman remember that when in the 
               <br />
               Province of Ontario he agitated the country from end 
               <br />
               to end with regard to the murder of poor Thomas 
               <br />
               Scott, he sat in the Legislature of Ontario, where 
               <br />
               he had no mandate to deal with that question? 
               <br />
               Did the hon. gentleman remember that on one 
               <br />
               occasion he himself brought into this House a re- 
               <br />
               solution which was offensive to a great many of us 
               <br />
               with regard to the Irish question, in order that he 
               <br />

               <br />
               an draw them to his standard, although he had 
               <br />
               no mandate, and although this House had no 
               <br />
               authority to speak with regard to Imperial con- 
               <br />
               cerns? Did that hon. gentleman remember that 
               <br />
               on another occasion he voted for, if he did not 
               <br />
               move, a resolution on the subject of the dis— 
               <br />
               establishment of the Irish Church? And yet 
               <br />
               he undertook to assert that the Legislature of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> had no right to petition this Par-

               liament. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'e</span> had a right to pass offensive resolu-

               <br />
               assert that the representatives of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Vest</span> 
               <br />
               had no right to petition or to express their wishes that 
               <br />
               this clause should be stricken out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“vest</span> 
               <br />
               Territories Aet. I will say no morein the absence 
               <br />
               of that hon. gentleman. I now desire, before 
               <br />
               closing, to say a word or two on the merits of the 
               <br />
               various motions before the Chair. The amendment 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil) 
               <br />
               has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received,</span> but little favor from any of the 
               <br />
               English-speaking members. It is one,I think, impos- 
               <br />
               sible of acceptance. It announces that if we repeal 
               <br />
               a clause in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Act, put in under the 
               <br />
               extraordinary circumstances to which reference 
               <br />
               has been made, and allowed to remain because 
               <br />
               attention has not been drawn to it, we shall be 
               <br />
               shaking the stability of our institutions and des- 
               <br />
               troying the peace and progress of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthJVest.</span> 
               <br />
               The mere recital of that resolution carries its 
               <br />
               condemnation with it. The other amendment with 
               <br />
               which we have to deal, and which seems to ﬁnd a 
               <br />
               good deal of favor, is the amendment of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest</span> Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) ; 
               <br />
               and before I deal with that I have somewhat of an 
               <br />
               apology to make to that hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               to this House. I am accused of interfering 
               <br />
               with the prerogatives of the members from 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“est.</span> Surely, said the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of Public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'orks,</span> echoed by the hon. Secretary of 
               <br />
               State, there were members in this House repre- 
               <br />
               senting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> whose duty it was to 
               <br />
               bring this question to the attention of this 
               <br />
               chamber, and there was rather an insinuation 
               <br />
               thrown out by the hon. member for Assiniboia 
               <br />
               himself in his very opening Words that my action 
               <br />
               was an intrusion on his domain ; and, if you will 
               <br />
               pardon me saying so, the bitterness—but that is 
               <br />
               too strong a word, for he could not be bitter if he 
               <br />
               tried, but the appearance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bitterness~which</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               next, when it is expected there will be a big ﬁght. We 
               <br />
               are informed on good authority that all the N orth-West 
               <br />
               representatives will vote against it. If they do so, their 
               <br />
               constituents should call upon them to resign forthwith. 
               <br />
               We are also informed that Mr. N. F. Davin will speak 
               <br />
               against it. West Assiniboia is about the best mis-repre- 
               <br />
               sented constituency in the North-West. This country is 
               <br />
               almost unanimous in favor of Mr. McCarthy’s Bill, but its 
               <br />
               representatives all belong to the party machine and must 
               <br />
               represent the machine in preference to the country.” 
               <br />
               That, Mr. Speaker, is my apology for venturing to 
               <br />
               introduce this point to the notice of the House. 
               <br />
               Now, with regard to the amendment of that hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman : what is it ? My motion is that the Bill 
               <br />
               be read the second time. Great fault is found with 
               <br />
               the preamble. The preamble is worse than the 
               <br />
               enacting clause ; the enacting clause is harmless 
               <br />
               and the preamble is something fearful. Well, to 
               <br />
               the laymen of the House, perhaps, explanations are 
               <br />
               necessary about the preamble. To the lawyers of 
               <br />
               the House an explanation is not called for. It is 
               <br />
               quite certain, as every lawyer in this House knows, 
               <br />
               that the preamble neither adds to nor takes from 
               <br />
               the effect of the enacting clause. The preamble, in 
               <br />
               this case, I quite admit, was unnecessary. While I 
               <br />
               do not at all withdraw from the sentiment con— 
               <br />
               tained in that preamble, yet as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effective</span> piece of 
               <br />
               legislation I am free to admit the Bill would be 
               <br />
               perfectly as good without as with the preamble. 
               <br />
               Now, if the hon. gentlemen in this House are 
               <br />
               sincere, and I am bound to believe in their 
               <br />
               sincerity ; if they desire that this dual clause 
               <br />
               should be expunged or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repealedm—the</span> hon. member 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'est</span> Durham thought “ expunge ” was a very 
               <br />
               improper word to use ; one has to be very careful 
               <br />
               of his language and must not use words, no matter 
               <br />
               how plain they may be, except with the greatest 
               <br />
               care— well, I will call it repeal, or anything you 
               <br />
               will. But, I say, if hon. gentlemen are sincerein 
               <br />
               their desire to repeal this clause, the way to do 
               <br />
               that is to pass the Bill to the second reading, and 
               <br />
               those who are opposed to the preamble can then 
               <br />
               have it struck out. The preamble of a private Bill 
               <br />
               is the all-essential portion ; if the preamble be not 
               <br />
               carried, the Bill does not pass. The preamble of a 
               <br />
               public Bill is Wholly unessential ; its only possible 
               <br />
               use can be to make an ambiguous portion of the 
               <br />
               enacting clause plain, if ambiguity there be ; and I 
               <br />
