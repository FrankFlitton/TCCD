               do I now think it was a wise one. It may have

               a wise and judicious result. Before that time, the

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assembly</span> should be recorded in both languages : 
               <br />
               it was permissible to use both languages in the

               <br />
               far as the courts were concerned. and so far as the

               publication of the laws were concerned, the old 
               <br />
               provision remained. So that, although I do not

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5</span> the two languages, that evil still exists. I did not

               complain, I do not knowanybody <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ctnnplained,</span> of the 
               <br />
               fact that members of the Legislative Assembly 
               <br />
               might speak in both languages or either language, 
               <br />
               or in any language. That was a matter. I think, 
               <br />
               which might be left to the. Assembly itself. 
               <br />

               <br />
               in other words, that the French language should

               cerued, on a par with the English language. I do

               not intend to do more than brieﬂy state the history 
               <br />
               of this question, which will enable the House fully 
               <br />
               to understand it; and I need only address those 
               <br />
               members who were not present two years ago, in 
               <br />
               regard to this double language question. In the 
               <br />
               early days in the French province, now the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, there was the right claimed, and I do not 
               <br />
               think it was an unreasonable right, by the gentle- 
               <br />
               men elected to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LegiS‘lative</span> Council of that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> province. to speal; in their own language. It was 
               <br />
               impossible for them, probably, to speak in English 
               <br />
               or any other language, and the request was cen- 
               <br />
               ceded, not as a matter of law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> but of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right,</span> to 
               <br />
               address their fellow members in their own language. 
               <br />
               I repeat that that appears to have not been at all 
               <br />
               an objectionable request. But the difﬁculty that.
