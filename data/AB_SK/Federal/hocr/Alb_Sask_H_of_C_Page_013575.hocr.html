               phasized in a very striking manner by Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy in 1892. In referring to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mo</span>

               posal made at that time by my right hon.

               friend he said :

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Even if there had been a conference in that 
               <br />
               way I do not see what particular benefit could 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               merely reproduced the scheme of the majority. 
               <br />
               It would merely have reproduced the scheme 
               <br />
               which the government have now presented and 
               <br />
               which this House, representing in the same way

               the same proportion of numbers, will ultima-

               That is the criticism which I would make 
               <br />
               upon this proposal in so far as it contemplates 
               <br />
               a conference or committee. If it is intended 
               <br />
               to produce an agreement such as was 
               <br />
               arrived at in 1884, if it is proposed to adopt 
               <br />
               the same principle which was acted on by the 
               <br />
               English government at that time, it seems to 
               <br />
               me that the proposal of my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               should have been a proposal for a com- 
               <br />
               mittee composed of an equal number of 
               <br />
               members from each side, a proposal which 
               <br />
               would not reﬂect the numerical strength of 
               <br />
               either party in this House, instead of the 
               <br />
               present one which in the end must merely 
               <br />
               result, or might merely result in reproducing 
               <br />
               to the House the scheme of the majority. 
               <br />
               as Mr. McCarthy remarked in 1892. Now 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend has assured me that 
               <br />
               no schedules or maps have been prepared, 
               <br />
               or at least that they have not been ﬁnally 
               <br />
               prepared. Of course. we have heard a great 
               <br />
               many rumours to the contrary, some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these,</span> 
               <br />
               rumours appear to be well founded; but 
               <br />
               again I say I accept, as far as my right 
               <br />
               'hon. friend is concerned, in the fullest sense 
               <br />

               Now there is another observation I would 
               <br />
               make, which is that no principle whatever 
               <br />
               has been announced by my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               in introducing this Bill, beyond this. He 
               <br />
               says : -

               My right hon. friend has not made any

               reference whatever to equality of population, 
               <br />

               <br />
               that in his speech of 1892. I would like 
               <br />
               to point out to him that in Great Britain 
               <br />
               in 1884 very full rules were laid down, and 
               <br />
               among them were these: In the ﬁrst place 
               <br />
               equality of population; in the next place 
               <br />
               retaining in the divisions any particular 
               <br />
               portion of the population which was of an

               In speaking upon the second reading of the

               <br />
               possible to work out a principle of that kind 
               <br />
               in framing schedules for a Bill of this char-

               acter, but at all events it is a principle

               upon which my right hon. friend very 
               <br />
               strongly relied in 1892, and it is one which 
               <br />

               <br />
               respect of the criticism which my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend made of the Act of 1892. In speaking 
               <br />
               on the ﬁrst reading of this Bill, he named 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.t'ortytwo</span> constituencies in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario which, he said, had elected twenty- 
               <br />
               iive Conservatives and only seventeen Lib- 
               <br />
               erals, and notwithstanding that fact, the 
               <br />
               vote for the seventeen Liberals was greater 
               <br />
               in number than the vote for the twenty-ﬁve 
               <br />
               Conservatives. My right hon. friend seems 
               <br />
               to regard that as a complete argument to 
               <br />
               show that the Bill of 1892 was unfair to the 
               <br />
               Liberal party. Well, now, I have been fur- 
               <br />
               nished with a list of certain constituencies 
               <br />
               in the province of Ontario which produce an 
               <br />
               exactly opposite result. Take the constitu-
