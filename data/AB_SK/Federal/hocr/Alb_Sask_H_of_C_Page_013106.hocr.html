               natural conclusion to be drawn from his remarks, because 
               <br />
               he made the general statement that Dakota and Minnesota 
               <br />
               were more prosperous than the Canadian N orth-West, and 
               <br />
               that their land laws were more liberal. Let any Ameri

               <br />
               Take the matter of taxation. Mr. Webster states in his 
               <br />
               pamphlet, among other things, at page 14:

               <br />
               mind ofa thoughtful immigrant farmer. On the let of June, 1887, the 
               <br />
               farm mortgage debt of Dakota was $45,000,000. That sum, if equally 
               <br />
               divided, would be a mortgage of $400 on every family in Dakota. But 
               <br />
               all are not farmers ; so much the worse for those that are. At the same

               aging $30, 000. and the thoughtful farmer can see why taxes are high, 
               <br />
               and why it is hard to make wheat growing proﬁtable in Dakota."

               cipalities to build.” 
               <br />
               In this connection, I may say that our municipal taxes in 
               <br />
               Manitoba in the last few years have been very much reduced, 
               <br />
               and there are several municipalities in the county of Bran- 
               <br />
               don that have balances in the bank. The city of Brandon, 
               <br />
               on the 1st of January, after providing for the interest on its 
               <br />
               coupons and for every other demand, had 83,500 to its 
               <br />
               credit in the bank; the municipality of Elton had 84 000; 
               <br />
               and the municipality of Cornwallis had 81,500. The munici- 
               <br />
               pality of Oak Lake and the municipality of Blanchard, in 
               <br />
               the county of Marquette, had also large balances in the bank. 
               <br />
               If the municipalities are prosperous, I think that is good 
               <br />
               evidence that the peeple must be prosperous. New, I say 
               <br />
               in answer to the hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. 
               <br />
               Charlton), that our land laws are far more liberal than 
               <br />
               those prevailing in Dakota and the western States; and it 
               <br />
               does not behoove him, or any other member of this House, to 
               <br />
               make the general statement he has made. Our land laws 
               <br />
               have not been all that we could have wished them to he ; 
               <br />
               but if any hon. gentleman imagines that the land laws of the 
               <br />
               United States are perfect, all he has to do is to go to the 
               <br />
               library to ﬁnd volume after volume of the decisions of the 
               <br />
               land ofﬁcers at Washington, and to ﬁnd that they have had 
               <br />
               more trouble with their land laws than we have had. There 
               <br />
               are certain matters that we would like to have changed, but 
               <br />
               we are glad to have as Minister of the Interior a gentleman 
               <br />
               who has spent eight or ten years of his life in the North- 
               <br />
               West, and is conversant with our wants and requirements; 
               <br />
               and asthe hon. member for Marquette (Mr. Watson) said 
               <br />
               this afternoon, from the interview that we had with the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> we are satisﬁed that he is desirous of giving 
               <br />
               the settlers of that country all that is required to make the 
               <br />
               land laws of this Parliament satisfactory to them. I do 
               <br />
               not wish to state anything of what occurred at that inter- 
               <br />
               view ; but as the representative of one of the constituencies 
               <br />
               of Manitoba, I am well satisﬁed with what the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               promised. When the new land regulations are laid before 
               <br />
               the House, we shall have a full discussion of the question, 
               <br />
               and I will reserve any further remarks I have to make 
               <br />

               Mr. McMULLEN. I am very glad indeed to hear the 
               <br />
               glowing accounts given by the hon. gentleman of the pros- 
               <br />

               <br />
               great satisfaction to us all to learn that the prospects of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to regret, and that mistakes have been made in connection 
               <br />
               with the land regulations. It was a very unfortunate ar- 
               <br />
               rangement by which the Government permitted large sec-

               tioos of that country to be taken up by colonisation com- 
               <br />
               panies and withheld from actual settlers for years, so that 
               <br />
               many persons who went in there were prevented from set- 
               <br />
               tling where they wanted to. If the arrangements had been

               <br />

               are matters that we have to deplore, and I earnestly 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hope,</span> along with the gentlemen who have spoken, 
               <br />
               that the Minister now in charge of that department 
               <br />
               will make such changes as will give the actual settler 
               <br />
               greater advantages than he has enjoyed in that coun- 
               <br />
               try hitherto. But while we are prepared to lend our hearty 
               <br />
               encouragement to every movement that will tend to ﬁll that 
               <br />
               country with population and promote its development, 
               <br />
               that would tend to bring it up to the standard where I 
               <br />
               would like to see it, a great populous and wealthy country. 
               <br />
               There is another side of the question that has not been 
               <br />
               touched by any hon. gentleman opposite, the question of 
               <br />
               expense. I hold that in their arrangements the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment have expended enormous sums of money for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of meeting the wishes of political friends and ﬁnding 
               <br />
               soft and easy resting places for those who were pressing 
               <br />
               upon them for lucrative positions. When we come to con- 
               <br />
               sider the condition of things as we ﬁnd them by the Auditor 
               <br />
               General’s Report, we have to deplore the fact that an enor- 
               <br />
               mous amount of money has been expended compared with 
               <br />
               the amount received in return. I ﬁnd that we expended 
               <br />
               altogether last year, including the expenses of the Winni- 
               <br />
               peg board, and the expenses west of Winnipeg. as follows: 
               <br />
               Dominion lands, outside service, $149,536.61. We expended 
               <br />
               on the Half breed Commission $6,714.39, and we expended 
               <br />
               on the registrars, of whom we have seven, 813,386.32. 
               <br />
               Now this is in all an expenditure for oﬂicials in the 
               <br />
               North-West, including the Land Board at Winnipeg, and 
               <br />
               all west of that, of $169,637.32. Now, what were our 
               <br />
               receipts? Our entire income last year from the sales of 
               <br />
               lands, mainly coal lands, ranching grants, and all other 
               <br />
               sources was $267,973.51, leaving a balance to our credit 
               <br />
               of $98,336.18. That virtually means that for all the money 
               <br />
               received in the North-West, we have actually paid out 60 
               <br />
               per cent. for hired service, agents, inspectors, travellers, 
               <br />
               and the like. I want to give a resume of the account, as it 
               <br />
               now stands, for the last year. As I stated before, we have 
               <br />
               expended $149,534.61 under the head of Dominion lands 
               <br />
               account. That includes contingencies. Then we have 
               <br />
               expended in the Department of the Interior, inside service, 
               <br />
               salaries here at Ottawa, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$35,011.13;</span> on surveys, $136,009 02; 
               <br />
               salaries at Ottawa, Dominion lands, $76,604,67 ; contingen- 
               <br />
               cies at Ottawa belonging to Department of Interior, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$22,137.02.</span> In all we have expended in the Department of 
               <br />
               Interior, including the expenses in Ottawa, and the expenses 
               <br />
               in the North-West, and the surveys, $420,744.76. N ow, let 
               <br />
               us look at the receipts. We have received from Dominion 
               <br />
               lands and ranching leases, &amp;c., <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$217,688.01;</span> from ordnance 
               <br />
               lands, 836,239.88; from the registry ofﬁce, 87,212.02; ﬁnes 
               <br />
               and iorfeitures, $7,065.76; and other ﬁnes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$372.79;</span> in all 
               <br />
               we have collected $267,973.50. Deducting that from our 
               <br />
               expenditure, we are actually at a positive less in the Opera- 
               <br />
               tion of the Department, including the surveys for last year, 
               <br />
               of $166,172.22, but allowing that the surveys performed 
               <br />
               last year, which cost $106,000, should be charged to capital 
               <br />
               account, we are actually at a loss of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$60,172.22,</span> on last 
               <br />
               year’s operations. Now, to give the House a little idea of 
               <br />
               the manner in-which this condition of things is brought 
               <br />
