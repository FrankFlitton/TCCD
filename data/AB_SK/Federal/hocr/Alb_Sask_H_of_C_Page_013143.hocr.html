               Mr. GIGAULT. Harmony prevailed in this 
               <br />
               country. French and English-speaking subjects 
               <br />
               were working hand in hand for the prosperity of this 
               <br />
               country, by that means endeavoring to strengthen 
               <br />
               and secure the safety of the British Empire. 
               <br />
               Thanks to the wisdom and prudence of Canadian 
               <br />
               and British statesmen, burning questions which 
               <br />
               had created animosity in the past, had been 
               <br />
               removed from the arena of politics. The French 
               <br />
               language and the Separate School questions had 
               <br />
               been settled by the Constitution of 1867. Every 
               <br />
               one hoped that those questions would not be 
               <br />
               agitated any longer. But a cloud, threatening our 
               <br />
               tranquility, has appeared on the horizon. The 
               <br />
               Bill presented by the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), is objectionable chieﬂy 
               <br />
               on account of its preamble which shows the intention 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman. Moreover, we have his 
               <br />
               speeches outside of and inside this House, and we 
               <br />
               know what is his aim and what is the chief aim of 
               <br />
               the school of which he is the head. I believe that all 
               <br />
               persons who wish well to Canada should seek to stop 
               <br />
               the crusade which has been organised, and which is 
               <br />
               being made by the hon. member for North Simcoe. 
               <br />
               By the preamble of the Bill, that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               says that unity of languages is absolutely necessary 
               <br />
               for national unity. Mr. Speaker, the British legisla— 
               <br />
               tors have not been of that opinion. At the very doors 
               <br />
               of the English metropolis the French language is 
               <br />
               spoken, namely, in the Channel Islands. What do we 
               <br />
               see in India ‘2 There the English Government, so far 
               <br />
               from compelling the inhabitants of that colony to 
               <br />
               speak the English language, compels the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment ofﬁcials to learn Sanscrit and the vernacular 
               <br />
               languages of India. What do we see in the Cape 
               <br />
               Colony ‘3 The Dutch language was not spoken there 
               <br />
               before 1882, but in that year a law was passed in 
               <br />
               the British Parliament allowing the debates to be 
               <br />
               made in that colony either in English or Dutch. In 
               <br />
               the Mauritius Islands the debates are conducted 
               <br />
               either in French or in English, and last year an 
               <br />
               ordinance was enacted by which the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> be used before the courts of law in the 
               <br />
               Seychelles Islands. So, the policy which the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) is follow- 
               <br />
               ing here, is contrary to all the legislation which has 
               <br />
               been passed, and which is now being passed by the 
               <br />
               British Empire. The policy followed by the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is not a British but an American 
               <br />
               policy. He was not formerly an admirer of 
               <br />
               American institutions, but to-day he seems to 
               <br />
               abandon the British spirit in order to imitate 
               <br />
               American institutions. The hon. gentleman has 
               <br />
               been kind enough to remind us that the French 
               <br />
               Canadians are a conquered people, and he stated, 
               <br />
               at the same time, that the Treaty of Paris did not 
               <br />
               secure to us the use of our language.” The hon. 
               <br />

               gentleman should not forget that, if the Treaty of 
               <br />
               Paris does not secure to us the use of the 
               <br />
               French language, there is the international law, 
               <br />
               a law common to all nations, which secures to us 
               <br />
               some rights and gives us some privileges, and it is 
               <br />

               new idea. The Quebec Act was framed upon

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               These are the principles laid down by the then

               Solicitor General of England, principles which 
               <br />
               have guided the British Parliament in legislating 
               <br />
               for her colonies. What has been the effect of 
               <br />
               that legislation ‘3 It has been such that Eng- 
               <br />
               land has preserved a strong hold upon her 
               <br />
               possessions, which to-day are more than 8,000,000 
               <br />
               square miles in extent, and the population of 
               <br />
               which numbers more than 200,000,000 of loyal 
               <br />
               and devoted British subjects. Such has not 
               <br />

               <br />
               the government of their foreign possessions, for 
               <br />
               they have acquiredpossessions and colonies andlost 
               <br />
               them, because they were not faithful to the principles 
               <br />
               laid down by Solicitor General VVedderburn. 
               <br />
               These ideas are not only those of that English 
               <br />

               tesquieu, in his work entitled the “ Spirit of the 
               <br />
               Laws,” says:

               “ One of the great principles of the s irit of conquest 
               <br />
               ought to he to render the condition of t e conquered as 
               <br />
               much better as possible: this is to fulﬁl at once the law 
               <br />
               of nature, and a maxim of state.

               “ It may sometimes be necessary to change the laws of 
               <br />
               the conquered people; it can never be so to deprive them 
               <br />
               of their manners, or even of their customs, which are 
               <br />
               often all they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formanners.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> the surest way of 
               <br />
               preserving a conquest is to put, if it is DOSSlble, the con- 
               <br />
               quered on a level With the conquerors, to grant them the 
               <br />
               same rights and the same principles.”

               So we ﬁnd that the author of the “ Spirit of Laws” 
               <br />
               clearly says that we ought to put the conquered on 
               <br />
               the same level as the conquerors, and grant them 
               <br />
               the same rights and the same privileges. That is 
               <br />
               the way we in this Dominion Wish to be treated.
