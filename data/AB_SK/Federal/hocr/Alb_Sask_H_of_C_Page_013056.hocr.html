               would be, since so much depended upon 
               <br />
               the character of those appointed to it. He 
               <br />
               thought it was a wise provision not to at

               once extend legislative powers to the new

               <br />
               500inhabitants, but when they increased to

               increased in the same ratio, he thought it 
               <br />
               would be right to give them local legisla— 
               <br />
               tive powers. His objection to the North- 
               <br />
               West Council as at present constituted 
               <br />
               was that many of its members knew

               nothing more of the country than gentle—

               <br />
               had of other far distant countries. How- 
               <br />
               ever, there were atleast six of them who knew

               dious thing for these gentlemen to get up 
               <br />
               and tell their fellow-councillors that they 
               <br />
               knew nothing at all about it. Itwould be

               were the least acquainted with a subject 
               <br />
               were the most ready to give advice. He 
               <br />
               thought on the Whole it was very much 
               <br />
               better that they should have the Council

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnd</span> that a port on Lake Superior belonged

               whether it did or not the people of Ontario

               would give it to them as a matter of grace. 
               <br />
               The point brought up by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for South Ontario was an important one, 
               <br />
               and he was glad to ﬁnd that the First

               Minister intended to introduce a provision

               <br />
               who paid the duties. At present the 
               <br />

               <br />
               were acquainted with the North-West 
               <br />
               Territory would agree with him that it 
               <br />
               was a most difﬁcult matter to establish a 
               <br />
               proper and efﬁcient system of Government 
               <br />
               there. He was very much pleased with 
               <br />
               the general features of the Bill. He dis- 
               <br />
               sented from the view of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Kingston that the Lieut. Governor of 
               <br />
               Manitoba could efﬁciently administer the 
               <br />
               Government of the territories. That sys- 
               <br />
               tem had proved a failure, and though he 
               <br />
               was a member of the council he must 
               <br />
               frankly admit that it was impossible for 
               <br />
               them under the circumstances to efﬁciently 
               <br />
               carry out the laws in the territory. He 
               <br />
               believed with the member for South Bruce 
               <br />
               that we must have a strong Government 
               <br />
               in that territory. There was a moral 
               <br />
               power in the cocked hat of a ' Governor, 
               <br />
               and in the coat of a policeman. Large 
               <br />
               powers should be given to the proposed 
               <br />
               new council. It was not advisable in his 
               <br />
               opinion to give representative institutions 
               <br />
               to that territory just now. However, he 
               <br />
               would discuss the details of the measure 
               <br />
               at a future stage, and he hoped the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov‘</span> 
               <br />
               ernment would receive in a kindly spirit 
               <br />
               the suggestions of those who were familar 
               <br />
               with the condition and wants of that 
               <br />
               country. With regard to the mounted 
               <br />
               police, he must say that under its present 
               <br />
               able commander it had proved a very 
               <br />
               efﬁcient force. He regretted that the 
               <br />
               Government decided upon Fort Pelly as 
               <br />
               the seat of Government for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North.</span> 
               <br />
               West, as in his opinion it possessed no 
               <br />
               recommendation except the fact that it 
               <br />
               would have telegraph communication. 
               <br />
               However, as there was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provision'in</span> the 
               <br />
               Bill for a change in the seat of Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, if it was deemed advisable he would 
               <br />
               raise no objection on that head.
