               zatlon, I have had the honour to discuss the 
               <br />
               matter with the members of the House of 
               <br />
               Commons from the territories. I have asked 
               <br />
               them to consider whether it would be advisa- 
               <br />
               ble to have such legislation introduced this 
               <br />
               year. We are as you know introducing a re- 
               <br />
               distribution measure at the present session and 
               <br />
               we are giving to the territories a 'much larger 
               <br />
               representation in the House of Commons than 
               <br />
               they would be entitled to were they to be- 
               <br />
               come a province. In fact the Bill which we 
               <br />
               have introduced, allows to the territories a 
               <br />
               representation in the House of Commons of 
               <br />
               10 members. Were they to be admitted at once 
               <br />
               as a. province they would be entitled only to six 
               <br />
               members. It would be a question of extreme 
               <br />
               difﬁculty and complications to give to the terri-

               My hon. friendl (Mr. Oliver) is quite right

               in suggesting—if he intended to make that 
               <br />
               suggestion—that there is no direct statement 
               <br />
               in the letter of the Prime Minister that it 
               <br />
               was the opinion of the hon. members from 
               <br />
               the territories that such legislation should 
               <br />

               <br />
               ference that has been drawn by Mr. Haul— 
               <br />
               tain is the only possible inference. It is this:

               that the Prime Minister, having consulted

               <br />
               the conclusion that it would not be advisable 
               <br />
               to introduce legislation this year, they must 
               <br />
               have been of the opinion which the Prime

               <br />
               ernment. 
               <br />

               Then he deals with certain details as to 
               <br />
               these two bridges, and he concludes his letter
