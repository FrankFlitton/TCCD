               <br />
               what I want to say is this, that the attitude 
               <br />

               quence of these criticisms,continued too long. 
               <br />
               I remember when it was determined—I hap-

               <br />
               byanother gentleman, to close up the mile 
               <br />
               belt. and to close up Southern Manitoba; 
               <br />
               and a man whom we all honoured greatly. 
               <br />
               and whose memory we honour in this House, 
               <br />
               the late John Henry Pope. who was then 
               <br />
               Minister of Agriculture, told me 'of this, and 
               <br />
               said he thought it was a very serious step. 
               <br />
               I thought so, too, and I went to the Acting 
               <br />
               Minister and tried to argue him out of it: 
               <br />
               but I failed to do it, and Southern Manitoba 
               <br />
               and the mile belt were closed. It was a 
               <br />
               very bad policy. I commenced at once to 
               <br />
               attack the policy ; and in the papers down 
               <br />
               in the cast I was attacked for attacking the 
               <br />
               policy of the Department of the Interior of 
               <br />
               that day. To his honour, be it said, the late 
               <br />
               Sir John Macdonald, my leader of that day. 
               <br />
               wrote to me: “ Don’t mind these attacks 
               <br />
               upon you; you express the opinion of the 
               <br />
               country where you are. and it would be a 
               <br />
               most disastrous thing if you expressed the 
               <br />
