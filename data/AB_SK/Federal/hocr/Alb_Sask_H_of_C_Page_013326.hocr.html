               <br />
               dismayed at the conclusions arrived at by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Durham. He has concluded his 
               <br />
               train of reasoning by these forcible words : if justice 
               <br />
               is not done to the minorities, if we kindle in this 
               <br />
               country a war of races, a religious war, neither 
               <br />
               prosperity nor progress will everbe possibilities for 
               <br />
               us. I do not know, Mr. Speaker, which ought to 
               <br />
               frighten us the most, whether it be this formidable 
               <br />
               conclusion or the inevitable contained in this con— 
               <br />
               clusion. If the policy of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe should prevail, I believe that the con- 
               <br />
               clusion of the hon. member West Durham is inevit— 
               <br />
               able. I think that every patriot who loves his 
               <br />
               country, no matter to what nationality he may 
               <br />
               belong, should make superhuman efforts to keep 
               <br />
               the nation far from the path of discord into 
               <br />
               which the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               and his friends desire to thrust it. I think that 
               <br />
               every public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mam—and</span> it seems to me that they 
               <br />

               berland (Mr. Mitchell), intensely warlike as he is, 
               <br />
               has spoken with moderation and wisdom. He also 
               <br />
               has come to the aid of the Government to assist 
               <br />
               them in settling this difﬁcult matter,—all public 
               <br />
               men should work together in concert, and with all 
               <br />
               possible energy, to lift us from the way of discord 
               <br />

               Mr. SCRIVER. Mr. Speaker, in view of the 
               <br />
               great length to which this debate has extended, it 
               <br />
               having now occupied seven days, and sympathising 
               <br />
               as I do with the natural impatience of the House, 
               <br />
               I shall not detain hon. members more than such 
               <br />
               time as will enable me, in a very few words, to ex- 
               <br />
               plain the position I take on this question. I regret 
               <br />
               exceedingly that the question which is now before 
               <br />
               the House has been brought into it. I feared, when 
               <br />
               the Bill of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) was introduced, it would give rise not 
               <br />
               only to great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> of opinion, but perhaps to 
               <br />
               angry and intemperate discussion, and would excite 
               <br />
               great feeling, not only in the House, but through- 
               <br />
               out the length and breadth of the land. The im- 
               <br />
               passioned, not to say intemperate, utterances of 
               <br />
               some leading members on both sides of the House 
               <br />
               have satisﬁed me that my apprehension had some 
               <br />
               foundation. I was desirous, therefore, that some 
               <br />
               solution of the question should be reached which 
               <br />
               would remove it from this House, and relegate it 
               <br />
               to some authority to which it would be reasonable, 
               <br />
               just and fair to refer it, and I was glad, therefore, 
               <br />
               when the hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) 
               <br />
               submitted the amendment he proposed. It met 
               <br />
               my views completely under the circumstances, and 
               <br />
               I determined at the time it was submitted that, 
               <br />
               unless some modiﬁcation of it was roposed which 
               <br />
               Would more fully meet my views, would support 
               <br />
               it. With regard to the amendment proposed by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice, it does not meet my views 
               <br />
               as does the amendment submitted by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). I think 
               <br />
               that if the decision of this question is relegated to 
               <br />
               the people of the North-VVest, whom it mainly 
               <br />
               concerns, those people should be given the power

               Mr. LAURIER. Mr. Speaker, a few days ago, 
               <br />
               in the course of this debate, I stated that my 
               <br />
               opinion was that the best and most proper time to 
               <br />
               settle this question would be when Parliament 
               <br />
               felt that the time had come to extend to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories a larger measure of local 
               <br />
               autonomy than they now enjoy. I voted for the 
               <br />
               amendment of the hon. member for Berthier 
               <br />
               (Mr. Beausoleil) on this express condition. I did 
               <br />
               not approve altogether of the wording of the 
               <br />
               amendment of my hon. friend ; but I thought, on 
               <br />
               the whole, that the idea therein expressed, that 
               <br />
               our institutions in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“’est</span> should be 
               <br />
               permanent, was true to this extent, that they 
               <br />
               should be permanent in every particular so long as 
               <br />
               the present form of government in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-IVest</span> 
               <br />
               endured. This view has not prevailed, and the 
               <br />
               consequence is that the House is not called upon 
               <br />
               to deal with this question. I then also stated that 
               <br />
               when the time came, be that time early or late, 
               <br />
               the only way to deal with the question before 
               <br />
               the House would be on the broad principle 
               <br />
               of local autonomy. I thought from the ﬁrst, and 
               <br />
               I still more than ever believe it, that the only 
               <br />
               method under which we can carry out the system 
               <br />
               of Confederation, the only method by which we 
               <br />
               can give justice and fair play to minorities, wher-

               ever minorities may be situated, will depend alto— 
               <br />
               gether on the adoption of the principle of local au- 
               <br />
               tonomy. It has been stated to-day that there really 
               <br />
               is no question of autonomy or Provincial rights here. 
               <br />
               It may be said we have no Provincial ri hts, in 
               <br />
               the technical sense, inthe Territories, but t e prin- 
               <br />
               ciple involved is the same. Although the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories have not been organised into Provinces, the 
               <br />
               principle applying to the case is the same as if they 
               <br />
               had been so organised. The only difference is 
               <br />
               that their powers would be supreme and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abso-</span> 
               <br />
               lute if they were organised into Provinces, 
               <br />
               and that they should not, in my judgment, be 
               <br />
               subject to the revision of the Central Government. 
               <br />
               For all that, the principle remains unimpaired, and 
               <br />
               should be acted u n, that the will of the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories a ected ought to be the will which
