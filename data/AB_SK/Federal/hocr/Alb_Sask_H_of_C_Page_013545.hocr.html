               ter which requires a very great expenditure 
               <br />
               in a country of the immense extent of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories, some parts of which

               large rivers. The subject of education is one 
               <br />
               of no less importance. In a country like 
               <br />
               'the North-west Territories, where a very

               people of Ganada, one of the very highest

               importance. As illustrating the need of an 
               <br />
               increase in the vote by this House for the 
               <br />
               purposes of the legislative assembly, I will 
               <br />
               quote some ﬁgures to show the way in which 
               <br />
               the school districts have been increasing 
               <br />
               in number. At the end of 1896 there were 
               <br />
               436 public school districts. These had been 
               <br />
               organized since 1884, when the public 
               <br />
               school system was inaugurated. At the end 
               <br />
               of 1897 there were 459 school districts, be- 
               <br />
               ing an increase of 21 districts in that year. 
               <br />
               At the end of 1898 there were 480, there 
               <br />
               being an increase of 23. At the end of 1899 
               <br />
               the number had risen to 524, there being an 
               <br />
               increase of 44. At the end of 1900 there 
               <br />
               were 576, an increase of 52. At the end 
               <br />
               of 1901 the number of school districts which 
               <br />
               had been organized was 684, showing an 
               <br />
               increase during the last year of 108 dis- 
               <br />
               tricts. The expenditure of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories upon education in 1901 was $204,- 
               <br />
               000, being something more than half of the 
               <br />
               total grant made by this parliament <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> all 
               <br />

               North-west Territories. I neglected to men-

               tion, in regard to the subject of public 
               <br />
               works, that the expenditure made last year 
               <br />
               was in the neighbourhood of-$250,000, so 
               <br />
               that it will be seen that the expenditure on 
               <br />
               education and public works, on these two 
               <br />
               subjects, more than took up the whole of 
               <br />
               the yearly grant made by parliament last 
               <br />

               in regard to brands shall be carefully 
               <br />
               administered. During last year, I believe 
               <br />
               there were no less than 10,000 new brands

               <br />
               a miscellaneous vote of $5,000, making

               a total, outside the subjects of public works 
               <br />

               it would be proﬁtable for me, or for any

               <br />
               to endeavour to make any comparisons 
               <br />
               between the expenditures in one part of the 
               <br />
               country and in another, I am going to say, 
               <br />
               and I think this principle has been largely 
               <br />
               followed, that wherever any service seems 
               <br />
               to be advisable and necessary this House 
               <br />
               should endeavour to provide adequately for 
               <br />
               that service. I believe that is the proper 
               <br />
               principle, and I believe that if that principle 
               <br />
               be applied in this case, parliament will at 
               <br />
               the present session grant a very large in- 
               <br />
               crease in the vote for the purpose of gov- 
               <br />
               erning locally the North-west Territories. 
               <br />
               Just to show what is the position of the local 
               <br />
               authority up there at the present time, I 
               <br />
               Will quote a few brief ﬁgures. In the year 
               <br />
               1899 the grant made by parliament for gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in the North-west Territories was 
               <br />
               $283,000, but the total amount expended 
               <br />
