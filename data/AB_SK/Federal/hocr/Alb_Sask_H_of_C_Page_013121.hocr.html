               Mr. DAVIN. I happened to be in Hamilton at 
               <br />
               the time, under more auspicious circumstances, but 
               <br />
               I have read that speech carefully, and the remark- 
               <br />
               able thing about it is that it is one of a series 
               <br />
               illustrating the law of evolution ; because they go 
               <br />
               on bit by bit ; they repeat themselves considerably, 
               <br />
               but still, at each step, my hon. and learned friend 
               <br />
               shows that the doctrine of Darwin is applic- 
               <br />
               able even to great politicians, and he illustrates 
               <br />
               the law of evolution. I said a moment ago that I 
               <br />
               had not the honor of hearing that speech, but, Sir, 
               <br />
               I had the honor of reading his speech that had 
               <br />
               been delivered in Ottawa, a speech going over the 
               <br />
               same ground. It was, after all, the same old stuﬁ“, 
               <br />
               but with a little evolution. So <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> although I 
               <br />
               did not hear the speech I am tolerably familiar 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend’s opinions on these 
               <br />
               subjects, and I may say that in the course 
               <br />
               of a pretty long political life, in the sense that I 
               <br />
               have been studying politics all my life, and 
               <br />
               have had an opportunity of hearing most politicians 
               <br />
               in England and Canada, and prominent politicians 
               <br />
               in France, I have never met with speeches so 
               <br />
               wanting in logic from so distinguished a man. 
               <br />
               Those speeches have two peculiar characteristics. 
               <br />
               The one is that my hon. and learned friend has 
               <br />
               taken to dilating on questions that, from his busy 
               <br />
               life, he was evidently not conversant with, and I 
               <br />
               am sorry to say that from a somewhat cold manner 
               <br />
               he has lapsed into violent appeals to passions that 
               <br />
               can do nothing but harm. Now, Sir, this question 
               <br />
               is a local one, and for that reason I consider that 
               <br />
               it should be dealt with by the Local Legislature. 
               <br />
               Some French gentlemen have gone in there, because 
               <br />
               we have had a small French immigration. Some 
               <br />
               of our most useful citizens are French gentlemen. 
               <br />
               They have come there with much wealth, and 
               <br />
               one of them is a coffee grower, M. de Roﬁignac 
               <br />
               Von Brabandt who has started south of VVhiteWOOd 
               <br />
               the cultivation of chicory. This House will probably 
               <br />
               be surprised to hear that Canada has become a 
               <br />
               coffee-growing country. We have in the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W'est</span> coﬂ'ee plantations at the present minute, and 
               <br />
               when my hon. and learned friend next goes there 
               <br />
               we shall be able to regale him with a cup of coffee, 
               <br />
               if with nothing better, before he dilates on his 
               <br />
               favorite topics.

               Mr. DAVIN. Oh, I forgot, that would not agree 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend. Well, Sir, the View that I 
               <br />
               take is this, and it is a View that I have taken here 
               <br />
               twice in regard to the second homestead. I say 
               <br />
               that if that law is on the Statute-book, a French 
               <br />
               gentleman who has gone into the N orth-VVest 
               <br />
               under that 110th clause has a right to complain if 
               <br />
               it is repealed without his having something to say. 
               <br />
               We have a certain quantum of French population 
               <br />
               along the Saskatchewan ; we have a small French 
               <br />
               speaking population to the south, and although 
               <br />
               they are greatly outnumbered, the bare fact of 
               <br />
               their being outnumbered is a reason why, without 
               <br />
               giving them a hearing, we should not repeal this 
               <br />
               clause. Now, as I said, this speech is a part of a 
               <br />
               series. I will say that on some subjects in which 
               <br />

               remember that the last time that I spoke and 
               <br />

               <br />
               Now, let me make this remark. He says there 
               <br />
               is no such thing as a Celtic skull or a Saxon skull. 
               <br />
               I suppose there is no such thing as a Jewish skull 
               <br />
               or an Aztec skull; and yet I have read some very 
               <br />
               scientiﬁc treatises in which I have seen the differ- 
               <br />
               ences in skulls pointed out. Again he says : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               N 0w, I will explain how my hon. friend has fallen 
               <br />
               into such a proposition as this. He has read 
               <br />
               treatises on language, especially as it affects modern 
               <br />
               thought ; and it is rather—I do not like to say it, 
               <br />
               I do not like to say that he did not understand it, 
               <br />
               because it would be impolite, and I could not be 
               <br />
               impolite—but I will say this, that he is so busy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> 
               <br />
               man that he has not time to inform himself properly, 
               <br />
               and perhaps he is too much of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mad</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prim</span> advocate 
               <br />
               to be accurate, and too much of a mere lawyer to 
               <br />
               be a statesman. But remember the two proposi- 
               <br />
               tions that he lays down. The ﬁrst proposition is, 
               <br />
               that language makes the race and the nation ; and 
               <br />
               as you may have seen in his speech delivered at 
               <br />
               Ottawa, he lays down the proposition that with 
               <br />
               diversity of language to make a nation is impossible. 
               <br />
               Now, the important thing about that proposition 
               <br />
               is this : It is sent broadcast into ignorant ears, and 
               <br />
               if that last proposition is true we may despair 
               <br />
               of Canada. That is the important thing about 
               <br />
               these hurried deductions from superﬁcial studies. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend, in his Ottawa speech and in the 
               <br />
               speech delivered in this House also, talks about 
               <br />
               making this a British colony. Sir, is not this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> 
               <br />
               British colony ‘3 Let us be just. Why is it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> 
               <br />
               British colony ? It is so because of that very 
               <br />
               Lower Canadian French race that seems to act 
               <br />
               like a red rag <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.on</span> a bull on the mind of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend ; for we know this very well, that there was 
               <br />
               a time in. the history of Canada when that race 
               <br />
               had just passed over to the British ﬂag, when 
               <br />
               temptations were held out to them to join the 
               <br />
               thirteen colonies, and if they had not been true to 
               <br />
               their new-found allegiance, if their loyalty had not 
               <br />
               been impregnable against the seductions of Franklin 
               <br />
               and others, we should have had no British colony 
               <br />
               here to-day. Let us be just, if my hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">canr</span> 
               <br />
               not be generous. I will say this, because I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want.</span> 
               <br />
               to help my hon. friend. My hon. friend does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not.</span> 
               <br />
               profess, he says, to be a very devout man, but still he 
               <br />
               com lains bitterly that the Roman Catholic Church 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">istollerated</span> in a manner in this country that our laws 
               <br />
               hardly permit. That is his lan ge, addressed to 
               <br />
               ignorant and passionate ears. I ave the documents
