               <br />
               well~known in this district, and he is now one of the most 
               <br />
               successful men in the whole North-West. He has a large 
               <br />
               herd, farms extensively, and has probably made some 
               <br />
               820,000 in the North-West. He is here at the present 
               <br />

               <br />
               has succeeded so well. A moment ago I spoke about the 
               <br />
               schools in the N orth-West, and I shall now refer to them 
               <br />
               again. This House will be glad to know that in that new 
               <br />
               region opened up six years ago we have 167 schools at the

               <br />
               the Government, and especially on the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, that I really think a step might be taken further in 
               <br />
               the matter of education and something done in the way of 
               <br />
               having a high school at some central place. The children 
               <br />
               that went to our ordinary schools six years ago have now 
               <br />
               grown beyond the teachers, and we ought to have a high 
               <br />
               school for them. I spoke to you a moment ago about that 
               <br />
               Assembly which has charge of so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">important}</span> part of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'our</span> 
               <br />
               interests. It has very wide powers now and it is gliding into 
               <br />
               responsible government. That Assembly passed a number 
               <br />
               of memorials which it desired should be brought before this 
               <br />
               House. I do not intend to occupy your time at any great 
               <br />
               length, and I will rapidly describe what those memorials are. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst relates to a subject which need not be impressed 
               <br />
               upon any hon. member: it is the necessity of opening <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iip</span> as

               rapidly as possible the Saskatchewan district by railway

               their part in this matter and that we shall soon have a 
               <br />
               railway openin up the Saskatchewan territory. It is a 
               <br />
               district of the orth- West which is, if anything, more 
               <br />
               attractive than even our prairies along the line, because it 
               <br />
               is varied with hill and forest and stream, and the House 
               <br />
               will easily understand what an attractive place for immi- 
               <br />
               gration it will be when a railway gives facilities for the 
               <br />
               ingress of immigrants and for the egress of the crops and 
               <br />
               products which they grow. Of course, at the present mo- 
               <br />
               ment there is no encouragement to settlers to grow craps, 
               <br />
               because, if they grow them, they have no market within 
               <br />
               reach. The next memorial relates to what are called 
               <br />
               the loyal half-breeds. I do not know much about the 
               <br />
               subject myself, but my hon. friend from Saskatchewan (Mr. 
               <br />
               Macdowall) will be better acquainted with the particulars. 
               <br />
               It is contended that there were some loyal half-breeds 
               <br />
               who suﬁ'ered losses, and, notwithstanding their loyalty, their 
               <br />
               losses have not been recouped. The Assembly now pray 
               <br />
               that His Excellency will be authorised to have such steps 
               <br />
               taken as will cause a reconsideration of the whole subject 
               <br />
               of the claims of half-breeds for losses during the rebel- 
               <br />
               lion, with a view to compensate those who proved them- 
               <br />
               selves to have been loyal, with such amounts as may 
               <br />
               be shown to be equal to their losses. The next memorial 
               <br />
               relates to providing seed grain for any person in a part of 
               <br />
               the N orth-West Territories whose crops may have failed. 
               <br />
               In the district with which I am connected there have been 
               <br />
               no failures whatever, and I am not aware of any failure in 
               <br />
               crops along the line. But I suppose there must have been 
               <br />
               failure in some districts, or this resolution would not have 
               <br />
               been passed by the Assembly. I come now to a resolution 
               <br />
               which deals with a burning question in the North-

               West, that is the liquor question. Ever since I went

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> in there that question has created great restlessness,

               and I think myself it has created unreasonable restless- 
               <br />
               ness when we remember that no man went into 
               <br />
               the territory without knowing that it was a prohibitory 
               <br />
               territory. Every man that went there knew that prohibi- 
               <br />
               tion obtained, and as I have often said to some of my 
               <br />
               friends who grumbled very loudly on this subject, it was 
               <br />
               one on which they had no right to grumble about, because 
               <br />
               they knew it was a prohibitory territory when they went 
               <br />
               in there. Notwithstanding this, however, the question has 
               <br />
               created a great deal of feeling. The settlers somehow seem 
               <br />
               to think it hard that they had to ask a permit from anyone, 
               <br />
               and I have heard men, because they were refused a permit, 
               <br />
               talk as though they had good grounds for ﬂat rebellion . I 
               <br />
               will say this in passing: The hon. gentleman who is Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Interior, and who had the administering of that 
               <br />
               permit system, had one of the most diﬂicult tasks to per- 
               <br />
               form that any man could undertake. No one course would 
               <br />
               please everybody, and to do one’s duty in refusing a permit 
               <br />
               to men who ought not to get it was sure to make enemies. 
               <br />
               I always sympathised with the hon. gentleman in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁcult</span> 
               <br />
               task he had to perform in dealing with that permit system. 
               <br />
               Now, here is the position at present. The four per cent. 
               <br />
               beer has been admitted wholesale by a special permit. It is 
               <br />
               not strong enough for some people, and it is too strong for 
               <br />
               others; the consequence is that there is a great desire to 
               <br />
               have this question settled, both on the part of those in favor 
               <br />
               of high license and on the part of those strictly temperance 
               <br />
               people who would like to see prohibition established, even 
               <br />
               unqualiﬁed by permit. There is a great deal to be said in 
               <br />
               favor of settling this question rapidly. In the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               we can grow in the North-West the ﬁnest barley that ever 
               <br />
               rewarded farmer’s toil, and beer and whiskey are both 
               <br />
               brought in from outside. Over 7,000 gallons of whiskey 
               <br />
               was brought in last year by permit, yielding a revenue of 
               <br />
               over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">83,000</span> from permits; and yet the amount of whiskey 
               <br />
               brought in contraband from Montana Colonel Herchmer 
               <br />
               will tell you, is simply incalculable. Parties bring it in, 
               <br />
               cache it two miles from the town, and on moonlight nights 
               <br />
