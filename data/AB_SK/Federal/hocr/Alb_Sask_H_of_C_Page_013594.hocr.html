               the next twenty-ﬁve years we may have a 
               <br />
               million people in the far west. No man can 
               <br />
               see what effect that will have upon the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation, and the fact that one-twentieth 
               <br />
               was put as the margin of stability shows 
               <br />
               that the framers of confederation were 
               <br />
               not considering so wide a ﬁeld. They 
               <br />
               were conﬁning themselves to the four old 
               <br />
               provinces whose population was fairly well 
               <br />
               settled, and the whole of the provisions 
               <br />
               show that they were framing these words 
               <br />
               in reference to it. If you take section 51 
               <br />
               you will see that it clearly refers in explicit 
               <br />
               terms to the four provinces, not to the prov- 
               <br />
               inces of the Dominion, but explicitly to the 
               <br />
               four provinces. When we take subsection 
               <br />
               4 of that very section we can have no doubt 
               <br />
               that the word ‘Canada‘ means the four 
               <br />
               provinces there referred to. Why should 
               <br />
               you go beyond it '2 It seems to me a 
               <br />
               clear and reasonable reading of the 
               <br />
               words in the main section to use the 
               <br />
               word ‘ Canada ’ as deﬁned by the Act itself. 
               <br />
               If you go outside of these four provinces, 
               <br />
               you introduce a disturbing element. What 
               <br />
               had these people, dealing with the readjust— 
               <br />
               ment of their own representation, to do 
               <br />
               with the people that might come into Mani- 
               <br />
               toba or British Columbia -? How did that 
               <br />
               concern the question between themselves? 
               <br />
               If Ontario and Quebec were jealous of each 
               <br />
               other, were nervous about the effect of the 
               <br />
               future upon their relative representation, 
               <br />
               what had they to do with the number of 
               <br />
               people that might come into British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia, the North-west Territories or the Yu- 
               <br />
               kon? These were elements quite outside 
               <br />
               of the calculation. The deﬁnition of the 
               <br />
               word ‘ Canada ’ by the Act is consistent and 
               <br />
               reasonable with What they were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">driving</span> at ; 
               <br />
               that is keeping their relative positions, in so 
               <br />
               far as they could be provided for by Act of 
               <br />
               parliament. I repeat what other hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men have said, that nobody would, espe- 
               <br />

               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice has read, say that

               there was no doubt upon this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> 
               <br />
               There certainly is such a doubt that it 
               <br />
               would be extremely unsafe to go on and 
               <br />
               provide for a parliament upon a new basis 
               <br />
               of representation, perhaps elect a par- 
               <br />
               liament, and leave the question in such 
               <br />
               a condition that hereafter—when Acts 
               <br />
               have been passed and corporations created 
               <br />
               and all sorts of interests dealt with—that 
               <br />
               we might ﬁnd that under an appeal of pri-

               highest court, decided that all our procedure 
               <br />

               Mr. E. A. LANCASTER (Lincoln and

               <br />
               few words on this very important measure, 
               <br />

               strained to oppose the second reading of 
               <br />

               this Bill is read a second time, then every

               Justice this afternoon as a justiﬁcation for 
               <br />
               opposing the second reading of this Bill 
               <br />
               under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> existing circumstances. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice told us to-day as clearly 
               <br />
               as he could state it in language, that the 
               <br />
               measure is not ripe for second reading, for 
               <br />
               he declared that there may be some doubt 
               <br />
               concerning the rights of the parties as 
               <br />
               declared by this Bill. In view of that state- 
               <br />
               ment made by the chief legal adviser of the 
               <br />
               government, I was somewhat surprised 
               <br />
               that the right hen. the Prime Minister did 
               <br />
               not withdraw his motion, and acting upon 
               <br />
               the advice of his Minister of Justice post- 
               <br />
               pone the second reading of the measure 
               <br />
               until the rights of the parties were deﬁned 
               <br />
               by the courts. We are in this position now. 
               <br />
               We have a very serious constitutional ques- 
               <br />
               tion brought before us. This parliament is 
               <br />
               asked to legislate in regard to a serious in-

               certain representation in this House. We 
               <br />
               are asked by this Bill to say. without any 
               <br />
               more ado about it, that a change in the re-

               presentation of these provinces shall be 
               <br />
               made to their detriment and made at once, 
               <br />
               and we are asked to declare that, in face
