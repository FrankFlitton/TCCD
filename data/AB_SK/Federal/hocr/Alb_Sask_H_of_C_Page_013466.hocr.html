               constitution of a province can be amended

               <br />
               deals with education, because that section is

               being in the majority in Manitoba some 
               <br />
               years ago. It so happened that I spent about 
               <br />
               a year of my life in Manitoba in 1870. and 
               <br />
               my recollection of the matter at that time is 
               <br />
               that the two classes. the Protestants and the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics were about equal in num- 
               <br />
               ber. At any rate we must not forget that 
               <br />
               up to that time the country had been ruled 
               <br />
               by the Hudson Bay Company. that it had 
               <br />
               been ruled as a Crown colony and that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> 
               <br />
               were no rights such as it has been intimated 
               <br />
               they possessed by the member who last 
               <br />
               spoke. There was no such thing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">omcially</span> as 
               <br />
               the French language. Of course many of 
               <br />
               the people spoke it among themselves, and 
               <br />
               there was no wish to interfere with them in 
               <br />
               doing so. but the language was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recon-</span> 
               <br />
               nized <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">omcially</span> at least. It is true that in

               often published in French. but further than

               that the Hudson Bay Company paid no 
               <br />
               attention whatever to anything of that sort. 
               <br />
               The only rights the French people obtained 
               <br />
               were obtained subsequent to that, and were

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IV.</span> F. Maclean. of East York. in which 
               <br />
               he asks me to state: “ If present, I would 
               <br />
               vote with Mr. McCarthy. I am detained 
               <br />
               here.”

               Mr. McNEILL. I wish to say but very 
               <br />
               few words on this subject. I think the fact 
               <br />
               to some extent has been overlooked that we 
               <br />
               are dealing not only with the amendment 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) but also with the expressed wish 
               <br />
               of the Legislative Assembly of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. Those who are opposed to 
               <br />
               the amendment, I think. have carefuny 
               <br />
               avoided any reference to that fact : but it is 
               <br />
               an important fact, and I think that those 
               <br />
               who are asking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> that the representa- 
               <br />
               tives elected by the people of the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories should be allowed the privilege 
               <br />
               of managing their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂairs</span> in reference 
               <br />
               to education. as well as in reference to 
               <br />
               other matters, should not at all events be 
               <br />
               accused of intolerance. I confess I was a 
               <br />
               good deal surprised and a good deal hurt 
               <br />
               to hear the right hon. gentleman who leads 
               <br />
               the Government, speaking of those who ad—

               <br />
               by implying that the people of the provinces

               of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and British
