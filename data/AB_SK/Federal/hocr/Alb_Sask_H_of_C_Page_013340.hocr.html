               Those who take advantage to-day of this report 
               <br />
               are worthy successors of him who prepared it. I 
               <br />
               must here remark, Mr. Speaker, that there exists 
               <br />
               a false impression about the history of this country. 
               <br />
               They Wish to treat us as if we were a conquered 
               <br />
               people, whereas Canada was not conquered but was 
               <br />
               ceded to England under the terms of a treaty. In 
               <br />
               this treaty it is provided that our religion, our 
               <br />
               laws, and our customs as they existed at the time, 
               <br />
               should be protected, and I ask myself whether it 
               <br />
               cannot be afﬁrmed to-day, that Within these con- 
               <br />
               ditions and terms is included the conservation of 
               <br />
               our mother tongue, which we spoke at that time 
               <br />
               and which we still speak. From such reasoning 
               <br />
               it results that when the hon. member for Simcoe 
               <br />
               states that there was no such guarantee in the 
               <br />
               treaty,—-that is to say the guarantee of the use of 
               <br />
               our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language,—~I</span> can tell him his statement is 
               <br />
               false. The gravest insult that can be offered to us 
               <br />
               in the course of this discussion, which has hardly 
               <br />
               yet opened in this House; is that men should 
               <br />
               Wish to have our enemies believe that because we 
               <br />
               do not use the English language habitually we are 
               <br />
               not loyal subjects of Her Majesty. They attack 
               <br />
               us on this line when taxing us with disloyalty. 
               <br />
               Well, when we see what our ancestors did when 
               <br />
               the time had come to defend the frontier, can it 
               <br />
               not be fairly said that they showed themselves 
               <br />
               quite as loyal if not more loyal than our fellow 
               <br />
               subjects of British origin? Can it be that people 
               <br />
               have forgotten the celebrated battles which we 
               <br />
               fought against our powerful neighbors the 
               <br />
               Americans <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> And if Canada still remains a British 
               <br />
               possession, to whom does England owe its retention 
               <br />
               if not to the French—but still loyal—population 
               <br />
               of the Province of Quebec. No, Mr. Speaker, in

               the present state of affairs they have thought it 
               <br />
               expedient to endeavor to exite prejudices in order 
               <br />
               perhaps to avenge the defeat which they suffered

               last yearin another matter; but onthis question, as

               on every other where our laws and our religion are 
               <br />
               attacked, I believe that we shall remain unmoved; 
               <br />
               and more particularly, that we shall defend in this

               they have read it and can form a mature judgment 
               <br />
               upon it. There is a good deal that I would per—

               remarks. I will not do so to—day; but the hon.

               gentleman will permit me to give him a piece of' 
               <br />
               information as to which he appears to be in 
               <br />
               obscurity. He wants to know what was the 
               <br />
               cause that the Liberal candidate was defeated in 
               <br />
               the County of Richelieu. So far as my informa- 
               <br />
               tion goes, I have always understood that the cause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">»</span>

               duced what my hon. friend calls controversial

               taken in making my statement, which I endeavored 
               <br />
               to make as impartial and fair as possible, on the

               I have made my statement now and hon. gentlemen
