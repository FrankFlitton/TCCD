               It is the view of the government that it will 
               <br />
               not be wise at the present time to pass legis- 
               <br />
               lation forming the North-west Territories into 
               <br />
               a. province or provinces. Some of the reasons 
               <br />
               leading to this view may be found in the fact 
               <br />
               that the population or the territories is yet 
               <br />
               sparse; that the rapid increase in population 
               <br />
               now taking place will in a short time alter 
               <br />
               the conditions to be dealt with very materially 
               <br />
               and that there is a considerable divergence of 
               <br />
               opinion respecting the question whether there 
               <br />
               should be one province only, or more than one 
               <br />
               province. Holding this view, therefore, it will 
               <br />
               not be necessary for me to discuss the details 
               <br />
               of the draft Bill which you presented as em-

               I may say, in connection with this matter, 
               <br />
               which I think has been alluded to also by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Prime Minister during 
               <br />
               the present session, that the difference of 
               <br />
               opinion as to whether there should be one 
               <br />
               province or two provinces does not seem a 
               <br />
               suﬂicient reason for withholding provincial 
               <br />
               status from the North-west Territories. Are 
               <br />
               the people of those territories to be for ever 
               <br />
               deprived of the status enjoyed by the people 
               <br />

               <br />
               there may not be absolute unanimity as to 
               <br />
               whether there shall be one province or two 
               <br />
               provinces or three provinces? It is not likely 
               <br />
               at any time in the future that you will have 
               <br />
               absolute unanimity in the North-west Ter—

               ritories with regard to a matter of that

               kind. It is only a detail after you have once

               settled the principle that the time has ar-

               Mr. Haultain replied to that letter on the

               That language of Mr. Sifton is very signi-

               <br />
               he said there Was very much in the sugges-

               Another reason advanced is z ‘ That the rapid 
               <br />
               increase in population now taking place will in a
