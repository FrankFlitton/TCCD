               country, defend the cause of Home Rule and equality of 
               <br />
               rights for all races and all creeds under the British flag.” 
               <br />
               I might quote several other newspapers which have 
               <br />
               declared themselves on this amendment moved by 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Justice, and, without excep- 
               <br />
               tion, they all agree that it is asacriﬁce of the 
               <br />
               rights and privileges of the French population of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest,</span> in order to purchase peace in this 
               <br />
               House, because the Government expect that, if 
               <br />
               this amendment be adopted, we will hear no more 
               <br />
               about the repeal of clause 110 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. But I may say that this is only the 
               <br />
               beginning of the agitation led by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe, and that so long as there will be 
               <br />
               a remnant of French or Catholic institutions, 
               <br />
               whether in the North-West, or in Manitoba, or 
               <br />
               Ontario, or in any other portion of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               we will have that hon. gentleman coming into this 
               <br />
               House, year after year, and endeavoring to per- 
               <br />
               petuate this agitation which has been excited 
               <br />
               under his leadership. There is only one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂective</span> 
               <br />
               way of ﬁnally settling this question, and that is to 
               <br />
               vote for the amendment I have proposed, and thus 
               <br />
               clearly put on record our opinion, which is that of 
               <br />
               almost every hon. gentleman who has spoken, that 
               <br />
               this Bill of the hon. member of North Sinicoe 
               <br />
               is a mischievous attempt to set race against race 
               <br />
               and creed against creed. It is for this House, and 
               <br />
               especially the Government, to take a. bold stand, 
               <br />
               and say, once for all, that such an attempt shall 
               <br />
               not be tolerated, and by a crushing vote of the 
               <br />
               whole House against the ﬁve or six, or it may 
               <br />
               be ten, who would follow the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe, declare that we are not prepared 
               <br />
               to give these men the means of disturbing the good 
               <br />
               feeling and understanding which now exists be- 
               <br />
               tween the two races in this country, and we will 
               <br />
               not allow them to perpetuate the division which 
               <br />
               they have started and which has given rise to 
               <br />
               feelings it will take a long time to allay. It is 
               <br />
               not by yielding to the ﬁre-brands who 0 through 
               <br />
               the country sowin the seeds of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discord,</span> that we 
               <br />
               will become unite , but it is by showing them 
               <br />
               that the good sense of the country, as represented 
               <br />
               in this House, is in a position to deal with them in 
               <br />
               a summary manner by stamping out this agi— 
               <br />
               tation, and showing them they have no stand- 
               <br />
               ing in the House or the country and that 
               <br />
               their course will not be tolerated. I am 
               <br />
               very sorry we are not about to take this course, 
               <br />
               and all the more so because I am obliged 
               <br />
               to separate myself from my most esteemed 
               <br />
               leader, in whom I have always had the greatest 
               <br />
               conﬁdence. But this question has been left an 
               <br />
               open one, and I take the opportunity of voting 
               <br />
               according to my judgment, and in accord with the 
               <br />
               sentiments I feel so strongly in this matter, even 
               <br />
               though I be compelled to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ditfer</span> from my leader. 
               <br />
               Another cause for regret to me is that, by separat- 
               <br />
               ing myself from my leader, I shall be obliged to 
               <br />
               vote in company with the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe, but it will be the ﬁrst time, and I hope 
               <br />
               the last, because I hope that the next time that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, or any other, attempts to create 
               <br />
               trouble in the country, a. more vigorous policy will 
               <br />
