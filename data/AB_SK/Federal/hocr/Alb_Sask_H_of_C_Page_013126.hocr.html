               the breasts of the people of the North-West Terri- 
               <br />
               tories and British Columbia, would all disappear 
               <br />
               in the grand federal feeling that they should ﬁght 
               <br />
               for their common country. Why, Sir, how little 
               <br />
               language has to do with preventing people from 
               <br />
               becoming citizens of a country. I have travelled 
               <br />
               in Alsace-Lorraine where the people speak German. 
               <br />
               They are now under the German ﬂag, but gladly 
               <br />
               would they go back. They fought gallantly under 
               <br />
               the French banner. A more loyal part of France 
               <br />
               than Alsace-Lorraine did not exist. Then take 
               <br />
               the Bretons. I saw in the summer of 1870, Gen. 
               <br />
               Trochu review 300,000 Breton Mobiles in the streets 
               <br />
               of Paris, and there was not a man under the 
               <br />
               rank of ofﬁcer who could speak French ; yet these 
               <br />
               men, when the hour of peril came, went into 
               <br />
               battle and fought just as gallantly and just as 
               <br />
               eagerly as the men who spoke French. N ow, Sir, 
               <br />
               harangues like these, whose dangers I have exposed 
               <br />
               to-night, I hope will cease. They can reﬂect no 
               <br />
               honor on my hon. and learned friend, and I speak 
               <br />
               with truth when I say that I would be jealous for 
               <br />
               his honor. There is no position that he could 
               <br />
               attain, there is no reputation, however bright, that 
               <br />
               he could make, which would not give me great 
               <br />
               pleasure. But such harangues as these can reﬂect 
               <br />
               no credit on him as a statesman, and they are cap— 
               <br />
               able of doing incalculable damage to his country. I, 
               <br />
               for one, whether we have a dual language or not, 
               <br />
               have no fear whatever for Canada. I am perfectly 
               <br />
               certain of Canada’s future. History teaches me 
               <br />
               lessons that history, if he studies it, Will teach my 
               <br />
               hon. and learned friend. Why, Sir, does he knoW 
               <br />
               anything of the genesis of nations ? Does he know 
               <br />
               how one country after another has risen, and hOW 
               <br />
               they have spoken different languages, and how they 
               <br />
               have come together, and fought under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> 
               <br />
               banners, and lived under different governments, 
               <br />
               and gradually become assimilated until the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂel“</span> 
               <br />
               ence of language disappeared, and sometimes a neW 
               <br />
               language was evolved? History will teach my hon- 
               <br />
               friend that he can dispel those fears that have tor- 
               <br />
               tured his imagination, and with which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> 
               <br />
               sought to inﬂame the passions of the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thls</span> 
               <br />
               country. The main propositions that are behind 
               <br />
               his speech, I have shown to be absolutely withou
