               North Norfolk, whom I have met on other ﬁelds, 
               <br />
               is so anxious to observe the rules of the House and 
               <br />
               the decencies of debate. The hon. and learned 
               <br />
               gentleman, for he is entitled to be called the hon. 
               <br />
               and learned gentleman, has read to us a letter 
               <br />
               from Senator Perley. The hon. Senator has been 
               <br />
               a member of this Parliament ; I have known 
               <br />
               him a long time ; some of you have known 
               <br />
               him, and I need not say that I recognise him, 
               <br />
               as you do, as a great authority, this “guide, 
               <br />
               philosopher and friend ” of the hon. and learned 
               <br />
               member for Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). He appears 
               <br />
               in a character eminently suitable to himself, 
               <br />
               to his own views of what his duty to the public 
               <br />
               is, and I think he is eminently suitable as a 
               <br />
               guide to the hon. member from Simcoe. Sir, 
               <br />
               Senator Perley and the hon. member for Simcoe ; 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Simcoe and Senator Perley.

               <br />
               reported in the Empire, and in this speech he de— 
               <br />
               clares to the people of Collingwood that he did not 
               <br />
               want this Parliament to deal with this question, 
               <br />
               but he wanted the people of the North-VVest todeal 
               <br />
               with it, the very thing that he denounces to-night. 
               <br />

               for the hon- and learned gentleman for Simcoe-— 
               <br />
               that no message whatever had come from the 
               <br />
               people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest.</span> Why? Because this 
               <br />
               assembly had not got any authority from its creator 
               <br />
               to deal with this question. By dealing with this 
               <br />
               question he must mean to legislate on it; so he 
               <br />
               says that we cannot receive any representation 
               <br />
               from them because they had no power to legislate 
               <br />
               on it ; but if they had any power to legislate on it, 
               <br />
               they would not require to make any representation 
               <br />
               at all. The point was taken up very properly by 
               <br />
               my hon. and learned friend that it was only 
               <br />
               three short years before that we heard the

               hon. and learned member for West Durham 
               <br />
               propose in this House a resolution with regard 
               <br />
               to Home Rule of which we were not in any

               wise seized ; yet he asked us to pass a resolution, 
               <br />
               and showed that he thought our representation 
               <br />
               ought to have some effect, or might have some

               I want to refer to a personal matter. I saw a criti-

               whether that is correct or not, but I hope it was

               the hon. and learned gentleman were the weapons

               of a gentleman. The hon. and learned gentleman 
               <br />
               comes here with an innuendo that is absolutely
