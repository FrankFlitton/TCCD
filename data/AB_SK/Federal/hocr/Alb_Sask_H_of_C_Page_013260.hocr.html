               their rights to speak their own language, which will

               be recognised, at least in courtesy, as it is recognised 
               <br />
               in every other Province of Canada where it is

               <br />
               should speak in the tongue which suits him best. I 
               <br />
               have seen that right conceded frequently in the 
               <br />
               legislature of my own Province where there is no 
               <br />
               legislative guarantee on the subject, and the man 
               <br />
               who would object to an Acadian in Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               speaking his own tongue in the Legislature of his own 
               <br />
               Province would he laughed to scorn, as unworthy 
               <br />
               to sit in that Assembly. We can safely leave 
               <br />
               that subject to the Assembly, which I am 
               <br />
               sure, will be guided by as patriotic a feeling 
               <br />
               as actuates the other legislative bodies in 
               <br />
               Canada. I shall ask the House, in the proposition 
               <br />
               I am about to make, to give to the Assembly, in 
               <br />
               due time, the power to regulate its own debates, and 
               <br />
               to say in what manner, in what tongue, or in what 
               <br />
               mode its records and its Journals may be published 
               <br />
               from time to time. There are two subjects which 
               <br />
               remain and which, as I have already mentioned, 
               <br />
               stand upon a somewhat different footing. \Vhen 
               <br />
               we undertake to say that we shall expunge 
               <br />
               from the Statute-book a provision that justice 
               <br />
               shall be administered, or may be administered, in 
               <br />
               either of the two languages used in the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">V‘Vest</span> Territories, we are touching a subject far 
               <br />
               more important than the mere language of debate, 
               <br />
               and the mere language of the publication of the 
               <br />
               Journals of a legislative body. These, Sir, are our 
               <br />
               courts; these are the courts of the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. In respect of the Provinces, power is iven 
               <br />
               to the Provincial Legislatures, by the British 1\ orth 
               <br />
               America Act, to establish the courts, and to regulate 
               <br />
               their organisation, their maintenance, and the ex- 
               <br />
               tent of their jurisdiction. That power which rests 
               <br />
               on them, as regards the Provincial courts, rests 
               <br />
               directly on this Parliament as regards the courts of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Territories. We have imposed 
               <br />
               upon us the duty, not only of creating those courts, 
               <br />
               but of breathing into them the breath of life by 
               <br />
               giving them the jurisdiction they exercise and the 
               <br />
               procedure bywhich that jurisdiction is to be carried 
               <br />
               on. Nay, more, it is our duty, just as it is the 
               <br />
               duty of a Provincial Assembly, to see that they are 
               <br />
               properly equipped to exercise their jurisdiction, in 
               <br />
               every detail, whether relating to mere procedure or 
               <br />
               to substantive enactment, so as to carry jus- 
               <br />
               tice to every section of the people, in their homes 
               <br />
               in the wide territories where we have established 
               <br />
               them ; and the proposal that this Parliament should 
               <br />
               on such short notice, without enquiry—for it 
               <br />
               is only within twelve months that we have 
               <br />
               heard of this agitation, or that the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe discovered that such a pro- 
               <br />
               vision existed on the Statute-book——expunge the 
               <br />
               provision that either language may be used 
               <br />
               in the courts of the country, seems to me to 
               <br />
               carry with it consequences more alarming than 
               <br />
               this House is prepared to risk. It isnot mere fancy, 
               <br />
               but I am repeating what has been said to me, that 
               <br />
               in some distant sections of that country, if that 
               <br />
               provision be obliterated, we may have the misfor- 
               <br />
               tune of seeing men brought to the bar of justice in 
               <br />
               our own courts, tried before our own judges, con- 
               <br />
               victed, condemned and sentenced in a language 
               <br />
               not one word of which they understand, and 
               <br />
               unable to offer a plea for justice or for mercy. 
               <br />
               Surely, Sir, it is unreasonable to say, in respect 
               <br />
               Sir JOHN THOMPSON.

               If that would be the case with respect to new

               where English law and language alone prevail, the 
               <br />
               case is made ten times stronger when applied, as 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Secretary of State said this 
               <br />
               evening, to those who were the ﬁrst settlers in the 
               <br />
               country; and where the new comers, who have 
               <br />
               established the new laws and the new language, 
               <br />
               should surely be willing to incur the obli- 
               <br />
               gation of permitting the old inhabitants of 
               <br />
               the country to use, for a time at least, their own 
               <br />
               language in their own defense and in the assertion 
               <br />
               of their rights before our courts of justice. The 
               <br />
               remaining subject which is touched upon in this 
               <br />
               provision is the printing of the ordinances of the 
               <br />
               N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-\Vest</span> Assembly in both languages. This is 
               <br />
               a matter on which we are not required to hear the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly ; it is a duty which we have 
               <br />
               ourselves to discharge. True, the enactment makes 
               <br />
               necessary the printing in both languages ; but it is 
               <br />
               a duty which this House has charged itself with 
               <br />
               from year to year. The ordinances have been 
               <br />
               printed in both languages not merely because sec- 
               <br />
               tion 110 of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“'est</span> Territories Act so pro- 
               <br />
               vides, but more especially because at our table the 
               <br />
               money has been voted at every session since that 
               <br />
               Act was passed, and probably long before, for that 
               <br />
               purpose. That matter may safely be left in the 
               <br />
               hands of this Parliament, where it has always been 
               <br />
               dealt with down to this moment; and if this 
               <br />
               Parliament should think ﬁt from year to year to 
               <br />
               order that the ordinances of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories should be printed in any language in which 
               <br />
               it should be necessary to print them, in order to 
               <br />
               make them fully known to the people of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories who are to be affected 
               <br />
               by them, I should like to ask what interests 
               <br />
               in this country would be injured thereby, 
               <br />
               or why any legislator or any person in the 
               <br />
               N orth-VVest Territories should say that it is dis- 
               <br />
               tasteful to him that any of the ordinances should 
               <br />
               be printed in any but his own tongue ? Therefore, 
               <br />
               Sir, in regard to that question, as well 
               <br />
               as in regard to the use of the language 
               <br />
               in the courts, I shall ask this House to 
               <br />
               come to the decision that these two provisions of 
               <br />
               the Act should be maintained ; but with respect to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               the records, the Journals, and the debates of the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Assembly, we may yield them the 
               <br />
               deference and the conﬁdence of permitting them to 
               <br />
               regulate their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> to the fullest extent. As 
               <br />
               to the time when this shall be done, I propose that 
               <br />
               it shall be done after the next election to the 
               <br />
               Assembly of the North-VVest Territories, and for 
               <br />
               the obvious reason that until then there can be 
               <br />
               nobody in the Territories capable of representing 
               <br />
