               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Very</span> serious protests were made against

               position taken by this side was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agreed</span> to by 
               <br />

               member for the Territories. The hon. Min-

               <br />
               test ; and as the matter was only brought to 
               <br />
               the attention of the House in the dying days 
               <br />
               of the session of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1895.</span> we had no oppor- 
               <br />
               tunity of really discussing the question. In 
               <br />
               the meantime. public attention in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories had been directed to the matter. and 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories assembly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed</span> 
               <br />
               a resolution. which I read in full on the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               reading of this Bill of mine. In that reso- 
               <br />
               lution. they drew attention to the very un- 
               <br />
               fortunate position in which the Territories 
               <br />
               would be placed at an election on account 
               <br />
               of this change, and they urged that one of 
               <br />
               three things be done,——either that the Fran- 
               <br />
               chise Act applicable to the rest of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion should be put in force there ; or that 
               <br />
               the territorial law with regard to elections 
               <br />
               should be adopted; or that the law should 
               <br />
               be put back where it was. This resolution 
               <br />
               was introduced in the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories assembly by Mr. Insinger, member for 
               <br />
               the northern part of Eastern Assiniboia, and 
               <br />
               was supported unanimously by the assembly.

               fprovincial law with regard to voting. We

               <br />
               wrong it comes down to the re-enactment 
               <br />
               of section 44. in order that a man who is 
               <br />
               entitled to vote may know whether his name 
               <br />
               is on the list of voters or not. And the 
               <br />
               reason why the assembly were so unani- 
               <br />
               mous in condemning the change in the law. 
               <br />
               and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason</span> why I think I can appeal 
               <br />
               confidently to this House to make the change 
               <br />
               is that there are no sufﬁcient delays pro- 
               <br />
               vided for. and it is quite impossible. in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               nature of things. to provide sufficient delay 
               <br />
               in making this list to enable both parties 
               <br />
               fairly to get their names upon it. The list 
               <br />
               is not to be made out at all until a pro- 
               <br />
               clamation is issued for an election. As soon 
               <br />
               as that proclamation issues, the Government 
               <br />
               appoint ennmerators for each polling divi- 
               <br />
               sion. The enumerator makes a list for the 
               <br />
               polling subdivision. He has nothing to com- 
               <br />
               mence with except what knowledge he may 
               <br />
               have of the subdivision. It is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neces</span> 
               <br />
               sary under the law for the. Government to 
               <br />
               appoint a resident of the polling subdivision, 
               <br />
               and it might happen. and it would happen. 
               <br />
               probably. that the enumerator would have 
               <br />
               very little actual knowledge as to which 
               <br />
               electors should have their names upon the 
               <br />
               list. However, he is to do the best he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(an.</span> :1. 
               <br />
               and. certainly, if he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> a partisan. and 
               <br />
               were inclined to use his position for the

               <br />
               unlimited opportunities to do so. He could 
               <br />
               make the list in any way he sees ﬁt. put-
