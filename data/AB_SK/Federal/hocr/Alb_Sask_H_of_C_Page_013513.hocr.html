               He said: Mr. Speaker. I would ask the 
               <br />
               House to listen for a short time to an ex- 
               <br />
               planation of the object for which this 1110- 
               <br />
               iion is made. The motion is moved in order 
               <br />
               to afford information to the House on a 
               <br />
               subject of considerable interest to the House 
               <br />
               and to the country. It isasubject in regard 
               <br />
               to which efforts have been made for the 
               <br />
               enlightenment of the House in the past, or 
               <br />
               rather for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlightenment</span> of the late 
               <br />
               Government, but the information never 
               <br />
               reached the House, and it seems to me it 
               <br />
               would be well to take upa short time of this 
               <br />
               sitting in order to arrive at an understanding 
               <br />
               of this question. The motion relates to the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial condition of the legislature of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories in its connection with 
               <br />
               this Government. The position occupied by 
               <br />
               the Territories at the present time is very 
               <br />
               similar to the position of a province. that 
               <br />
               is to say. the territorial government and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> have all, or nearly all. the re- 
               <br />
               sponsibilities of a provincial government or 
               <br />
               legislature. and at the same time they have 
               <br />
               much greater responsibilities than the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of any province, owing to the im- 
               <br />
               mense area of country they are expected to 
               <br />
               govern and the difﬁculties of carrying on 
               <br />
               that government. While the North-west 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> and legislature have almost 
               <br />
               equal power and greater responsibility 
               <br />
               than the government of a province. the 
               <br />
               government and legislature are con- 
               <br />
               fronted with the position that they 
               <br />
               have not adequate ﬁnances. and those 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnances</span> have been inadequate for some 
               <br />
               years past. The area under the government 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories is. roughly 
               <br />
               speaking. something like 600 miles square: 
               <br />
               it is very much larger than the settled area 
               <br />
               of all the eastern provinces of the Dominion, 
               <br />
               and settlement being scattered more or less 
               <br />
               over this great area, the expense <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and,</span> dith- 
               <br />
               culty of carrying on the government are 
               <br />
               proportionately increased. It is not only 
               <br />
               that there is a great area over which settle- 
               <br />
               ment is scattered, but there is also diversity 
               <br />
               of interest. There is the wheat raising 
               <br />
               interest in the east. the cattle raising 
               <br />
               interest in the west, the coal mining 
               <br />
               in the mountains, and the trading interest 
               <br />
               in the far north—a diversity of interests 
               <br />
               that renders legislation and government in 
               <br />
               that country more difﬁcult <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">probably</span> than in 
               <br />
               any province, or, at all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">events.</span> in any pro- 
               <br />

               as 66,799. and the subsidies at that time de—
