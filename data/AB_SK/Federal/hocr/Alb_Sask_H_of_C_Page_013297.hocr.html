               justice which are due to minorities. There is 
               <br />
               another question which we know agitates the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe. It is the question res- 
               <br />
               pecting the Jesuit Estates. This question has come 
               <br />
               again to be threshed out before this House. Com— 
               <br />
               plaint is made of the famous preamble of the Bill 
               <br />
               respecting which so much noise was made last year. 
               <br />
               I shall not quote, in reply to what has been said, 
               <br />
               any other authority than that of a Protestant who 
               <br />
               occupies one of the highest positions in our Province, 
               <br />
               and who is looked upon with the greatest respect 
               <br />
               by the Protestants of the Province of Quebec. I 
               <br />
               mean the Hon. Mr. Joly. This is what he said on 
               <br />
               this matter in a letter addressed to the Montreal 
               <br />

               “The Jesuit Estates Act has become the signal for a 
               <br />
               strong agitation throughout the Dominion. Men who for 
               <br />
               so many years lived together <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in'conﬁdence</span> and friendship, 
               <br />
               in spite of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> of origin and creed, have now 
               <br />
               become suspicious the one of the other and are gradually 
               <br />
               separating more and more. * <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span> Every eli'ort ought to be 
               <br />
               brought to bear in order to preserve this time~honored 
               <br />
               sentiment of confidence and mutual tolerance, which has 
               <br />
               allowed us, Canadians as we are, English and French, 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics and Protestants, to live happily and in 
               <br />
               peace, side by side, in days when there is but little peace 
               <br />
               in the world. Such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efforts</span> deserve to be supported by all 
               <br />
               men endued with good will. ’* ’* If I had been a member of 
               <br />
               the Legislature at the time, and the name of the Pope and 
               <br />
               his consent might have been omitted, I would have 
               <br />
               insisted in placing them in the Bill before allowing it to 
               <br />
               be adopted.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knowledge,</span> will be struck With the display of minute 
               <br />
               precautions which have been taken to obtain on behalf 
               <br />
               of the Province, a ﬁnal and non-appealable judgment.” 
               <br />
               This is how, Mr. Speaker, a Protestant holding 
               <br />
               the position which Mr. Joly does, appreciates the 
               <br />
               preamble of the Bill respecting the J esuit Estates, 
               <br />
               which has been so severely criticised in this House. 
               <br />
               Another assertion on the part of the hon. member 
               <br />
               which has astonished me, is that which he has 
               <br />
               made when alleging that La <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ve’m'tc’</span> is the organ of 
               <br />
               the Quebec Government. He appears to me to be 
               <br />
               a close reader of this journal, because he constantly 
               <br />
               quotes it in his speeches. Probably because he 
               <br />
               takes delight in it and reads it on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sunday</span> in order 
               <br />
               to keep holy the Sabbath day. I protest, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, against the statement of the hon. member. 
               <br />
               One must be a complete stranger to what is going 
               <br />
               on in the Province of Quebec to make such an 
               <br />
               assertion. La Vém'tc’ is not the organ of any poli- 
               <br />
               tical party ; not more the organ of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party; not more the organ of the hon. Ministers 
               <br />
               who are sitting on the Treasury benches, than the 
               <br />
               organ of the Quebec Government. And, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, I do not desire any other proof of this 
               <br />
               than an article in this journal published on the 
               <br />
