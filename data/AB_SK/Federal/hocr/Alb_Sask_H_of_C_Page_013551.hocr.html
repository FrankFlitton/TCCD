               Mr. INGRAM. Hon. gentlemen from the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories have referred to 
               <br />
               this matter as being of interest to eastern 
               <br />
               members, and I take the liberty of discuss- 
               <br />
               ing it from that point of view. I listened 
               <br />
               with a great deal of attention to the re- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               who represents a Manitoba constituency. 
               <br />
               The point these gentlemen from the terri- 
               <br />
               tories made was that a provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ment should be granted to the people of the 
               <br />
               territories. The hon. member for Selkirk 
               <br />
               says it should not be given to the territories 
               <br />
               owing to the friction that exists there at the 
               <br />

               the Dominion government; they know full

               well that for some years past a strong agi-

               of forming those territories into a province. 
               <br />
               Why? Because the people ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               immigrants coming in there in large num- 
               <br />

               present given by the Dominion government 
               <br />
               is insufﬁcient. Therefore they are agitating 
               <br />
               for a provincial government so that they 
               <br />
               may be put on the same footing as other 
               <br />
               provinces.

               Now, I think the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               said in his letter to the Hon. Mr. Hanltain 
               <br />
               that the population in the North—west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories was too sparse, that was one of the 
               <br />
               reasons why the government of Canada re-

               fused to organize the territories into a pro-

               <br />
               the government of Canada did not think it

               they differ with the Minister of the 111-

               <br />
               is their duty to say so in this House. The 
               <br />
               people of Canada should not be kept in the 
               <br />
               dark on this subject. It is in the interest 
               <br />
               of the people of the east as well as of the 
               <br />
               west to know whether there should be one 
               <br />

               There is another question and it is whether

               the present machinery of the territories can 
               <br />

               is any justiﬁcation for refusing to organize 
               <br />

               Now. let us make a comparison with the 
               <br />
               area of the North-west Territories with that 
               <br />
               of British Columbia. Ontario and Quebec. 
               <br />
               If the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territories</span> are brought in as they are 
               <br />
               proposed to be. I believe the area of the 
               <br />
               new province sought to be organized would 
               <br />
               be about 302.000 square miles. British 001- 
               <br />
               umbia has 383,000 square miles. Ontario 222,-

               000 square miles. and Quebec 228.000 square 
               <br />
               miles. I ﬁnd that so far as area is con- 
               <br />
               cerned. the people of the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
