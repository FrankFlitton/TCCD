               <br />
               mitted to any assembly, is to keep the language 
               <br />

               <br />
               the North-VVest, and to settle this question, by-and- 
               <br />
               bye, after they get there. If they go in masses, 
               <br />
               says the hon. member, I shall much regret it ; but 
               <br />
               if they do go there in masses—and we perfectly 
               <br />
               well know that they do not go in any other way— 
               <br />
               then, he said, something will have to be done. If 
               <br />
               I might appeal to the reason of the House without 
               <br />
               prejudice, I would say, let us look at the position 
               <br />
               of the North-VVest to-day. We are told, and the 
               <br />
               census conﬁrms it, that in 1885 there were but 
               <br />
               1,500 French Canadians in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“'est.</span> If you 
               <br />
               add the number of the half-breeds of French descent, 
               <br />
               the number will still be less than 5,000. I have 
               <br />
               got the exact ﬁgures here. We know that at the 
               <br />
               time to which I refer, there were in the three dis- 
               <br />
               tricts 23,285 English-speaking people ; I am leaving 
               <br />
               the Indians out of consideration. The ratio is 
               <br />
               therefore 83 to 17 per cent, and if our records are 
               <br />
               correct that disproportion has been vastly increased, 
               <br />
               and it is not too much to say that there are not to- 
               <br />
               day in the North-VVest one-tenth of the people who 
               <br />
               speak the French language to the nine-tenths who 
               <br />
               speak the English language. And moreover, when 
               <br />
               we look at the record we ﬁnd that these French 
               <br />
               are scattered.

               of the hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake),

               <br />
               I venture to say that this is the place. The hon.

               <br />
               if instead of insinuating, he would make his state- 
               <br />
               ments so clear that they could be understood. He 
               <br />
               said that the North-VVest Council had been moved 
               <br />
               to present the petition I spoke of by some outside

               thing. What did the hon. gentleman mean ‘3 Has
