               <br />
               want it. I Would not have said anything on this 
               <br />
               question except for a reﬂection passed on the 
               <br />
               Province of Manitoba. The First Minister stated 
               <br />
               that nearly all the representations he had received 
               <br />
               from the North-VVest were to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> that the 
               <br />
               people would be in a very much worse position 
               <br />
               than they occupied to-day if they were governed 
               <br />
               by the sort of Government they had in Manitoba. 
               <br />
               I consider that a reﬂection on the Government of 
               <br />
               that Province, whoever may be the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s informants, whether members of this 
               <br />
               House or persons outside the House; and as a 
               <br />
               resident of Manitoba, and I know I am speaking 
               <br />
               the opinion of the great majority of that Province, 
               <br />
               I say the people are thankful we have a respon- 
               <br />
               sible Local Legislature there, and the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman no doubt would much prefer to have a 
               <br />
               Council similar to that in the North-West, and one 
               <br />
               subject to his dictation. But We have a Legisla- 
               <br />
               ture which has protested against the unjust acts 
               <br />
               of the right hon. gentleman, and we are now 
               <br />
               reaping the beneﬁts of responsible government. I 
               <br />
               do not think we should consider the individual 
               <br />
               acts of any member of the N orth-VVest Council 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> as has been done by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> 
               <br />
               for us to know that the Council is Composed 
               <br />
               of an able body of men, as has been admitted by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), 
               <br />
               and I am satisﬁed, although I do not know the in- 
               <br />
               dividual members of that body, that the represen- 
               <br />
               tations of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Council should have 
               <br />
               more weight in this House than the views of an 
               <br />
               individual member from the North-VVest; and if 
               <br />
               the North-\Vest Council recommend to this House 
               <br />
               the granting of responsible government to that 
               <br />
               country, it is in the interest of this House to con- 
               <br />
               sider the advisability of granting it, and if they 
               <br />
               object to having legal advisers appointed, who 
               <br />
               must have certain weight in the Assembly, the 
               <br />
               gentlemen composing that Council are men who 
               <br />
               are quite competent to elect men who are able to 
               <br />
               fulﬁl the positions of the legal advisers. Ihave 
               <br />
               no doubt that if the North~VVest Council and the 
               <br />
               people, through their representatives in this 
               <br />
               House, were listened to by this Parliament, and if 
               <br />
               it would act on their advice, we would do very 
               <br />
               nearly what is right for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-VVest.</span> They 
               <br />
               are more interested in its welfare than are people 
               <br />
               2,000 miles away. We should endeavor, as nearly 
               <br />
               as possible, to carry out‘ the wishes of the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W'est</span> Council, and I repeat, if they wish to have 
               <br />
               the legal experts abolished, this should be done. 
               <br />
               In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test,</span> as in Manitoba, we must have 
               <br />
               minorities, and the hon. member for Provencher 
               <br />
               (Mr. LaRiviere) represents a class that think 
               <br />
               they must have all the rights and privileges which 
               <br />
               the majority possess in the Province and in the 
               <br />
               Legislature. We must expect these things to oc- 
               <br />
               cur, but the rights of the majority under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act must prevail, and 
               <br />
               those constituting the minority must submit to 
               <br />

               posed there should be two representatives from

               posed by hon. gentlemen opposite, on the ground 
               <br />
               that the population of the Province did not au-

               laughed at when I said that I wanted more than

               one to come, as one would be lonely coming such a 
               <br />
               long distance. It is quite true, what the hon.

               member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Vest</span> Durham (Mr. Blake) has said, 
               <br />
               that the credit of giving representative institu- 
               <br />
               tions to that Province is to a certain extent due to 
               <br />
               the Government of which the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East York (Mr. Mackenzie) was the head. But 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman must not deprive me of my 
               <br />
               four lambs from the North—VVest, the four repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est,</span> and the fact that 
               <br />
               representation was given to the N orth-VVest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terri~</span> 
               <br />
               tories by the Government of which I was a member. 
               <br />
               But, speaking in regard to this measure now under 
               <br />
               consideration, the discussion has gone on as if we were 
               <br />
               settling a new constitution for the North-VVest, as if 
               <br />
               we were applying ourselves to the remodelling of 
               <br />
               that whole system. If that were so, it would 
               <br />
               require more consideration than can possibly be 
               <br />
               given to the subject at this period of the Session, 
               <br />
               and it must be remembered that this Bill was 
               <br />
               introduced for the purpose of making such amend- _ 
               <br />
               ments as were wanted for the present, and not for 
               <br />
               the purpose of arranging a new constitution for the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest,</span> as when we were settling the Quebec 
               <br />
               resolutions giving a constitution to the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada. It is impossible that we can endeavor 
               <br />
               in the discussion of this Bill, which is a practical 
               <br />
               one, to discuss it with any such view. In order to 
               <br />
               do justice to the measure, we would be kept here 
               <br />
               for weeks and weeks. And, therefore, the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment must either ask the House to take such pro- 
               <br />
               visions as are unobjectionable and adopt them for 
               <br />
               the nonce, for this Session, or we must ask the 
               <br />
               House to support the majority, or we must with- 
               <br />
               draw the Bill. We cannot set to work and settle 
               <br />
               now a new constitution for the N orth- West.

               the reason why the right hon. gentleman gave 
               <br />
               popular institutions to Manitoba, and gave repre- 
               <br />
               sentation in this House to the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories. That supervened which generally does 
               <br />
               supervene before a Tory reform. There was a. 
               <br />
               rebellion ﬁrst. The right hon. gentleman gave the 
               <br />
               people of Manitoba a paternal Constitution ; he sent 
               <br />
               up there 3. Lieutenant Governor, who never got into 
               <br />
               the country ; and an alien Council, which could not 
               <br />
               get in either. The people rose in rebellion against 
               <br />
               him ; and then he came down here and gave them, 
               <br />
               forsooth, provincial rights. And he now claims 
               <br />
               credit for having given that which they obtained 
               <br />
               at the point of the bayonet. So much for Manitoba.
