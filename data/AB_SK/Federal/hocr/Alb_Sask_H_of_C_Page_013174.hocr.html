               I come next to the hon. member for Drummond 
               <br />
               and Arthabaska (Mr. Lavergne). I am bound 
               <br />
               to say that the spirit and the attitude of the 
               <br />
               French members of this House upon this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and upon all questions for that matter, 
               <br />
               .is above all praise. I say this truly; I say this 
               <br />
               fully. They have shown—there may be an excep- 
               <br />
               tion or two, for there is an exception to every 
               <br />
               rule—forbearance and a desire to treat this ques- 
               <br />
               tion fairly ; they have not evinced bitterness, they 
               <br />
               have not evinced bigotry, they have not evinced 
               <br />
               prejudice in an undue degree, and this is especially 
               <br />
               true with respect to the French Canadian Liberals 
               <br />
               of this House. The hon. gentleman to whose 
               <br />
               remarks I am referring, spoke last night in defence 
               <br />
               of Canadian rights, the rights that are guaranteed 
               <br />
               the French race under the constitution. I can 
               <br />
               agree with him. There is not a right guaranteed 
               <br />
               to the race under the constitution which I wish to 
               <br />
               see impaired ; there is not a right the integrity of 
               <br />
               which I wish to see iinpaired in the slightest 
               <br />
               degree. This is not a question of the preservation 
               <br />
               of rights existing ; it is a question as to the forma- 
               <br />
               tion of new institutions and a polity that will be 
               <br />
               adopted with respect to the vast unoccupied terri- 
               <br />
               tories of this Dominion. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then we come-to the remarks of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Bothwell (Mr. Mills). The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               treated us to a very learned dissertation, to a speech 
               <br />
               which, of its character, is perhaps the ﬁnest I ever 
               <br />
               listened to in this House. It was a most admirable 
               <br />
               contribution, and it was listened to, beyond doubt, 
               <br />
               with the greatest degree of pleasure by the hon. 
               <br />
               members of the House. I am afraid, however, it 
               <br />
               will be above the comprehension of the average 
               <br />
               elector and may not be read with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> by the 
               <br />
               millions in the country. I was struck with one point 
               <br />
               in the hon. gentleman’s speech which I thought 
               <br />
               evinced a want of tact. He said that three millions 
               <br />
               people could not swallow two millions, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it"</span> was 
               <br />
               not a cod that swallowed Jonah but a whale. Now, 
               <br />
               the comparison of the French race in this country to 
               <br />
               Jonah was, I think, on the part of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man, somewhat unkind. We are not proposing to 
               <br />
               swallow this Jonah ; we do not expect to undertake 
               <br />
               any such impossible task as to swallow two millions 
               <br />
               people—not by any means, but we do expect to get 
               <br />
               the institutions of the North—West ﬁxed up in a 
               <br />
               right shape and we have no doubt in the world 
               <br />
               that we will succeed in that.

               <br />
               expect to allow our French Canadian friends to 
               <br />
               enjoy whatever privileges they ever have enjoyed, 
               <br />
               and we do not question their right to enjoy one of 
               <br />
               these privileges. If we can secure the gradual 
               <br />
               assimilation of the races, if we can secure gradual 
               <br />
               homogeneity, we will be glad, and if we cannot we 
               <br />
               will be sorry. The question of the two languages 
               <br />
               in the North-West is the question we have in hand 
               <br />
               to-day. We propose if possible to have that North- 
               <br />
               VVest an English country. I have not time this 
               <br />
               afternoon to attempt to follow the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) in the various positions 
               <br />
               he has taken. However, he gave us an account 
               <br />
               of the attempt in the Netherlands to have commu- 
               <br />
               nity of language there, and said it was a failure. 
               <br />
               Well, we are not making that attempt in Canada, 
               <br />
               and it is not a parallel case, nor has it any bearing 
               <br />
               on the matter under discussion. We do not 
               <br />
               propose to make any attempt to force the English 
               <br />
               language upon the Canadians of Quebec, and there- 
               <br />
               fore the comparison was far-fetched and entirely 
               <br />
               inapplicable. We merely propose that in a new 
               <br />
               country, where there are comparatively no inhabi- 
               <br />
               tants at all, that the English language shall be 
               <br />
               used as the ofﬁcial language in place of two 
               <br />
               languages. That is all there is about the question, 
               <br />
               from our standpoint. The hon. gentleman also 
               <br />
               said—and I cannot see what bearing it has 
               <br />
               on the case at all—that we had better com- 
               <br />
               mence with the aborigines by prohibiting the 
               <br />
               translation of books into their languages 
               <br />
               and by prohibiting the missionaries from 
               <br />
               learning their languages or from preaching the 
               <br />
               Gospel to them in their native tongue. It may be 
               <br />
               that this had a bearing on the case, but I cannot 
               <br />
               see it. There is no proposal to make the aboriginal 
               <br />
               languages in the North—VVest ofﬁcial languages, nor 
               <br />
               is such a thing dreamed of ; there is no proposal to 
               <br />
               prohibit a man of the Cree or Sioux or Blackfeet 
               <br />
               tribes speaking in his native tongue, nor no proposal 
               <br />
               to prohibit the translation of the Bible into those 
               <br />
               tongues. Why the hon. gentleman should have 
               <br />
               brought up that argument I am unable to see.
