               allowed to govern themselves, but that there were 
               <br />
               a certain few called the Family Compact, who had 
               <br />
               all the places, all the power, and who ruled the 
               <br />
               country as they pleased, and the people had no 
               <br />
               voice or power. That was the cause of the trouble 
               <br />
               in Upper Canada, and the hon. gentleman did 
               <br />
               not say a word about it. But the state of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> was exactly the same in Lower Can- 
               <br />
               ada. There was no ﬁght between the races. 
               <br />
               The immense majority of the people were French, 
               <br />
               but men were sent from England to govern us, and 
               <br />
               our people had no right to have a voice in their 
               <br />
               own government. They had to submit to having 
               <br />
               all their judges and executive councillors and legis- 
               <br />
               lative councillors of one stripe ; 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly, they could not even do what 
               <br />
               they thought proper with their own money. That 
               <br />
               brought about a struggle. The cause of that 
               <br />
               struggle was a good one ; but, according to the 
               <br />
               authorities on matters of that kind, a people has 
               <br />
               no right to rise in rebellion unless they have the 
               <br />
               strength and the means to enforce a recognition of 
               <br />
               their rights. Our people had not that strength. 
               <br />
               In Upper Canada as well as in Lower Canada they 
               <br />
               rose and fought, and were defeated ; and they 
               <br />
               should have expected defeat, because they had 
               <br />
               neither the money, the ammunition, nor the guns. 
               <br />
               Well, in England our people were not heard. The 
               <br />
               constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, but 
               <br />
               not that of Upper Canada. The Upper Canadians 
               <br />
               were treated better than we, because, I suppose, 
               <br />
               we were nearer the sea and could be got at 
               <br />
               better ; but that would have been a strong 
               <br />
               reason to have done the contrary, and have left us 
               <br />
               our constitution and taken it from those who were 
               <br />
               further away from the reach of England. But 
               <br />
               that was not done. We did not complain : we are 
               <br />
               a race which has suffered a long time, and we have 
               <br />
               been in the habit of suﬁ'ering, but we never lose 
               <br />
               heart. We always cling to our principles and our 
               <br />
               ideas, we know what are our rights, and when the 
               <br />
               time comes to assert them, we assert them. To-day 
               <br />
               is the time when we must assert them against the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman who seeks to have the majority of 
               <br />
               the House set them aside. I hope this House will 
               <br />
               not consent to that, but will show the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man that his ideas of persecution and fanaticism 
               <br />
               are not those of the majority of the people, and 
               <br />
               will show that the majority speaking the English 
               <br />
               language are not disposed to do us—-who are in the 
               <br />
               minority, but a large minority~—an injustice. We 
               <br />
               have conﬁdence in the majority ; we are not beggars 
               <br />
               here, we are not asking favors, but what we ask 
               <br />
               is the continued enjoyment of the right we possess 
               <br />
               by nature and as British subjects. We have the 
               <br />
               right to speak our own language. What harm would 
               <br />
               it do the North-West for the thousand or so—-—I do 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notknow</span> how many French Canadians there are 
               <br />

               <br />
               language. How much would the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">horth-West</span> be 
               <br />
               depreciated, how much would it lose, by allowing 
               <br />
               those French Canadians who have gone there con- 
               <br />
               ﬁding in the law of Parliament, conﬁding in the 
               <br />
               protection given them by the British laws, to speak 
               <br />
               their own language. Supposing two or three of 
               <br />
               them should be elected at the next elections to sit 
               <br />
               in the Legislative Assembly there, these men will 
               <br />
               not speak in both languages. After I have spoken 
               <br />
               in English, I do not intend repeating my remarks 
               <br />
               in French, though I have the right to do so. I 
               <br />
               would never think of doing that, because I know 
               <br />

               passed, but the French Canadians will go there. 
               <br />
               They are in the habit of going everywhere. They 
               <br />
               went there long before the English people did, 
               <br />

               sion, thought that as he had had very little success

               then, he would try something bigger, in order that

               <br />
               thing. Well, the hon. gentleman went up there 
               <br />
               as a missionary. He said to the people of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               that they were oppressed, that the French language 
               <br />
               should disappear, that those Frenchmen were a 
               <br />
               nuisance, and that they should abolish the French 
               <br />
               language. More than that, he said that the 
               <br />
               separate schools should disappear. Then he 
               <br />
               went on to the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-W’est,</span> and tried to impress 
               <br />
               the same views upon the people there, and I have 
               <br />
               no doubt that if the two languages had been used 
               <br />
               in British Columbia, the hon. gentleman would 
               <br />

               But he was saved of the trouble, as the two 
               <br />
               languages do not exist there. The Province was 
               <br />
               settled, and had its constitution before it entered 
               <br />
               Confederation. But the hon. gentleman, neverthe-

               there will be no such injustice done. I Would
