               Freeman asks. Because circumstances led them

               to cleave to England though their kindred in 
               <br />

               <br />
               control more than language. The insular Norman, 
               <br />
               though speaking French, did not become aFrench-

               “These instances,” says Freeman, “and countless 
               <br />
               others, bear out the position, that while community of 
               <br />
               language is the most obvious sign of common nationality, 
               <br />
               while it is the main element, or something more than an 
               <br />
               element, in the formation of a nationality, the rule is 
               <br />
               open to exceptions of all kinds, and the inﬂuence of

               to the British ﬂag. Now, Freeman points out

               that political and other reasons forbade the an-

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ Yet surely,” he says, “the Swiss Confederation is a 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               feeling as any other nation.” 
               <br />
               Yet this man has been quoted to prove that Can-

               ada, with two languages, could not be a nation ! 
               <br />
               May I not apply his language to Canada, and say 
               <br />
               that surely Canada with her two ofﬁcial languages, 
               <br />
               even if they continue to prevail, can surely become a 
               <br />
               nation. Then my hon. friend quotes this writer again 
               <br />
               to prove that identity of speech is necessary to make 
               <br />
               a nation, and that diversity of language is fatal to 
               <br />
               the existence of a nation—~that two or more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official</span> 
               <br />
               languages are fatal to a nation, and that identity 
               <br />
               of language and race will alone make one. What 
               <br />

               Can anything be plainer than that Mr. Freeman 
               <br />
               teaches the very contrary of what my hon. friend 
               <br />
               quoted him to prove. Therefore, I have con- 
               <br />
               cluded, because I know my hon. friend is an 
               <br />
               honorable man, that he did not read the article, or 
               <br />
               he read it in such a cursory manner that he did not 
               <br />
               grasp the ideas that inspired and infused it. Well, 
               <br />
               all I can say is, that if he takes up his knowledge 
               <br />
               as certain birds take their food, on the wing, it is 
               <br />
               no wonder his conclusions should be so ﬂighty.

               My hon. friend comes from the country whence I 
               <br />
               Ireland can boast of him amongst 
               <br />
               her distinguished lawyers. Does identity of 
               <br />
               language make community of sentiment, com- 
               <br />
               munity of race, and community of nation there? 
               <br />
               Why, do we not know that for hundreds of years 
               <br />
               the Saxon has been denounced in the Saxon 
               <br />
               tongue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> So that there were at my hon. friend’s 
               <br />
               door facts that might have prevented him, if he 
               <br />
               had the time for reﬂection, from falling into the . 
               <br />
               errors he has fallen into. Now, I hardly think it 
               <br />
               worth while to deal with his allusions to Mr. 
               <br />
               Mercier, his allusions to French newspapers, his 
               <br />
               quotations from The Month. The Month he cited 
               <br />
               as an authority. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhy</span> did he quote The Month 
               <br />
               as an authority ? “ Why,” he said, “it was an 
               <br />
               authority last year, and it ought to be an 
               <br />
               authority now ;” but, if I remember rightly, my
