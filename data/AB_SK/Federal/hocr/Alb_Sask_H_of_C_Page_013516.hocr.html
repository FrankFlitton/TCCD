               which has been granted in past years. so 
               <br />
               as to catch up to some extent with the pre-

               sent requirements. Let me say that the 
               <br />
               manner in which the subsidy has been cal- 
               <br />
               culated in the past has been this. The ter- 
               <br />
               ritorial government made up an estimate of 
               <br />
               what was required. The Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior granted either that amount or as 
               <br />
               much less as it saw ﬁt. The territorial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment was compelled to keep within the 
               <br />
               amount voted. When the territorial govern- 
               <br />
               ment. next year, sent down an estimate for 
               <br />
               an increased amount, the department here, 
               <br />
               I suppose, argued: “ Well. you got along 
               <br />
               with so much last year; you can certainly 
               <br />
               get on with the same amount this year.” 
               <br />
               So the amount has been kept at about the 
               <br />
               same ﬁgure for the last ﬁve years. This, it 
               <br />
               appears to me. is putting the matter on a 
               <br />
               false basis, which is neither in the interest 
               <br />

               In regard to the grant on account of the 
               <br />
               land, I would say a word or two. The pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba has been granted $100,- 
               <br />
               000 a year in consideration of its public 
               <br />
               lands having been administered by Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. In the Territories there is, I sup- 
               <br />
               pose. four or five times as much land as 
               <br />
               there is in the province of Manitoba _: and. 
               <br />
               while it may be argued that the land is not 
               <br />
               proﬁtable to the government, that the ad- 
               <br />
               ministration of it has not returned a ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial proﬁt to the Government, let me put 
               <br />
               the matter to you in this way. Parliament 
               <br />
               has seen ﬁt in the past to grant off these 
               <br />
               lands to the Canadian Paelﬁc Railway, 
               <br />
               which is a national work and not a North— 
               <br />
               western work simply, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to;</span> the extent of 25.- 
               <br />
               000,000 acres. 1 understand that that land 
               <br />
               has been bonded to the amount of $1.25 an 
               <br />
               acre ; so that its value stands. under these 
               <br />
               bonds. at something like $31,000.000. which. 
               <br />
               at 4 per cent, is equivalent to a million and 
               <br />
               a quarter dollars a year. This is not 
               <br />
               any fancy calculation, but a calculation on 
               <br />
               the basis of actual cash. So <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> when we 
               <br />
               say that the Territories are entitled to con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ernment land there, we are not going beyond 
               <br />
               the mark when we say that we should be 
               <br />
               dealt with at least as favourably as the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba, particularly when we 
               <br />
               call your attention to the fact that the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Prince Edward Island has received 
               <br />
               a specieal grant of something like $40,000 a 
               <br />
               year. in consideration of the fact that at the 
               <br />
               time of entering confederation it had not 
               <br />
               any public .land at all; and that the pro-

               viree of British Columbia has been granted 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$100,000</span> a year, in consideration of what is 
               <br />
               known as the railway belt, in which belt 
               <br />
               the province still holds the precious metals. 
               <br />
               which. .I suppose, are really the most valu-

               somewhat in the line of that which my hon. 
               <br />

               that not merely now but, as I pointed out,

               them year after year, and in fact I think

               it was either last session or the session be-

               ing in mind what should have been paid, on 
               <br />
               the basis of the calculation made by my

               hon. friend in his able speech this afternoon

               and comparing that with the amount which 
               <br />
               has been given. In 1889, the legislative as-

               sembly of the North-west Territories sub-
