               Judging from the wording of the Act. and from 
               <br />
               there being no reference to this clause one might 
               <br />
               reasonably assume that it was intended that the 
               <br />
               power of dealing with the subject. should be left in 
               <br />
               the hands of the Lieutenant Governor in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council.</span> 
               <br />
               I understand, however, that it IS contended that by 
               <br />
               the interpretation clause this power, herein appar- 
               <br />
               ently given only to the LieutenantUovermn- inCoun- 
               <br />
               oil, is also vested in the Assembly, to which new and 
               <br />
               extensive powers are given. I think. even if that 
               <br />
               Is the case, it would have been better if the Act 
               <br />
               had been so worded that there should be no doubt 
               <br />
               as to that point, but that when we are giving this 
               <br />
               body the power to deal with property and civil 
               <br />
               rights and a variety of other subjects referred to in 
               <br />
               the Act, this subject of education, if it were to be 
               <br />
               dealt- with by it, should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{e</span> specially mentioned. 
               <br />
               However, that is not the subject to which I wish 
               <br />
               to direct the attention of the House. This clause 
               <br />
               which I have read establishes 1n the North-\Vest

               <br />
               not, the system of separate schools. The question 
               <br />
               that I wish to bring before the House to-day is, 
               <br />
