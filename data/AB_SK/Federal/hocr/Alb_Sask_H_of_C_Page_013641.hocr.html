               Mr. HENDERSON. Well, the only word 
               <br />
               we have heard is ‘ carried.’ However, I am 
               <br />
               going to deal with the resolution. I think 
               <br />
               we are making a mistake in creating a debt 
               <br />
               against the territories before we give them 
               <br />
               autonomy. I am very sorry indeed. if we 
               <br />
               are going to proceed as a parliament next 
               <br />
               year to organize those large territories into 
               <br />
               one or more provinces, that we shall be 
               <br />
               compelled to sit down and adjust a debt ac— 
               <br />
               count. I think it is better to proceed along 
               <br />
               thelines we have been following in the 
               <br />
               past, giving the territories what we consider 
               <br />
               fairly and reasonably sufﬁcient for their 
               <br />
               purposes. But by no means let us raise up 
               <br />
               a debt account against them, which will be 
               <br />
               standing in the way and perhaps be a 
               <br />
               troublesome matter to settle when we come 
               <br />
               to arrange for the political autonomy of the 
               <br />
               provinces. It will make no difference to the 
               <br />
               Dominion. We are getting no interest, and 
               <br />
               I do not suppose for a moment that when the 
               <br />
               adjustment is made even the principal will 
               <br />
               ever be asked for. If we treat the ter- 
               <br />
               ritories respectfully, treat them handsomely, 
               <br />
               and keep them in good humour, I think we 
               <br />
               will make better terms with them when we 
               <br />
               come to settle all these questions. But 
               <br />
               by no means let us do something that will 
               <br />
               only prove a vexed question hereafter. Now 
               <br />
               with regard to the other question, I have 
               <br />
               only to say that the sooner we give these 
               <br />
               provinces political autonomy the better, for 
               <br />
               then we do away with these annual grants. 
               <br />
               As at present they are regarded as wards 
               <br />
               of the Dominion, and I think the sooner we 
               <br />
               close this account by bringing about a 
               <br />
               different arrangement for the government of 
               <br />
               these provinces and doing away with these 
               <br />
               annual grants, the better for the Dominion 
               <br />
               and the better for the territories. I would 
               <br />
               advise the Finance Minister to create no 
               <br />
               debt account, because if we do anything

               respondence on the subject was brought 
               <br />
               down some time ago. I think perhaps I 
               <br />
               would not be justiﬁed in saying that the 
               <br />
               territorial government consented. Really,

               it was unnecessary to ask their consent in- 
               <br />

               of the privileges of this Act they need not

               any obligation upon them, we did not deem 
               <br />
               it necessary to obtain their consent. I

               think, perhaps, the territorial government

               ment have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">requested:</span> that this method shall 
               <br />
               be adopted, but I think the territorial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment will ﬁnd this arrangement useful 
               <br />

               <br />
               it will not be pressed 011 them and no harm 
               <br />
               is done.
