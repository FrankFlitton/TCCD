               well treated. I want to point out one feature 
               <br />
               of the case, and it is this : The hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition thinks that provincial au- 
               <br />
               tonomy is a new proposition in the territories. 
               <br />
               There was a meeting held in- my own town 13 
               <br />
               years ago, and a committee was appointed 
               <br />
               and money collected to agitate for provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy, but that agitation soon died out. 
               <br />
               It is, therefore, an old scheme. Four or 
               <br />
               ﬁve years ago, when Mr. Haultain started 
               <br />
               his agitation we had a population of 100,— 
               <br />
               000; to-day we have a population of 330,- 
               <br />
               000, we are told, and if we are entitled to 
               <br />
               have $33 per head placed to our credit on 
               <br />
               capital account, we are $7,590,000 better 
               <br />
               off to-day than we would have been 
               <br />
               if Mr. Haultain had succeeded when he 
               <br />
               ﬁrst commenced. It is all very well to 
               <br />
               say that we could get a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lie-arrangement,</span> but 
               <br />
               I notice that the other provinces have not 
               <br />
               been successful in their attempt in that re- 
               <br />
               spect. When we do form a province, we 
               <br />
               want it formed on such terms and condi-.' 
               <br />
               tions that we will not have to ask for better 
               <br />
               terms from year to year. We see the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba loaded up with a big debt. 
               <br />
               We may call it a guarantee of bonds and 
               <br />
               say that the people will not have to pay the 
               <br />
               interest, but nevertheless it is a liability 
               <br />
               against the province which they may be 
               <br />
               called upon to pay. The North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories is getting all that work done by 
               <br />
               the federal government, and I think they 
               <br />
               are better off as they are to-day. The 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition told us that he 
               <br />
               considered the question of the number of 
               <br />
               provinces into which we are to be divided 
               <br />
               as a secondary consideration. If he went 
               <br />
               to my district he would ﬁnd out what a mis- 
               <br />
               take he makes in that. The southern belt 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories has had the 
               <br />
               advantages of a transcontinental railway 
               <br />
               for 22 years, but the northern belt has been 
               <br />
               without railway-s until the last few years. 
               <br />
               There were a couple of railways there, but 
               <br />
               they might as well have been built to the 
               <br />
               moon, for they were of no use whatever to 
               <br />
               colonization. It is only now that the north- 
               <br />
               ern portion of the district is getting immi- 
               <br />
               gration, and as a member of the district I 
               <br />
               will say that the people there are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre</span> 
               <br />
               pared to go in with the people of the south- 
               <br />
               ern portion to form one province. We 
               <br />
               think there should be two provinces, and if 
               <br />
               my hon. friend (Mr. Borden, Halifax) were 
               <br />
               leading the government he would not coerce 
               <br />
               us unless he wanted to have another rebel- 
               <br />
               lion on his hands like that which the Con- 
               <br />
               servatives fomented in 1885. All that has 
               <br />
               to be taken into consideration. If the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. Borden, Halifax) goes to Cal- 
               <br />
               gary, which is the centre of this agitation, 
               <br />
               he will ﬁnd that the people there want three 
               <br />
               provinces, and some of them want four pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. If he told the people of Calgary 
               <br />
               that he wanted one province, the ﬁrst ques- 
               <br />
               tion they would put to him was: Would 
               <br />
               he have the capital in Calgary, and if he 
               <br />
               proposed to leave it to the Legislative assem- 
               <br />

               waiting until something else turned up. The 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition has perhaps ap- 
               <br />
               proached this subject in a fair spirit, and I 
               <br />
               am glad to know that he is prepared to lend 
               <br />
               his assistance at all times, and to sym-

               of demands made by Premier Haultain. 
               <br />
               They are modest demands in a way, and the 
               <br />
               people of the North-west would be glad to 
               <br />

               dorses them. If the hon. gentleman only gets 
               <br />
               rup and states that it is a good thing to have 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy he might as well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span> 
               <br />
               that it would be a good thing if the sun: 
               <br />
               would shin-e to-morrow, or that it would- 
               <br />
               rain next summer, but the people of the ter- 
               <br />
               ritories want something more deﬁnite than 
               <br />
               that. They have been educated by—I was 
               <br />
               going to say my friend Mr. Haultain—they 
               <br />
               have been educated by the friend of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition up to considering 
               <br />
               that they were entitled to the conditions 
               <br />
               laid down in his proposition, and the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition will ﬁnd it hard to satisfy- 
               <br />
               public opinion without going as far as Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain proposes. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. Boa-den) stated that in 1902 Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain swept the country for provincial auto- 
               <br />
               nomy. Everybody knows that Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain adopted the tactics of the wily politi- 
               <br />
               cian, and that he took a snap verdict. I 
               <br />
               fancy that if sufﬁcient time were given to 
               <br />
               have threshed out the question of political 
               <br />
               autonomy and other questions, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haul:</span> 
               <br />
               tain would not have a majority at all. But, 
               <br />
               when the people were putting their crops 
               <br />
               in, and could not get to the polls, he brought 
               <br />
               on the elections and got a snap verdict, and 
               <br />
               he claims it as a verdict in favour of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial autonomy. I want to say that the 
               <br />
               people took no stock at all in that question. 
               <br />
               The leader of the opposition might as well 
               <br />
               say that when Mr. Roblin was returned to 
               <br />
               power the people of Manitoba pronounced in 
               <br />
               favour of a high tariff, because Mr. Roblin 
               <br />
               mentioned it on the platform. Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain is in the same position. The people 
               <br />
               did not take any stock in the question of 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy, because they knew it 
               <br />
               had to come from Ottawa and not from him, 
               <br />
               and as a matter of fact Mr. Haultain got 
               <br />
               several in my district. I supported him 
               <br />
               myself, and I helped him to the best of my 
               <br />
               ability to carry some seats, and 1 never con- 
               <br />
               sidered the question of provincial autonomy 
               <br />
               at all. I want to say as one of the represen- 
               <br />
               tatives from that country, that the people 
               <br />
               whom I represent are opposed to provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy at present. I think we are well off 
               <br />
               as we are. We have been treated very: 
               <br />
               generously, and with the help of the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition, we will be treated more 
               <br />
               generously in the future in getting sufﬁ- 
               <br />
               cient subsidies to run the affairs of the coun- 
               <br />
               try without going into debt, and without
