               census of 1901. The very fact of your giving 
               <br />
               them ten members is evidence that you are 
               <br />
               not bound by the census of 1901. If you are 
               <br />
               bound by the census of 1901 the Territories 
               <br />
               would receive only six members, but you

               <br />
               general elections in May, 1902. The question of 
               <br />
               larger representation in the federal parliament 
               <br />
               is without doubt an important one, but the in— 
               <br />
               ﬁnitely more urgent question of provincial or- 
               <br />
               ganization should not be subordinated to it. 
               <br />
               The two questions are quite separate and in— 
               <br />
               dependent, and cannot, I think I have shown,

               affect one another. Under any circumstances,
