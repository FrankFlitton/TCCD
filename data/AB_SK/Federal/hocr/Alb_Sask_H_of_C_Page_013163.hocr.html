               hon. gentleman says is necessary for the establish- 
               <br />
               ment of a united state? The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               says that unity is vital. Unity is well nigh 
               <br />
               vital to the existence of a nationality, but all 
               <br />
               experience shows that unity is not absolutely 
               <br />
               necessary to the maintenance of a state. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, by his policy, proposes to conﬁne 
               <br />
               his efforts at reform to remote regions Where few 
               <br />
               men dwell, and he allows the barrier which he says 
               <br />
               threatens the permanence of the state to exist 
               <br />
               here at the capital. Let us go far away from the 
               <br />
               seat of war, in order to conquer. Could there be 
               <br />
               greater infatuation ? The hon gentleman, when he 
               <br />
               was speaking, heard cries of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“ecoutez,”</span> on this 
               <br />
               side of the House, and he thought this a word of 
               <br />
               treasonable import, a word that endangered the 
               <br />
               unity of the state. If hon. gentlemen on that 
               <br />
               side and on this had said “ hear, hear,” we should 
               <br />
               have been in no danger; the permanency of the 
               <br />
               union would have been in no way threatened ; 
               <br />
               but to say “ecoutez ” was a very different thing, 
               <br />
               and calls for the serious consideration of every 
               <br />
               member of the House. Now, the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has quoted paragraphs from Freeman and Muller, 
               <br />
               but those quotations do not sustain the argument 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman. His contention is not 
               <br />
               theirs. The hon. gentleman confounds nation with 
               <br />
               state. Professor Freeman and Professor Muller do 
               <br />
               not do so. They could not say what the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman says without being contradicted by the 
               <br />
               condition of things existing in almost every country 
               <br />
               in Europe. The Gypsies are a nation ; the Jews are 
               <br />
               a nation ; the Poles are a nation, but neither Gypsies, 
               <br />
               Jews nor Poles are a state. The United 
               <br />
               Kingdom is composed of English, Irish, Scotch and 
               <br />
               Welsh ; there is one state, but there are four nation- 
               <br />
               alities. England has an immense predominence in 
               <br />
               wealth, numbers in literary and legal force over 
               <br />
               Wales ; the Union has existed for eight hundred 
               <br />
               years, and there is no probability of Wales being 
               <br />
               absorbed as a part of the English nation and losing 
               <br />
               its national identity, VVelshmen are still VVelshmen 
               <br />
               and not Englishmen ; they are still two nationalities 
               <br />
               in one state, not less united politically because they 
               <br />
               are still two nations. The political bonds between 
               <br />
               Ireland and England are exactly or very nearly the 
               <br />
               same as thosebetween Wales and England. Ireland 
               <br />
               perhaps is not so well united as Wales, but the line 
               <br />
               of cleavage is not between those who speak Erse and 
               <br />
               those who speak English. Mr. Parnell reckons a 
               <br />
               much larger number of English-speaking Irishmen 
               <br />
               among his followers than those who only speak 
               <br />
               Erse. The truth is that the line of cleavage is 
               <br />
               through the English-speaking population, and it is 
               <br />
               due to other causes than diﬂ‘erence in language.

               understand each other, may nevertheless entirely 
               <br />
               agree in political sentiment. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               quotes this sentence from Max Miiller :

               <br />
               uses the expression ; but I altogether dissent from 
               <br />
               the use the hon. gentleman has made of it. Pro- 
               <br />
               fessor Miiller is considering man as a social being, 
               <br />

               <br />
               known as a Federal State. VVhy,Sir, the English 
               <br />

               the same language. Are they politically united ? 
               <br />
               Are they drawn together, or have they, for the 
               <br />
               past century, been drawn together in the way the

               hon. gentleman has spoken ‘2 Are England and the 
               <br />
               United States more inclined to unite politically 
               <br />
               than England and Wales, than England and the 
               <br />
               Highlands of Scotland? The hon. member cannot 
               <br />
               answer without destroying his argument. We in 
               <br />
               Ontario speak English, and so do the people 
               <br />
               of New York and the people of Virginia; but 
               <br />
               is the hon. gentleman more inclined to a union 
               <br />
               on the banks of the Potomac than on the banks 
               <br />
               of the Ottawa? If the hon. gentleman’s argu- 
               <br />
               ment has any value, the hon. gentleman himself 
               <br />
               would prefer a union with the United States to a 
               <br />
               union with the people of the Province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               Switzerland has, as several hon. gentlemen have 
               <br />
               stated during this debate, three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nationalities—the</span> 
               <br />
               German, the French, and the Italian, who are 
               <br />
               all loyal to the republic. Many centuries ago 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> nationalities found their way through 
               <br />
               the glens and valleys of the Alps, and if race 
               <br />
               and language were the strongest considerations 
               <br />
               they would have formed parts of Italy, France and 
               <br />
               Germany. But for four centuries they have been 
               <br />
               a united country. The French population of 
               <br />
               Switzerland have not been less loyal to that gov- 
               <br />
               ernment because they have on the western border 
               <br />
               a people speaking the same language ; the Italian 
               <br />
               population of the south have not been less loyal to 
               <br />
               that country because they have on the southern 
               <br />
               border a people speaking the same Ian uage and of 
               <br />
               the same race. If you had to app y the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s doctrine to Switzerland, how long, I 
               <br />
               ask, would that union last? Suppose the German 
               <br />
               population were to insist that the union has no 
               <br />
               value because the people do not all speak the one 
               <br />
               language? I would like to know whether the 
               <br />
               French, sooner than be denationalised, would not 
               <br />
               seek a union with France and the Italian popula- 
               <br />

               That is precisely what we have here. Such, too, 
               <br />
               is the position of Austria, of Switzerland, and of 
               <br />
               the United Kingdom. The hon. gentleman will 
               <br />
               see that in the very quotation which he makes 
               <br />
               from Professor Freeman the fact is stated—and 
               <br />
               it would be impossible that he could say other-

               language there is less friction than where there are 
               <br />
               several. It is true that there may be less danger of 
               <br />
               division and of certain forms of party strife where 
               <br />
               all the pee 1e are of one nationality than where

               they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> several. But that is not the question 
               <br />
