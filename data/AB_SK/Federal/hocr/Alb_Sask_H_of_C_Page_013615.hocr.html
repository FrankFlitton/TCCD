               My right hon. friend points to the unit 
               <br />
               of population. Well, the unit of Prince 
               <br />
               Edward Island, British Columbia and 
               <br />
               Manitoba, when those provinces came 
               <br />
               in, was not at all the same unit 
               <br />
               as prevailed in the other provinces. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman knows that as 
               <br />
               well as I do, every member of the House 
               <br />
               knows it. Under this very Bill the unit of 
               <br />
               population in the North-west Territories is 
               <br />
               not the same. I am not ﬁnding any fault 
               <br />
               with the Bill in that regard, because I do 
               <br />
               not think that too great a representation is 
               <br />
               being given to the North-west Territories. 
               <br />
               But still the unit of population there is 
               <br />
               smaller than it is in the other provinces. 
               <br />
               The unit of population for the North-west 
               <br />
               Territories under the last census would be 
               <br />
               less than 16,000, whereas in the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces it is between 25,000 and 20,000.

               Now what is to be gained by going on 
               <br />
               while this matter is sub judice? It is practi- 
               <br />
               cally sub judice at the present time, because 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice is taking steps, as I 
               <br />
               understand, to have ths matter referred to 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court, under a provision in 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court Act. Suppose that we 
               <br />
               go on in the meantime and delimit the con- 
               <br />
               stituencies in the provinces where changes 
               <br />
               have to be made, the work of our com- 
               <br />
               mittee will be all for naught in case the 
               <br />
               decision should be against the view which 
               <br />
               has been expressed by the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice. I have every possible respect for the 
               <br />
               opinion of my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, as I said before; but although he 
               <br />
               is strong on this point, he very candidly 
               <br />
               admits to the House that he is not infallible. 
               <br />
               None of us claim to be infallible, and it 
               <br />
               . may happen that he is mistaken. I have 
               <br />
               not a very pronounced opinion myself, I 
               <br />
               have not a pronounced opinion against that 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Justice; but I can see 
               <br />
               that a strong argument can be made on the 
               <br />
               other side. I can also see that the argu- 
               <br />
               ment of the Minister of Justice leads to some 
               <br />
               extraordinary conclusions. For example, he 
               <br />
               based his argument almost entirely upon 
               <br />

               provinces, as the right hon. gentleman him- 
               <br />
               self has stated. Well, suppose you had had

               in the addresses under which those different 
               <br />

               parliament of Canada might afterwards de-

               argument of the Minister of Justice to—day

               <br />

               tion of Ontario, and Quebec, and the mari- 
               <br />
               time provinces. I submit to the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, that this would be the logical 
               <br />
               result. It seems to me, with all deference to 
               <br />
               the opinion of the Minister of Justice, that 
               <br />
               if the argument cannot be based upon a 
               <br />
               higher ground than that, there is good cause 
               <br />
               for referring this matter to the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court. As I said before, we might simply 
               <br />
               be wasting our time by going on now and

               dealing with this matter while the question

               hon. gentleman who leads the government 
               <br />
