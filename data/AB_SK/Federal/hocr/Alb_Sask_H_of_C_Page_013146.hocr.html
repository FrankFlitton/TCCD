               In concluding these few observations which I make

               <br />
               of this country likewise understand each other, I 
               <br />
               beseech those hon. members who seek to agitate 
               <br />
               the people to let us wage our political warfare on 
               <br />
               the legitimate ground of politics ; to let us make 
               <br />
               our endeavors so that harmony may prevail among 
               <br />
               all races ; to allow us to work together for the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of the bonds that unite us. Under those 
               <br />
               conditions we shall see the country neither agita- 
               <br />
               ted nor threatened, but united ; we shall have a 
               <br />

               Canadian or any other Canadian may live in peace. 
               <br />
               It is a fortunate thing that we should have, as 
               <br />
               leaders of the French Canadian members of this

               Mr. ROBILLARD. Mr. Speaker, if this Bill 
               <br />
               had been moved by an ordinary member, I would 
               <br />
               have sat in my chair and given a silent vote ; but 
               <br />
               as the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy) is the mover of it, I beg to address a few 
               <br />
               words to the House as a Canadian from Ontario, 
               <br />
               speaking French, if you like ; for I call myself a 
               <br />
               Canadian, and it is the only name by which I 
               <br />
               call myself. The hon. member has been going 
               <br />
               through the country, and has very seldom lost an 
               <br />
               occasion to throw mud at us. Sir, the very 
               <br />
               preamble of his Bill I look upon as an insult to 
               <br />
               any French Canadian in this country. The idea 
               <br />
               that the fact of my speaking French is a barrier 
               <br />
               between me and my English-speaking neighbor I 
               <br />
               deny. It is true, Sir, we speak French, but we 
               <br />
               are learning English as fast as we can, and we are 
               <br />
               proud of it. Why should we not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> I say that 
               <br />
               every sensible French Canadian would wish to 
               <br />
               have his children learn English as well as French. 
               <br />
               I would not be doing my duty to my child if I did 
               <br />
               not allow him to learn English, because if he did 
               <br />
               not he would not have a fair start in the world 
               <br />
               with the children of my English~speaking neighbors. 
               <br />
               But when I hear men like the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Muskoka (Mr. O’Brien) say that they are not 
               <br />
               attacking our language, I may say to him that 
               <br />
               people do not feel the insult that is given to others. 
               <br />
               That hon. member is not so sensitive as the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe, because he has taken 
               <br />
               up the cause of people who have never asked him, 
               <br />
               people who do not suffer ; for I challenge the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to show that there was ever a complaint 
               <br />
               in the North-VVest on this subject before he went 
               <br />
               up there himself to sow the seed of dissension. As 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman knows, the people of the North- 
               <br />
               West do not pay that paltry sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$500</span> 
               <br />
               which the use of the language there costs. I do 
               <br />
               not know the amount for which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />

               <br />
               his share of that cost does not amount to a mill. I 
               <br />
               say that the preamble of this Bill itself is a false 
               <br />
               pretension and a false proposition. Although I 
               <br />
               speak French and am a Roman Catholic, I can 
               <br />
               live at peace with my English and Protestant 
               <br />
               neighbor. I do not care whether he is an Orange- 
               <br />
               man, a black Presbyterian or a Methodist, I can 
               <br />
               go and walk with him arm-in-arm on Sunday 
               <br />
               morning, and he drops into his church and 
               <br />
               I into mine, and we can escort <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each,</span> other 
               <br />
               back to our homes afterwards in a friendly and 
               <br />
               neighborly way. The time is past when people 
               <br />
               may hate each other for God’s sake. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from North Simcoe professes to do all this 
               <br />
               for love of the poor French Canadians ; he wants 
               <br />
               to get us out of the crushing power of the clergy 
               <br />
               in Lower Canada ; he is sorry to see us going to 
               <br />
               the States, and he invites us to go to Ontario ; but 
               <br />
               what does he say? If you come into Ontario, you 
               <br />
               must shut your month; you are not allowed to 
               <br />
               speak your language. I know something of What 
               <br />
               I am speaking about, for I had the honor to 
               <br />
               represent a county in eastern Ontario, where 
               <br />
               people often come from Lower Canada, and I have 
               <br />
               always been proud and glad to see them, because 
               <br />
               they have been peaceable and respectable and moral 
               <br />
               citizens, though they could not speak a word of 
               <br />
               English. According to the idea of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe, these people may send their 
               <br />
               children to school, but the school must be taught 
               <br />
               by an English teacher. The hon. member, with 
               <br />
               his great love for the French Canadians, would 
               <br />
               not allow one to teach a school in Ontario, 
               <br />
               no matter how efﬁcient he might be. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman will not deny that fact, for 
               <br />
               I have his own words for it in a speech he 
               <br />
               made in December last in the city of Ottawa. 
               <br />
               You know, Sir, he is one of the fathers of this 
               <br />
               Imperial Federation scheme. I will not say much 
               <br />
               about Imperial Federation, because it has not yet 
               <br />
               assumed a practical shape, and I think it will be 
               <br />
               a long time before it does ; but, Sir, he is the 
               <br />
               father of another party— a party that made a great 
               <br />
               racket in Ontario and in the capital of this Domi— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nion—what</span> they call the Equal Rights party, but 
               <br />
               what I call the Unequal Rights party, from the 
               <br />
               way they put it in practice. Under the wing of 
               <br />
               that Equal Rights agitation, under the pretence 
               <br />
               of British fair play to the French Canadians, he 
               <br />
               said he would not allow a French Canadian to 
               <br />
               teach ina French county, were he ever so clever a 
               <br />
               man, because, there being French blood in his 
               <br />
               veins, the tendency of this teaching would be 
               <br />
               to Frenchify and not to Anglicise the people. That 
               <br />
               is the way he shows his great liberality. I would 
               <br />
               like the hon. gentleman to show his affection 
               <br />
               and love to his wife in that way. I would like 
               <br />
               to see him come to her with sweet and warm 
               <br />
               words in contradiction with his acts. Acts

               are stronger than words. Let him act towards 
               <br />
               his wife as he does towards us; let him lose 
               <br />
               no opportunity to trample on her feet, to hurt 
               <br />
               her feelings, and to deprive her of her rights, and 
               <br />
               he will soon come to the conclusion, to which I

               <br />
               I gave my wife when I took her. I said to her: 
               <br />
               Here I am; I wish you to try and make yourself 
               <br />
               happy with me, with all my faults, as you ﬁnd 
               <br />
