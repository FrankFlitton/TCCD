               <br />
               this item, but let me say a word with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to certain ‘demands,’ it we may call 
               <br />
               them so, or, suggestions that were made by 
               <br />
               the responsible people representing the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories. The Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior has quoted a clause in which they 
               <br />
               practically demand—or in which they sug- 
               <br />
               gest, at all events—that the public resources 
               <br />
               should be handed over to the local author- 
               <br />
               ity. The hon. minister also said that he 
               <br />
               doubted whether any agreement which the 
               <br />
               House of Commons at the present time 
               <br />
               could be got to accept, would be such an 
               <br />
               agreement as would not compel the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories to come back here within 
               <br />
               one or two years. That simply proves to 
               <br />
               my mind that the demands or suggestions 
               <br />
               made by the government of the North-west 
               <br />
               are not unreasonable. It may be that to a 
               <br />
               majority of the members of the House of 
               <br />
               Commons at the present time, they might 
               <br />
               seem unreasonable, but it, unless these sug- 
               <br />
               gestions are adopted, the position is going 
               <br />
               to involve a lack of permanency in the ar- 
               <br />
               rangement, then we must come to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that there is reason in the sugges- 
               <br />
               tion made by those who represent the 
               <br />
               N orth-west Territories.

               I dealt at some length last session with 
               <br />
               this phase of the question, devoting myself 
               <br />
               not to an argument in favour of the propo- 
               <br />
               sition that the time had arrived, but to some 
               <br />
               phase of the terms which I thought ought 
               <br />
               to be arranged. I say now, as I said then, 
               <br />
               that I do not believe that any arrangement 
               <br />
               will have the basis of permanency, or that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> arrangement will ever he arrived at 
               <br />
               that would be satisfactory to the people of 
               <br />
               the North—west, except an arrangement by 
               <br />
               which the public resources shall be handed 
               <br />
               over to the local authority, and that they 
               <br />
               shall be placed upon the same basis as are 
               <br />
               the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofethe</span> other provinces of Canada, 
               <br />
               except the province of Manitoba. Leaving 
               <br />
               that phase of the question, and turning to 
               <br />
               the item, it is evident that the people of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories are not going to be 
               <br />
               granted provincial autonomy this year, and 
               <br />
               that being so, the local authority needs money 
               <br />
               to carry on this year’s business. I accept 
               <br />
               what has been said by my hon. friend the 
               <br />

               with regard to the reply he made to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) re- 
               <br />
               specting the fact that there were two sides 
               <br />
               to the question, even with regard to the 
               <br />
               estimate; I do not know that it would be 
               <br />
               fair to adopt that statement with too great 
               <br />
               positiveness. As I endeavoured to explain 
               <br />
               at an earlier stage, this in reality at the 
               <br />
               present time, is simply one of the ordinary 
               <br />
               services which parliament is in duty bound 
               <br />
               to provide for. With regard to every other 
               <br />
               department of government, the minister has 
               <br />
               the advice of oﬂicers who are directly re- 
               <br />
               sponsible to him, as to the money he asks 
               <br />
               the House of Commons to vote; but with 
               <br />
               regard to this particular service the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior has no responsible oiﬁcer 
               <br />
               who is in a position to declare whether the 
               <br />
               estimates that are submitted by the North- 
               <br />
               west government are reasonable estimates 
               <br />
               or not. I therefore say that the demand 
               <br />
               that is made by the North-west govern- 
               <br />
               ment has in a great measure to be accepted 
               <br />
               as ﬁnal. The North—west authorities are 
               <br />
               the people who make the estimate: they 
               <br />
               are responsible to the electors there for the 
               <br />
               amount of the estimate which they present, 
               <br />
               and therefore this service is in a different 
               <br />
               position from probably any other service 
               <br />
               that the House of Commons has to provide 
               <br />
               for. The authorities there have this year 
               <br />
               stated that they need an amount approxi- 
               <br />
               mating $000,000. As a matter of fact, esti- 
               <br />
               mates were brought down in the House of 
               <br />
               Assembly at Regina last week appropriating 
               <br />
               about $600,000. I accept with pleasure the 
               <br />
               intimation of the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               that an increase will be provided in the 
               <br />
               supplementary estimates, and I wish again 
               <br />
               to impress upon him as strongly as I can 
               <br />
               the real necessity for a very large and sub- 
               <br />
               stantial increase.

               Mr. HENDERSON. It is early yet, only 
               <br />
               two minutes past twelve, and we have a 
               <br />
               large subject before us. Possibly we cannot 
               <br />
               do better than discuss it fully even at this 
               <br />
               late hour of the night. To my mind we have 
               <br />
               a very serious problem to settleinthe North- 
               <br />
               west. I look upon this question as one that 
               <br />
               will require the very best consideration 
               <br />
               this government can give to it. A new popu-

               tories; coming in from various countries, 
               <br />
               and no doubt that population will demand 
               <br />
               increased <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights.</span> To my mind, so long as

               of this government, no spirit of self—reli-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anlce</span> will ever assert itself amongst them.

               They will realize that they are dependant on

               us for the little bit of money we choose from
