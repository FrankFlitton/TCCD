               Mr. CHARLTON. We did saddle it, and we 
               <br />
               should unsaddle it. The hon. member for Cardwell 
               <br />
               (Mr. White) says that he believes in Provincial 
               <br />
               rights in this matter. Well, there is something 
               <br />
               rather curious in connection with the backdown of 
               <br />
               the Government upon this question of Provincial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights.</span> It rather provokes my surprise. I can 
               <br />
               remember when the Rivers and Streams Bill was 
               <br />
               disallowed again and again ; I can remember when 
               <br />
               the railway legislation of Manitoba was disallowed, 
               <br />
               and when the Government asserted—and they 
               <br />
               told the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">truth—“that</span> they had unquestionably 
               <br />
               an unlimited power in the matter of disallowance. 
               <br />
               There can be no question, it is a matter in the 
               <br />
               discretion of the Government, which is responsible 
               <br />
               only to the people for the proper exercise of that 
               <br />
               power, and yet the Government have become the 
               <br />
               advocate of Provincial rights. They have had a 
               <br />
               new revelation on this matter ; they have had a 
               <br />
               new light as to their duty ; they do not feel war- 
               <br />
               ranted now in meddling with Provincial rights at 
               <br />
               all since the Jesuit Estates’ Bill; and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Cardwell has no doubt whatever that 
               <br />
               in this difﬁculty Provincial rights should govern. 
               <br />
               I think the position of the Government is scarcely 
               <br />
               a creditable one ; its abandonment of their 
               <br />
               position with regard to their right to exercise the 
               <br />
               veto power in the case of Provincial legislation 
               <br />
               does not reﬂect credit on them.

               <br />

               <br />
               organised, for the settlement of this question, 
               <br />
               because it is a matter pertinent to Provincial 
               <br />
               rights, and I say it is a matter which pertains to 
               <br />
               us. The authority emanates from us, the clause 
               <br />
               was adopted by us, the clause should be rescinded

               <br />
               by us, and then the Provinces of the N orth—VVest 
               <br />
               will be placed in the position to exercise Provincial 
               <br />
               rights, and say whether they will have this thing 
               <br />
               or not. Reference was made by some speaker, in 
               <br />
               the early part of the debate, to the petitions sent 
               <br />
               in by the N orth-V’Vest Council, and the insinuation 
               <br />
               was made that the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) had bought the Council. I do not 
               <br />
               remember who made this charge. I do not think 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe has the funds 
               <br />
               to buy that Council, and I would not deem it a 
               <br />
               very creditable thing on the part of any hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber to cast that imputation upon him. Another 
               <br />
               assertion made was that his 8 each has captured it. 
               <br />
               That is an assertion more attering to the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman than the other, and I have no doubt 
               <br />
               his 3 ch had very much weight and inﬂuence in

               of the French members of this House who believe 
               <br />
               in the extension of their language over the North- 
               <br />

               and I shall respect their action if they vote accord- 
               <br />
               ingly ; but I cannot agree with them, and will 
               <br />
               therefore vote the other way. I hope that the 
               <br />
               French members will forgive, if they deem it 
               <br />
               necessary to forgive, that feeling which they can- 
               <br />
               not endorse, but which English-speaking members 
               <br />
               of this House entertain—a feeling of pride in the 
               <br />
               history of the British Empire; that feeling which 
               <br />
               causes them to take pleasure in contemplating the 
               <br />
               result of the battle upon the Plains of Abraham; 
               <br />
               that feeling which leads them to rejoice in the 
               <br />
               results of the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar, and 
               <br />
               in the results of the Battle of Waterloo ; that feel- 
               <br />
               ing which makes them view with pride the progress 
               <br />
               of the British Empire, and inspire in them the belief 
               <br />
               that British institutions are the best calculated to 
               <br />
               conduce to the prosperity and welfare of mankind. 
               <br />
               I hope, Sir, they will forgive our purpose, our 
               <br />
               avowed purpose, to make this a Saxon state. The 
               <br />
               avowed purpose of the Anglo-Saxon is to make the 
               <br />
               Anglo-Saxon race the greatest race on the earth, 
               <br />
               and the hope of the Anglo-Saxon is that the day 
               <br />
               will come, and come before many decades have 
               <br />
               elapsed, when the English language will be the 
               <br />
               common means of intercomxnunication between all 
               <br />
               the races of the world, and the En lish race will 
               <br />
               be the dominant race of the worl , so that the 
               <br />
               Anglo-Saxon will fulﬁl the destiny which God has 
               <br />
               evidently designed he shall fulﬁl in this world.
