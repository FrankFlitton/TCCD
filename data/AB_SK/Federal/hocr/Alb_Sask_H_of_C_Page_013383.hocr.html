               this subject passed last session, and the language

               for the present, there is the provision that, after

               the next Assembly is elected, the Assembly shall

               gentleman will see that, while it is only a 
               <br />
               reasonable concession, it is also an inevitable 
               <br />
               concession, because any legislative body will 
               <br />

               Assembly to listen to the views of a gentleman who 
               <br />
               desired to express himself in any other than the 
               <br />
               English language, I am sure that in this country

               and in almost any civilized country, the views he 
               <br />
               desired to so express would be heard with due re-

               provinces have a right to decide for them
