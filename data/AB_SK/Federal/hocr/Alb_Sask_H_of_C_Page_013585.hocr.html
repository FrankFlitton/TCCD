               spect to the redistribution of the constitu-

               encies in the provinces, a principle which 
               <br />
               was laid down by the right hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               government (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier), 
               <br />
               as I understood him when he presented this 
               <br />
               Bill, is that we should maintain county boun- 
               <br />
               darics, and that after having settled the 
               <br />
               principle that in so far as it is possible 
               <br />
               county boundaries should be maintained the 
               <br />
               subdivision of any county is a matter that 
               <br />
               parliament should deal with and that subdi- 
               <br />
               vision is to be made by a committee of the 
               <br />
               House, as stated by him when he introduced 
               <br />
               the Bill. In respect to the principle that 
               <br />
               was laid down by the right hon. the leader of 
               <br />
               the government that we would adhere to 
               <br />
               municipal or county boundaries, I would 
               <br />
               like to say to the House that that prin- 
               <br />
               ciple was laid down by the late Sir John 
               <br />
               Macdonald in 1871 at the time of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               redistribution, and that it was acquiesced 
               <br />
               in by the then leaders of the opposition, 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Mackenzie and Hon. Mr. Blake, 
               <br />
               and was concurred in by Sir Charles Tupper, 
               <br />
               who also spoke upon that question. There- 
               <br />
               fore, the question of adhering to county 
               <br />
               boundaries may be considered as a question 
               <br />
               that was determined by the leaders of both 
               <br />
               political .parties in 1871. It is true that 
               <br />
               for purposes to which it is not necessary 
               <br />
               to refer now that principle was departed 
               <br />
               from in 1882, but it was not departed from 
               <br />
               by the Liberal party, and in so far as we 
               <br />
               are concerned our position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is the 
               <br />
               position we occupied in 1871, that we should 
               <br />
               maintain county boundaries. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Having</span> stated 
               <br />
               that much, I now proceed to submit to the 
               <br />
               . House the method of reasoning adopted by 
               <br />
               me in support of the proposed redistribution 
               <br />
               of seats. This matter is to be referred to the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court of Canada; it will be argued 
               <br />
               there, and in so far as I am concerned I will 
               <br />
               be content to state now the position I 
               <br />
               take without adding any argument in sup- 
               <br />
               port of it. It seems to me the time to argue 
               <br />
               this abstract legal question will be when 
               <br />
               we come to submit the matter to the Su- 
               <br />
               preme Court, because it would be to some 
               <br />
               extent forestalling the judgment of the Sn- 
               <br />
               preme Court if we were to argue it here 
               <br />
               to-day. I will be content at present to leave 
               <br />
               it to the House to appreciate how far my 
               <br />
               conclusions ﬂow from the position I lay 
               <br />
               down. My hon. friend who spoke last said 
               <br />
               the fathers of confederation provided for 
               <br />
               the then present. So far as I am concerned, 
               <br />
               as I read the Confederation Act, the inten- 
               <br />
               .tion was to provide for the then present and 
               <br />
               to provide for the future, and it is because 
               <br />
               I maintain that the British North America 
               <br />
               Act provided for the future that I have 
               <br />
               reached the conclusion to which I will have 
               <br />
               occasion to refer by and by. Am I right 
               <br />
               when I say that the British North America 
               <br />
               Act provided for the future, and that when 
               <br />
               the British North America Act was passed
