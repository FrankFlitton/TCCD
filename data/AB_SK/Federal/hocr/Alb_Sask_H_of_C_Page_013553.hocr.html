               Mr. BOYD. I wish to say a few words 
               <br />
               on this question, and principally for the 
               <br />
               reason that last winter I had the pleasure 
               <br />
               of attending a public meeting at Indian 
               <br />
               Head in East Assiniboia, where about 1,000 
               <br />
               people were gathered to discuss this very 
               <br />
               question as to whether the territories should 
               <br />
               or should not have their own provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment or governments. Whatever doubt 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain may have had previous to 
               <br />
               that meeting, there was not the slightest 
               <br />
               doubt that the people present there were 
               <br />
               quite unanimous on the question. I could 
               <br />
               not help smiling when I heard the members 
               <br />
               for the territories speaking, and when I 
               <br />
               watched the only three or four ministers 
               <br />
               present and how they acted. The Post- 
               <br />
               master General and the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               were industriously reading their newspapers; 
               <br />
               the Minister of Agriculture was busy with 
               <br />
               his letters; they were all very indifferent, 
               <br />
               and they thought the question of so little 
               <br />
               account that they took the ﬁrst opportunity 
               <br />
               to get up and slide out of the House. They 
               <br />
               have left the whole thing to the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior. It is true that he has told 
               <br />
               the people of Manitoba and the North-west 
               <br />
               that he assumes responsibility. and is to be 
               <br />
               held responsible for the management of that 
               <br />
               country, but if he were to tell us what he 
               <br />
               thinks to-night—I do not expect he will for 
               <br />
               he has been too long in the House for that— 
               <br />
               he would tell us that he really believes that 
               <br />
               he would give the people of the territories 
               <br />
               what: they want. The objection raised by 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman for Selkirk (Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
