               In the course of the speeches which have been

               tiously alluded to the alliance between my hon.

               <br />
               they may exist. I do not say that I would not 
               <br />
               consider that the Governor in Council has not the 
               <br />
               power to veto a Bill of this kind on the ground 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dominion</span> ; but I do say that, in my belief, the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> has no right to establish local institu-

               <br />
               For that reason, I believe that this clause 110 should 
               <br />
               be repealed. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Ve</span> must remember that Canada was 
               <br />
               formerly a military colony ; we must remember 
               <br />
               that divergencies existed between the old French 
               <br />
               colonies and the English colonies in America ; and 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> of opinion, these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> of 
               <br />
               institutions, and these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differences</span> of instincts, have, 
               <br />
               to a certain extent, come down to the present day. 
               <br />
               Canada was a military colony; it had feudal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               stitutions ; and the thirteen colonies were quite 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> from Canada. The Saxon colonies are 
               <br />
               quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> in many respects from the colony of 
               <br />
               Quebec ; it is natural, therefore, that friction should 
               <br />
               arise between these two systems, and it is in the 
               <br />
               last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">degree</span> unwise to extend the area of that 
               <br />
               frlction. It would be much better to restrict it to 
               <br />
               the Province where the question under debate was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">first</span> at issue, as we would do by repealing this
