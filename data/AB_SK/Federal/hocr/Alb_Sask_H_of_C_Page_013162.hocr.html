               who fear Him. It is true that there have been 
               <br />
               many tribes scattered throughout Europe of one 
               <br />
               race, settling within the territories of other tribes 
               <br />
               and absorbed by them. It is said the Ostrogoths 
               <br />
               and the Lombards became Italians, the Franks and 
               <br />
               Burgundians became French ; certain Slavs and 
               <br />
               Wends who settled in Prussia became Germans, 
               <br />
               but in every case the absorption of these made the 
               <br />
               race by whom they were absorbed different in 
               <br />
               language from what it was before. But these 
               <br />
               tribes were without a history and without a litera- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the present, and projecting itself into the future, 
               <br />
               They were subject to new environing inﬂuences. 
               <br />
               They were out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01f</span> from their kindred and entered 
               <br />
               upon the heritage of a new world of thought and

               the world in which their primitive character had 
               <br />
               been formed no longer existed. M. Bluntchli in 
               <br />
               writing on this subject says, with reference to the

               <br />

               <br />
               soundness of the doctrines he read from Freeman 
               <br />
               and from Muller. There is a very ancient author- 
               <br />
               ity, however, which says that at one time the peo-

               ple were of one language and one speech, not in a 
               <br />
               very advanced condition of society, that they delibe- 
               <br />
               rately abused their advantage, that the unity of the 
               <br />
               race was broken, and that language was diversiﬁed 
               <br />
               by Divine interference. The race was broken 
               <br />
               up into classes, and they were scattered over the 
               <br />
               world, and sent to school. The currents of that 
               <br />
               division have flown into a great many channels,and 
               <br />
               men have gained more advantages from the divison, 
               <br />
               than they have endured misfortunes. The limitless 
               <br />
               capabilities of the human intellect have been shown ; 
               <br />
               through many vicissitudes, the race has, in each 
               <br />
               class, learned much, and all have been advanced 
               <br />
               to a higher elevation, to a purer atmosphere, and 
               <br />

               <br />
               only have resulted in working folly and mischief. 
               <br />
               The hon. member wants a united Empire ; he 
               <br />
               insists that the whole British Empire should be 
               <br />
               united in one confederation. Well, if the doctrine 
               <br />
               he has laid down, with regard to Canada, is sound, 
               <br />
               it is equally sound when applied to the whole 
               <br />
               Empire ; and so we must have three hundred

               be determined by a majority, that the Hindoos 
               <br />
               would have their way, and instead of all of us 
               <br />
               abandoning French and learning English, we 
               <br />
               should have to give up both French and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English,</span> 
               <br />
               and learn Hindoo. We have, according to thls 
               <br />
               View, not simply to undertake to establish English 
               <br />
               at the foot of the Rockies, but a common language 
               <br />
               at the foot of the Himalayas as well. The hon.

               gentleman insists on a unity and cohesion whlch 
               <br />
               is denied by Providence to modern states. Ancient 
               <br />
               governments were united ; ancient overnments 
               <br />
               counted men as nothing; the indivi ual had 110 
               <br />
               rights as against the state ; but in every modern 
               <br />
               state there is an element of clay as well as of iron ; 
               <br />
               there is an element of dissolution as well as of 
               <br />
               strength, and that element is the individuality of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mell-</span> 
               <br />
               You recognise the individual as having rights <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d}5-</span> 
               <br />
               tinct, and separate, from the state; you recognise 
               <br />
               his right, when those rights are encroached <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon,</span> 
               <br />
               to stand up in their defence, and you put in jeop-

               ardy the existence of the state itself for the p_uI‘- 
               <br />
               pose of maintaining them ; and without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respecting</span> 
               <br />
               those rights the state itself cannot endure. Why 
               <br />
               should we unite for the purpose of maintaining a 
               <br />
               government unless it is goingto serve some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1311111933</span>
