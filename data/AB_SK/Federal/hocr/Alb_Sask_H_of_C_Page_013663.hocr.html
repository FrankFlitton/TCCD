               the amount of subsidy which the proposed

               <br />

               <br />

               proposition that political credit should be

               <br />
               deﬁnite proposition made by Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               in support of my statement. He submitted 
               <br />
               a draft Bill for the establishment of the 
               <br />
               territories as a province, and in that Bill 
               <br />
               he suggested the measure of subsidies which 
               <br />
               the territories should receive: 
               <br />
