               the discussion of this question, what opinion must 
               <br />
               he form of us ? We are here in a new country ; we 
               <br />
               need to develop our immense resources, agricul- 
               <br />
               tural, industrial, mineral, and all the exhaustless 
               <br />
               wealth that Providence has placed at our disposal ; 
               <br />
               we have a country extending from the Atlantic to 
               <br />
               the Paciﬁc, and sparse as is our population, we have 
               <br />
               made such progress as to challenge the admiration 
               <br />
               of the world; and here we have this prosperity 
               <br />
               placed in peril by the discussion of questions in 
               <br />
               the Parliament of Canada utterly devoid of inter- 
               <br />
               est to all with the exception of the fanatics who 
               <br />
               have provoked the debate. What can be the ob— 
               <br />
               ject of these agitators ? Can any patriotic motive 
               <br />
               inspire them? The march of events within the 
               <br />
               past few years is not unknown to us. We know 
               <br />
               how the question was raised and precipitated into 
               <br />
               the arena of public discussion, and I may ask, is 
               <br />
               there one worthy citizen, Whatever his race may 
               <br />
               be, who will be found to state that the authors of 
               <br />
               this agitation are animated by honorable Ino- 
               <br />
               tives ? The question now before us has 
               <br />
               been represented, on the one hand, as purely 
               <br />
               local, and, on the other, as one of general interest ; 
               <br />
               to me it appears that had this question been raised 
               <br />
               opportunely it should have been dealt with from a 
               <br />
               purely local point of view ; but when we consider 
               <br />
               not only the preamble of the Bill now before us, 
               <br />
               in which the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               attacks all the French Canadians hold most dear, 
               <br />
               but the violent and outrageous speech in which he 
               <br />
               introduced it, it is difﬁcult not to comprehend the 
               <br />
               motives that inspired this legislation. As has been 
               <br />
               well stated already, the people of the North-VVest, 
               <br />
               without distinction, the earliest settlers, and those 
               <br />
               Who at the cost of great sacriﬁces went in there 
               <br />
               for the purpose of colonising those vast regions, 
               <br />
               were living in peace and security, building up the 
               <br />
               country by their united efforts and extending to 
               <br />
               each other a helping hand and not one word was 
               <br />
               heard concerning the abolition of the French as an 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language. But for reasons best known to 
               <br />
               himself, a man who proclaims himself an apostle of 
               <br />
               equal rights for all, arouses an agitation for the 
               <br />
               purpose of depriving those who have made so many 
               <br />
               sacriﬁces of the right to speak their own language, 
               <br />
               or to have it ofﬁcially recognised in that section of 
               <br />
               the country. Is there any justification for the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s conduct? Not a single individual 
               <br />
               in the region referred to has raised the question, 
               <br />
               but we have this self—constituted patriot, who 
               <br />
               declares his desire to form here one British nation 
               <br />
               by a single dash of his pen, and who appears to be 
               <br />
               an admirer of all that was odious in the nal 
               <br />
               legislation of days gone by, laws that bring a blush 
               <br />
               of shame to every Englishman’s face, going into 
               <br />
               that country to arouse there passion and prejudice, 
               <br />
               and not only to disturb those who were living there 
               <br />
               in peace and harmony, but seeking to disjoint all 
               <br />
               friendly relations between the people of the older 
               <br />
               Provinces. Mr. Speaker, We cannot discuss this 
               <br />
               question in ignorance of the state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> that 
               <br />
               
            </p>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               exists around us. W e have to deal with things as 
               <br />
               they are. It is all very well to say, here is a local 
               <br />
               question that concerns the progress of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories solely. That cannot hold, the 
               <br />
               position has been complicated in such a manner by 
               <br />
               its mover that we cannot avoid its determination 
               <br />
               in the broader sense, nor the inevitable conclusions 
               <br />
               to which the presentation of the question leads us. 
               <br />
               Some have said this is merely a monetary question 
               <br />
               involving the expenditure of public moneys, whilst 
               <br />
               nearly all have urged that not only are the people 
               <br />
               of the N orth-West interested but all Canada is 
               <br />
               involved. One thing is certain, on a subject of this 
               <br />
               kind a proud race will never allow their noblest 
               <br />
               aspirations to be interfered with by mere monetary 
               <br />
               considerations. Therefore, when we discuss this 
               <br />
               question, which, if it does not interest all Canada, 
               <br />
               at all events involves the sympathies of a million 
               <br />
               and a-half of French Canadians, we cannot do other- 
               <br />
               wise, in View of the onslaught made by the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Simcoe, than to respect and uphold 
               <br />
               the sentiments of a chivalrous people who have 
               <br />
               done so much for the development of our country, 
               <br />
               and we must above all be careful not to trample 
               <br />
               upon their sacred rights. What is the history of 
               <br />
               this legislation? I have no desire to prolong the 
               <br />
               discussion by reiterating what has been so eloquent- 
               <br />
               ly said by those who have traced in glowing terms 
               <br />
               the history of our French Canadian compatriots. I 
               <br />
               shall conﬁne myself to the amendment introduced 
               <br />
               by the Hon. Senator Girard when the Bill for the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Territories was discussed before the 
               <br />
               Senate. The hon. Senator caused the insertion of 
               <br />
               the French language amendment and there was not 
               <br />
               one dissentient voice. That amendment was unani- 
               <br />
               mously conﬁrmed by the House of Commons. I 
               <br />
               have carefully noted the attitude of the press on the 
               <br />
               subject in Ontario and Quebec as well, at that time. 
               <br />
               Not a single newspaper, either English or French, 
               <br />
               not a single organ of either political party pub- 
               <br />
               lished a syllable of condemnation of that legisla- 
               <br />
               tion. On the contrary, it was everywhere conceeded 
               <br />
               that not only was an act of justice being done to 
               <br />
               the French inhabitants of the North-West, but 
               <br />
               that the best means was being adopted to induce 
               <br />
               French Canadian immigration to the Territories 
               <br />
               and prevent their exodus to the United States. No 
               <br />
               doubt the strongest inducement for them to go 
               <br />
               there was to say to them : “ You will enjoy there 
               <br />
               all the privileges you possess in the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec,” and that, Sir, was the motive that 
               <br />
               prompted the Girard amendment. Well, Sir, from 
               <br />
               that date until last summer no complaint was heard 
               <br />
               either in the press or on the platform or elsewhere, 
               <br />
               nothing was ever hinted that the progress of the 
               <br />
               Territories was being retarded by the ofﬁcial use of 
               <br />
               the French and English languages. The hon. 
               <br />
               member from Simcoe, in all his speeches, has held 
               <br />
               himself responsible for that legislation, and that 
               <br />
               he had made no move for years until he commenced 
               <br />
               his agitation in Ontario and then proceeded to dis- 
               <br />
               turb the minds of the people of the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories. Until the hon. gentleman’s crusade, 
               <br />
               nothing was heard against the legislation that he 
               <br />
               now seeks to have repealed. Under such circum- 
               <br />
               stances, we naturally ask ourselves : What is the 
               <br />
