               Will I show you the different results which can be 
               <br />
               wrought upon the feelings of a sensitive people by 
               <br />
               generous treatment ? Let me quote a speech 
               <br />
               delivered by Mr. John Dillon, M. P. for 
               <br />
               Tipperary, last year. The occasion was a demon- 
               <br />
               stration in favor of Mr. Dillon on his being released 
               <br />
               from jail, where he had served a term under the 
               <br />
               odious Coercion law. Now, I cite this s eech because 
               <br />
               it may be a lesson to the hon. mem er for North 
               <br />
               Siincoe (Mr. McCarthy) and those who agree with 
               <br />
               him in this House. Mr. Dillon said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ But it is impossible for me to be blind to the facts 
               <br />
               that are forced upon my notice as regard the mighty 
               <br />
               change which have come over the minds of the masses of 
               <br />
               the people of England, and remembering this, I think it 
               <br />
               is not wise to be impatient, because the liberty of 
               <br />
               Ireland is not to be accomplished in a day. I can see no 
               <br />
               cause for impatience, but cause rather for hope and even 
               <br />
               exultation. Coming now, as I do, from what was meant to 
               <br />
               be a degradation and an insult to me, and as I hope an 
               <br />
               honorable man, I can ﬁnd in my heart not the slightest 
               <br />
               trace of bitterness against the people of England. I re- 
               <br />
               collect the day when the power and when the name of 
               <br />
               Englishmen were hateful to my heart. It may be that 
               <br />
               Ihave been demoralised by the countless acts of kind- 
               <br />
               ness I have received at the hands of Englishmen ; but 
               <br />
               the feeling has now changed, and I cannot ﬁnd it in my 
               <br />
               heart to regret that it is fast passing away.”

               Those last words, I am sure, will ﬁll with un- 
               <br />
               bounded joy the friends of Ireland and the friends 
               <br />
               of England as well. But with what terrible mean- 
               <br />
               ing are not these words prefaced? It is known 
               <br />
               that Mr. Dillon is a man of noble and unstained 
               <br />
               character. No harsh words would be expected to 
               <br />
               cross the lips of such a man, yet he tells us there 
               <br />
               was a time when the very name of England was 
               <br />
               hateful to him. How terrible these words are? 
               <br />
               They are the expression of the bitterness accumul- 
               <br />
               ated through centuries and centuries of persecu- 
               <br />
               tions in succeeding generations of Irishmen. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, mark the change. Less than ﬁve years of a 
               <br />
               generous attempt by a great party to do justice 
               <br />
               to Ireland, to give her the liberty and justice 
               <br />
               to which she is entitled, has worked wonders 
               <br />
               and changed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> disposition of the Irish people. 
               <br />
               These ﬁve years of generous attempts to do justice 
               <br />
               to Ireland have erased the sentiment of bitterness 
               <br />
               and replaced it by sentiments of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affection</span> to the 
               <br />
               land whose very name was hateful to Ireland 
               <br />
               only a few years ago. What a triumph this is for 
               <br />
               the cause of Ireland? What a triumph this is for 
               <br />
               those who, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House, told the English people 
               <br />
               that if they were to treat the Irish people gener- 
               <br />
               ously, they would have the same result in Ireland 
               <br />
               as in this country? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> an evidence also 
               <br />
               this is that the only manner, after all, in 
               <br />
               which you can attach a people to their alle- 
               <br />
               giance is to treat them with fairness and 
               <br />
               generosity; and what a rebuke it is to all those 
               <br />
               (my hon. friend from North Simcoe included) 
               <br />
               who believe that the only manner in which to make 
               <br />
               a people loyal is to trample under foot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everything</span> 
               <br />
               which they hold dear and sacred. Sir, I have just 
               <br />
               pronounced the name of Home Rule. Home Rule 
               <br />
               with us is local autonomy, and I hope that this 
               <br />
               principle of local autonomy will some day afford us 
               <br />
               some solution of the difﬁculty we have now to deal 
               <br />
               with. What is objectionable in this Bill is not, as 
               <br />
               has been often stated, the object of the Bill itself, 
               <br />
               (which is, after all, with some exceptions, a local 
               <br />
               question), but the tendency of the Bill and the 
               <br />
               principles which underlie it, for we know that 
               <br />
               this is only a preliminary step that is to be fol~ 
               <br />
               lowed by many others. We are, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> in the

               fourth day of this debate, and I have to make the 
               <br />
               reproach that the Government have not yet told 
               <br />
               us what their policy is on the question. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov~‘</span> 
               <br />
               ernment, of late, do not discharge the duty they 
               <br />
               owe to this House. They can advise us on matters 
               <br />
               of details and matters of procedure, but when it 
               <br />
               comes to a question of principle they refuse to dis- 
               <br />
               charge the duties for which they are responsible to 
               <br />
               the House. We had a speech the other day from 
               <br />
               the hon. the Minister of Public Works. He simply 
               <br />
               told us he was against the Bill, but he affirmed no 
               <br />
               principle which we might apply to the situation. 
               <br />
               We have three propositions before us : the Bill itself, 
               <br />
               the amendment of my hon. friend from Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin) and the amendment of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil). I am free to speak 
               <br />
               of them, but in what I say I declare that I express 
               <br />
               my own personal opinion. I do not speak here as the 
               <br />
               leader of a party—I express my own opinion, and 
               <br />
               nothing more. As to the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), I have to say 
               <br />
               that, in my opinion, it is premature. It is endeav- 
               <br />
               oring to give to the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               upon one question, plenary power, while they are 
               <br />
               still in a form of tutelage. We are not repared 
               <br />
               to give to the people of the North-VVest ull local 
               <br />
               autonomy. W'e cannot expect that a population 
               <br />
               which in 1885 numbered only something like 30,000 
               <br />
               souls—the population of a small town, scattered 
               <br />
               over immense territories, out of which several 
               <br />
               empires can be carved~—can be entrusted with the 
               <br />
               full power of responsible government. The amend- 
               <br />
               ment of my hon. friend from Berthier (Mr. Beau- 
               <br />
               soleil) is, perhaps, more consistent with our true 
               <br />
               position. The amendment afﬁrms the proposition 
               <br />
               that the present state of things ought to be per— 
               <br />
               manent. With this, however, I Cannot agree, and 
               <br />
               althou h I am prepared to vote for the amendment 
               <br />
               of my on. friend from Berthier, I cannot do so 
               <br />
               Without taking exception to his statements. It is 
               <br />
               impossible to admit, for instance, that the institu- 
               <br />
               tions of the North-West are permanent. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, they are exceptionally temporary ; they 
               <br />
               deal with a state of thin s which is exceptional in 
               <br />
               itself ; they were devise at a time when there was 
               <br />
               no population, and they must be modiﬁed from 
               <br />
               time to time as the necessities of the case require. 
               <br />
               But at this moment to say they are permanent, is 
               <br />
               a thing in which I cannot agree, except so far as 
               <br />
               they must be permanent in every particular, so 
               <br />
               long as we are not ready to give these peo- 
               <br />
               ple a more extended form of local authority. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend also says in this amendment, that 
               <br />
               since we passed this law and gaVe this incipient

               constitution to the North—West Territories, no- 
               <br />
               thing has occurred to change our views. I cannot 
               <br />
               agree with that. Everything has occurred since 
               <br />
               that time, not to change our views, but to set us 
               <br />
               thinking about what we should do at a future time, 
               <br />
               not very far off, in regard to those Territories. 
               <br />
               What has occurred is this : a population has gone 
               <br />
               into those Territories; they have been given a. 
               <br />
               Legislature; and that Legislature has demanded 
               <br />
               certain measures—not only on the question of lan- 
               <br />
               guage, but on that of the schools, and on the 
               <br />
               system of Government. Bearing these facts in 
               <br />
               mind, it seems to me that the proper time to deal 
               <br />
               with this question will be when we are repared 
               <br />
               to give the Territories, perhaps not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absolute,</span> but 
               <br />
               a more extended form of local self—government; 
               <br />
               and when that time comes, we must be prepared 
               <br />
