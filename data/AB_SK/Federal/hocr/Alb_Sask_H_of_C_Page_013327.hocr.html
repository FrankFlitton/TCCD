               should prevail in the solution of this question, and 
               <br />
               of all other similar questions. My hon. friend, the 
               <br />
               member forNorfolk (Mr. Charlton), stated this after- 
               <br />
               noon that the best method of solving this question, 
               <br />
               with a view to Provincial rights, Would be simply to 
               <br />
               afﬁrm the principle of the Bill itself. Surely, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend was not serious in so speaking. The 
               <br />
               Bill of my hon. friend from Simcoe proposes to 
               <br />
               abrogate clause 110 of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories 
               <br />
               Act, which clause provides that either the English 
               <br />
               or the French language may be used by any person 
               <br />
               in the debates of the Council or Legislative Assem- 
               <br />
               bly of the Territories. If you simply repeal this 
               <br />
               clause, you remove from the Legislature of the 
               <br />
               Territories the power which they now have of using 
               <br />
               either the French or the English language in their 
               <br />
               debates. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“hat</span> I understand by Provincial rights 
               <br />
               ——and I suppose what my hon. friend must under- 
               <br />
               stand—is, that the people of the Territories should 
               <br />
               decide for themselves whether or not they are to 
               <br />
               have the privilege or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">07111.3</span> of having two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> 
               <br />
               languages. If you remove that law, you take away 
               <br />
               from them the privilege which they now have of 
               <br />
               using the two languages. I do not believe that is 
               <br />
               in the direction of Provincial rights, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pro»</span> 
               <br />
               vincial autonomy. The amendment of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, the Minister of Justice, tends to uphold 
               <br />
               Provincial rights and local autonomy, and I am 
               <br />
               happy to extend my congratulations to the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, and to his Government that more and 
               <br />
               more, and day by day, the force of circumstances 
               <br />
               brings them over to this principle. More and 
               <br />
               more the principle grows, and they are forced to 
               <br />
               adopt it, in spite of their former practice in older 
               <br />
               times. It is stated, however, against this amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the Minister of Justice, that it is not so 
               <br />
               complete as the amendment moved by the member 
               <br />
               for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin). It may not be so 
               <br />
               complete, but it is not the less just, for the amend— 
               <br />
               ment of my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               involves this : that in the debates of the Local As- 
               <br />
               sembly of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest,</span> and in the recording 
               <br />
               of their proceedings, they shall have the privilege 
               <br />
               of using one language or the other, or both, and 
               <br />
               they shall be empowered to decide for themselves 
               <br />
               whether they shall have only one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">official</span> language 
               <br />
               or two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Official</span> languages. There is, then, the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the courts, and it has been stated (and I 
               <br />
               think properly stated), that the use of the lan- 
               <br />
               guage in courts, would be acknowledged as beyond 
               <br />
               the power of the Dominion Parliament. There 
               <br />
               then remains the question of the printing of the 
               <br />
               statutes. So long as we provide the Territories with 
               <br />
               a revenue, can any serious objection be taken to 
               <br />
               the fact that we should provide for the printing of 
               <br />
               the laws and ordinances in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Noz‘th—‘Vest?</span> I 
               <br />
               can see very well that if the Territories had to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provide</span> that out of their own revenue, to impose any 
               <br />
               obligations upon them, which they would not want 
               <br />
               to assume, might be a grievance. But so long as we 
               <br />
               gwe them the revenue, surely no man can object ; 
               <br />
               and we who supply the money ought to have the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Power</span> to put upon it an obligation (which is not 
               <br />
               after all an unreasonable obligation), and which on 
               <br />
               the other hand is in the tendency of peace and har— 
               <br />
               mony. It has been stated that this amendment 
               <br />
               Was a compromise. I must say for my part, and 
               <br />
               the First Minister will hear me out, that there has 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               n no compromise between him and me. I 
               <br />
               always have stated publicly as well as privately, 
               <br />
               and I have never disguised my. thoughts on this 
               <br />

               matter, that, in my judgment, sooner or later, and 
               <br />
               better sooner than later, this question had to be 
               <br />
               settled upon the broad basis of local autonomy. 
               <br />
               In fact, if this question has taken a wider range 
               <br />
               than is involved in the principle of local autonomy, 
               <br />
               it is simply because the member for Simcoe has 
               <br />
               chosen to make it so. If the hon. member for Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy), instead of placing as the basis of 
               <br />
               his Bill, that there should be a community of lan- 
               <br />
               guage, and that this community of language should 
               <br />
               extend everywhere in the Dominion where French 
               <br />
               is spoken, had simply left it to the will and the 
               <br />
               desire of the people of the Territories, we would not 
               <br />
               have had one-half or one-tenth part of all the 
               <br />
               trouble we have had over this question. But it 
               <br />
               is because the people of Quebec have good reason 
               <br />
               to suppose that this was a preliminary skirmish, 
               <br />
               soon to be followed by other attacks, soon to be 
               <br />
               followed by attacks which would reach them in their 
               <br />
               own Province, that they have been so excited. A 
               <br />
               few days ago, the hon. member for Simcoe, speak- 
               <br />
               ing in this debate, disclaimed the idea of imposing 
               <br />
               hiswill upon the people of Quebec and attempting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               to deprive them of their language; but it seems 
               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman is not so brave here as he 
               <br />
               was in Manitoba ; for in Manitoba he is recorded 
               <br />
               as having stated that if the French language was 
               <br />
               abolished in that Province, it would be abolished 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec.</span> Is it to be wondered that the 
               <br />
               people of Quebec have felt as they have felt upon 
               <br />
               this question in face of such a threat as this? 
               <br />
               I want to say to my fellow-countrymen of French 
               <br />
               origin that we must expect, in the face of such a 
               <br />
               declaration, that, some day or other, this agitation 
               <br />
               commenced here will be carried into our Province. 
               <br />
               Let us remember this : that if we are prepared to 
               <br />
               stand by the principle of local autonomy in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Territories, we will stand ten times, 
               <br />
               and a hundred times, stronger when we have to 
               <br />
               meet an attack in our own Province. If we are 
               <br />
               now prepared to stand by the principle of local 
               <br />
               autonomy, I submit that, when the time comes, 
               <br />
               we will ﬁnd a tower of strength in the position 
               <br />
               which we may take upon this question. This is 
               <br />
               one of the reasons which impel me to take the 
               <br />
               action I propose on this measure, that is, to sup- 
               <br />
               port the amendment of the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. I quite realise that it must be painful for 
               <br />
               many hon. members from the Province of Quebec 
               <br />
               to vote for a measure which may, perhaps, imply 
               <br />
               the possibility that the French language should 
               <br />
               cease to be the ofﬁcial language in the North—West 
               <br />
               Territories. I have no reason to suppose, and 
               <br />
               I do not for one moment suppose, that the people 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est</span> Territories would act unjustly 
               <br />
               or unfairly towards the French minority. I know 
               <br />
               it has been said that, if we vote this meas- 
               <br />
               ure, it is a foregone conclusion that the French 
               <br />
               language will not be an official language of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est,</span> because the Legislature has already
