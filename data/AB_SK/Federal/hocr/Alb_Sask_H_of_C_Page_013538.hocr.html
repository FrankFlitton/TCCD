               The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. 
               <br />
               The principle upon which I acted is this. I 
               <br />
               met the representatives of the territorial 
               <br />
               government, and they explained to me—-as 
               <br />
               of course I knew before—that there has been 
               <br />
               in the Territories for some years, an agita- 
               <br />
               tion in favour of what they called provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy. Now, it is a subject with 
               <br />
               which it would be extremely inconvenient 
               <br />
               to deal until it takes some shape in the pub- 
               <br />
               lic mind. I fancy that any Government 
               <br />
               that undertook to form an organization 
               <br />
               there, without something more deﬁned to go 
               <br />
               by than we have at the present time, 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd very considerable dlmculty. 
               <br />
               But I said that if they wanted something of 
               <br />
               a practical character which would assist 
               <br />
               them in carrying on their business, no doubt 
               <br />
               their wishes in that respect could be met. 
               <br />
               They suggested, therefore, that a Bill such 
               <br />
               as I have presented to the House would, for 
               <br />
               the present, meet the views of the people ; 
               <br />
               and I have not thought it advisable to go 
               <br />
               further at the present time. but to allow 
               <br />
               matters to develop. At a future time the 
               <br />
               House may be called on to deal with the 
               <br />
               question of the organization of a provincial 
               <br />
               constitution.
