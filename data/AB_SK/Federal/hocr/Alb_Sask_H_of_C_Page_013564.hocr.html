               confederation by way of a necessity which 
               <br />

               deliberate exercise of the discretion of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament</span> of Canada, thinking than: it 
               <br />
               would be an ideal or desirable state of 
               <br />
               affairs to have 17,000 people constituted into 
               <br />
               a province, that the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               was formed. It was formed because the 
               <br />
               necessity arose. There were people there 
               <br />
               who demanded local powers, and the peace- 
               <br />
               ful settlement of the country could not 
               <br />
               have been effected, and that territory could 
               <br />
               not have been brought under the rule of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada, without those terms 
               <br />
               being granted at that time. Hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men will remember that there was a re- 
               <br />
               bellion, and it is possible that the trouble 
               <br />
               arose only on account of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the»</span> belief that 
               <br />
               was created by interested persons that the 
               <br />
               government here did not intend to give them 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy or to treat them fairly. 
               <br />
               They had to be treated in that way, be- 
               <br />
               cause they were insisting that the existing 
               <br />
               status should be recognized, and it was re- 
               <br />
               cognized as a matter of necessity. British 
               <br />
               Columbia came in as a sovereign colony 
               <br />
               under a bargain made with the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, and the people of Canada had no 
               <br />
               choice in that respect. But that is no 
               <br />
               reason for saying that when you get 17,000 
               <br />
               people in a territory in any part of the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada, you are to form them 
               <br />
               into a province. That is not justiﬁed by 
               <br />
               common sense or by the precedents cited in 
               <br />
               favour of it. I think what parliament will 
               <br />
               be disposed to do will be to treat this ques- 
               <br />
               tion on a fair and liberal basis; but 
               <br />
               they will desire, when they come to 
               <br />
               deal with it, to have before them 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient data to enable them to feel 
               <br />
               that they are working out a settlement 
               <br />
               which has in it the element of permanency. 
               <br />
               And 1 think parliament would be rather 
               <br />
               prepared for two or three or four years 
               <br />
               to vote sums of money, which might be rea- 
               <br />
               sonably arrived at as approximately what 
               <br />
               the territories actually require for their im- 
               <br />
               mediate necessities, and let us get more in- 
               <br />
               formation with regard to what the position 
               <br />
               will be and what the necessary require- 
               <br />
               ments of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> territories will be, so that 
               <br />
               when we do arrive at a settlement, it shall 
               <br />
               have some of the elements of ﬁnality. At 
               <br />
               this late hour, I shall not undertake .to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span>

               mittee that there is sufﬁcient material in 
               <br />
               that Bill for a year’s consideration. When 
               <br />
               I said that it was desirable that we should 
               <br />
               take a little time to consider, I do not think 
               <br />
               I was asking anything unreasonable. I did 
               <br />
               not discuss with premier Haultain the de- 
               <br />
               tails of the Bill. I desire to say, in all 
               <br />
               frankness, to the committee, that-I did not 
               <br />
               think it desirable to discuss the details. I 
               <br />
               do not think it desirable, in a matter of 
               <br />
               such vast importanece to the people of 
               <br />
               Canada generally and of the territories in 
               <br />
               particular, to unnecessarily rush the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment of Canada into a record on these 
               <br />
               questions. They are questions upon which

               a good deal of light may be thrown by fur- 
               <br />
               ther discussion. The circumstances during 
               <br />
               the last year were not propitious to a com- 
               <br />
