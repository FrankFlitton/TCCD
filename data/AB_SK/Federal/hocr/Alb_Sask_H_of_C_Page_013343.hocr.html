               for them in their present condition. It is felt that 
               <br />
               the powers which they have already received are 
               <br />
               inadequate, and I question very much whether 
               <br />
               this small measure of reform, though it may be 
               <br />
               accepted for What it is worth, will meet the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of the people of the Territories. If the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment had seen ﬁt to give them a responsible 
               <br />

               <br />
               government, than they have at the present time, 
               <br />
               many of the difficulties which may come before 
               <br />
               this House at some time or another, and many of 
               <br />
               the difﬁculties which may arise in the Territories 
               <br />
               themselves, under the present system, would in all 
               <br />
               probability be avoided. All the difﬁculties that 
               <br />
               have arisen between the Lieutenant Governor and 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature—and</span> they have had some difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties during the last Session—arose from the fact 
               <br />
               that the Governor had not a responsible body of 
               <br />
               advisers who were answerable to the House, and 
               <br />
               this fact shows the necessity for some larger <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mea-</span>

               sure of responsible government. Under the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances, I do not venture at this moment any 
               <br />
               further criticism of this Bill than to say that, in 
               <br />
               my judgment, it falls short of what should be the 
               <br />
               proper remedy for the difﬁculties which may arise, 
               <br />
               not only in this House but in the Territories

               Mr. DAVIN. I sympathise, to some extent, 
               <br />
               with the remarks that have fallen from the leader 
               <br />
               of the Opposition. Those remarks are not couched 
               <br />
               in a spirit of hostility to the Government or to 
               <br />
               this Act. In fact, this Act is travelling along the 
               <br />
               road that the hon. and learned gentleman wishes 
               <br />
               it to go, but he would have it go further. I think 
               <br />
               that so long as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> remained as it was there 
               <br />
               was a very large section of the people in the N orth-

               <br />
               gentleman that though there was some difﬁculty in 
               <br />
               the Assembly last year, I believe as a fact that the 
               <br />
               weight of opinion in the N orth-VVest was with the 
               <br />
               minority of that Assembly. By the llth sub-clause 
               <br />
               of section 10, that is to say, section 13 of the 
               <br />
               Revised Statutes, which has been put in by the 
               <br />
               Senate, all the powers that call for responsibility 
               <br />
               are given, as we ﬁnd by these words :

               <br />

               has often happened in the history of such Gov-

               <br />
               Committee of Supply ; if you allowed those 
               <br />
               moneys to be expended by the advice of this 
               <br />
               Parliament without any Government to be respon- 
               <br />
               sible therefor to the people, the result would be 
               <br />
               that vast sums that are now carefully expended, 
               <br />
               would be worse than wasted. With regard to the 
               <br />
               local fund which they raise now, amounting, I 
               <br />
               think, to some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$16,000</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$17,000,</span> that sum is log- 
               <br />
               rolled. The manner in which that sum is expended is 
               <br />
               this : It is divided by 22, and the quotient given 
               <br />
               to each member, and whether he needs it or not, he 
               <br />

               One case happened where an hon. gentleman spent

               <br />
               would be as well to go still further and to give

               them a little government. I think there are some 
               <br />
               parts of the Bill that will be found an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improve</span> 
               <br />
               ment ; but, when we come to the clause dealing 
               <br />
               with the appointment of deputy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sheriffs,</span> I will ask 
               <br />
               the Committee to accept an amendment. It seems 
               <br />
               to me that is indefensible ; it is vicious in principle. 
               <br />
               to have the Assembly provide for the appointment 
               <br />
               of deputy sheriffs ; it would be much better to 
               <br />
               have the judges provide for the necessity of the 
               <br />
               appointment of deputy sheriffs, because if you have 
               <br />
               this work devolving on the Assembly, every mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the Assembly will be troubled with requests 
               <br />
               from every little town in his district to have a 
               <br />
               deputy sheriff appointed, because every little place 
               <br />
               would think it would obtain a certain importance 
               <br />
               if it had a deputy sheriff. The subject was dis- 
               <br />
               cussed elsewhere, if I may refer to it in passing, 
               <br />
               and all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-V‘Vest</span> opinion was in the direc- 
               <br />
               tion which I now express myself. I will ask the 
               <br />
               Government to consider that point, because, as I 
               <br />
               say, you will have such a large number of deputy 
               <br />

               <br />
               are very good reforms in the Bill, and the North- 
               <br />

               Mr. BLAKE. I think it impossible to attach 
               <br />
               too much importance to the point on which the

               departure from the principles of responsible 
               <br />
               government, as we understand them, in a most 
               <br />
               important particular. I admit that it is difﬁcult 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ment. The principle, as I understand it, is that, 
               <br />
               with respect to the expenditure of public moneys, 
               <br />
               it is the Crown that initiates, not the Assembly. 
               <br />
               The Assembly is supposed to be a check, a guard, 
               <br />
               to keep the drag on; that is the function of the 
               <br />
               popular body. I quite agree that eminent states- 
               <br />
               men, not theorising, but dealing with actual 
               <br />
               results in late years in the mother country, have 
               <br />
               pointed out how far the English House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons has departed from the ancient traditions; 
               <br />
               how far it has ceased to be a bulwark and support 
               <br />
               to the Administration in matters of prudence and 
               <br />
               economy in public expenditure. But, none the less, 
               <br />
               I hold it to be the most important ingredient in se- 
               <br />
               curing economy, and also good direction, in public 
               <br />
               expenditure, that there shall be an initiative some- 
               <br />
               where else than in the popular assembly, and, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deeply</span> 
               <br />
               as I differ from the hon. member for West AssinlbOIa 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin) as to his characterisation of the ex- 
               <br />
               penditures that have taken place in this House, or 
               <br />
               rather With the sanction of this House, I say they 
               <br />
               are, beyond all comparison, better, more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prudent,</span> 
               <br />
               and wiser than they would have been if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sTuch</span> a 
               <br />
               system as we are proposing to give the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lorth—</span>

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">VVest</span> Territories had existed here. We have had 
               <br />
               a few instances, I am glad to say only a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few,</span> 0f 
               <br />
               attempted departure from that system. There have 
               <br />
               been perhaps three cases, three only occur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t9</span> my
