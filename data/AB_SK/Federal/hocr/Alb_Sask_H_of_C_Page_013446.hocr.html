               see how the question might readily arise of 
               <br />
               establishing separate schools, based on the 
               <br />
               question of language; but I cannot see any

               reason why such schools should be based 
               <br />
               on theology, as subsequently was the case. As 
               <br />
               regards language. the two races were about

               do not desire to be understood as being in

               favour of Protestant separate schools or 
               <br />
               Protestant control of schools ; but my theory 
               <br />
               is this. that there should be no theological 
               <br />
               control whatever in connection with schools. 
               <br />
               I shall endeavour to submit a few points 
               <br />
               to support my view. It is our duty to teach the 
               <br />
               youth of the land, intellectually. The question 
               <br />
               of theology cannot possibly arise in teaching 
               <br />
               reading, writing and arithmetic, or, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tact,</span> 
               <br />
               teaching any of the subjects that form our 
               <br />
               school curriculum. History is the only sub- 
               <br />
               ject on which any difference of opinion can 
               <br />
               possibly exist, and even in regard to that 
               <br />
               I am satisﬁed an arrangement could he 
               <br />
               arrived at which would be perfectly satis- 
               <br />
               factory to persons of all creeds and forms 
               <br />
               of theology. Therefore. no question can be 
               <br />
               raised by any theologian on subjects which 
               <br />
               we may call intellectual in our public 
               <br />
               schools. There can be no possible objection 
               <br />
               to teaching sanitary laws or physical laws 
               <br />
               relating to disease, and the development 
               <br />
               of the human frame in our schools. Those 
               <br />
               are recognized <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> by all theologians as 
               <br />
               being proper, and certainly theology does 
               <br />
               not enter into those subjects; therefore. 
               <br />
               Protestants and Roman Catholics can at- 
               <br />
