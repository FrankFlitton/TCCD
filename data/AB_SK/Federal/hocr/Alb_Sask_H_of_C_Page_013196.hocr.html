               to despair by years of careless indifference, at last 
               <br />

               <br />
               of everything dear to man, to get justice, and then

               <br />
               own supineness had brought about such a crime 
               <br />
               on the fair name of the country. There is 
               <br />
               more than that. If the history of that rebellion 
               <br />
               were told, it would unfold to the world a tragedy 
               <br />
               darker than Hamlet. There was a race of men 
               <br />
               on the border between savage and civilised life; 
               <br />
               advanced enough to understand the value of pro- 
               <br />
               perty, but not advanced enough to defend their 
               <br />
               property against those unfeeling speculators who 
               <br />
               everywhere precede civilisation. Among the whole 
               <br />
               race then in Canada there was not one who had 
               <br />
               received the smallest rudiment of education ; but 
               <br />
               they had heard there was one of their number 
               <br />
               who had been more favored than they in this re- 
               <br />
               spect, and he was then an exile. If he were 
               <br />
               brought back to the Territories, might he not pro- 
               <br />
               cure for them the act of simple justice which they 
               <br />
               themselves could not obtain? To him they 
               <br />
               appealed; but, misfortune greater than all their 
               <br />
               misfortune ! the man to whom they thus appealed 
               <br />
               to be the eye to see for them, the mind to guide 
               <br />
               them, the arm to protect them, had been touched 
               <br />
               by the hand of God, and was the most help- 
               <br />
               less of them all. In the face of such facts, the 
               <br />
               judgment of my fellow-countrymen can be im- 
               <br />
               pugned, but their honesty cannot be assailed. It is 
               <br />
               a vile imputation to attack their honesty of pur- 
               <br />
               pose ; and if I have thus alluded to these facts, it 
               <br />
               is not with a view of recrimination, it is not with 
               <br />
               .a view of perpetuating the bitterness of these 
               <br />
               sad days. But since we are threatenod with a 
               <br />
               war of races, since my hon. friend (Mr. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               is going to appeal to the people of Ontario to 
               <br />
               unite together, I want at least fair play in the 
               <br />
               contest. I cannot alIOW' that such a statement 
               <br />
               as this made at Stayner, should go unrebuked, 
               <br />
               and I must do my share in the attempt to re-esta- 
               <br />
               blish perverted truth. I cannot allow the fair 
               <br />
               name of my countrymen to be assailed by false 
               <br />
               statements, and that the expression should go 
               <br />
               abroad uncontradicted that the people of Quebec 
               <br />
               will follow no law but the law of their own 
               <br />
               selﬁshness. Since the hon. gentleman (Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy) has taken this attitude, since he has tried 
               <br />
               to introduce this new policy, which outlines the 
               <br />
               course he has taken recently, we might have hoped 
               <br />
               that he were impelled by motives of a higher 
               <br />
               and nobler consideration. I am not ignorant of 
               <br />
               the fact that, among the men who have adopted 
               <br />
               the same views as the hon. gentleman, there are 
               <br />
               many who have come to the conclusion which the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has given expression to, from the 
               <br />
               conviction that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existence</span> of two separate nation- 
               <br />
               alities in Canada is not compatible with the exist- 
               <br />
               ence of the Dominion. This objection thus present- 
               <br />
               ed is, one Which I will not reject. On the contrary, 
               <br />
               I say this is a question which must e oss the 
               <br />
               serious attention of all those who have at cart the 
               <br />
               future ef the country, for no one can close his eyes 
               <br />
               to the fact that the existence of two distinct 
               <br />
               nationalities must produce sometimes, as it has 
               <br />
               produced already, causes of angry friction and, 
               <br />
               therefore, of danger. But, Sir, we must deal with 
               <br />
               facts as they are, and deal with them as’ we ﬁnd

               them. Here are two different races geographi- 
               <br />
               cally united under the same political allegiance, 
               <br />
               but separated by numerous ethnical features. 
               <br />
               With those conﬂicting elements, it is the object 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman apparently—it is my own 
               <br />
               object certainly, and it is the object of us all, I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believewto</span> try to form a nation. This is the 
               <br />
               problem we have to solve ; how , shall we proceed 
               <br />
               to solve it? The hon. gentleman has given us his 
               <br />
               method, the Tory method, and he has once more 
               <br />
               demonstrated that Tory methods never proceed 
               <br />
               from the nobler, higher instincts of the human 
               <br />
               heart and the human intellect, but always from the 
               <br />
               dread, the difﬁdence, and the distrust which every- 
               <br />
               where has made the Tory party, Wherever it has 
               <br />
               had sway, suspicious and cruel. Thehon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               looking around this broad Dominion, sees a popula- 
               <br />
               tion of one and a-half million inhabitants, nearly 
               <br />
               one-third of our whole population, who are of French 
               <br />
               origin, attached to their language, their laws, their 
               <br />
               institutions, and their religion—attached to every- 
               <br />
               thing which characterises their separate individu- 
               <br />
               ality. If the hon. gentleman had stated that this 
               <br />
               was a cause of possible friction, and that we should 
               <br />
               endeavor to ﬁnd some means of alleviating that fric- 
               <br />
               tion, I would agree with him ; but the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man did not take that View. On the contrary, he 
               <br />
               coldly asserts that the existence of two separate 
               <br />
               races here is not compatible with the existence of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and, therefore, one must disappear; 
               <br />
               and I have quoted his words in which he appeals 
               <br />
               to his friends of English origin to buckle on their 
               <br />
               armor, and see to it that we have only one nation- 
               <br />
               ality on this continent. Sir, if this policy were to 
               <br />
               prevail, what would be the result? What is it 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has in View? It is simply 
               <br />
               this: that the French Canadians should feel the 
               <br />
               yoke on their shoulders, that they should be 
               <br />
               deprived by legislation, or by force if necessary, 
               <br />
               of everything which has been granted to them 
               <br />
               hitherto. If this doctrine were to prevail, on 
               <br />
               what foundation would this Confederation rest? 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman, I am sure, would himself 
               <br />
               admit that pride of race, attachment to the 
               <br />
               memory of one’s nation and ancestors, are noble 
               <br />
               sentiments ; and yet the hon. gentleman coldly 
               <br />
               proposes that one and a-half million of Canadians 
               <br />
               —in order, as he says, that they should become 
               <br />
               good Canadians—should renounce their origin and 
               <br />
               the traditions of their race. He proposes that 
               <br />
               the humiliation of one whole race in this country 
               <br />
               should be the foundation of this Dominion. Woe 
               <br />
               to the party which can adopt such degrad- 
               <br />
               i doctrines as this. Who does not see 
               <br />
               that the humiliation of one race would be a 
               <br />
               far greater danger to Confederation than any we 
               <br />
               have ever yet known ? I endorse the words spoken 
               <br />
               a. short time ago by the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Bruce (Mr. McNeill), that we want to build 11 a 
               <br />
               nation on this continent ; and we want to estab 'sh 
               <br />
               such a state of things that every citizen of this 
               <br />
               country, whatever his ori ' may be, whether he 
               <br />
               is English or French, all feel in his heart a 
               <br />
               supreme ride to call himself a. Canadian. But I 
               <br />
