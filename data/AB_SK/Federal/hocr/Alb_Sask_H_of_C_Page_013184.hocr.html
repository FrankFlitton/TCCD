               desire to enlarge upon the lessons of history, 
               <br />
               of which we have heard much in this debate; 
               <br />
               but I wish to call your attention to two very recent 
               <br />
               formal, and to my mind, solemn expressions of opi- 
               <br />
               nion, expressions of British opinion, of the opinions 
               <br />
               of the English Government upon questions closely 
               <br />
               allied to this. You remember the long and compli- 
               <br />
               cated and difﬁcult controversy with reference to 
               <br />
               Schleswig-Holstein. In 1860, the English Govern- 
               <br />
               ment proposed to Denmark to allow Schleswig, 
               <br />
               one of the duchies, independently to decide upon 
               <br />
               the language to be used where the Danish people 
               <br />
               prevailed, where the Germans prevailed, and where 
               <br />
               the races were mixed. That was the character of 
               <br />
               the dispatch, that the community itself should 
               <br />
               decide, and that regard should be had to the 
               <br />
               various languages of the populations, thus giving 
               <br />
               a plain indication at that comparatively recent 
               <br />
               date, of the view of the British Government, 
               <br />
               under the Secretariat for foreign affairs of Lord 
               <br />
               John Russell, in regard to that question. 
               <br />
               in 1862 and 1863, unhappy, broken-down, disin- 
               <br />
               tegrated and enslaved Poland, regarded by the 
               <br />
               great powers as no longer possessing the capa- 
               <br />
               cities for an independent state, but as a people 
               <br />
               under the thrall of Russia, had broken out 
               <br />
               once again into insurrection, under the pressure 
               <br />
               of some fresh severities of its Russian masters; 
               <br />
               and three of the great powers of Europe agreed 
               <br />
               together to ,remonstrate with Russia as to its 
               <br />
               course towards the Poles—I can hardly say 
               <br />
               towards Poland, but towards the Poles. Who 
               <br />
               were they? Great Britain, France and Austria. 
               <br />
               They remonstrated with Russia. Russia asked

               gested her lines of policy towards Poland should 
               <br />
               proceed. Those three powers formulated, by 
               <br />
               conjoint action, six points, and one of the six 
               <br />
               points on which they recommended to Russia 
               <br />
               action towards Poland, circumstanced as Poland 
               <br />
               was, and so late as the year 1863, was the use of 
               <br />
               the Polish language in the public ofﬁces and in the 
               <br />
               law courts. That was the advice given by Great 
               <br />
               Britain, France and Austria to Russia, interfering 
               <br />
               with its course towards its own subjects, who had 
               <br />
               been handed over to it by a proceeding which no 
               <br />
               one can read without condemning, but handed over

               ation was that the step taken should be reversed,

               much, I ask how should this Bill, brought forward

               ble by which it is prefaced, with the speech in which 
               <br />
               it was introduced, with the speeches by which out 
               <br />
               of doors it was heralded, having regard to the

               movement of which I have said it is the ﬁrst fruits—- 
               <br />
               how should this Bill be met ‘? I am prepared to meet 
               <br />
               such a Bill, so introduced, so framed, so prefaced, 
               <br />
               with an uncompromising negative. But it has 
               <br />
               seemed to be the temper of the House to meet it 
               <br />
               with some substantive declaration. I shall not 
               <br />
               object to that ; but for myself I am not fully satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed with either of the declarations which have 
               <br />
               been proposed. I am of opinion that, if we do 
               <br />
               formulate a declaration, it should contain a dis- 
               <br />
               tinct and unequivocal repudiation of the principle

               raised by the enacting clause. In these respects 
               <br />
               and also because I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mm</span> prepared for myself to 
               <br />
               afﬁrm all the language contained in the second 
               <br />
               amendment,— for example the statement that the 
               <br />
               enactment would put in doubt the stability of our 
               <br />
               institutions—I think that amendment is not 
               <br />
               Wholly applicable to the situation ; nor do I think 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst amendment is what we require either. I 
               <br />
               think there is apart from the suggestions of policy, no 
               <br />
               present grievance of any account. The money ques- 
               <br />
               tion is absolutely nothing. The amount is triﬂing, 
               <br />
               and this Parliament pays it ; and the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who proposes the Bill (Mr. McCarthy) has cheerfully 
               <br />
               voted for and supported the payment of hundreds 
               <br />
               of thousands of dollars—I might say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">millionswof</span> 
               <br />
               expenditure much less defensible than the $400 or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$500</span> a year which are expended to convey to the 
               <br />
               French people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est,</span> few as they may 
               <br />
               be, a knowledge of the ordinances of the country 
               <br />
               in which they live. Now, Sir, what is the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of our countrywith respect to the North-VVest? 
               <br />
               We have spent many scores of millions mainly 
               <br />
               in connection with the North-West.‘ Our crying 
               <br />
               need there to-day is, and will for a long time be, 
               <br />
               settlement, the inﬂux of hardy and frugal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cultiva~</span>
