               ﬁnd, on looking at the petitions, that there was 
               <br />
               any complaint against them. My own impression 
               <br />
               strongly is, that if a small executive council were 
               <br />
               granted to the Territories, which, I think, ought 
               <br />
               to be granted, the experts should disappear; and 
               <br />
               my opinion is that the people of the country them- 
               <br />

               <br />
               altogether excluded. They would thus obtain as 
               <br />
               much trained assistance as they thought necessary ; 
               <br />
               and if they chose to do Without it, nobody but 
               <br />
               themselves would be the sufferers. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W'ith</span> refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the number of members, I was not in a

               position, of course, to hear the whispers of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               here. I heard the hon. member for Saskatchewan, 
               <br />
               at an early period of the Session, declare that 
               <br />
               complaints were made with reference to the dis- 
               <br />
               tribution of districts in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—“'est,</span> and 
               <br />
               particularly with reference to those in the region he 
               <br />
               represents; and, if necessary, some remedy ought to 
               <br />
               be applied to that. If there be a subject with which 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terrhorial</span> Assembly might be supposed to be 
               <br />
               better competent to deal than any other, it is in 
               <br />
               what way the country should be divided for local 
               <br />
               representation. How is it possible for us to form 
               <br />
               an intelligent appreciation of that subject? We 
               <br />
               have to take upon trust the statement of the 
               <br />

               in a country of that description, arrangements 
               <br />
               which require an intelligent acquaintance, not 
               <br />
               merely with the census, but with the prospects of 
               <br />
               growth and with the particular regions in which 
               <br />
               those prospects are brightest. It is an evil to 
               <br />
               change frequently, and in this country we know 
               <br />
               that, in older days, when changes were made, we 
               <br />
               recognised the view that newer sections—as, for 
               <br />
               example, the County of Bruce and the County of 
               <br />
               Renfrew—should be, as regarded population, over- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represented</span> for a while, because we expected that an

               of the hon. gentleman’s remarks. We ought not 
               <br />
               always to be tinkering with this question of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W'est.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“7e</span> cannot here be competent to 
               <br />
               reassign and readjust the boundaries of the dis— 
               <br />
               tricts in the North-VVest. If the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly there are to have the power to readjust 
               <br />
               the boundaries, we should give them the power to 
               <br />
               increase the districts when, in their judgment, it IS 
               <br />
               necessary. It may be said that these 22 men have 
               <br />
               not the ability to do anything until after the next 
               <br />
               election. That, at all events, is the theory which 
               <br />
               has been already adopted by this Parliament. At 
               <br />
               all events, they might be given the power to do it 
               <br />
               after the next election. I dare say that, if you take 
               <br />
               many of the districts since the Act was passed 
               <br />
               two years ago, you will find the changes in popula- 
               <br />
               tion so great that the present representation is not 
               <br />
               a fair one. _ I press upon the Committee that a 
               <br />
               change should be made in the direction suggested 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills).

               Mr. DAVIN. I wish to repudiate in the strong— 
               <br />
               est manner the language of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). He said that I 
               <br />
               put the representatives in the Assembly on a lower 
               <br />
               plane than the members composing this Parliament. 
               <br />
               0n the contrary, I have again and again asserted 
               <br />
               in this House that we have a representation in that 
               <br />
               Assembly which would do credit to any Assembly 
               <br />
