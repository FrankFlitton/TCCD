               that spirit. We in the west would like to

               men opposite, when they were running the

               Mr. DAVIS. I fancy so. Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               asked for the payment of lands given as bo- 
               <br />

               <br />
               member for Grey (Mr. Sproule) who is lead— 
               <br />
               ing the opposition, would probably inform us 
               <br />
               whether he is prepared to pay us at a reason- 
               <br />
               able rate for the 50,000,000 acres of land 
               <br />
               he and his friends gave away in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories to subsidize railways. 
               <br />
               At a reasonable price per acre, say $3, it 
               <br />
               would amount to something like $150,000,000. 
               <br />
               Well, we will accept it, we would like to get 
               <br />
               it, because it would put us on a good footing, 
               <br />
               a little better footing than the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario. Now, he goes on further, and if the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition had read that portion 
               <br />
               at the bottom instead of reading only one 
               <br />
               portion of the- document, he would have 
               <br />
               found that Mr. Haultain wants compensation 
               <br />
               for all the lands that are given as homesteads 
               <br />
               in the North-west Territories; in other words, 
               <br />
               he wants the federal government to spend 
               <br />
               a certain amount of money to put the people 
               <br />
               into the territories, and then the North-west 
               <br />
               government would like to be compensated 
               <br />
               for those lands given to those people as 
               <br />
               homesteads. Whether that is a. reason- 
               <br />
               able demand to make, I will leave to the 
               <br />
               judgment of the leader of the opposition who 
               <br />
               seems to be quite friendly to Mr. Haultain, 
               <br />
               and who wants to have this thing carried 
               <br />
               out. Another thing which will interest my

               hon. friend from Grey, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know—«because</span> he

               asks that legislation be now passed to have

               Mr. DAVIS. It is in the Bill, it is 1901. 
               <br />
               I must say that if the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion were consulting the Premier of the 
               <br />
               North-west Territories now he would be pre- 
               <br />
               pared to ask <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for.</span> $600,000, and I would not 
               <br />
               blame him at all. I am just taking what is 
               <br />
               in that Bill, the draft of the Bill that was 
               <br />
               presented to this House,'and that is what 
               <br />
               he expects it you give him provincial au- 
               <br />
               tonomy. Now, we will take the ﬁgures of 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, 330,000. He 
               <br />
               wants the debt account based on 330,000,
