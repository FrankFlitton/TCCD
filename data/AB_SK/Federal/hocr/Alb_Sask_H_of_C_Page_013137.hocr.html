               it is impossible to consider the question in that

               <br />

               man, before an admiring and appreciative audience, 
               <br />
               dealt with the general question of the French 
               <br />
               language in Canada ; and quoting from the Empire 
               <br />
               of 15th July, I ﬁnd the following words attributed 
               <br />

               Again we were favored with an expression of the 
               <br />
               views of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) on 12th December last. He, on that occa— 
               <br />
               sion, delivered an address in Ottawa, and a printed 
               <br />
               copy of that speech has been distributed pretty 
               <br />
               generally, and I have been favored with a copy. In 
               <br />
               that address I ﬁnd the hon. gentleman referred 
               <br />
               to the report ofLord Durham in 1840, and quoted 
               <br />
               from it with appreciation. Referring to Lord 
               <br />
               Durham’s report, he quoted : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ First, and above all things, then, he held that the

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               French language must be stamped out.” 
               <br />
               Then the hon. gentleman goes on to declare what 
               <br />
               the vested rights of the French Canadians are in 
               <br />
               respect to their language, and returning again to 
               <br />
               Lord Durham’s report, he quotes from it, substan-

               in introducing this Bill, the proposition he sub- 
               <br />
               mitted was substantially this : that there 
               <br />
               must be unity in language in order to have unity 
               <br />

               realise all its possibilities there must be but one 
               <br />
               language. Let me say that the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               rested that proposition entirely on a misapprehen- 
               <br />
               sion, as was pointed out last night by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), of the mean 
               <br />
               ing of Professor Freeman’s article from which he 
               <br />
               quoted. Professor Freeman on that occasion stated 
               <br />
               most distinctly and positively that for all political 
               <br />
               purposes unity of language was not necessary. 
               <br />
               He was the only respectable authority the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman gave ; the others were anonymous, with 
               <br />
               the exception of Professor Max Muller, who can— 
               <br />
               not be considered as having dealt with this subject 
               <br />
               politically. Professor Freeman, the only au- 
               <br />
               thority on whom the hon. gentleman depends, 
               <br />
               proves nothing at all in support of his proposition. 
               <br />
               But even if Professor Freeman did take that view, 
               <br />
               I will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁer</span> to the House some facts of history as 
               <br />
               against the opinions either of Professor Freeman 
               <br />
               or of the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy). I will lay down a proposition and 
               <br />
               endeavor to prove it by facts, not opinions. I 
               <br />
               think the facts of history will justify one in 
               <br />
               making this assertion—that, as a rule, every nation 
               <br />
               of any note has at its earlier or later periods been 
               <br />
               composed of races speaking two or more languages. 
               <br />
               I think I can further assert with conﬁdence that 
               <br />
               history does not disclose the case of any great 
               <br />
               nation, which has acquired enduring greatness, and 
               <br />
               in which there is but one language spoken. I will 
               <br />
               address myself to arguments in support of that 
               <br />
               ﬁrst part of my proposition. Suppose we unfold 
               <br />
               before the mind’s eye a. map of Europe, and see 
               <br />
               What is the condition of affairs in the great nations 
               <br />
               of Europe to-day. If the object of the hon. member 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) is the development of this country, 
               <br />
               if his object is for the good of this country, if 
               <br />
               it can be made manifest that countries have been 
               <br />
               great, and can be great, and that the greatest 
               <br />
               countries on the earth to-day are those in which 
               <br />
               more than one ton e is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spoken:</span> surely there is no 
               <br />
               necessity for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁiianced</span> views of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
