               They have been appealing for provincial

               <br />
               extent should receive that recognition from 
               <br />
               this parliament for which they are asking 
               <br />

               <br />
               is merely a matter of readjustment, which

               <br />

               tion, and not by grace, as they are under 
               <br />
               this Bill. If the territories want to come in 
               <br />
               as a province, my hon. friend would be the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saythalt</span> it would be only fair that 
               <br />
               they should have the representation to 
               <br />
               which they would be entitled as a province. 
               <br />
               But we thought it better to keep them as 
               <br />
               territories and give them representation this 
               <br />
               year of ten members, because their popula- 
               <br />
               tion is increasing, and will no doubt soon 
               <br />
               reach the ﬁgures which will entitle them to 
               <br />
               that number. My hon. friend has spoken 
               <br />
               on the school question, "but I doubt whether, 
               <br />
               in view of the school taxation, it would be 
               <br />
               advisable for the territories to become a 
               <br />
               province, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">becauserthey</span> would then lose the 
               <br />
               power they now have of taxing the railway 
               <br />
               lands of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for 
               <br />
               their schools. The question is not so simple 
               <br />
               as my hon. friend would make us believe 
               <br />
               it is. How many provinces will there be— 
               <br />
               oue or two ? On that point the people of the 
               <br />
               territories are not unanimous. A member 
               <br />
               of some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">p-rominenCe</span> in the legislature has 
               <br />
               withdrawn his conﬁdence from Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               taln’s government, because it is in favour of 
               <br />
               one province, whereas he and others think 
               <br />
               there ought to be two provinces. For these 
               <br />
               reasons, we had better reﬂect coolly and 
               <br />
               seriously before we make the ﬁnal jump. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend says it is humiliating for 
               <br />
               the territories to come here year after year 
               <br />
               and ask for better terms. Well, they are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not;</span> coming for better terms, but for an al- 
               <br />
               lowance, which parliament has given them. 
               <br />
               and which must increase as their population 
               <br />
               increases. But when they are organized as 
               <br />
               a province, with all the powers of a pro- 
               <br />
               vince, they will have to take all the respon- 
               <br />
               sibilities of a province; and whether their 
               <br />
               population increases or not, their allowance 
               <br />
               must remain the same, and we shall have pro-

               bably the spectacle, which we have seen in 
               <br />
               other provinces, notably Manitoba, Which 
               <br />
               was perhaps organized as a province prema- 
               <br />
               turely—we shall see them year aft-er year 
               <br />
               coming for better terms. It would be far 
               <br />
               better not to move too hastily. What are 
               <br />
               the powers which the territories have not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> which they would have as a pro-

               blush, the legislature of-the territories has 
               <br />
               all the powers enjOyed by a province, with 
               <br />
               the exception of the power to borrow money.

               My hon. friend has therefore no reason to 
               <br />
               get warm and say that they are kept as 
               <br />
               slaves, and are not free British subjects.
