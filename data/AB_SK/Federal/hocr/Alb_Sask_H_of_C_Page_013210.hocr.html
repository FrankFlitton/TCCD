               <br />
               service many very important lessons of history, and 
               <br />
               if we wish to learn anything with reference to 
               <br />
               national life there is no source from which we 
               <br />
               can glean greater knowledge. From history 
               <br />
               we can learn the causes of the rise, the 
               <br />
               growth,’ the progress and the decay of he.- 
               <br />
               tions; from it we can learn those principles 
               <br />
               which tend to make nations great, powerful, and 
               <br />
               long-lived ; and if the lessons of history teach any- 
               <br />
               thing, they teach us one important truth, that 
               <br />
               community of language is not essential to national 
               <br />
               unity, because some of the greatest nations have 
               <br />
               been cited in which national unity, to all intents 
               <br />
               and purposes, either for political or social life, ex- 
               <br />
               ists without community of language, which the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe professes to say is 
               <br />
               necessary for the well-being of a nation. If 
               <br />
               Switzerland has now endured for over seven hun- 
               <br />
               dred years and stands as an emblem of greatness 
               <br />
               in national life, as a federation of states based up- 
               <br />
               on somewhat the same principles as our Confedera- 
               <br />
               tion, and yet has three different languages recog- 
               <br />
               nised as state languages, does she not teach us the 
               <br />
               very important lesson that it is not essential to 
               <br />
               have community of language in order to have a 
               <br />
               great state? The hon. member for Bothwell laid 
               <br />
               down some very important rules to guide us 
               <br />
               in our choice among the resolutions proposed 
               <br />
               or to be proposed for the solution of this 
               <br />
               question. He said that the rule upon which the 
               <br />
               English authorities followed, in reference to what 
               <br />
               language or languages should be the ofﬁcial lan- 
               <br />
               guage of any new state or country when it was 
               <br />
               organised, was the rule of convenience. Well, we 
               <br />
               should apply the rule of convenience to this case, 
               <br />
               and if the hon. gentleman’s logic went to prove 
               <br />
               anything, it went to prove that the solution of the 
               <br />
               present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span> is the one proposed by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), because 
               <br />
               it cannot be inconvenient to that country to have 
               <br />
               but one language, seeing that there is not one 
               <br />
               member in the North~VV est Council who speaks 
               <br />
               French. If the rule of convenience should be the 
               <br />
               rule to guide us, when we have the unanimous 
               <br />
               voice of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> Council asking that 
               <br />
               only one language be ofﬁcial, surely there can be 
               <br />
               no injustice in granting their petition ; and the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) ought to 
               <br />
               support the resolution of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) if he has the strength of 
               <br />
               his convictions. The hon. member for \Vest Dur- 
               <br />
               ham (Mr. Blake) intimated to this House the 
               <br />
               nature of the resolution that he would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> 
               <br />
               posed had he the opportunity ; but I do think that 
               <br />
               with all his great eloquence and ability, his pro~ 
               <br />
               position fell far short of meeting the requirements 
               <br />
               of the mass of the people. What was his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> 
               <br />
               position? It was this : We will postpone the day 
               <br />
               of settlement in that country until, if I may 
               <br />
               so term it, vested rights grow up in reference to 
               <br />
               the French langua e there ; until the question may 
               <br />
               be much more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diécult</span> to settle than it is now. 
               <br />
               He roposes that we should shunt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0110</span> the respon- 
               <br />
               sib' ity from our shoulders to-day and relegate it 
               <br />
               to the future, and in the meantime, allow to be 
               <br />
               kept up a very dangerous agitation, that may 
               <br />
               ultimately result in the destruction of the state. 
               <br />
               I do not think it was statesmanlike on the part of 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman to make that proposition. It 
               <br />
               is much more practical to solve the difﬁculty by 
               <br />
               Mr. SPROULE.

               <br />
               fellow-citizens. Moreover, the hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               his supporters have invariably held that the duty 
               <br />
               of the Federal Parliament was, as far as possible, 
               <br />
               to give power into the hands of the people to settle 
               <br />
               these provincial or territorial questions themselves. 
               <br />
               In harmony with that theory, he has always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'</span> 
               <br />
               argued, during the last ten or twelve years, in 
               <br />
               which I have had the honor of a seat in this House, 
               <br />
               that in matters affecting provincial rights, the Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces should be left to deal with them alone. Why 
               <br />
               not put that theory into practice on this occasion ‘3 
               <br />
               To do so Would be a much better solution of the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty than the hon. gentleman proposes. I can 
               <br />
               see practically no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the motion of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman and that proposed by an hon. 
               <br />
               French member (Mr. Beausoleil) a few evenings 
               <br />
               before. They are both in the same direction, and 
               <br />
               are attended with the difﬁculty that they post- 
               <br />
               pone the settlement of this vexed and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> 
               <br />
               question to the future, and merely tide over 
               <br />
               the present. One hon. member said that the 
               <br />
               reason we ought not to touch this question at 
               <br />
               present, and allow the French language to be spoken 
               <br />
               in that country, was because the Act has been so 
               <br />
               long in existence. For thirteen years it has been 
               <br />
               on the Statute-book, and previous to that time he 
               <br />
               said the French language was also spoken there ; 
               <br />
               and if for no other reason, the right of priority 
               <br />
               would compel us to decide that the French language 
               <br />
               should be the language spoken in that country. 
               <br />
               The hon. member for Toronto (Mr. Denison) 
               <br />
               answered that argument ably, when he said if it was 
               <br />
               the right of priority which should determine the 
               <br />
               question, the Cree language ought to be made the 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial language instead of the French, because the 
               <br />
               Cree was spoken in those Territories by the 
               <br />
               aborigines long before there was any Eng- 
               <br />
               lish spoken there. Another hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               said that a large number of the French who 
               <br />
               were there almost compelled us to do justice 
               <br />
               to them by retaining this clause in the Act ; but 
               <br />
               in Ontario <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> we have ten times the number 
               <br />
               of French Canadians that there are in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, and no one contends that in the Legislative 
               <br />
               Hall of Ontario it would be wise or needful in 
               <br />
               the interests of that Province that the two 
               <br />
               languages should be ofﬁcial. If the reasoning of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Bothwell were correct, that 
               <br />
               because French Canadians were there, and the 
               <br />
               right to use the dual language was given them a 
               <br />
               few years ago, we should continue it to them now, 
               <br />
               with much greater force should the French 
               <br />
               Canadians of Ontario ask us to make the dual 
               <br />
               language oﬂicial in that Province. A great many 
               <br />
               strictures have- been passed upon the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe for having brought this question 
               <br />
               before the House. Stripping the question of all 
               <br />
               its surroundings, I do not think that the motion 
               <br />
               he has proposed or the amendment to that clause 
               <br />
               of the law, is in itself very extraordinary ; but, 
               <br />
               unfortunately, when we came to consider 
               <br />
               the proposition, we found that in the pre-
