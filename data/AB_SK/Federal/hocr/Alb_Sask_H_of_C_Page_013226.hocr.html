               dians have some glorious pages in the history of 
               <br />
               our country. If we have suffered losses, if we have 
               <br />
               experienced checks, we can in any case march with 
               <br />
               head erect ; we can look behind with pride and be 
               <br />
               proud of our ancestors. I say, Mr. Speaker, that 
               <br />
               it is not generous ; I say that it is despicable to 
               <br />
               make illusions like that to the ancestors of a nation 
               <br />
               which has a glorious past. Occasion has been 
               <br />
               found to speak of the Salvation Army. I ask what 
               <br />
               has the Salvation Army to do with this case ‘3 I 
               <br />
               frankly admit that I have no very great admira- 
               <br />
               tion for this army, which may have a cause for its 
               <br />
               existence from its own point of view ; but is, in my 
               <br />
               opinion, only a gathering of parasites, which I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               simply ridiculous. I might say more, but as there 
               <br />
               may be found among those people some well-in- 
               <br />
               tentioned individuals, I wish to give them the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneﬁt</span> of the doubt. Nevertheless, there is one 
               <br />
               thing very certain, which is, that the Salvation 
               <br />
               Army, like many other fanatical religious organ- 
               <br />
               isations, has no justiﬁcation for its existence, and 
               <br />
               I say that the law does not permit scandalous and 
               <br />
               noisy processions in the streets. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’e</span> live in a free

               we desire that our religion should be respected ; 
               <br />
               but the liberty of creed in a country does not 
               <br />
               authorise license. This is what the ﬁrst section of 
               <br />
               the Act respecting rectories says on the subject 2——

               Well, all creeds have free access to this country ; 
               <br />
               all religions are respected ; but this must not give 
               <br />
               an opening for license which may disturb the 
               <br />
               public peace. Will they say that the noisy demon- 
               <br />
               strations, of which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> were witness on the streets 
               <br />
               of Quebec, are not of a kind to break the public 
               <br />
               peace? 1 say : yes, they are ; and, further, I ﬁnd in 
               <br />
               these processions a provocation which should be 
               <br />
               avoided by all legal methods. To show the good- 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the Hon. Mr. Taillon in reference to the troubles 
               <br />
               which have occurred lately in Hull. This is What 
               <br />
               he said :

               drew the attention of the Government to the regrettable 
               <br />
               disorders which took place recently in Hull,and asked

               in this instance only done his duty, and I trust that

               the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />

               <br />
               which he, Mr. Mercier, has taken on this occasion. 
               <br />
               Well, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speaker,</span> with regard to the French 
               <br />
               language, they tell us that in this country it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im-</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible—if</span> we wish to be a homogeneous people, a 
               <br />
               true nationality,—— that it is impossible that there 
               <br />
               should exist different langua es. The learned re- 
               <br />
               searches of several of my co leagues have shown 
               <br />
               Mr. DESSAINT.

               that the thing not only is not impossible, but that 
               <br />
               it is found to be practical and advantageous in 
               <br />
               several countries, notably in the United States, 
               <br />
               in the Island of Jersey, in Switzerland, and in 
               <br />
               several other countries. I will venture to remark 
               <br />
               to the hon. member for Simcoe that, if he expects 
               <br />
               by this means to make the English language 
               <br />
               spoken by all British subjects his breath will be 
               <br />
               a long time out of his body before this end is 
               <br />
               reached ; because Canada is not the only country 
               <br />
               where another language is spoken : there are other 
               <br />
               British possessions Where English is not spoken at 
               <br />
               all—thus, the East or English Indies, where the

               <br />

               <br />
               member for Simcoe does not entertain the hope 
               <br />
               that England can impose her language upon all the

               <br />
               the English language into these regions. Let us 
               <br />
               see now what goes on in the Island of Jersey. It 
               <br />
               has been stated here that the French language 
               <br />
               was spoken there. It has been an English 
               <br />
               possession for many ages. The population is 
               <br />
               56,078, of which 2,000 are Frenchmen. Not- 
               <br />
               withstanding, what do we see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“7e</span> see the 
               <br />
               French language there is held in high esteem ; that 
               <br />
               it is spoken by the well-to-do people, and that it is 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcial language of the country. This does not 
               <br />
               prevent the inhabitants of Jersey from proving in 
               <br />
               many instances their deep attachment for their 
               <br />
               new nationality, that of Great Britain. One can 
               <br />
               recollect that several. years ago, France being at 
               <br />
               war with England, the people of Jersey took up 
               <br />
               arms against their old'mother country, and fought 
               <br />
               for the Crown of England. This did not prevent 
               <br />
               them from preserving their customs, their privileges 
               <br />
               and their language up to the present time. This 
               <br />
               shows that one can be a patriot and a good British 
               <br />
               subject though speaking a foreign tongue. Let 
               <br />
               us look again at the Island of Ste. Lucie. It is a 
               <br />
               small island, exclusively, I think, or in great part 
               <br />
               peopled by French. Nevertheless <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'for</span> a great number 
               <br />
               of years the only language spoken in this island 
               <br />
               has been the French one ; it is the ofﬁcial language. 
               <br />
               Several years back, when the Hon. Judge Armstrong 
               <br />
               was Governor of this island, which possessed French 
               <br />
               laws, they adopted the greater portion of the Code 
               <br />
               of Lower Canada. This does not prevent their being 
               <br />
               loyal subjects of Her Majesty, and if need be they 
               <br />
               would take up arms to defend the British Crown. 
               <br />
               I will not recall the glorious deeds of arms in which 
               <br />
               the French Canadians took part. These facts have 
               <br />
               already been mentioned in the Course of this debate, 
               <br />
               and it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁcient</span> to recall them to show the loyalty 
               <br />
               of the French Canadians under all circumstances 
               <br />
               and in all places. Now, in order to prove the 
               <br />
               qualities of the French language, which has been 
               <br />
               so violently attacked, and which it is desired to 
               <br />
               see disappear, I will venture to quote a page written 
               <br />
               by Mr. Oscar Dunn, who, I think, is of British 
               <br />
               origin. This is what he says : _ 
               <br />
               “TheFrench lan uage is a diamond of inestimable value ; 
               <br />
               it is a work of gol worked on for centuries, of a beauty 
               <br />
               like to none other. All the world admires her ; she charms 
               <br />
