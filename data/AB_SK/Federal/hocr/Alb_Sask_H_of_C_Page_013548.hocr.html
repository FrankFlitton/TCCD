               000 in the coming year for the expenses

               it would be the worst policy that ever was 
               <br />
               entered upon. to stint the means whereby

               they may be rendered satisﬁed with the

               <br />
               of immigrants to the North-west many 
               <br />
               years ago, and at that time people seemed 
               <br />
               to think that the rush could not be stopped, 
               <br />
               but it was stopped and it remained stopped 
               <br />
               for nearly twenty years. There is a rush

               on again, and I counsel members of this

               House to take such measures that it shall 
               <br />
               not be stopped until that country has been 
               <br />
               satisfactorily developed. Every one knows

               that the best immigration agent is the con- 
               <br />
               tented settler. Therefore, our best policy 
               <br />
               is to provide adequate means to give in- 
               <br />
               tending settlers those advantages of civili- 
               <br />
               zation, which they will demand, and which 
               <br />
               they consider of the very highest import- 
               <br />
               ance. It is because these people look for 
               <br />
               these advantages of civilization and prize 
               <br />
               them so highly that they are valuable set- 
               <br />
               tlers. It is because they want schools and 
               <br />
               roads and good government that they are 
               <br />
               good settlers. People who would not make 
               <br />
               those demands, to whom it makes no diﬁer-

               Mr. DOUGLAS. I only wish to make a 
               <br />
               few remarks in addition to what has al- 
               <br />
               ready been said on this question. I would 
               <br />
               like to emphasize, if possible, in the mind 
               <br />
               of the committee, the statements that have 
               <br />
               been made by my hon. friend from West 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) and my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Alberta <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Oliver). This question 
               <br />
               of an increased subsidy is a very important 
               <br />
               one in the estimation of he people gener- 
               <br />
               ally. We should have ei er an increased 
               <br />
               subsidy or provincial autonomy. As far as 
               <br />
               I have given the matter attention, I think 
               <br />
               it would be much better for the country, 
               <br />
               in its existing circumstances, to receive an 
               <br />
               increased subsidy at present rather than 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy. I know that there is 
               <br />
               a tendency amongst many members of this 
               <br />
               House to say that we, the people in the 
               <br />
               west, are always clamouring for special ad- 
               <br />
               vantages. They point to the early settlers 
               <br />
               of the older provinces in the east and tell 
               <br />
               us that we are looking to be spoonfed and 
               <br />
               ought to have the courage, endurance 
               <br />
               and hardihood of the early settler in On- 
               <br />
