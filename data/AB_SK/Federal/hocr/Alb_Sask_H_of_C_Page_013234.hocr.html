               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe said that the in- 
               <br />
               surrection in 1837' was a war of races and not the 
               <br />
               result of misgovernment. I am at a loss to know 
               <br />
               in what book the hon. gentleman has read the 
               <br />
               history of Canada. First, he forgets that the in- 
               <br />
               surrection was not limited to Lower Canada, that 
               <br />
               Upper Canada had its share of it ; then, that several 
               <br />
               prominent Englishmen of the Province of Quebec 
               <br />
               took part in the Rebellion. Does he not know also 
               <br />
               that the principles upon which the constitutional 
               <br />
               battle was fought from 1791 to 1837 were those for 
               <br />
               which the English had been ﬁghting for more than 
               <br />
               a century——in fact, for the articles of the Magna 
               <br />
               Charta—for the pure, prompt and impartial ad- 
               <br />
               ministration of justice, for the control by the people 
               <br />
               of the expenditure of public money, for the redress 
               <br />
               of abuses and shocking favoritism from the personal

               and tyrannical chief of the Executive. The hon.

               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) and his 
               <br />
               friends—for, after all, we must take them together, 
               <br />
               because they have a plan of campaign, they have 
               <br />

               <br />
               throughout the country—these gentlemen submit 
               <br />
               three reasons in support of the Bill now before the 
               <br />
               House. These are : First, that the North-West has 
               <br />
               been rapidly ﬁlled by Anglo-Saxon immigration, and 
               <br />
               that the number of people speaking the French 
               <br />
               language is so small in the Territories that the 
               <br />
               expenditure involved in the use of a second lan- 
               <br />
               age in oﬁicial proceedings is a waste of money. 
               <br />
               econd, a dual language is a source of contention 
               <br />
               and division, and should never be allowed in the 
               <br />
               Mr. CHAPLEAU.

               <br />
               Third, the use of the French language was not 
               <br />
               allowed to the ﬁrst inhabitants of the country after 
               <br />
               it fell into British hands ; that it has always been

               a source of division and discord in this country, 
               <br />
               that it is inconsistent with true British loyalty; 
               <br />
               and that the sooner it disappears the better. I 
               <br />
               have endeavored to give answers to the two 
               <br />
               last reasons. But let us face squarely the argu— 
               <br />
               ment with regard to the Territories themselves. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vhat</span> is the reason given for objecting to the dual 
               <br />
               language in the North-VV est Territories? The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has said that the Act amending the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-‘Vest</span> Territories Act was passed at a 
               <br />
               time when there were no people in the Territories 
               <br />
               to assent or consent to it. But the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               should remember that there was a population there 
               <br />
               at that time; and they were people who, with 
               <br />
               their ancestors, had occupied the country for 
               <br />
               nearly a century. The North Saskatchewan, Lac 
               <br />
               a la Fourche, Prince Albert, Edmonton and 
               <br />
               Battleford were settled. The Territories had a 
               <br />
               population in 1877, although it was not a teeming 
               <br />
               population. And why was it that the French 
               <br />
               language was allowed to those people ‘3 It was be- 
               <br />
               cause at that time the great majority of the people 
               <br />
               of those Territories was French. Time has passed, 
               <br />
               and the country has been conquered peacefully by 
               <br />
               another race. Do hon. gentlemen imagine that 
               <br />
               we French Canadians of another Province ﬁnd fault 
               <br />
               with that result? No ; I speak here the sentiments 
               <br />
               of my fellow—countrymen when I say that the 
               <br />
               greater the Anglo-Saxon immigration is into those 
               <br />
               Territories the better for the Territories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and“</span> for 
               <br />
               the country at large. They have put their 
               <br />
               money and their energies into that country. 
               <br />
               They have shown themselves good settlers, and 
               <br />
               they are now a large majority in these Territories. 
               <br />
               I am not sorry of it. I speak of it without any feel- 
               <br />
               ing or without any prejudice. As I have stated on 
               <br />
               many occasions, I have invited English to be 
               <br />
               spoken in my home, and the peace of that home 
               <br />
               has not been disturbed by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> of lan- 
               <br />
               guage in our prayers to the Almighty. I do not 
               <br />
               envy my neighborbecause he succeeds in the path 
               <br />
               of life, with another language, another creed than 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               population in the Territories is in the proportion 
               <br />

               little more, of the population, is French, as to the 
               <br />
               language, in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories. Now, in 
               <br />
               the Province of Quebec about one-sixth of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation is English, but nobody has ever dreamed 
               <br />
               of denying them the use of their language. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend may say you could not take 
               <br />
               from them the use of their language, because 
               <br />
               the constitution of the Province of Quebec would 
               <br />
               prevent you ; nor could you do it, in view of the 
               <br />
               importance of the Anglo-Saxon race, their industry, 
               <br />
               their energy and the capital they have in the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec. I Will admit all that, but I 
               <br />
               say, and I speak for my countrymen when I say 
               <br />
               so, that, leaving those reasons aside, and consider- 
               <br />
               ing only the paramount right of minorities, if a 
               <br />
               measure were proposed in the Province of Quebec 
               <br />
               to abolish the use of the English ‘ age, I would 
               <br />
               be the ﬁrst to denounce it and am sure the 
               <br />
               immense <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> of my fellow-countrymen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would,</span>
