               this country, from such base motives, by such 
               <br />
               puny politicians as Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Lafontaine, 
               <br />
               Sir Allen MacNab and Mr. Morin. The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle</span> 
               <br />
               man was proud, he said, to fortify his views with 
               <br />
               the views of Lord Durham, and he was proud to 
               <br />
               refer to Lord Durham as a Liberal of the Liberals. 
               <br />
               It is true that Lord Durham was a Liberal, but I 
               <br />
               will show that, While he was a friend of liberty, 
               <br />
               and was one of the most advanced statesmen of his 
               <br />
               day, he did not know the force of free institutions, 
               <br />
               and that, however large the range of his mind, he 
               <br />
               was not such a keen-sighted statesman, nor even 
               <br />
               true .Liberal, as was our own Robert Baldwin. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the other day recalled the famous 
               <br />
               words of Lord Durham, wherein, in graphic 
               <br />
               language, he depicted the state of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               in the summer of 1838. He had expected, he 
               <br />
               said, to find here a conﬂict between a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span> 
               <br />
               ment and a people, but he had found two 
               <br />
               peoples warring in the bosom of the same state ; he 
               <br />
               had found a struggle, not of principles, but of 
               <br />
               races. The language is perfectly true. It cannot 
               <br />
               be doubted at this day, that the movement which 
               <br />
               culminated in the rebellion of 1837—38 in Lower 
               <br />
               Canada, when it assumed that acute form, had 
               <br />
               degenerated into a war of races. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               did not tell us the cause which had brought 
               <br />
               about that war of races, but Lord Durham told 
               <br />
               us, and my hon. friend might have quoted his 
               <br />
               language. The cause was the contest between 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly and an irresponsible 
               <br />
               Government. For almost ﬁfty years the Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Assembly passed laws which were deemed 
               <br />
               essential, absolutely essential, for the welfare of 
               <br />
               the country, and even for the very existence of 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly itself, as a body ; and as 
               <br />
               often as those laws were passed, so often were they 
               <br />
               trampled upon by an irresponsible Government. 
               <br />
               The Assembly was altogether French ; the Execu- 
               <br />
               tive was almost entirely English, and its members 
               <br />
               were recruited by the Colonial Ofﬁce among its 
               <br />
               creatures. As may be expected in any such 
               <br />
               case, the Whole French population took part with 
               <br />
               the Assembly, and nearly the whole of the English 
               <br />
               population took part with the Executive. Very 
               <br />
               few, probably, thought much as to Who was in the 
               <br />
               right or as to who was in the wrong ; but, if you 
               <br />
               desire to know who was in the main right in that 
               <br />
               dispute, I cannot do better than to call in the testi— 
               <br />
               mony of Lord Durham himself, as it is couched 
               <br />
               in his report. And this is what he said : 
               <br />

               said that the loyalty of the French Canadians

               I have already stated that Lord Durham did not 
               <br />
               know the full force of free representative institu- 
               <br />
               tions, and that our own Baldwin was a greater 
               <br />
               statesman in that respect than Lord Durham. 
               <br />
               Lord Durham had not imagined, he had not 
               <br />
               thought, that, if the French Canadians were 
               <br />
               given all their privileges, they would at once 
               <br />
               become loyal subjects, that they would not have 
               <br />
               to be governed by the strong hand of an English 
               <br />
               majority, that division would not take place on 
               <br />
               the line of races but on the broader lines which 
               <br />
               impel men to move onwards or to cling to the past. 
               <br />
               Mr. Baldwin understood that, and he was the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to suggest that the French Canadians should 
               <br />
               have their language restored, and should be treated 
               <br />
               as the equals of their fellow—citizens of English 
               <br />
               origin. That was true statesmanship and that 
               <br />
               view was unanimously adopted by the Legislature ; 
               <br />
               and I ask, in face of subsequent facts, who is the 
               <br />
               greater statesman, Lord Durham or Mr. Baldwin? 
               <br />
               Lord Durham stated that the then living generation 
               <br />
               of French Canadians would never yield submission 
               <br />
               to an English Government. At that very time, there 
               <br />
               was a young man who was an exile from his native 
               <br />
               country, because he had been a few months before a 
               <br />
               rebel in arms, and the British Government had set a 
               <br />
               price upon his head. There is no doubt that, if he 
               <br />
               had been captured, he would have met the fate of 
               <br />
               those who, on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scaffold,</span> paid the penalty of 
               <br />
               having loved their country not wisely but too well. 
               <br />
               Under the policy introduced in 1845, this young 
               <br />
               man became a member of Parliament and leader 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party, and he died a baronet 
               <br />
               of the realm. Sir, this took place in face of the 
               <br />
               words Lord Durham wrote in 1838, when he said 
               <br />
               that never again would that generation of French 
               <br />
               Canadians yield a loyal submission to the British 
               <br />
               Government. Now, my hon. friend from Simcoe 
               <br />
               asks us to go back upon this policy. Are we to 
               <br />
               be told at this day, or is it to be believed by any 
               <br />
               one at this day, that the policy introduced by Mr. 
               <br />
               Baldwin has not made Canada what it is ‘2 Is there a 
               <br />
               man living in this land, especially if he is of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party, who Would at this day go back upon 
               <br />
               the policy inaugurated by their leader forty years 
               <br />
               ago? Sir, there is not a man in this country to—day 
               <br />
               who must not feel proud of the wise and statesman- . 
               <br />
               like policy which wasintroduced upon that occasion.

               I am not ignorant of, nor will I minimise, the danger 
               <br />
               which arises to Canada from the fact that we have 
               <br />
               here a dualty of language and a dualty of race. But 
               <br />
               the fact exists, and ostracism of any kind, instead 
               <br />
               of removing the danger, would simply intensify it, 
               <br />
               by forcing a section of our population to hate the 
               <br />
               institutions under which they live—intensify it, 
               <br />
               because it would bring a section of our population 
               <br />
               into conﬂict With the majority, which would thus 
               <br />
               abuse the brute power of numbers. It seems to 
               <br />
               me that the hon. gentleman must feel that the 
               <br />
               policy which he is now championing is weak and 
               <br />
               inferior. Any policy which appeals to a class, to 
               <br />
               a creed, to a race, or which does not appeal to the 
               <br />
               better instincts to be found in all classes, in all 
               <br />
               creeds, and in all races, is stamped with the stamp 
               <br />
               of inferiority. The French Canadian who appeals 
               <br />
               to his fellow-countrymen to stand by themselves, 
               <br />
