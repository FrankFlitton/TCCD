               to our country more than ever they applied 
               <br />
               to the United Kingdom. We have here a

               form a nation on this continent. I appeal 
               <br />
               to my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />

               upon him and I call upon all Canadians, 
               <br />
               French or Catholic, Protestant or English, 
               <br />
               to sink a little of their preferences, of their 
               <br />
               prejudices, of their passions. of their senti-

               believe it would be injudicions on my part

               ject is a tempting one. Again, I repeat: 
               <br />
               it is not the question of separate schools that 
               <br />
               I am discussing at this moment, it is simply 
               <br />
               the question of carrying on our system of 
               <br />

               has been given power by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act of 1871 to, from time to time, 
               <br />
               establish new provinces in the Territories, 
               <br />
               and at the establishment of those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> 
               <br />
               in the Territories make provision for the 
               <br />
               constitution and administration of such pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Up to the present moment, with the 
               <br />
               exception of the province of Manitoba, which 
               <br />
               was given its constitution by the Act known as 
               <br />
               the Manitoba Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1871,</span> no provinces have 
               <br />
               been carved out of. that vast territory. But 
               <br />
               no doubt the time will come—it may come 
               <br />
               very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shortly—«when</span> the people of that coun~ 
               <br />
               try will come to this Parliament and say 
               <br />
               that the time has arrived when one or 
               <br />
               more provinces should be curred out of 
               <br />
               what is now known as the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. Those Territories are now governed, 
               <br />
               as the House knows, under the laws passed 
               <br />
               by this Parliament from time to time, by 
               <br />
               a Territorial Legislature. Now. the British 
               <br />
               North America Act of 1871 conﬁrms and 
               <br />
               makes valid the Act of 1869. which I have 
               <br />
               quoted. The next Act relating to the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Territories is ~an Act to 
               <br />
               make further provision for the government

               <br />
               34 Victoria, 1871. There is nothing in that 
               <br />
               Act as to schools. Then, we come to chapter 
               <br />
               5 of 36 Victoria, 1873, and there is nothing in 
               <br />
               that Act as to schools. The next is chapter
