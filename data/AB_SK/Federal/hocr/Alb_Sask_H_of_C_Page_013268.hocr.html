               <br />
               friends in this House, without reference to party, 
               <br />
               to forget What may be an inconvenience when they 
               <br />
               go back to their constituents on both sides, to for- 
               <br />
               get that for a moment, and to merge everything in 
               <br />
               the great desire to make Canada, French and 
               <br />
               English, one people, without any hostile feeling, 
               <br />
               without any difference of opinion, further than that 
               <br />
               which arises from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> literatures and the 
               <br />
               different strains of mind that run always in differ- 
               <br />
               ent races, and which sever the Scotchman and the 
               <br />
               Irishman from the Englishman as much as it severs 
               <br />
               the Frenchman from the Englishman. Let us for- 
               <br />
               get this cry, and we shall have our reward in 
               <br />
               seeing this unfortunate ﬁre, which has been kindled 
               <br />
               from so small a spark, extinguished for ever, and 
               <br />
               we shall go on, as we have been going on since 1867, 
               <br />
               as One people, with one object, looking to one

               future, and expecting to lay the foundation of one

               Mr. EDGAR. I think it is a fortunate thing 
               <br />
               that this debate has taken so wide a range. If 
               <br />
               there is one thing more than another which should 
               <br />
               make a man feel proud of being a member of this 
               <br />
               Assembly, it is to have listened ,to a great debate 
               <br />
               like this. The questions which are before us for 
               <br />
               discussion are those which underlie our national 
               <br />
               existence, and upon the peaceful settlement of these 
               <br />
               questions depends our hope for the future of 
               <br />
               Canada. The speakers in this debate have, for 
               <br />
               the most part, been equal to the occasion, and 
               <br />
               they have displayed the coura e to grapple with 
               <br />
               the real issues, they have s own a breadth of 
               <br />
               statesmanship to look at the lesson which history 
               <br />
               has taught us, and I do not think I am going too 
               <br />
               far in saying that they have dealt with the whole 
               <br />
               subject with an eloquence which could be found in 
               <br />
               few deliberative assemblies in the world. I think 
               <br />
               it is well that this debate has taken so Wide a 
               <br />
               range for another reason. It has gone to the 
               <br />
               country. Day after day the Opinions of the 
               <br />
               wisest statesmen of Canada, the most experienced 
               <br />
               of our public men, have been sent abroad by the 
               <br />
               press to educate the people on this subject before 
               <br />
               it shall have got into the hands of the 
               <br />
               uninformed and irresponsible platform craters 
               <br />
               who might use it to inﬂame thepassions of race

               from so very small a Bill, and so very small a mat- 
               <br />
               ter on its face, taken so wide a range as it has? 
               <br />
               There are several reasons for it. One is to be 
               <br />
               found in that unfortunate preamble. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) has told 
               <br />
               us that he was surprised to ﬁnd that the preamble 
               <br />
               was the occasion of so great an explosion of alarm 
               <br />
               and wrath in this House. I dare say he was sur- 
               <br />
               prised, because he says so, but it seems to me that 
               <br />
               he is making the same excuse as the boy made, in 
               <br />
               whose hands the ﬁre-arm exploded, when he said 
               <br />
               that he did not know it was loaded. But the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman not simply knew that that pream- 
               <br />
               ble was loaded, but he loaded it himself, and, 
               <br />
               therefore, he has no such excuse to make. The 
               <br />
               next reason that I ﬁnd for the wide range 
               <br />
               of this debate was the speech by which it was 
               <br />
               introduced in this House by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). My judg- 
               <br />
               ment might be wrong, if I only depended on 
               <br />
               it to tell me that the hon. gentleman’s intro- 
               <br />
               ductory speech was sufﬁcient to cause this widely 
               <br />
               extended debate. I do not depend upon my judg— 
               <br />
               ment alone, but upon that of an experienced par- 
               <br />
               liamentary hand, the leader of the House and the 
               <br />
               leader of the Government. It is not the custom 
               <br />
               of the leader of the Government to introduce an 
               <br />
               unpleasant subject into this House when he can 
               <br />
               avoid it, but I can show that the speech of the 
               <br />
               First Minister, made a few minutes after the in- 
               <br />
               troductory speech of the hon. gentleman, was 
               <br />
               ample ground for the range the debate has taken. 
               <br />
               On that occasion, referring to the speech of the 
               <br />

               <br />

               amble to this Bill, but the simple terms of the Bill 
               <br />
               itself, if we had had no speech from the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman in introducing it of such a character as the 
               <br />
               First Minister has described, we still had a cause 
               <br />
               for alarm. Our French friends in this House and 
               <br />
               in the country had cause for alarm when they had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">read—as</span> I fancy all the members of this House 
               <br />
               had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">read—the</span> speech which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               delivered almost under the shadow of this build— 
               <br />
               ing, in Ottawa, on the 12th December, 1889. 
               <br />
               I am not going back to any 12th July speeches of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman. On that exciting occasion, I 
               <br />
               suppose, he ought to be allowed a little latitude, 
               <br />
               but I was lad to ﬁnd that my leader on this 
               <br />
               side of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I-Iouse</span> compelled the hon. entleman 
               <br />
               to Withdraw or to explain away some 0 the lan- 
               <br />
               gua e he used in one of those 12th July speeche 
               <br />
               ma. 6 before the assembled brethren. However,. 
               <br />
               we will not go into that. Let us see what the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman promised the ple of Ottawa he 
               <br />
               would do in the way of egislation; let us see:
