               I think it was the hon. member for Alberta 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver)—that it is one thing to bring 
               <br />
               immigrants to the country and another to 
               <br />
               keep them here. I was one of the unfor- 
               <br />
               tunates who left this eastern part of Can- 
               <br />
               ada twenty-two years ago last month. I 
               <br />
               arrived in Winnipeg some time in March, 
               <br />
               got my ox and cart and started across the 
               <br />
               prairies with others. I shall never forget 
               <br />
               as long as I live some of the hardships 1 
               <br />
               saw the settlers undergo. We met violent 
               <br />
               storms at Portage la Prairie, and further 
               <br />
               west where Brandon now is, and also about 
               <br />
               the locality of Rapid City. There were no 
               <br />
               towns there then. I have seen strong men 
               <br />
               shed tears when they saw their wives and 
               <br />
               children in water three or four feet deep 
               <br />
               trying to cross the creeks and ravines where 
               <br />
               there were no bridges. A large number of 
               <br />
               people left the country as soon as they 
               <br />
               could get out of it. I believe 85 per cent 
               <br />
               of those who came from the British islands 
               <br />
               in 1882 and 1883 left that country before 
               <br />
               1885. In the ﬁrst place, they could not get 
               <br />
               to a market or to a railway centre. They 
               <br />
               saw no sign of civilization. They had no 
               <br />
               company and they got lonely. There were 
               <br />
               no post oiﬁces, they could not get a letter or 
               <br />
               send one Without going ﬁfty or sixty miles. 
               <br />
               They had no schools, and their children 
               <br />
               were growing up in ignorance around them. 
               <br />
               That same condition exists in the territories 
               <br />
               and it will have the same effect if this 
               <br />
               government do not wake up to the facts. 
               <br />
               I know a family; I could give their names—— 
               <br />
               I will give their names. Mr. Richard Lyons 
               <br />
               and his family, who settled in Manitoba, 
               <br />
               thirty-ﬁve miles from Swan River, in 1898. 
               <br />
               Mr. Lyons had eleven of a family and came 
               <br />
               from the north of Ireland. Although we 
               <br />
               have provincial government there, he re- 
               <br />
               mained there for ﬁfteen months before he 
               <br />
               had a school or post oﬂ‘ice nearer than Swan 
               <br />
               River <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thirty-ﬂave</span> miles away. He wrote 
               <br />
               me letters, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> in one of them he said: I 
               <br />
               will leave this country in three months, un- 
               <br />
               less .I can get a school or post ofﬁce. I 
               <br />
               wrote to the superintendent of immigration 
               <br />
               and ﬁnally succeeded in meeting his wishes. 
               <br />
               That is one example of the kind of thing 
               <br />
               that may happen in the territories. 
               <br />

               Now, Mr. Chairman, when you think of 
               <br />
               $357,000, with, I think $40,000 the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman said of local revenue, say $400,- 
               <br />
               000 altogether, to supply all the munici- 
               <br />
               pal and other services required in that vast 
               <br />
               territory, I think any man who has had 
               <br />
               experience in municipal matters must 
               <br />
               wonder how it has been done. Most of 
               <br />
               you who live in cities and towns in Ontario 
               <br />
               probably know the condition here in Ottawa, 
               <br />
               as I know the condition in the city of 
               <br />
               Winnipeg. The revenue of the city of 
               <br />
               Winnipeg is some $635,000, of which $135,- 
               <br />
               000 is paid yearly for schools. The revenue 
               <br />
               of the city of Winnipeg, a town of 50,000 
               <br />
               inhabitants, is nearly double the sum with 
               <br />
               which they have to govern that whole terri- 
               <br />
               tory 500 miles by 400 miles. I ask if that

               Hon. gentlemen from the east may think 
               <br />
               this is pecularily a western question. Now 
               <br />
               it is not, it is more an eastern matter. A 
               <br />
               great many gentlemen on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House live in cities and towns which 
               <br />
               are manufacturing centres. For instance, 
               <br />
               we have three members from Toronto, none 
               <br />
               of them here to-night. I would ask those 
               <br />
               gentlemen in the city of Toronto who under- 
               <br />
               stand the Massey-Harris people, what a 
               <br />
               good settler is worth to the Massey-Harris 
               <br />
               people every year. I ask them what every new 
               <br />
               family who goes into the territories is worth 
               <br />
               to the manufacturers of eastern Canada. 
               <br />
               They are worth nothing to western Can- 
               <br />
               ada in that way, we have no manufac- 
               <br />
               turers, we have no implements, no cloth, 
               <br />
               woollens nor cottons, no fruits—everything 
               <br />
               these people have to buy must come from 
               <br />
               the east. Every settler you put there in- 
               <br />
               creases the wages of your artisans, increases 
               <br />
               the population of your cities and towns in 
               <br />
               Ontario. It does not help as half as much 
               <br />
               as it helps you people here, and I think 
               <br />
               it is your duty to wake up to the fact that 
               <br />
               the more settlers you get in there the larger 
               <br />
               your towns will grow, and the higher the 
               <br />
               value of your lands will become in older Can- 
               <br />
               ada. I say this is a matter of gigantic im- 
               <br />
               portance. I believe that in the supple-

               mentary estimates to be brought down this 
               <br />
               sess10n a very large sum of money should

               be granted in aid of the people of the terri- 
               <br />
               tories. Bear in mind also that while the 
               <br />
               population that is going in there now very 
               <br />
               largely comes from the United States, 
               <br />
               Europe and Great Britain, a conSiderable 
               <br />

               <br />
               per cent, are your own brothers, and sisters, 
               <br />
               and sons from the eastern provinces. Are

               <br />
               changed, and those people should have 
               <br />
               enough money to support their schools, to 
               <br />
               build their bridges, and to make the neces-

               sary improvements to keep pace with the 
               <br />
               advancing population. I may remark to the 
               <br />
               Postmaster General, as I remarked the other
