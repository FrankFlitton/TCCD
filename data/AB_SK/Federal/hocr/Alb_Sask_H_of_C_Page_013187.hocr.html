               we have not even the right of free discussion I do 
               <br />
               now know what Canada is coming to. I have been 
               <br />
               much struck during the course of this debate with 
               <br />
               one or two of its features. One of them is that 
               <br />
               there seems to be a very strong reluctance, I do 
               <br />
               not say on the part of the hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               just addressed the House, but on the part of most of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen who have opposed this Bill, to 
               <br />
               meet this issue squarely, and to say whether or not 
               <br />
               they desired to maintain a dual language in the 
               <br />
               North-West Territories, in the teeth of the 
               <br />
               almost unanimous wish of the representatives 
               <br />
               of the people there. Another feature of this debate 
               <br />
               which has struck me is this, that hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               or some of those who have spoken at least, desire 
               <br />
               not so much to discuss this Bill as it is, or to discuss 
               <br />
               the provisions of the Bill, or whether or not the 
               <br />
               dual language should be maintained ofﬁcially in 
               <br />
               the N orth-West, but rather to discuss some other 
               <br />
               question as to whether our French Canadian 
               <br />
               friends are to have the right to speak their own 
               <br />
               language at all in the North-W'est and through- 
               <br />
               out the length and breadth of this Dominion. 
               <br />
               There is another feature of this debate which has 
               <br />
               impressed me a good deal, and that is, that there is 
               <br />
               a tendency, in some quarters, to impute narrow- 
               <br />
               mindedness and a want of liberality to those Who 
               <br />
               think that to impose the dual language by statutory 
               <br />
               enactment upon the people of those vast regions, 
               <br />
               which we call the North-VVest, would not be to the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of Canada. The speech of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Bothwell (Mr. Mills) struck me as somewhat 
               <br />
               of an illustration of the ﬁrst two of these features 
               <br />
               of this debate. The hon. gentleman, if he will allow 
               <br />
               me to say so, made us a most able and a most 
               <br />
               interesting address ; but I listened to that speech 
               <br />
               for considerably over an hour without being able 
               <br />
               to discover Whether the hon. gentleman was or 
               <br />
               was not in favor of continuing the dual language 
               <br />
               ofﬁcially in the North~VVest. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               certainly pitched into my hon. friend beside me (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) most unmercifully, as did several other 
               <br />
               gentlemen, and unless my hon. friend from Simcoe 
               <br />
               has the hide of a rhinoceros, or half a dozen of 
               <br />
               them, he must, by this time, one would 
               <br />
               think, be pretty sore. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Bothwell told us that if one language only was 
               <br />
               to be the language of Canada, that could not be 
               <br />
               the English language, but that it must be a sort of 
               <br />
               hybrid between the English and the French. I 
               <br />
               thought when he made that statement that he was 
               <br />
               not complimentary to my friend, the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public Works, who had just <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> addressing us in 
               <br />
               very forcible English indeed. I thought he had 
               <br />
               not been complimentary to my hon. friend, the 
               <br />
               leader of his own party, whose charming 
               <br />
               En lish will, I venture to say, live in the literature 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ganada.</span> The hon. gentleman naturally over- 
               <br />
               looks these facts, because they are facts. He has 
               <br />
               also overlooked the fact that although High- 
               <br />
               landers of Scotland speak the English language 
               <br />
               they speak pure English ; he overlooked the fact 
               <br />
               that although almost all the rising generation 
               <br />
               of Wales speak English, they do not speak a 
               <br />
               hybrid between Welsh and English. He also over- 
               <br />
               looked the fact that although the people in the 
               <br />
               counties of Ireland, where there has been an 
               <br />
               admixture of race, speak English, that that 
               <br />
               English is not a mixture of Erse and English, but 
               <br />
               is pure English. The hon. gentleman overlooked 
               <br />
               these facts; but I do not suppose we need be much 
               <br />

               Mr. MCNEILL. The hon. gentleman is simply 
               <br />
               stating facts which my hon. friend from Bothwell 
               <br />
               never can appreciate. I may say further that I 
               <br />
               thought the hon. gentleman paid rather a left- 
               <br />
               handed compliment to our French Canadian 
               <br />
               friends, when out of all the characters portrayed by 
               <br />
               Shakespeare he selected as the mouth-piece of the 
               <br />
               French Canadians on this occasion the rapacious, 
               <br />
               the extortionate, and the relentless Shylock. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend gave us a very interesting discourse 
               <br />
               upon the law of forces. He handled the subject 
               <br />
               admirably, and he told us that if a number of forces 
               <br />
               were acting upon a given body at a given time, 
               <br />
               that body would be impelled in the direction of 
               <br />
               the resultant of these forces. I see my hon. friend 
               <br />
               nods his head and agrees to that statement. He 
               <br />
               told us that that law applied to mental as well as 
               <br />
               to physical force, and he was happy enough to illus- 
               <br />
               trate the fact himself, because he showed us that 
               <br />
               the forces then acting on his own mind impelled 
               <br />
               him to make a perfect circle round the subject 
               <br />
               under discussion and carefully to avoid touching it 
               <br />
               at all. In reference to the third feature of this 
               <br />
               discussion, namely, the tendency to impute illiber- 
               <br />
               ality to those who think that the dual ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               language should not be maintained in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories. For my own part, I wish to state 
               <br />
               that I shall express my conscientious convictions 
               <br />
               on this question regardless of any such imputations. 
               <br />
               While in many things I do not agree with my hon. 
               <br />
               friend beside me (Mr. McCarthy) yet I agree with 
               <br />
               the proposition he lays down, when he says that a 
               <br />
               country inhabited by one homogeneous people, 
               <br />
               speaking one language, is stronger and more stable 
               <br />
               than the same country would be if it were inhabit- 
               <br />
               ed by an equal population composed of the original 
               <br />
               races which together went to make up that homo- 
               <br />
               geneous people ; each one of them speakin its 
               <br />
               own separate language, maintaining its own awe 
               <br />
               and customs and preserving its own individuality. 
               <br />
               I venture to say that there are few people who will 
               <br />
               controvert that assertion. Let us take the Austrian 
               <br />
               Empire for example. What is the notorious cause 
               <br />
               of the weakness of the Austrian Empire? It is 
               <br />
               the fact that there is no distinctive nationality in 
               <br />
               Austria; it is the fact that Austria consists of a 
               <br />
               conglomeration, or rather I should say of a bundle 
               <br />
               of distinct peoples, each of them preserving their 
               <br />
               own nationality, their own manners and customs ; 
               <br />
