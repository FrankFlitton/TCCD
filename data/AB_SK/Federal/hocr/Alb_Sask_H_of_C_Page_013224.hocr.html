               third~class men. They'endeavored by this means 
               <br />
               to prevent their having access to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">courts-wand</span> 
               <br />
               our countrymen chose the oldest men among them 
               <br />
               to adjust their differences ; it was certainly the 
               <br />
               best way to bear up as they have done. The hon. 
               <br />
               First Minister has spoken to us about a memorable 
               <br />
               epoch ; he spoke to us about the year <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1844,</span> the year 
               <br />
               in which he entered public life for the ﬁrst time. He 
               <br />
               told us that if the French Canadians were pro- 
               <br />
               tected in that year it was by a Tory Government. 
               <br />
               I think that the hon. the First Minister makes a 
               <br />
               mistake in this connection, for the Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of’</span> 
               <br />
               the day was not Wholly Tory ; and the measure to 
               <br />
               which he alluded, that is to say the restoration <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> 
               <br />
               the French language in Canada, was not proposed 
               <br />
               by a Tory, but by the Hon. Mr. Papineau, who 
               <br />
               certainly was not a Tory, but a Reformer and an 
               <br />
               advanced Liberal. This measure was a protest 
               <br />
               against the Union Act of 1840; for it is knowu that 
               <br />
               in this Union Act a section had been interpolated 
               <br />
               by which the French language was completely for- 
               <br />
               bidden in the legislative debates. In 1845 the 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Papineau, moved a resolution and based 
               <br />
               3. Bill upon this resolution, re-establishing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">usqof‘</span> 
               <br />
               the French language in the Legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chamber-</span> 
               <br />
               This resolution was unanimously adopted by the 
               <br />
               members present. Consequently the Conservative 
               <br />
               party of to-day, or the Tory party, cannot claim to 
               <br />
               have given us the beneﬁt of such a measure. But 
               <br />
               if the hon. the First Minister had gone a little- 
               <br />
               further and had come down to 1849, he would, 
               <br />
               perhaps have been able to have made us see what- 
               <br />
               were the intentions of the Tories of that day. We 
               <br />
               can remember that, in 1849, the Tory newspapers 
               <br />
               declared war to the death on everything in the. 
               <br />
               shape of a French Canadian. We can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recollect</span> 
               <br />
               that at that time it was a Liberal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government»</span> 
               <br />
               which asked the House to vote a sum of money as 
               <br />
               an indemnity to those French Canadians who had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suffered</span> losses in the rebellion of 1837. The pro— 
               <br />
               posal of the Government was warmly debated, and 
               <br />
               the hon. the First Minister of the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moment;</span>
