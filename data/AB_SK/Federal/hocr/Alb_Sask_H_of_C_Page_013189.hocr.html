               impressed by considerations of abstract principles

               as by facts as they exist and by the lessons of 
               <br />
               history, and while it would have been well for 
               <br />
               England if the Celts of the west had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amalgamated</span> 
               <br />
               with the rest of the population as the Celts in

               Cornwall and Devonshire did, and while it would

               have been well for Scotland if the Celts in the 
               <br />
               North had amalgamated with the Saxons in the 
               <br />
               plains as the Celts in England have done, still 
               <br />
               we must remember that notwithstanding the fact 
               <br />
               that they did not amalgamate and have not 
               <br />
               amalgamated up to this day, England has grown 
               <br />
               to be great and prosperous as no country of a 
               <br />
               like area has ever grown before ; and Queen

               Victoria <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> has not throughout her broad

               Empire more devoted and loyal subjects than are 
               <br />
               to be found in Wales. And while it is true that 
               <br />
               it would have added to the strength of Scotland 
               <br />
               if the Celts of the Highlands had joined hand in 
               <br />
               hand with their brethern on the plains, yet, 
               <br />
               notwithstanding the fact that they did not do so, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> 
               <br />
               Scotland for many a long century preserved her 
               <br />
               independence and held her own; and when at 
               <br />
               length the kingdoms were merged into one, that 
               <br />
               result came about, not as a consideration of 
               <br />
               abstract principles alone would have led us to 
               <br />
               believe it would have come about, by the conquest 
               <br />
               of the weaker country by the stronger, but it came 
               <br />
               about by the fact that the far weaker country 
               <br />
               gave a king to her great and powerful southern 
               <br />
               neighbor from her own royal House of Stuart ; 
               <br />
               and to-day when any British general wishes to get 
               <br />
               a body of picked men for any service of special difﬁ— 
               <br />
               culty and danger, these very plaided warriors of 
               <br />
               the North, who were so often led by men like 
               <br />
               the typical Rhoderick Dhu against the Saxon, are 
               <br />
               amongst the most highly prized of all those most 
               <br />
               famous regiments whose splendid deeds of valor, 
               <br />
               and prowess, have shed a lustre on the British arms. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I say, that although we have two races 
               <br />
               living side by side here in Canada, I for one am 
               <br />
               not doubtful of the result. Let no man fear for the 
               <br />
               future of Canada. Mighty and glorious that future 
               <br />
               must be, notwithstanding that there may be per- 
               <br />
               haps a poor pitiful handful of traitors within, and 
               <br />
               that there are certainly swarms of jealous rivals 
               <br />
               without. For my part I wish we had no race dis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               geneous people, I wish the terms French Canadian 
               <br />
               and British Canadian were only to be found in the 
               <br />
               pages of history, and that from the North to the 
               <br />
               South and from ocean to ocean, the simple Word 
               <br />
               Canadian were the one and only term that could 
               <br />
               appropriately be applied to the citizen of this 
               <br />
               broad Dominion. But, Sir, such a result as that, 
               <br />
               if it is to be brought about at all, can only come 
               <br />
               about by the ﬂux of time and by the cultiva- 
               <br />
               tion of feelings of mutual respect, mutual forbear- 
               <br />
               ance, and mutual good-will. I wish to say this, 
               <br />
               however, that the forbearance must not be all 
               <br />
               on one side. We must remember that part of the 
               <br />
               trouble is this, that in the Province of Ontario, 
               <br />
               and, I believe, in other parts of Canada to—day, the 
               <br />
               impression is that the forbearance has been pretty

               Sir, we have our race distinctions, and it is our 
               <br />
               duty to make the best of them. Unfortunately the 
               <br />
               extraordinary movement which was inaugurated 
               <br />
               some time ago in the Province of Quebec, and which 
               <br />
               was promoted so largely by the hon. member, for 
               <br />
               West Ontario (Mr. Edgar), and which culminated in 
               <br />
               the formation of a party whose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">raison</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d’étre</span> is only 
               <br />
               that it is the French as against the English party, 
               <br />
               has rendered the making the best of our race 
               <br />
               distinctions very much more difﬁcult than it 
               <br />
               otherwise would have been. That is a propo- 
               <br />
               sition which perhaps may be taken exception 
               <br />
               to. But when the people of the Province of 
               <br />
               Ontario see the Premier of the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec ostentatiously put himself at the head of 
               <br />
               this anti-British party in the Province of Quebec, 
               <br />
               they, I think, naturally come to the conclusion-- 
               <br />
               whether it is right or not is another question-— 
               <br />
               that this anti-British party represents the senti— 
               <br />
               ments of the people of the Province of Quebec and 
               <br />
               that the sentiment of the people of the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec is hostile to British interests. I do not 
               <br />
               myself believe that that is a fair view of the 
               <br />
               situation, because we know—those of us who are 
               <br />

               <br />
               say we know that the Parti National does not re- 
               <br />
               present united Quebec at all events. We know 
               <br />
               that our French Canadian friends sitting on this 
               <br />
               side of this House are opposed to the Parti N a- 
               <br />

               <br />
               denounces the Parti National. If, then, we have

               sent the great Liberal Party of the Province, also 
               <br />
               opposed to it, I think the sentiment of the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec cannot fairly be taken to be hostile to 
               <br />
               British interests, but the existence of that Parti Na- 
               <br />
               tional produces that impression in Ontario. I was

               very much pleased to hear the hon. member for Belle- 
               <br />

               <br />
               nent position in that party—if I may be allowed to 
               <br />
               allude in passing to a previous debate—aver from 
               <br />

               <br />
               in the most distinct and emphatic terms, that he

               anti-British feeling whatever ; that he and his com- 
               <br />
               patriots recognised to the fullest extent the beneﬁ-

               of BritishruleinCanada. And Iwas glad to hear him 
               <br />
               aver that, without any reservation, they admitted 
               <br />
               that they were treated with fair play, with justice 
               <br />
               and with generosity. I was delighted when I 
               <br />
               heard the hon. member make that speech, and I 
               <br />
               was so moved by it that I was almost inclined to 
               <br />
               cross the ﬂoor of the House and renew to him my 
               <br />
               supplication that he would allow his name to be 
               <br />
               enrolled as a. member of the Imperial Federation
