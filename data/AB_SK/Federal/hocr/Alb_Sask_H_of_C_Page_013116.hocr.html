               <br />

               <br />
               all, we did not in the beginning make any resistance. Since 
               <br />
               the time that the Indians concluded the treaty with the 
               <br />
               Government the entire control of the Indian Department 
               <br />
               Was, in my diocese at least, generally and exclusively 
               <br />
               underthat of Protestants using the English language. 
               <br />
               For reasons which they will not admit at any time these 
               <br />
               gentlemen compel our Christian Indians to withdraw 
               <br />
               from our establishments, in consequence of which we were 
               <br />
               compelled to close them. This conduct wasas e ually 
               <br />
               opposed to the treaty conditions as to the physica and 
               <br />
               moral interests of t e Indians. When, after that we 
               <br />
               desired to establish ourselves among the Indians at their 
               <br />
               own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">request,</span> you could not conceive the difﬁculties which 
               <br />
               they stirred up against us. Without regard to the relig- 
               <br />
               ious faith and the wish of the Indians, Protestant schools 
               <br />
               were the only ones granted to them; and the cor Indians 
               <br />
               were pressed, even threatened, to com )el t em to send 
               <br />
               their children to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span> where their aith was not re- 
               <br />
               spected. Apart from an industrial school, there is not in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myldiocese</span> a single Catholic school which we were not

               <br />
               sition, and to support in a measure in the beginning. In 
               <br />
               November, 1887, I was assured most positively from Otta-

               But it seems that gratitude, even the remembrance of an
