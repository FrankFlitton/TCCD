               <br />

               doubt, have read. Little Alice was seated at the 
               <br />
               head of the table, and there were present a hatter, 
               <br />
               a March hare, and a dormouse. An argument 
               <br />
               announced by little Alice did not seem quite to suit 
               <br />
               the hatter, and so the hatter said: “You might 
               <br />
               just as well say, little Alice, that because ‘I see 
               <br />
               what I eat,’ that it is the same thing as ‘I eat 
               <br />
               what I see ;’ ” and the March hare also rejoined .- 
               <br />
               “ You might just as well say that because ‘ I like 
               <br />
               what I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get,”</span> it is the same thing as that ‘ I get What 
               <br />
               I like ;’ ” and the dormouse said 2 “ Because, little 
               <br />
               Alice, I breathe when I sleep, you might say it is 
               <br />
               the same thing as that I sleep when I breathe ;” and 
               <br />
               the batter, summing up the propositions, said 
               <br />
               that little Alice must expect such inconsistent 
               <br />
               propositions as these, if she was to stand by the 
               <br />
               argument she advanced a few moments ago. I think 
               <br />
               if the hatter in the story were in this House he 
               <br />
               would have addressed the hon. member for Both- 
               <br />
               well (Mr. Mills) regarding his argument in much 
               <br />
               the same way as he admonished little Alice on 
               <br />
               the particular occasion I have spoken of. It is 
               <br />
               impossible for me, not being a historian, to 
               <br />
               follow the hon. member for Bothwell (Mr. Mills) 
               <br />
               in his historical crusades throughout the universe. 
               <br />
               He travelled up and down longitudes and back and 
               <br />
               forward over latitudes to ﬁnd authorities to show 
               <br />
               that it is in the interests of the unity of the Empire 
               <br />
               and of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> that dual language should be 
               <br />
               retained. The hon. member introduced us to the 
               <br />
               Jews, to the Gentiles, and to the Greeks; he 
               <br />
               then took us among the Parthians, the Medes, 
               <br />
               the Alamites; then he brought us to dwell in 
               <br />
               Mesopotamia and Judea, and back again to the 
               <br />
               reign of Ahasuerus; then he asked us to travel 
               <br />
               with him mentally among the Italians of Malta, 
               <br />
               and then jumped across the Atlantic to take us 
               <br />
               among the French of Quebec. Then he introduced 
               <br />
               us among the Dutch of the Cape, took us to Cal- 
               <br />
               cutta among the Hindoos, and then among the 
               <br />
               Chinese of Hong Kong. He talked of the Helots of 
               <br />
               Sparta, and travelled in and out among the Ionian 
               <br />
               Islands. He took us back to the Roman Empire, and 
               <br />
               then with one stupendous bound brought us among 
               <br />
               the Algonquin tribes of the North-West. All this 
               <br />
               for the purpose of showing us that dual language 
               <br />
               is not harmful, but that it is, in fact, rather 
               <br />
               desirable to have a variety of languages, and 
               <br />
               thereby the unity of the Empire is perpetuated and 
               <br />
               secured. But, Sir, the hon. member for Bothwell 
               <br />
               (Mr. Mills), from the Alpha to the Omega of his 
               <br />
               speech, never said one word about that great exam-
