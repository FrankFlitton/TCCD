               The hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) 
               <br />
               has argued against the propriety of allowing the

               <br />
               bec Act of 1774, or in the Act giving constitutional 
               <br />
               government to Canada in 1791. I say that is no 
               <br />
               argument. If it was not then enacted, the reason is 
               <br />
               this : there was a tacit understanding that the right 
               <br />
               of the people to their language should be respected. 
               <br />
               But my hon. friend has gone further, and has said: 
               <br />
               Oh, in a new country, where people are beginning 
               <br />
               to colonise and settle, it is wrong in principle and it 
               <br />
               is a wrong policy to ermit differences of language. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'But</span> there is no di erence between the two cases. 
               <br />
               In the one case, you ﬁnd the people in a conquered 
               <br />
               country attached to their own language, and you all 
               <br />
               allow them to speak it ; in the other case, you are 
               <br />
               asking people to come from all parts of the world 
               <br />
               to settle in your country ; is it not a wise policy 
               <br />
               to assure them that when they arrive here, they 
               <br />
               Will ﬁnd the laws of the country promulgated 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,at</span> least in a language they -can understand. 
               <br />
               This has been the wise policy followed in England. 
               <br />
               It is true, however, the Equal Righters in this 
               <br />
               country have had ancestors in England. The 
               <br />
               Solicitor General in England, in the debate on the 
               <br />
               Act of 1774, speaks of a Canadian Grand Jury 
               <br />
               who some years before had returned an indictment 
               <br />
               against all the Roman Catholics of the country. But 
               <br />
               Sir, I repeat, it here : the British statesmen have 
               <br />
               framed a generous and liberal policy for the early 
               <br />
               government of this country, a policy which has 
               <br />
               saved this colony for En land instead of sending 
               <br />
               it over to the “ Stars an Stripes,” or of creating a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sort</span> of Ireland here in America. In presence of 
               <br />
               the noble conduct of these statesmen I say that 
               <br />
               the policy to foster reli ions strife or race animo- 
               <br />
               sities, whether coming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gem</span> a Quebec “ Nation—
