               <br />
               as we all know, he was a Liberal of the Lib— 
               <br />
               erals, and he was sent here by Lord Melbourne’s

               Government for the purpose of investigating 
               <br />
               the difﬁculties and ascertaining what caused the 
               <br />

               nothing to do at the moment with his report with 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Lower Province, he found the rebellion to be 
               <br />
               caused mainly, if not altogether, by race difﬁcul-

               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnd, when you investigate the subject, that the

               guish an Englishman who came over at the time of

               the Conquest from an Englishman of three or four 
               <br />
               centuries earlier ? Or, to come back to more recent 
               <br />
               times, is the Frenchman who came over to England 
               <br />
               during the time of the troubles, and owing to the 
               <br />
               troubles in France, and after a generation or two 
               <br />
               changed his name to an English name ; is he to be 
               <br />
               distinguished from those who have descended from 
               <br />
               a long line of English ancestry ? It is plain, that 
               <br />
               What makes the nation is language ; and, there—

               <br />
               tercourse of the two races. Those who have reﬂected on the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">powerful.</span> inﬂuence of language on thought, will erceive 
               <br />
               in how different a manner peeple who speak in iﬁ'ereut 
               <br />
               lan uages are apt to think; and those who are familiar 
               <br />
               wit the literature ofFrance,know that the same opinion 
               <br />
               will be expressed by an English and French writer of the 
               <br />
               present day, not merely in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁ'erent</span> words,_ but in style so 
               <br />
               diﬁ'erent as to make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utterly</span> different habits of thought. 
               <br />
               This diﬁ'ereuce is very striking in Lower Canada ; it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">crusts,</span> 
               <br />
               not merely in the books of most inﬂuence and repute, 
               <br />
               which are, of course, those of the great writers of France 
               <br />
               and England, and by which the minds <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of:</span> the respective

               which new issue from the Colonial ress. The articles in

               <br />
               different as thoseof France and England at present, and 
               <br />
               the arguments which convince the one are calculated to 
               <br />
               appear utterly unintelligible to the other. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(inference</span>

               Now, I venture to think, I have, at all events to

               some extent, made good the proposition which I am 
               <br />
               dealing with, that is, that language is of great im- 
               <br />
               portance, that it is of vital consequence toanation 
               <br />
               that the language spoken by its people should be 
               <br />
               common to them all, that they shou d not, at all

               hon. friend, at one time Minister of the Interior, has 
               <br />
               changed his views. He regretted the introduction 
               <br />
               of the French language in the North-West Terri~ 
               <br />
               tories at the time he consented to that amendment, 
               <br />
               and I give him credit for good faith in that regret.

               Certame circumstances since have not altered in
