               four thousand feet above the level of the sea. 
               <br />
               There are some 4,521 square miles unproductive,

               <br />
               with snow ﬁelds and glaciers. I do not think you 
               <br />
               can compare a country like that with what I might 
               <br />
               call the immense ocean land territory we have in 
               <br />
               the North-VVest. I have trudged through the whole 
               <br />
               of Switzerland, again and again, With my knapsack 
               <br />

               <br />
               take the whole of it and (luck it in Lake Superior, 
               <br />
               sink it to the bottom there, and were it not for its 
               <br />
               high mountains like Mount Rosa and others you 
               <br />
               would never know that it was at the bottom of the 
               <br />
               lake. I consider Switzerland in almost every respect 
               <br />
               dissimilar to Canada. In its whole history Swit- 
               <br />
               zerland is entirely diﬁ'erent from Canada. In 
               <br />
               Switzerland we are not dealing with a virgin 
               <br />

               beast and the home of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">buffalo.</span> We are not 
               <br />
               dealing with a country without a history ; a 
               <br />
               country spread out before us waiting for emigrants 
               <br />
               topossess it. In Switzerland we have a country 
               <br />
               which, in one form or another, has had some form 
               <br />
               of Government for six hundred years. Switzerland 
               <br />
               saw the beginning of its Confederation in the year 
               <br />
               1291, when Uri, Schwyr and Unterwalden united 
               <br />
               to check the encroachments of the House of Haps— 
               <br />
               burg. In 1332, Luzern joined ; in 1351, Zurich 
               <br />
               joined; in 1353, Glarus and Zug and Berne city 
               <br />
               joined; in 1481, Freiburg city and Solothurn joined; 
               <br />
               in 1501, Basie and Schaﬂhausen joined; in 1513, 
               <br />
               Appenzell joined : and these 13 cantons remained 
               <br />
               the Confederation of Switzerland. In 1798, two 
               <br />
               centuries and a-half or more after this, the Helvetic 
               <br />
               Republic, under the protection of the French Direc- 
               <br />
               tory, was established. When you look at this coun- 
               <br />
               try which has been held out as a model to ours, what 
               <br />
               do you ﬁnd ? You ﬁnd that its growth was from 
               <br />
               prehistoric times, unaccompanied by serious dis- 
               <br />
               turbing inﬂuences. Our growth in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North—W’est,</span> 
               <br />
               and throughout the whole of this country, is very 
               <br />
               diﬁ'erent. It has been made up of individual 
               <br />
               elements brought from all countries, amalgamated 
               <br />
               together from their own desire to satisfy their 
               <br />
               economic wants, whereas in Switzerland they were 
               <br />
               brought together by the external hostile inﬂuences 
               <br />
               around them. There were Austria, Italy, France 
               <br />
               and Germany crowding them altogether ; we ﬁnd, 
               <br />
               as soon as they were freed from this external 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pressure</span> upon them, there was internecine warfare.

               <br />
               which had no settled form of government until 
               <br />
               1848, when the new constitution as adopted by a 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the year 1832, we ﬁnd that seven of the twenty- 
               <br />
               two cantons formed themselves together in a Liberal 
               <br />
               Sonderbund. We ﬁnd in 1846 the Catholic cantons 
               <br />
               united in a separate Diet, and a separate Legislature 
               <br />

               <br />
               union among them that you ﬁnd in 1832 a civil and 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               in Switzerland, the ofﬁcial language is that spoken 
               <br />
               by the majority. The rule they have laid down for 
               <br />
               themselves is that the majority should decide what 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcial language should be in each canton. It is 
               <br />
               not a question of whether ﬁve or ten per cent. of 
               <br />
               the population should speak one language, and be 
               <br />
               correspondingly represented, but in every case it is 
               <br />
               decided that the ofﬁcial language shall be the 
               <br />
               language of the majority in the cantons. Now, 
               <br />
               in considering those cantons, we must never con— 
               <br />
               found them with our Provinces, although consti— 
               <br />
               tutionally they possess greater rights than the 
               <br />
               Provinces themselves. In fact, they accepted the 
               <br />
               doctrine of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extreme</span> state rights as it existed before 
               <br />
               the great civil war in the United States. I have 
               <br />
               pointed to Switzerland as adopting the ofﬁcial 
               <br />
               language of the majority, and I should like to see 
               <br />
               the same thing carried out in our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Ter-

               ritories. Louisiana has also been brought forward. 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd an Act of Congress on the 20th February, 
               <br />
               1811, with reference to the incorporation of Louis- 
               <br />
               iana, to the effect that they shall be allowed to come 
               <br />
               into the Union on condition that all its laws, all its 
               <br />
               records, and all its legislative proceedings were to 
               <br />
               be preserved in the English language. Austria- 
               <br />
               I-Iungary has also been referred to. In that 
               <br />
               country we have a population of 41,000,000. Of 
               <br />
               this we have 8,000,000 Germans, 6,000,000 Magyar, 
               <br />
               7,000,000 Czechs, 3,000,000 Roumanians, 3,000,000 
               <br />
               Poles, 3,000,000 Serbs and Croatians, and 1,500,000 
               <br />
               Turks, and other peoples speaking various tongues. 
               <br />
               There are 21 legislative assemblies and executive 
               <br />
               councils, and all of these transact their affairs in 
               <br />
               the distinct languages of the majority. If we look 
               <br />
               to Switzerland or to Austria-Hungary we shall ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the ruling there is the rule of the majority. 
               <br />
               Such a rule I would like to see introduced into this 
               <br />
               Dominion without any reference to religion or to the 
               <br />
               status of the language, and I am sure there would, 
               <br />
               in such a case, be very few found in this House who 
               <br />
               would contest the accuracy of such a proposition. 
               <br />
               The debate has proceeded as if the proposal were 
               <br />
               made to obliterate altogether the French language. 
               <br />
               We have been told that we shall have all to learn 
               <br />
               English ; that the French language will be un- 
               <br />
               known in our country ; that We shall have all our 
               <br />
               papers printed in English, and all our proceedings 
               <br />
               and private business conducted in English. I con~

               sider such argument a travesty on the question 
               <br />
