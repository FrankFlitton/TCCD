               Mr. \VALLACE. It is not my intention, at this 
               <br />
               late stage of the debate, to make any lengthy re- 
               <br />
               marks, butI cannot allow this question to pass 
               <br />
               and give a silent vote upon it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Ve</span> have been, on 
               <br />
               more than one occasion, brought face to face 
               <br />
               with racial and religious diﬂiculties. For these 
               <br />
               difficulties, I think no man in this country is more 
               <br />
               responsible than the ex-leader of the Opposition, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest</span> Durham. That hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, nearly twenty years ago, made capital 
               <br />
               out of the Scott murder case in the endeavor to 
               <br />
               gain power in Ontario, and when he had accom- 
               <br />
               plished his purpose, he quickly dropped the sub- 
               <br />
               ject so as not to embarrass his friends in the 
               <br />
               Dominion elections that were then about to follow. 
               <br />
               At a later date, on the question of the hanging of 
               <br />
               Louis Riel, the hon. member for West Durham, in 
               <br />
               his London speech, told the people that he would 
               <br />
               not make a platform for his party out 
               <br />
               of the Regina scaffold. Well, every true- 
               <br />
               minded patriot in this country commended that 
               <br />
               sentiment. But what did we ﬁnd afterwards? 
               <br />
               when the Government thought that a murderer is 
               <br />
               a murderer, no matter what his nationality may 
               <br />
               be, We find the hon. gentleman taking the other 
               <br />
               side of the question and going back on the record 
               <br />
               he had made for himself in London, going back 
               <br />
               upon the declarations he solemnly made in London, 
               <br />
               though he knew the whole facts of the case then 
               <br />
               as much as he did afterwards, and as much as he 
               <br />
               knows them to-day. We ﬁnd this hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               in this House, within the last few days, regretting 
               <br />
               that these difﬁculties were coming up again ; but I 
               <br />
               believe that no one in this country is more respon— 
               <br />
               sible for these difﬁculties than the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               himself. \Vith reference to the question which is 
               <br />
               immediately before the House, we have been told 
               <br />
               that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthJ’Vest</span> Council had no mandate 
               <br />
               from the people to dispose of this question, and 
               <br />
               we Were told by the hon. member for West Dur— 
               <br />
               ham (Mr. Blake) that they were in a state of 
               <br />
               tutelage. I think there is no portion of the people 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this country more intelligent than our North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“est</span> settlers. They are the ﬂower of the older 
               <br />
               Provinces of Canada ; they are young, enterprising 
               <br />
               and intelligent men ; they are young men of edu— 
               <br />
               cation, and I think they are as well calculated to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Express</span> an opinion upon questions as they arise as 
               <br />
               the population of any other portion of this Domin- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">}0D.</span> Therefore, while I am in favor of the Bill as 
               <br />
               introduced by the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">McCarthy)</span> ; and while I regret that the tone 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">9f.th1's</span> debate, on the other side, was not in 
               <br />
               mutation of the moderation of the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“L110</span> introduced the Bill, I think the people of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ROrth-W'est</span> themselves are better qualiﬁed to 
               <br />
               pronounce upon this question than even we are in 
               <br />
               the House of Commons. Another reason is. that 
               <br />
               the House of Commons to-day may repeal the 
               <br />
               110th clause of the North-West Territories Act, 
               <br />
               and next Sessiion, or in the next Parliament, it 
               <br />
               may re~enact that clause; and, therefore, we 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be bro ht face to face, either at every

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               ment, with this question. If we relegate it to the 
               <br />
               North-VVest Council, or to the new Legislatures we 
               <br />
               are creating in that country, to which each time 
               <br />
               we are giving largely increased powers, we know 
               <br />
               this, that when once you give power to a Local 
               <br />
               Legislature, you can never take it away again. 
               <br />
               The Local Legislatures are tenacious of any rights 
               <br />
               and privileges which are given to them; and, 
               <br />
               therefore, when you clothe them with a certain 
               <br />
               power, that power remains with them. There- 
               <br />
               fore, if either of these amendments is adopted by 
               <br />
               the House, you are more permanently settling the 
               <br />
               question than even by the adoption of the Bill 
               <br />
               itself. For these reasons, I will favor the amend- 
               <br />
               ment moved by the hon. the Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               though it does not go as far as I would like to go, 
               <br />
               or as far as the amendment of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), which I more 
               <br />
               favor. But we cannot have everything our own 
               <br />
               way. While a. spirit of compromise and concili- 
               <br />
               ation is abroad, I think, as patriots, and as loyal 
               <br />
               citizens of Canada, we should try to meet each 
               <br />
               other half way. In the ﬁrst place, therefore, I 
               <br />
               give my adhesion to the amendment of the hon. 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice.

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'ATSON.</span> This debate has taken a very 
               <br />
               wide range, and, to my mind, the practical question 
               <br />
               before the House has not been discussed as it 
               <br />
               should have been. If it had been so discussed, 
               <br />
               this debate would have ended three or four days 
               <br />
               ago. I am rather surprised that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man who has just taken his seat (Mr. Wallace) 
               <br />
               appears to desire to revive the old debate on the 
               <br />
               Riel question. That is a matter which is entirely 
               <br />
               foreign to this debate. I think the French peo )le 
               <br />
               are somewhat to blame for this discussion. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be-</span> 
               <br />
               lieve that clause “0 was, in a sense, smuggled into 
               <br />
               this Act by Senator Girard in the Senate, and that 
               <br />
               it should never have been there. From reading 
               <br />
               the debates, I think that clause was inserted con- 
               <br />
               trary to the Wishes of the hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               were then in power, but, as that House was com- 
               <br />
               posed of a majority who were against the policy 
               <br />
               and principles of the majority in the popular 
               <br />
               House, they did as they pleased, and, if that 
               <br />
               clause had not been accepted, that Bill would 
               <br />
               have been delayed for another season. In regard 
               <br />
               to the visit of the hon. member for North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Simcoe</span> 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy) to the North-\Vest, he did not 
               <br />
               trouble me very much on his visit to Portage la. 
               <br />
               Prairie. Even up to the present, I have some 
               <br />
               doubts as to the honesty of that gentleman, and 
               <br />
               as to his sincerity, in wanting to do good 
               <br />
               to people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-Vv’est.</span> It appears to me 
               <br />
               that he came there more for the sake of agitation 
               <br />
               than for any practical good. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Provencher (Mr. LaRiviere) made a reference to his 
               <br />
               visit and his speech on that occasion. I think his 
               <br />
               quotations from that speech are perfectly accurate, 
               <br />
               but he also referred to the Attorney General of the 
               <br />
               Province of Manitoba, who stood on the platform 
               <br />
               on that occasion, and he said he did not envy him 
               <br />
               his company. It was hardly necessary for the 
               <br />
               hon. member to make that statement, as this 
               <br />
               House knows that the hon. member for Provencher 
               <br />
               (Mr. LaRiviere) has not much use for the Attorney 
               <br />
               General of Manitoba, and that about the time he 
               <br />
               came around the legislative halls of that Province, 
               <br />
               the member for Provencher was very scarce. I 
               <br />
               believe that no change should be made in the 
               <br />
