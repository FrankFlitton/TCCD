               readjustment must be made. That is to say, 
               <br />
               hat the British North America Act, like every 
               <br />
               other Act, has always to be construed as if

               <br />
               to put it into operation. It is consequently 
               <br />
               necessary, under section 51, to make to—day 
               <br />
               provision for the readjustment, not of the 
               <br />
               four provinces, as they stood when the Act 
               <br />
               passed, but of the seven provinces composing 
               <br />
               confederation to-day. This has never hither- 
               <br />
               to been questioned. In 1871 provision was 
               <br />
               made for readjustment in more than four 
               <br />
               provinces, also in 1881, and in 1891 a read- 
               <br />
               justment was made of the representation 
               <br />
               of all the seven provinces. Where did the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada get authority to read- 
               <br />
