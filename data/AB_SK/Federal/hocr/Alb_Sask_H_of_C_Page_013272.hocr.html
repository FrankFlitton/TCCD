               <br />
               been struck with the fact that the hon. gentlemen

               much the speeches which he has delivered on the

               I may say, Sir, frankly, that with many of the aspi-

               <br />
               were many things said by that hon. gentle-

               have to say on this question and the will be

               the proposition now before the Chair, namely, the 
               <br />
               amendment moved by the hon. Minister of Justice. 
               <br />
               I have just stated that the greatest objection 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span> to this Bill refers to the preamble; that 
               <br />
               was one of the objections urged by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice in the speech he delivered here the 
               <br />
               other night. Well, Sir, we had before us last 
               <br />
               year the consideration of a Bill, the preamble of 
               <br />
               which was obnoxious to a very large portion of the 
               <br />
               people of this country—a preamble calculated to 
               <br />
               arouse the prejudices, if I may so express it, of 
               <br />
               a very large number of people, of whom I myself 
               <br />
               was one. I listened to the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice on that occasion taking the ground 
               <br />
               that the preamble of a Bill was no essential 
               <br />
               part of the Bill at all. During the recess fol- 
               <br />
               lowing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lasg</span> Session of Parliament, many of 
               <br />
               us were calle to account by our constit- 
               <br />
               uents for the position we had taken on the ques- 
               <br />
               tion I have just referred to; and I undertook 
               <br />
               to justify the position I took on that ques- 
               <br />
               tion because I believed that the Government 
               <br />
               were right and did what they ought to do in 
               <br />
               the interest of the country. In doing so, 
               <br />
               I took the ground that the hon. Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               had taken, that the preamble formed no essential 
               <br />
               part of the Bill, and ought not to be considered in 
               <br />
               reference thereto. But we ﬁnd the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice now laying down a new principle and taking 
               <br />
               the opposite View; he says he has a very strong 
               <br />
               objection to this Bill because of its preamble. Well, 
               <br />
               Sir, the hon. member for North Simcoe has stated 
               <br />
               distinctly that if this Bill passes a second reading, 
               <br />
               he has no objection to changing the preamble—that 
               <br />
               the House can amend it in any direction they 
               <br />
               please, or they can strike it out if they please. The 
               <br />
               whole question presented to this House, divested 
               <br />
               of all sentiment, and of all appeals to the Province 
               <br />
               of Quebec or to any other section of the country, 
               <br />
               is Whether it is desirable that that particular clause 
               <br />
               of the North~VVest Territories Act should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> 
               <br />
               tinned on the Statute-book or not. I have no sym-

               pathy with those hon. gentlemen who say that the 
               <br />
               ' hon. member for North Simcoe ought not to have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moved.</span> in this matter, but that it ought to have 
               <br />

               question at the present time. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Simcoe, with all his ardor in the di- 
               <br />
               rection he is moving, declared in the speech 
               <br />
               he made the other night, that it was not 
               <br />
               his intention to interfere in the slightest degree 
               <br />
               with the rights conferred on the minorities in the 
               <br />
               different Provinces by the Act of Confederation. 
               <br />
               The recognition of those rights is, to a very great 
               <br />
               extent, the basis of Confederation ; it was because 
               <br />
               of the concession of them to the minorities in the 
               <br />
               different Provinces that Confederation was made a 
               <br />
               possibility; and, therefore, Iwould be one of the 
               <br />
               last to interfere with them in the slightest degree, 
               <br />
               whether in the Province of Quebec, the Province 
               <br />
               of Ontario, or any other Province in this Dominion. 
               <br />
               But I take it that we are not called upon, 
               <br />
               on the present occasion, to deal with that 
               <br />
               question at all. No <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> proposition has been 
               <br />
               submitted to this House to interfere in the 
               <br />
               slightest degree with the rights of the minorities 
               <br />
               conferred upon them by the Act of Confederation, 
               <br />
               and, therefore, in my judgment at any rate, the 
               <br />
               recital in this resolution is entirely unnecessary. 
               <br />
               Then, I come to the other part of the question. 
               <br />
               The hon. Minister of Justice has laid down the

               <br />
               left to the ﬁnal decision of the North-VVest Legis— 
               <br />
               lature, after the next general election. Well, Sir, 
               <br />
               if he had enlarged the scope of his proposition 
               <br />
               I do not say I would not agree with him; 
               <br />
               but he has conﬁned it to two points. The ﬁrst, 
               <br />
               refers to the use of the French language in the 
               <br />
               ILegislative Assembly of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Terri- 
               <br />
               tories ; but, in the speech he delivered here the 
               <br />
               other night, the hon. Minister stated, that if a 
               <br />
               number of French gentlemen were elected to repre- 
               <br />
               sent portions of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Test</span> Territories in the 
               <br />
               Legislature, they would be permitted to use their 
               <br />
               language on the ﬂoor of that Legislature, as a matter 
               <br />
               of courtesy if not as a matter of right, so that it 
               <br />
               seems to me that the concession proposed to be 
               <br />
               made by this resolution is no concession at all. 
               <br />
               The second point refers to the printing of the 
               <br />
               roceedings of the North—West Legislature in the 
               <br />
               ‘rench language. Why, Sir, we have the autho- 
               <br />
               rity of my hon. friend from West Assiniboia 
               <br />
               (Mr. Davin), who ought to know, perhaps, better 
               <br />
               than any other man in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadaﬁalmost</span> as 
               <br />
               well even as the Regina Leader itself— 
               <br />
               What is the practice in that section of the 
               <br />
