               Mr. BOYD. The applause that was given 
               <br />
               to each of the speakers. How would you 
               <br />
               judge the feeling of a meeting, except by 
               <br />
               the sentiments expressed by the people in 
               <br />
               front of you. Now then, I say that the 
               <br />
               government might just as well face the 
               <br />
               question at once. If we knew the truth of 
               <br />
               the matter I believe we would ﬁnd that this 
               <br />
               is one of the questions that the cabinet is 
               <br />
               ﬁghting like blazes about, because has not 
               <br />
               the Minister of Public Works told us that 
               <br />
               they frequently ﬁght like blazes on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerent</span> 
               <br />
               questions ‘2 If the truth were known, it is 
               <br />
               one of the questions which is causing trouble 
               <br />
               to this cabinet, formed of the ex-ministers 
               <br />
               of different provinces. It is not a question 
               <br />
               of ﬁnance or a question of the division or the 
               <br />
               territory, that is causing the delay. The 
               <br />
               government might just as well admit that 
               <br />
               the delay is caused by the question of the 
               <br />
               schools, and the question of the language, 
               <br />
               and don’t think for a moment that the peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the North-west are not pretty well 
               <br />
               aware of that. You might just as well face 
               <br />
               the question now, and the less people you 
               <br />
               have in the territories the more easily it can 
               <br />
               be dealt with. At the Indian Head meet- 
               <br />
               ing the complaint was that the territories 
               <br />
               were not able to aid railways, were not able 
               <br />
               to do what they would do in the matter of 
               <br />
               transportation, and what they would do if 
               <br />
               they had their provincial government. That 
               <br />
               is the important question that is now agit- 
               <br />
               ating the people of the territories. I agree 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend from East Elgin (Mr. 
               <br />
               Ingram) that the gentlemen representing 
               <br />
               the territories should speak out frankly on 
               <br />
               this subject. I understand the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> of 
               <br />
               supporters of a government. I have been 
               <br />
               over there. But if they would speak out 
               <br />
               frankly and say whether or not they ap- 
               <br />
               prove of the action of the government in 
               <br />
               this instance, they would be giving much 
               <br />
               more satisfaction to their constituents than 
               <br />
               they are doing by the little by-play which 
               <br />
               we have had here this evening.

               )Ir. DOUGLAS. If the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who has just taken his seat draws his con— 
               <br />
               clusions from the meeting at Indian Head, 
               <br />
               he is very gravely mistaken as to the state 
               <br />
               of feeling on this question in Eastern As- 
               <br />
               siniboia. I think I can safely say that not 
               <br />
               one-tenth of the people there are in favour 
               <br />
               of provincial autonomy in the immediate 
               <br />
               future. They know that it must come and 
               <br />
               that we must prepare for it; but it would 
               <br />
               saddle additional burdens on the people. 
               <br />
               They feel that under existing circum- 
               <br />
               stances they could not carry out even a 
               <br />
               complete municipal organization because of 
               <br />
               the sparseness of settlement. There may 
               <br />
               perhaps be a few people or a considerable 
               <br />
               number of people about Indian Head who 
               <br />
               desire provincial autonomy, who have the 
               <br />
               opinion that it would enable them to get 
               <br />
               more support for the development of the 
               <br />
               country in the way of building railways. 
               <br />
               I remember very well the argument of Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultaiu, the premier of the North-west 
               <br />

               Territories. He argued that there should 
               <br />
               be only one province, because the larger 
               <br />
               the province the greater its facility in rais- 
               <br />
               ing money to build railroads; but if that is 
               <br />
               an argument, then it is better that the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories should remain under the supervision 
               <br />
               of the Dominion government, which has 
               <br />
               better credit'in the money markets of the 
               <br />
               world than any province could possibly 
               <br />
               have. Therefore, under existing circum- 
               <br />
               stances and for some years to come, I think 
               <br />
               we are better as we are than we could pos- 
               <br />
               sibly be with provincial autonomy. We 
               <br />
               know it must come, and no progressive set- 
               <br />
               tler would desire to retard it unduly; but 
               <br />
               just now it would certainly impose addi- 
               <br />
               tional burdens on the people, and, voicing 
               <br />
               the sentiment of Eastern Assiniboia, I would 
               <br />
               state decidedly that as far as I can inter- 
               <br />
               pret the feeling of the people, they are not 
               <br />
               in favour of provincial autonomy immedi-
