               of the Minister of Justice, because this question is 
               <br />
               only to be left until the next election in the North- 
               <br />
               VVest, and then a decision is to be given, and I 
               <br />
               believe hon. gentlemen know pretty well What that 
               <br />
               decision is going to be. They want to put off the 
               <br />
               evil day, and I believe that it would have been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abetter</span> to have met the thing boldly and moved the 
               <br />
               six months’ hoist, and so do away with the matter 
               <br />
               altogether. I believe that is the best way to put 
               <br />
               down these fanatics. I was somewhat amused at the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the Government this afternoon. He 
               <br />
               was a very bold man this afternoon, he was very 
               <br />
               courageous, and he held the sword over his head and 
               <br />
               deﬁed those gentlemen who are opposing him in re- 
               <br />
               ference to this matter. But he was quite mild the 
               <br />
               other day. When he made his two speeches before, 
               <br />
               they were just as tame and mild as a sucking dove’s 
               <br />
               speech. But the hon. gentleman was quite bold 
               <br />
               to-day, for, after making arrangements, by which 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen on this side of the House would 
               <br />
               help him through the difﬁculty, he gets up in his 
               <br />
               place and he declares here: “ We will stand or 
               <br />
               fall by this, we are going to make this question”— 
               <br />
               well, he did not say a Government question, but 
               <br />
               he meant that. His speech reminded me very 
               <br />
               much of an Irishman that came to this country 
               <br />
               when it was ﬁrst being settled. One day there 
               <br />
               came a bear into the house while the Irishman and 
               <br />
               his wife were there. He ran up stairs and cried 
               <br />
               out “ Biddy, kill the bear.” So Biddy killed the 
               <br />
               bear, and he came down very courageous, and 
               <br />
               when the neighbors came in he says : “ Look What 
               <br />
               Biddy and I did : we killed the bear.” Now, the 
               <br />
               Irishman had a good deal more—I will not say 
               <br />
               honor, but he had a good deal more generosity; for, 
               <br />
               although he took credit to himself, he gave Biddy 
               <br />
               a share of the credit. But the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               took all the credit to himself ; he did not even 
               <br />
               give my hon. friends on this side of the House 
               <br />
               any share of it Whatever, and I hope before this 
               <br />
               debate is through ‘the hon. gentleman will 
               <br />
               announce, so it may go to the country, that 
               <br />
               he did not do this thing all alone. I am 
               <br />
               a great admirer of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe, and always have been so. I know 
               <br />
               he is a great lawyer and an astute politician ; it is 
               <br />
               claimed that he is a man of undoubted pluck and 
               <br />
               determination. The hon. member for Northum— 
               <br />
               berland (Mr. Mitchell) said the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe was full of pluck and determination, 
               <br />
               and although he had been castigated by almost all 
               <br />
               the members of the House, he had never yielded. 
               <br />
               The hon. member has not shown so much pluck in 
               <br />
               the past as the member for Northumberland 
               <br />
               imagines. If we refer to the past we ﬁnd that on 
               <br />
               one occasion he introduced into this House a Bill 
               <br />
               to prevent people being injured on railways. He 
               <br />
               was not successful, and he did not introduce it the 
               <br />
               next year. Determination is shown by a man 
               <br />
               keeping introduci the same measure year after 
               <br />
               year, if it is a goo one until he succeeds. Next, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman introduced a Bill for the ap- 
               <br />
               pointment of a railway commission. He was sat 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> by the Premier, and he ﬁnally withdrew it. 
               <br />
               T en he had some lit' ation for a gentleman in the 
               <br />
               matter of patents, an he thought it would be a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> thing to regulate the Patent Oﬂice. He intro-

            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               uced a Bill for that purpose, but the late Minister 
               <br />
               of Railways sat on him, and that was the last 
               <br />
               of the Bill. I do not know how often the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman has been sat upon in this House.

               It is also said by people outside that the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman endeavored, in his legal profession, to 
               <br />
               make people believe that he ran the late Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, and that he had a great deal of inﬂu- 
               <br />
               ence with him; but since the present Minister 
               <br />
               came into ofﬁce his inﬂuence has vanished, and 
               <br />
               that is one of the reasons why he is not now in 
               <br />
               happy accord with the Government. It has been 
               <br />
               stated by the Minister of Public VVorks—I have 
               <br />
               great conﬁdence in the Minister of Public Works, 
               <br />
               although he sometimes gets a little excited ; I have 
               <br />
               great conﬁdence in his integrity, and I do not 
               <br />
               believe he would wilfully make an untruthful 
               <br />
               statement to the House; the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               stated that all the French printing for the North— 
               <br />
               West Territories had cost only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400</span> a year, and 
               <br />
               he was so magnanimous as to say that if any one 
               <br />
               objected to the amount, he would put his hand 
               <br />
               into his pocket and pay it every year. That was 
               <br />
               a generous proposition from the hon. Minister, and 
               <br />
               no doubt he is sincere and will do it. Let me re- 
               <br />
               fer, for a moment, to the St. Catharines Milling 
               <br />
               Company. They obtained, from this Govern- 
               <br />
               ment, a license to cut timber in a territory 
               <br />
               where they had no right, and the result was 
               <br />
               they had considerable litigation, and the 
               <br />
               Government stood sponsors to the company 
               <br />
               for their costs. The hon. member for North 
               <br />
               Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy) was selected solicitor for 
               <br />
               the company, and he received a total sum of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$33,500</span> for legal expenses. The hon. gentleman is 
               <br />
               afraid that this country will be ruined because of 
               <br />
               the enormous expenditure going on; but I will 
               <br />
               give the hon. gentleman this assurance, that at the 
               <br />
               rate the hon. Minister of Public Works stated as 
               <br />
               the cost, the French printing in the North-West 
               <br />
               could be maintained for 84 years for the costs in 
               <br />
               that suit. The hon. gentleman wants to do some- 
               <br />
               thing as a patriot, and I have no doubt he is 
               <br />
               sincere in his wish. I was a little impressed, 
               <br />
               however, with the story, which is going round, 
               <br />
               that there is collusion between the hon. the First 
               <br />
               Minister and the hon. gentleman, because the hon. 
               <br />
               the First Minister never said an unkind word to 
               <br />
               him, or even had a look of scorn ; in fact, he was 
               <br />
               as pleasant with the hon. gentleman as if they 
               <br />
               were both sailing in the same boat. It looked 
               <br />
               very much as if the report was true; still, 
               <br />
               one may be deceived by the very fact that hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite look so pleasantly conﬁdent, 
               <br />
               especially when they have got into a tight place. 
               <br />
               I have known some of the antecedents of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe. We had four con- 
               <br />
               tests in North Simcoe, and probably we would 
               <br />
               have had another, except for the fact that 
               <br />
               the hon. the First Minister gerrymandered 
               <br />
               the constituency. I am very sorry he did 
               <br />
               so, because I would have liked to have beaten the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman just once more. In almost every 
               <br />
               address made to the electors by the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
