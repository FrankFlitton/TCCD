               This is the amendment the hon. gentle-

               man objects to. These amendments 
               <br />
               were agreed to by this House. Now. 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, this was done in broad 
               <br />
               daylight when. I presume, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.‘gentle-</span> 
               <br />
               man was in his seat in the House. The 
               <br />
               Votes and Proceedings show that during that 
               <br />
               afternoon or evening a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">division.</span> took place, 
               <br />
               and the hon. gentleman’s name is recorded 
               <br />
               in the division. So the hon. gentleman was 
               <br />
               in the House or within the precincts of the 
               <br />
               House when these proceedings took place. 
               <br />
               Had the hon. gentleman paid the attention 
               <br />
               to his legislative duties that he ought to 
               <br />
               have paid, he would have known of these 
               <br />
               amendments, for he had the same notice of 
               <br />
               the amendments that I had.‘ When these 
               <br />
               amendments were made I went into them 
               <br />
               to ascertain the eiifect of them, because, as 
               <br />
               I said before, they were made without my 
               <br />
               knowledge. When my attention was called 
               <br />
               to the fact that section 44 was amended, 
               <br />
               I went to the hon. member for East Assini- 
               <br />
               boia (Mr. McDonald), who, I think, was the 
               <br />
               only representative from the North-west Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories about at the time, to ascertain what 
               <br />
               the facts were, and he explained to me why 
               <br />
               the amendment was made in the Senate. 
               <br />
               So the hon. gentleman’s charge that I was 
               <br />
               responsible for that amendment falls to the 
               <br />
               ground. That amendment was made by the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman in charge of the Bill in the 
               <br />
               Senate on the advice of the representatives 
               <br />
               in that chamber from the North-west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. I would be quite willing to leave 
               <br />
               the matter there but the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               goes further. He seems to wish to make 
               <br />
               a little cheap popularity by frequent clap- 
               <br />
               trap discussions of this matter. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman would give the members of this 
               <br />
               House to understand that by that simple 
               <br />
               amendment we have changed the position of 
               <br />
               voters in the North-west Territories and 
               <br />
               that the provisions he has read were new. 
               <br />
               He seeks to impress the people with 
               <br />
               same idea, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> in an interview with the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">_,hen.</span> gentleman in the Winnipeg “ Tribune,” 
               <br />
               which was sent to me, the impression is 
               <br />
               conveyed that there is something new about 
               <br />
               it. Why, Sir, the Act the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has quoted is one of the Acts of 49 Victoria. 
               <br />
               Ten years ago thatAct was passed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in’fthis</span> 
               <br />
               Heuse. So if any injustice was inﬂicted 
               <br />
               upon the people of the North-west Terri-

               Mr. DALY. The hon. gentleman is mis— 
               <br />
               taken. The hon. member for Winnipeg says 
               <br />
               that under the amendment, if names are not 
               <br />
               on the list two days before the election they 
               <br />
               cannot be got on at all. Under the old law 
               <br />
               persons could swear in their names on the 
               <br />
               day of the election. That is the real charge. 
               <br />
               If he rested the charge there, I would be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed. But he goes further and makes 
               <br />
               the charge against the Government that we 
               <br />
               are seeking to disfranchise the electors of 
               <br />
               the North-west Territories by a law that 
               <br />
               he would give us to understand was passed 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1894</span> or 1895. But the enumeration lists 
               <br />
               are made up under a law passed ten years 
               <br />
               ago. What are its provisions ‘3 They were 
               <br />
               made to suit the peculiar conditions and 
               <br />
               requirements of the North—west Territories. 
               <br />
               It was well understood by Parliament that 
               <br />
               it would not do to apply the provisions of 
               <br />
               the Franchise Act to the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. The most suitable law under the 
               <br />
               circumstances was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passiad.</span> in discussing
