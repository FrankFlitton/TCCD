               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BOW’ELL.</span> There is reason to believe that

               the part of “ British North America ” to which the 
               <br />
               oleomargarine referred to is exported, is the 
               <br />
               colony of Newfoundland. There is no evidence 
               <br />
               that any of it was imported to Canada, and entered 
               <br />
               into consumption in the Dominion. The ofﬁcers of 
               <br />
               Customs are instructed to exercise constant vigil— 
               <br />
               ance everywhere for the prevention of such viola— 
               <br />
               tion of law. A few pounds of the article was sent 
               <br />
               to a party in St. Thomas, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Out,</span> from Chicago as a 
               <br />
               sample without orders. It was seized by the Col- 
               <br />
               lector of Customs and confiscated by the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment. A consignment of oleomargarine from the 
               <br />
               United States to a party in Halifax was entered 
               <br />
               for consumption, and was seized by the Customs 
               <br />
               ofﬁcials, but upon evidence being produced that the 
               <br />
               entry was' made in mistake, it was allowed to be

               amended and the article exported to N ewfound- 
               <br />

               <br />
               to Great Britain. There is reason to believe that

               a great uantity of oleomargarine passes through
