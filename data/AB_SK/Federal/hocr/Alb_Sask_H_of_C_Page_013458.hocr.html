               west Territories Act, section 14, Ordinances 
               <br />
               have been passed by the territorial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislature</span> 
               <br />
               in reference to education. and we ﬁnd that on 
               <br />
               the Slst December, 1892, an Ordinance was 
               <br />
               passed by that legislature which made con- 
               <br />
               siderable changes in the matter of educa- 
               <br />
               tion there. Up to that time, under the 
               <br />
               Ordinance immediately preceding, namely, 
               <br />
               the Ordinance of 1888, education in that 
               <br />
               country was governed by a Board of Educa- 
               <br />
               tion, which was composed of men represent- 
               <br />
               ing both the majority and the minority. 
               <br />
               Under the Ordinance, the inspection of the 
               <br />
               different schools was made by inspectors 
               <br />
               appointed by the different sections of the 
               <br />
               Board of Education. But in 1892, by the 
               <br />
               Ordinance passed then. we ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               system of inspection now is similar, so far 
               <br />
               as all the schools are concerned. The in- 
               <br />
               spectors are appointed by the Council of 
               <br />
               Public Instruction, or the Lieutenant-Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor in Council. and they are appointed 
               <br />
               irrespective of their religion, to inspect all 
               <br />
               schools, whether separate or otherwise. in 
               <br />
               any portion of the district for which they 
               <br />
               are appointed. Objection was taken here. 
               <br />
               in a previous debate, to that Territorial Ord- 
               <br />
               inance on the ground that by it separate 
               <br />
               schools were taken away from the minority. 
               <br />
               On the contrary, it is stated, and I think on 
               <br />
               good foundation. that, so far as separate 
               <br />
               schools are concerned, they continue to 
               <br />

               established schools under that Ordinance, 
               <br />
               and subjected themselves to taxation for 
               <br />
               that purpose, believing that that law would 
               <br />
               prevail for all time to come, it would not be 
               <br />
               just or right for this Parliament now to 
               <br />
               take away, by one stroke of the pen, the 
               <br />
               rights of these people. But, when the time 
               <br />
               comes. as it may come soon, when the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of that country desire that one or more 
               <br />

               tory, then it will be necessary for us to 
               <br />
               give a full constitution to such provinces, 
               <br />
               then, and not till then, will we be called on 
               <br />
               to deal with this question of education.

               <br />
               those who in the future, at no distant day, 
               <br />
               will be interested in the Territories, are 
               <br />
               under the jurisdiction of this Legislature 
               <br />
               and have a voice in moulding the legislation 
               <br />
               here. so that the interests and wishes of 
               <br />
               those who are to become inhabitants of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> are better represented than they 
               <br />
               would be if the matter was put into the 
               <br />
               control of those who are the ﬁrst occupants 
               <br />
               of the Territories. It is for that reason 
               <br />
               that the House wisely kept control of this 
               <br />
               very important question when government 
               <br />
               was bestowed upon that country. If you 
               <br />
               look at that country to—day you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               they have not responsible government. In 
               <br />
               fact I am told by a number of the members 
               <br />
               from the TerritOries that the majority of 
               <br />
               the people would be opposed to reaponsible 
               <br />
               government. They confess their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immatur.</span> 
               <br />
               ity; they confess that their circumstances 
               <br />
               are such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it will not always be the case 
               <br />
               that, with responsible government, their con- 
               <br />
               trol of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> matters would not be as great 
               <br />
               as through this, House, in which they 
               <br />
               are represented in proportion to their num- 
               <br />
               bers. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">So,</span> I think, there was no ground 
               <br />
               of complaint as . put forward by .the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Simcoe, that this House 
               <br />
               had retained for itself control over the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub</span> 
               <br />
               ject of education, when, in 1875, the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of representation was, to a limited <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1</span> 
               <br />
               extent, introduced into that country. Then, 
               <br />
