               tinues much longer in power. Now, Sir, I say it is time 
               <br />
               that we called a halt ; it is time the Government were 
               <br />
               in a position to announce to this House that they intend 
               <br />
               to step the extravagance that exists in the North- 
               <br />
               West. We shall be glad to encourage them in the 
               <br />
               direction of securing an increase of settlement. We do not 
               <br />
               deny that it is absolutely necessary in the interest of this 
               <br />
               Dominion that the country should be settled. We will 
               <br />
               Oﬂer then every encouragement, we will say every word

               <br />

               <br />
               say, that so far as the older sections of the country is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, we cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂord</span> to go on and spend recklessly, in 
               <br />
               the way we have been doing, the money of the people of 
               <br />
               this country in a manner that is altogether unnecessary. 
               <br />
               I claim that it is quite unnecessary. I claim that no man 
               <br />
               who will go through that country, as I went through it, 
               <br />
               and see on every hand fellows in ofﬁcial position, fellows 
               <br />
               occupying easy quarters and drawing large salaries, but 
               <br />
               will come to the conclusion that that country has been 
               <br />
               cursed. I hope the Minister, now in charge will put in the 
               <br />
               pruning hook at once, and that Whatever the evils of the 
               <br />
               past may have been in regard to ofﬁcials there, these evils 
               <br />
               will now be put a stop to. Why, Sir, there are evils in 
               <br />
               other directions. I am sorry to say, that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) is no exception, because 
               <br />
               I see that the organ of which undoubtedly be is chief—or 
               <br />
               used to be, and I suppose he is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">still-is</span> getting 85,000 a 
               <br />
               year for printing. It appears that every one who supports 
               <br />
               the Government thinks he must get some little picking, 
               <br />
               some little advantage for himself. New, I say we have 
               <br />
               had enough of this thing, it has just gone far enough, 
               <br />
               in the interests of the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this country, and I 
               <br />
               hope that the members of this House will stand shoulder 
               <br />
               to shoulder, and persistently sit upon this thing, and not 
               <br />
               permit it to exist any longer, cut Oﬂ‘ these unnecessary 
               <br />
               and extravagant ofﬁcials, and come down to a common 
               <br />
               sense position. 'Ihe course that we have been pursuing 
               <br />
               in the past in the North West, has been a curse to 
               <br />
               the country; we have cursed it by our land regulations; 
               <br />
               we have cursed it by our mining regulations, by our rail- 
               <br />
               way regulations and in other ways; now let us remove all 
               <br />
               the restrictions and give the people an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Opportunity‘to</span> rise, 
               <br />
               let us take off the unnecessary burden put upon them in the 
               <br />
               way of eﬂicials that are now roaming around that country, 
               <br />
               and cut down the expenditure to what is actually necessary. 
               <br />
               Then i believe that the country will prosper and will go On 
               <br />
               prospering. ButI believe if you do not do that, if you 
               <br />
               allow this horde of Oﬁicials and these monopolies to continue 
               <br />
               to exist as they have in the past, the same curse will con-

               <br />
               duty, in the interest of the constituency I represent, and 
               <br />
               the Province from which I come, to make these remarks. 
               <br />
               I do not oifer any objection to one word that has been 
               <br />
               said by the representatives of that country; I give them 
               <br />
               credit for advocating the cause of their country; they 
               <br />
               would not be doing their duty if they did not advocate it, 
               <br />
               but I also hold that it is our duty to keep control of these 
               <br />
               things. We, in the Older Provinces, have an interest in that 
               <br />
               country, because we have to help to bear the burden, we 
               <br />
               have got to pay the taxes, we have to contribute towards 
               <br />
               the enormous sums that will annually fall upon the shoulders 
               <br />
               of the peOple of this country to meet the annual expense 
               <br />
               and the enormously increased interest on our public debt, 
               <br />
               to pay for the improvements that have been made up there ; 
               <br />
               and I say it is our duty to raise our voice in the interests 
               <br />
               of the peOple and to declare that we object to see the taxes 
               <br />
               increased from year to year, that we object to see imposed 
               <br />
               upon them new burdens which cannot be rolled away for 
               <br />
               many years to come. I hope the course Of this House will 
               <br />
               show the Minister of Interior that we desire him to put in 
               <br />
               the pruning hook, and let us begin at once to do what we

               Mr. DAVIS (Alberta). In Speaking upon these resolu- 
               <br />
               tions passed by the Legislative Assembly of the North-West 
               <br />
               last November, and that have been laid upon the Table 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin), 
               <br />
               I wish to say he has echoed my sentiments exactly. 
               <br />
               In the ﬁrst part of his speech he also gave us a glow- 
               <br />
               ing description of the agricultural capacity Of the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">West.</span> There was one industry, however, which he 
               <br />
               did not speak of, and that is the ranching industry. We 
               <br />
               have in the district of Alberta, as you all know, a large 
               <br />
               expanse of Open prairies, where we can graze cattle the 
               <br />
               year round. We have in the northern portion of the terri- 
               <br />
               tory some Of the ﬁnest, if not the very ﬁnest, farming land 
               <br />
               that lies out of doors. All we require is a railway in the 
               <br />
               North Saskatchewan country in order to develop that im- 
               <br />
               mense wheat country. Speaking Of the ranching country, 
               <br />
               I may say that in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> southern portion Of Alberta you will 
               <br />
               see herds of cattle which have been put into that country 
               <br />
               during the last ﬁve years. There are at present, I suppose, 
               <br />
               about 130,000 horned cattle in the district Of Alberta. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst year we had to import cattle, but last year I suppose 
               <br />
               the district of Alberta exported 5,000 head of steers, and 
               <br />
               probably as many more were consumed for home consump- 
               <br />
               tion, making 10,000 head of steers, while, ﬁve years ago, 
               <br />
               we had to import all the beef that was used in the country 
               <br />
               from the United States. Now these 10,000 head of steers, 
               <br />
               at $40 a piece—which they would bring at least, while 
               <br />
               many of them brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">850—</span> would make $400,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> that 
               <br />
               new industry that has been established in the North-West. 
               <br />
               Then we have another industry that has just been estab- 
               <br />
               lished in that country, and that is the raising of horses. 
               <br />
               We have at present, I presume, at least 20,000 in the district 
               <br />
               of Alberta, and I wish to remind the Minister of Agriculture 
               <br />
               that in his quarantine list he has left out horses. I see he 
               <br />
               has discriminated against all other animals except horses, 
               <br />
               I wish he would include horses on the list in his quarantine 
               <br />
               regulations. They are raising a great many horses in the 
               <br />
               vast country to the south of us, and we know at the present 
               <br />
               time there is some disease amongst horses on the south 
               <br />
               side of the line; therefore I think the Minister ought to 
               <br />
               put horses on the list, but I would not advise him to 
               <br />
               give as many days as he does in the case of cattle. 
               <br />
               Then within the last few years in the district of Alberta 
               <br />
               there have been large tracts of land held by speculators 
               <br />
               from the east who never intended to put stock on them. 
               <br />
               The present Minister of Interior, since he assumed Oﬁice, 
               <br />
               has thrown open at least 1,500,000 acres which, otherwise, 
               <br />
               would not have been opened to settlers, and this has 
               <br />
