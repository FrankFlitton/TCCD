               part of section four. The subsequent pro-

               other important section is section eight to 
               <br />

               I would rather be inclined to think that 
               <br />
               there is ground for the contention taken by 
               <br />
               the law ofﬁcers of the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick—I understand this to be their 
               <br />
               argument—that Canada as constituted under 
               <br />
               this Act meant in the ﬁrst place the four 
               <br />
               original provinces, or rather the three origi- 
               <br />
               nal provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and 
               <br />
               New Brunswick and not Canada as it might 
               <br />
               be constituted from time to time. If you 
               <br />
               once grant that, it seems to me that 
               <br />
               a very serious question arises. I am not 
               <br />
               insensible of the force of the argu-

               been made by the hon. Minister of Justice, 
               <br />
               and it seems that he has overlooked one 
               <br />
               point to which he might have drawn atten- 
               <br />
               tion and that is that the words ‘parliament 
               <br />

               ﬁfty-one must obviously mean Canada as 
               <br />
               constituted from time to time, because it is 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada as constituted

               <br />
               to be as conclusive as the Minister of Jus-

               tice supposes, because it might possibly be 
               <br />
               that the new provinces must be compared

               the very distinct language contained in sec-

               other four provinces are concerned. That 
               <br />
               seems to me to be the whole crux of the 
               <br />
               argument of the Minister of Justice. If 
               <br />
               you once concede that ‘Canada’ in section 
               <br />
               51 means ‘ Canada ’ as it was originally con- 
               <br />

               the light of a treaty between the four pro-

               garded in the light of a treaty between the 
               <br />
               four provinces—you must have something 
               <br />
               very distinct indeed in any subsequent sta- 
               <br />
               tutes or addresses if you are to modify the. 
               <br />
               language of that section. I do not know-

               that I would be inclined to go so far as
