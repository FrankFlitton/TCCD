               whole length of the railway. Acting on the 
               <br />
               powers contained in that Act, the North Shore 
               <br />
               Railway Company issued debentures to the amount 
               <br />
               of about one and three quarter millions, in round 
               <br />
               numbers. I do not pretend to give the exact 
               <br />
               ﬁgures, but that was about he amount. I under— 
               <br />
               stand that a portion of ese debentures was 
               <br />
               handed over to the Government of Quebec as col— 
               <br />
               lateral security for the obligation entered into by 
               <br />
               the company with the said Government of Quebec 
               <br />
               for the payment of the price of the railway. As I 
               <br />
               understand, half a million was paid cash, but the 
               <br />
               rest, three millions and a-half, is still due to the 
               <br />
               Government of Quebec. Of the total amount of de- 
               <br />
               bentures issued some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,108,000</span> was given as 
               <br />
               collateral security by the company to the Bank of 
               <br />
               Montreal. At the time of the sale of the railway 
               <br />
               to the North Shore Railway Company, a great deal 
               <br />
               of opposition was shown to the scheme of the 
               <br />
               Government, not only by the members of the 
               <br />
               then Opposition, but also by a great many 
               <br />
               supporters of the Government of which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Secretary of State was then the head. 
               <br />
               That opposition from his own friends was stopped, 
               <br />
               in a large measure, by the. representations which 
               <br />
               were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made—Johat</span> that was the only way to prevent 
               <br />
               the railway from going into the hands of the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk Railway Company. That sale took place in 
               <br />
               1882, and not later, I think, than February, 1883, 
               <br />
               the same railway was sold to the Grand Trunk' 
               <br />
               Railway Company. I do not mean to say that the 
               <br />
               line of the railway was sold, but an agreement was 
               <br />
               entered into by the North Shore Railway Com- 
               <br />
               pany, which was then represented by the late 
               <br />
               Senator Senecal, and the Grand Trunk Railway 
               <br />
               Company, by which the stock of the former com- 
               <br />
               pany was transferred to certain parties re resent- 
               <br />
               ing the interest of the Grand Trunk ailway 
               <br />
               Company. The Grand Trunk Railway Company 
               <br />
               then took possession of the railway, and what 
               <br />
               was the result ‘2 The city of Quebec had subscribed 
               <br />
               a large sum, 3. much larger sum than it could 
               <br />
               relatively afford, if we consider the needs of the 
               <br />
               city of Quebec. That subscription amounted to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,000,000.</span> In order to help the construction of 
               <br />
               the North Shore Railway the city of Quebec 
               <br />
               made this immense sacriﬁce, so as to secure a rival 
               <br />
               line between that city and Montreal. After the 
               <br />
               line was sold to the Grand Trunk Railway, that 
               <br />
               rivalry for which the city of Quebec had aid so 
               <br />
               much ceased altogether to exist. Not on y that

               rivalry ceased to exist, but an arrangement was
