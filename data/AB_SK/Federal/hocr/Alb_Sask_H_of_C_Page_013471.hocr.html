               whom challenge and deny the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s contention. They say there is nothing 
               <br />
               in the constitution to prevent the Local 
               <br />
               Leigslatures controlling the whole matter 
               <br />
               when the Territories come to be formed into 
               <br />
               provinces. Perhaps I hold views on edu- 
               <br />
               cation different from those of a good many. 
               <br />
               I am not in favour of such an absolutely 
               <br />
               secular system such as that established in 
               <br />
               Manitoba ; I believe it is wrong to abolish 
               <br />
               from our schools every vestige of religious 
               <br />
               education. I ﬁnd from the statement given 
               <br />
               to us by the hon. member for North Sim~ 
               <br />
               coe that there are in the North—west two 
               <br />
               hundred and ten Protestant public schools 
               <br />
               and only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thirty~four</span> Catholic public schools. 
               <br />
               Well. surely the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               can tolerate that number of Catholic schools 
               <br />
               until they ﬁnd what the Territory is going 
               <br />
               to develop into. The hon. gentleman points 
               <br />
               out that some of those schools cost more 
               <br />
               per capita than the Protestant schools. That 
               <br />
               is not the fault of the law; it is the fault 
               <br />
               of the system of administration. If the 
               <br />
               Government were to administer the system 
               <br />
               so as to grant a per capita allowance, we 
               <br />
               would not have that condition of things.

               <br />
               of the constitution. My hon. friend said 
               <br />
               something with regard to the request of 
               <br />
               the North—west Assembly. There is no 
               <br />
               doubt that that Assembly have asked 
               <br />
               to be allowed to deal with the question 
               <br />
