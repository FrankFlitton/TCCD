               When that grant was made the idea was

               However, owing to the increase of patients 
               <br />
               and the increase of hospitals, the grant now 
               <br />
               only amounts to 27 cents per day for non- 
               <br />
               paying patients. This is a charge that has 
               <br />
               increased from year to year and it is a 
               <br />
               charge that must be provided for. There 
               <br />
               has also been $3,000 paid out for the en-
