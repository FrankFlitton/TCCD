               the trail between McLeod and Calgary. There are four

               rivers on that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trail</span> which during at least four months in

               <br />
               Elbow River, is bridged at the present time. I would 
               <br />
               urge on the members of the Cabinet, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">especially</span> on the 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Works, to see that an appropriation is

               Tho work is most important to the people of that district, 
               <br />
               and it should not be neglected. The same remarks apply 
               <br />
               to the trail from Calgary to Eimonton, and the trail from 
               <br />
               Lethbridge to McLeod. This latter trail is only a short 
               <br />
               distance of thirty miles, and we have two of the largest 
               <br />
               rivers of the North-West to cross on it, which at all seasons 
               <br />
               of the year are unfordable. 1n the spring when the ice is 
               <br />
               soft and coming down, it is almost impossible to get 
               <br />
               across this river in any way. Not only are those rivers 
               <br />
               dangerous to property, but scarcely a spring passes that 
               <br />
               there are not lives lost there. Permit me to make 
               <br />
               some comments on the statements of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Wellington (Mr. McMullen) with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to 
               <br />
               colonisation companies in the N orthWest, for I have 
               <br />
               some experience up there, and I know something about 
               <br />
               the condition of things in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories.</span> Let me tell the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman that the two colonisation companies in the 
               <br />
               district of Alberta have been a great beneﬁt to the country, 
               <br />
               instead, as he would try to make out, an injury and a dis- 
               <br />
               advantage. There are only two companies in Operation at 
               <br />
               the present time in the North West, as the lands held by 
               <br />
               the others have been thrown Open, but I can say that these 
               <br />
               two companies have been a boon to that section of the 
               <br />
               country. The hon. gentleman has spoken of the expenses 
               <br />
               incurred in connection with the administration of affairs in 
               <br />
               the North-West and it is a subject which he has been con- 
               <br />
               stantly growling about in this House. It has got to be a 
               <br />
               chestnut with the hon. member and I have heard him sing- 
               <br />
               ing the same old song for the last three years. If we ask 
               <br />
               for the expenditure of public money up there it is because 
               <br />
               we need it to develop our great country, and whatever is 
               <br />
               expended on us now is in asense only borrowed money, for 
               <br />
               n a few years we will be able to pay it back to the Dom-

               <br />
               They get the small sum of 81,200 a year each and when a

               <br />
               cannot be considered in any sense a high salary. Why, we

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">81,800</span> a year and board him too. Talk about 81,200 a year to

               sometimes nearly double that to a good cowboy. I should say 
               <br />
               that the Government ought raise the salaries of the land 
               <br />
               agents to $1,500 a year and then it would look more like de- 
               <br />
               cent pay. The hon. gentleman has also spoken of the Ofﬁce 
               <br />
               expenses of those registry ofﬁces. What does he want to 
               <br />
               do with them? Does he want to close them all up and let 
               <br />
               them take care of themselves? I suppose that would be his 
               <br />
               remedy and that would be his policy to bring population 
               <br />
               and settlers into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthWest</span> Territories. There is 
               <br />
               another matter to which I wish to call the attention of hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               lived a good while in the North-West and [know more

               about the Indians than some of the hon. gentlemen who

               <br />
               them. Let me tell those members that they will ﬁnd it a

               great deal cheaper to feed the small number of Indians that 
               <br />
               we are feeding at the Ipresent; time than to have constantly 
               <br />
               a row on our hands. t is a good deal easier to feed the 
               <br />
               Indians than to ﬁght them, a fact which they have learned 
               <br />
               in the United States, and of which they have bitter experi-

               <br />
               on this question. There are other matters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effecting</span> the

               Mr. DE WDNEY. I do not prOpose to occupy the time 
               <br />
               of the House with any lengthened remarks on this subject 
               <br />
               to-night, because I think several Opportunities will be 
               <br />
               afforded before the close of the Session for dealing with 
               <br />
               almost every subject touched on by hon. gentlemen today. 
               <br />
               I think, by this time the House will have found out that there 
               <br />
               is more than one “funnel” through which we can obtain 
               <br />
               very valuable and interesting information, with regard to 
               <br />
               North-West matters. I am sure, we feel very much in- 
               <br />
               debted to the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Davin)</span> for bringing up these questions, and not only making 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen acquainted With the resolutions passel by 
               <br />
               the Legislative Assembly last autumn, but affording an 0p- 
               <br />
               portunity for an expression of views by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               Who are interested in our western country, and giving 
               <br />
               myself and the Government an opportunity for giving a 
               <br />
               greater and more intelligent consideration to the several 
               <br />
               matters included in his resolution. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               went over these resolutions seriatim ; but I do not think an 
               <br />
               extended reply will be expected from me, because hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen are aware, that all these memorials are now 
               <br />
               under the cousideration of the Government, and the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment’s reply to them, will in a very short time be for- 
               <br />
               warded to the Lieutenant Governor for the information of 
               <br />
               his Legislative Assembly. The hon. gentleman was kind 
               <br />
               enough, in connection with the resolution which 
               <br />
               he considered of great importance, the prohibition 
               <br />
               resolution, to say, that he sympathised with me dur- 
               <br />
               ing the years that the permit system was placed 
               <br />
               under my control. All I can say in reference to that 
               <br />
               is that I did not ﬁnd the duty 9. very pleasant one, and 
               <br />
               I sympathise with my successor who is now in my shoes in 
               <br />
               dealing with it. I shall only be too glad to see some change 
               <br />
               made in that respect. As I said to my constituents last 
               <br />
               autumn when addressing them, I do not care much what 
               <br />
