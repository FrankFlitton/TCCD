               agitation which would tend to destroy the loyalty 
               <br />
               of a portion of Her Majesty’s subjects. These 
               <br />
               gentlemen pose as the representatives of Ontario 
               <br />
               and pretend to speak the voice of Ontario 
               <br />
               in protest against the use of the French language 
               <br />
               in Canada. I venture to tell them that they do not 
               <br />
               represent Ontario in this matter, that they do not 
               <br />
               speak the voice of Ontario in this agitation. The 
               <br />
               true voice of Ontario may still be heard in the 
               <br />
               echoes of that splendid demonstration made in 
               <br />
               December, 1884, in Toronto, in honor of Sir John 
               <br />
               A. Macdonald. It was my good fortune to be 
               <br />
               present at that grand and imposing reunion of the 
               <br />
               forces of the great Conservative party. I shall never 
               <br />
               forget the ovation given to the Old Chief when he 
               <br />
               entered the hall where ﬁve thousand voices 
               <br />
               acclaimed him with enthusiastic cheers. I shall 
               <br />
               never forget the warm, the cordial reception given 
               <br />
               to my hon. friends the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works and the Minister of Militia, and to myself. 
               <br />
               It was my ﬁrst visit to'Toronto and the impression 
               <br />
               I received, an impression which will never be effaced 
               <br />
               from my memory, was that the bond of friendship, 
               <br />
               nay, the bond of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affection,</span> that linked together the 
               <br />
               two great races of this Confederation, would resist 
               <br />
               any attack which interest, jealousy or preju- 
               <br />
               dice might direct against it. It was, it is true, 
               <br />
               a political demonstration, but it had a great 
               <br />
               character beyond that, which proved that differ- 
               <br />

               the best manner for the progress of our common 
               <br />
               country. This was the voice of Ontario, and I 
               <br />
               think it would be the voice of Ontario still. I say 
               <br />
               to the supporters, if there are any in Ontario, of 
               <br />
               the measure of the hon. member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               (Mr. McCarthy), that I believe the voice of Ontario 
               <br />
               would be still the same if the right hon. the leader 
               <br />
               of the House would appeal, on the same generous 
               <br />
               principles, to the same fair-minded population of 
               <br />
               Ontario to—day. Sir, I protest against that agitation, 
               <br />
               I protest against that plan of campaign as sug-

               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), and indicated here 
               <br />
               and outside by the speeches of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for'North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton). I do not quote 
               <br />
               their expressions here. They are too ugly for me 
               <br />
               to quote them or, at all events, they are too <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro»</span> 
               <br />
               voking. It is not for us here to talk about opening 
               <br />
               a free road through the St. Lawrence for the 
               <br />
               Anglo—Saxon to pass to the conquest of the 
               <br />
               world. If that course is to be persisted in, Sir, I 
               <br />
               cannot qualify it in any other words, that if it is a 
               <br />
               political game it is a dangerous mistake, and if it 
               <br />
               is a determined and premeditated movement to be 
               <br />

               They will look in the past and around them, and

               they will see written on the walls the fate which 
               <br />

               <br />
               attempt to imitate their example. ‘ Sir, I appeal 
               <br />
               to the higher instincts, to the nobler feelings of

               those who sincerely wish the consolidation of these

               <br />

               <br />
               of all this. They must know how dangerous are

               thus put in motion will produce great and good

               results. Let them not forget that in dealing with

               <br />
               member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), I am not 
               <br />
               ready to accept the amendment proposed by the 
               <br />
               hon. memberfor Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil), although 
               <br />
               I am in accord with the principles of it, but I 
               <br />
               cannot ﬁnd too strong language to express my 
               <br />
               repudiation of the principles, the form, the sur— 
               <br />
               roundings of the measure submitted. The Bill of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe is opposed to 
               <br />
               his own political record, principles and career. 
               <br />
               He supported with intelligence and vigor the 
               <br />
               policy of unity of action and harmony of thought 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> races which form this Dom- 
               <br />
               inion, irrespective of creed or language. He was 
               <br />
               present when the Acts giving a constitution to 
               <br />
               the North-West Territories were initiated, revised 
               <br />
               and passed, and he ave his acquiescence to that 
               <br />
               legislation. The BilI is opposed to the policy that 
               <br />
               has prevailed in Canada, of protecting the rights 
               <br />
               of minorities in the schools, in the Legislatures, 
               <br />
               in the Senate. It is opposed to the law of the 
               <br />
               land, which was approved by two Administrations 
               <br />
               and three Parliaments. It is opposed to the 
               <br />
               spirit of British legislation, which, in the case of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, provided a perpetual guarantee to the 
               <br />
               minority in regard to schools and language, and, 
               <br />
               in the case of any new Province hereafter created 
               <br />
               in the Territories, provided a guarantee of stability 
               <br />
               to the constitution given to it at the time of its 
               <br />
               creation. It is opposed to the general policy of the 
               <br />
               modern British Empire, which, in India, in Mani- 
               <br />
