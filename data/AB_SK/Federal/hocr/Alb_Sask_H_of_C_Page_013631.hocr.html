               <br />
               granting full powers of local government to 
               <br />

               <br />
               were dispersed, the conditions did not seem 
               <br />
               favourable for the establishment of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov«</span> 
               <br />
               ernment and legislature with full powers of

               The powers granted to the North-west 
               <br />
               legislature are, however, quite large; and, 
               <br />
               in very many respects those territories are 
               <br />
               to-day exercising the privileges and hear- 
               <br />
               ing responsibilities of self-government. In 
               <br />
               some respects, they are not entirely clothed 
               <br />
               with the powers of provincial government; 
               <br />
               but I think we all agree that the time is 
               <br />
               close at hand when these powers must be 
               <br />
               given to them. These powers will not mere- 
               <br />
               ly convey privileges, but will also impose 
               <br />
               upon them some responsibility, and I am 
               <br />
               not quite sure that. from a purely ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial point of view, they will be beneﬁted by 
               <br />
               establishing provincial autonomy. How- 
               <br />
               ever. I presume the question is not to he 
               <br />
               judged from that point of view alone and 
               <br />
               that the people in that country which is 
               <br />
               now so rapidly being ﬁlled up will desire 
               <br />
               ordinary powers of provincial government. 
               <br />
               In the meantime, as it is not proposed at 
               <br />
               the present session to bring forward a mea— 
               <br />
               sure to give them full powers of provin- 
               <br />
               cial government, it is proposed that we 
               <br />
               should make a more liberal provision for 
               <br />
               the management of their ﬁnancial affairs. 
               <br />
               We, therefore, agree to make a very con— 
               <br />
               siderable increase in the annual grant and 
               <br />
               also to make this special provision having 
               <br />
               relation to the opening of a capital account. 
               <br />
               If they were established as a province, no 
               <br />
               doubt they would have a certain sum of 
               <br />
               money placed to their credit, the interest 
               <br />
               upon which they would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled.</span> to re- 
               <br />
               ceive and the principal of which they could 
               <br />
               make use of for public works. Provision 
               <br />
               is made in the existing law for any of the 
               <br />
               provinces that have capital account to their 
               <br />
               credit that, if they desire. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the!</span> may with— 
               <br />
               draw an amount for what are called in the 
               <br />
               Act local improvements. As a rule, the 
               <br />
               provincial government may not be desirous 
               <br />
               of withdrawing these sums, because while 
               <br />
               they remain to the credit of the province 
               <br />
               in the treasury, the province probably ob- 
               <br />
               tains a better rate of interest than it could 
               <br />
               manage to obtain otherwise. We think it is 
               <br />
               W611 that, during the present session, we 
               <br />

               by this resolution is that power shall be

               <br />

               <br />
               so desire, sums of money up to $250,000, 
               <br />
               which are to be expended on public works 
               <br />
               of a class which may be deemed properly 
               <br />
               chargeable to capital. Perhaps, as the two 
               <br />
               questions are connected I may call atten- 
               <br />
               tion to the increases that have been made 
               <br />
               in the grants to the North-west Territories. 
               <br />
               During recent years very considerable in- 
               <br />
               creases have been made, and it is proposed, 
               <br />
               in the present year, to make still further in- 
               <br />
               creases. There is one general grant given 
               <br />
               to the government of the North-west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories which is classed in our estimates as 
               <br />
               grants for schools, &amp;c., which, practically 
               <br />
               is equivalent to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial‘subsidy.</span> There 
               <br />
               are some other grants for special purposes 
               <br />
               to which I need not more particularly re- 
               <br />
               fer; but this annual grant for schools and 
               <br />
               other purposes, I think I may say, stands 
               <br />
               in about the position of a provincial sub- 
               <br />
               sidy. That grant in 1892 was quite small— 
               <br />
               only $40,000. In 1893 it was $198000; in 
               <br />
               1894, $199,000; in 1895, $225,000; in 1896, 
               <br />
               $267,000, which was the ﬁgure at which 
               <br />
               the grant stood when the present govern- 
               <br />
               ment came into power. In the following 
               <br />
               year there appears to have been a slight 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">falling</span> off. the reason of which I have not 
               <br />
               at hand. For the year ending 30th of July, 
               <br />
               1897. the grant was $242,000. From that 
               <br />
               time it has almost steadily increased. In 
               <br />
               1898 the grant was $262,000 ; in 1899. $282,- 
               <br />
               000; in 1900, $282,000. In 1901. including 
               <br />
               a special grant which was made in con- 
               <br />
               sequence of considerable damage suffered 
               <br />
               from ﬂoods, the grant was increased to 
               <br />
               $424,000. In 1902, the grant was $407,000. 
               <br />
               In 1903, the year recently closed, the sums 
               <br />
               allowed by parliament were found to be 
               <br />
               quite insufﬁcient, and, in our supplement- 
               <br />
               ary estimates for the year recently voted in 
               <br />
               this House, we gave an additional grant of 
               <br />
               $250,000 so that this general grant, which I 
               <br />
               have described as being equivalent to a pro- 
               <br />
               vincial subsidy, stood for the year 1903 
               <br />
               at $707,000, as against $267,000 in 1896. For 
               <br />
               the coming year, we are proposing to add a 
               <br />
               similar sum of $250,000, which will be pro- 
               <br />
               vided in the supplementary estimates. We 
               <br />
               are also making a special grant to the local 
               <br />
               government to enable them to carry out a 
               <br />
               plan which they had some months ago of
