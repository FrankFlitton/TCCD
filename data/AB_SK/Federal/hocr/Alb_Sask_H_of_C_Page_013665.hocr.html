               There has been put up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> argument that 
               <br />
               the territories should have control of their

               to aid railways. I do not know just where

               this idea emanated from at present; but I

               in a position to say that it was for the de-

               <br />
               years gone by that the demand was made 
               <br />
               ‘for control of the lands at a time when there 
               <br />
               was no railway extension in the territories,

               'when railway extension was very greatly 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tories</span> had been given and were b‘Eing given

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">territories</span> did demand and require the con-

               <br />
               position is very considerably different. To- 
               <br />
               day there are no lands in the territories 
               <br />

               no lands ‘in the territories being granted to 
               <br />

               or more provinces rather than be held as 
               <br />
               only one. I submit that at this mo-

               lating to the manner of a ﬁnal organization

               tlemen that the territories are not in the

               <br />
               bers of this government, I may say that

               I have had a long acquaintance with Mr.

               brief acquaintance with the members of the 
               <br />
               present government, I believe they are able 
               <br />
               to take their own part,-and that we can 
               <br />
               leave that matter to be settled between 
               <br />
               them. In regard to the people of the North-

               <br />
               The questions at issue are questions con- 
               <br />
               cerning them and interesting to them, and 
               <br />
               I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aim</span> bound to say that the answer to the

               people of the North-west Territories has 
               <br />
               been fairly satisfactory. It is contained in
