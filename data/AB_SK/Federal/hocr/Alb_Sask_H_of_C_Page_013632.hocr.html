               these were two important structures, they 
               <br />
               needed authority to construct them at once, 
               <br />
               and they were without ﬁnancial means’as to 
               <br />
               do so. They were assured that the govern-

               ment would place them in funds to con—

               these bridges, being of a solid and perman-

               have, on consideration, decided to make this

               The MINISTER OF FINANCE. As I 
               <br />
               was saying, it was at ﬁrst proposed as my 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Hon. Mr. Haggai-t) has sug— 
               <br />
               gested that we should deduct it. In 
               <br />
               some correspondence I had with the premier 
               <br />
               of the North-west government, I expressed 
               <br />
               the view that as these bridges were of a 
               <br />
               permanent character they were a proper 
               <br />
               charge against capital account. However, 
               <br />
               the North-west government thought that an 
               <br />
               ungenerous view to take and, on considera- 
               <br />
               tion, we have decided to yield to their re- 
               <br />
               presentations and make it a special grant 
               <br />
               this year. So, we shall provide for the cur— 
               <br />
               rent year, apart from some ordinary grants 
               <br />
               amounting to $90,000 which I do not need 
               <br />
               to specialize, and including the special 
               <br />
               grants on account of the bridges, $1,046,000, 
               <br />
               as against $267,000 which they were receiv- 
               <br />
               ing only a few years ago when the change 
               <br />
               of government occurred. I think it will be 
               <br />
               seen from the ﬁgures I have read that fair 
               <br />
               consideration has been given, from time to 
               <br />

               <br />
               tories, and that we are responding with fair 
               <br />
               liberality to their increasing necessities. We 
               <br />
               are proposing therefore, to give them, for 
               <br />
               the current year, either for their own gen- 
               <br />
               eral purposes or for special purposes, a sum 
               <br />
               of $1,046,000, and to give them a right to use, 
               <br />
               if they wish, a further sum of $250,000. 01’ 
               <br />
               course, if that be not used, there will be no 
               <br />
               charge against them. and, if it be used, or 
               <br />
               if any portion of it be used, the amount 
               <br />
               used will be charged to a capital account, 
               <br />

               is now to be considered, and that it will be

               taken up, as I gather, immediately after the 
               <br />
               elections are over. From what the Minister

               <br />
               been forced to take up this question, and 
               <br />
               in the meantime we are going to do some— 
               <br />
               thing for the Territories in a ﬁnancial way, 
               <br />
               and later on we are going to erect them into 
               <br />
               provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Now.</span> I am in favour of the

               most liberal kind of treatment to the North-

               liberal share of the public domain in that 
               <br />

               hope when this territory comes to be erect-

               <br />
               them, but that they will be given control

               of a very considerable portion of the public

               the various streams, and these bridges will

               Mr. SPROULE. It seems to me this 
               <br />
               would be a very proper time for the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to explain why they have refused 
               <br />
               provincial autonomy to the North—west Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. We know the people of the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories have applied or it, the application 
               <br />
               has been brought to the notice of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment at different times and in differ- 
               <br />
               ent ways, with a good deal of force. We 
               <br />
               found when in that country last fall 
               <br />
               that there was a strong consensus of 
               <br />
               opinion in favour of it, and the people 
               <br />
               regarded their situation as most unfortu- 
               <br />
               nate because they were not granted provin- 
               <br />
               cial autonomy. The people out there think 
               <br />
               they are very much handicapped in carrying 
               <br />
               on the operations of life for the want of 
               <br />
               it. Then, why have the government not 
               <br />
