               vided that the majority of the ratepayers 
               <br />
               might establish such schools and impose 
               <br />
               such necessary assessment as they might

               Catholic, might establish separate schools :

               and such rate-payers would be liable only

               be found generally speaking to meet the

               requirements of the country. However, 
               <br />
               the Government would be very glad to
