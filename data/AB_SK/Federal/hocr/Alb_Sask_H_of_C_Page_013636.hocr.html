               Mr. OLIVER. There was no arrangement 
               <br />
               with the territories. The grant is a matter 
               <br />
               of ordinary vote by parliament from year

               provincial organization. That was the con- 
               <br />
               dition which gave rise to the present de-

               mand (if you may say so) for provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">H'aultain</span> wanted to get the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the debt account which he would 
               <br />
               have on the then existing population and 
               <br />
               to get such other grants as properly belong 
               <br />
               to a province, believing that he would then 
               <br />
               be ﬁnancially better off than he was under 
               <br />
               the system of granting subsidies, which 
               <br />
               practically stood still for a number of years. 
               <br />
               But since that time, the subsidies have very 
               <br />
               largely increased, and particularly so dur— 
               <br />
               ing the present year. The increase of sub- 
               <br />
               sidy changes the position very considerably 
               <br />
               in regard to the demand for provincial or- 
               <br />
               ganization. In my estimation at any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rate;</span> 
               <br />
               in a country such as the territories, where 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial needs are very great—the ﬁn- 
               <br />
               ancial question is the chief question. The 
               <br />
               obtaining of money with which to carry out 
               <br />
               public improvements and to keep educa- 
               <br />
               tional facilities up to a modern standard, 
               <br />
               is the great object which the government 
               <br />
               desires to attain, and if it be attained, then 
               <br />
               the chief object of local government is at— 
               <br />
               tained. And whether it be under the' name 
               <br />
               of territorial organization or provincial or— 
               <br />
               ganization, is of secondary moment. It. is 
               <br />
               fair matter for consideration, whether we 
               <br />
               should press an immediate and urgent de— 
               <br />
               mand upon this parliament, for provincial

               <br />
               larger and very rapid increase of population, 
               <br />
               whether we should wait until that increase 
               <br />
               of population should entitle us to still bet- 
               <br />
               ter terms. The area under the jurisdiction

               Mr. SPROULE. I mean that instead of 
               <br />
               giving this money by way of loan, we should 
               <br />
               take into account the very exceptional needs 
               <br />
               of the territories and give a subsidy to suit 
               <br />
               their requirements from time to time, not to 
               <br />
               give it in the shape of a loan, which would 
               <br />
               be regarded as a debt.
