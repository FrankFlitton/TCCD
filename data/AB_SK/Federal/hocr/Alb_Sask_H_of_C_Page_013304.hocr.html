               <br />
               Mr. Mercier. The politics of Mr. Mercier are dis— union in the Bill of the member for North Simcoe 
               <br />
               cussed in the Legislature three months, and every (Mr. McCarthy). It is an insult to nearly half the 
               <br />
               day of the year in the press, and some persons population of Canada; it contains false principles; 
               <br />
               hold that he is very good, while others say that and,unfortunately, theGovernment,to a certain ex— 
               <br />
               he is very bad. The hon, member for North Sim- tent, yield to it. The Bill is unjust to the half- 
               <br />
               coe, however, imagines that in two words he will breeds, because it takes away from them vested 
               <br />
               condemn that hon. gentleman in the face of the rights granted to them by this Parliament in the 
               <br />
               universe. I only wish he would meet Mr. Mercier Act of 1877. If you give a man a hundred dollars, 
               <br />
               on the stump, and then the hon. member for North you have no right to take twenty dollars back

               <br />
               that Mr. Mercier is guilty of half the sins <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> This Bill, if adopted, would be 
               <br />
               with which he is charged. Mr. Mercier has done unfair to the half-breeds, to whom we owe much, 
               <br />
               more for the good of his country since he because through them we have been enabled to 
               <br />
               has been in power than the hon. gentleman make treaties with the Indians and to enter peace- 
               <br />
               will ever be able to do harm. I now come to ably into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest.</span> I have documents here,

               <br />
               the preamble of the Jesuit Bill. The preamble of proposed by the member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               the Jesuit Bill was a recital of facts and nothing McCarthy) is that we should take away their lan-
