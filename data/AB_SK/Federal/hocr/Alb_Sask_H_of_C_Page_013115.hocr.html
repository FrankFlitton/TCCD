               Sir RICHARD CARTWRIGHT. Whether a beneﬁt or 
               <br />
               not, it was the duty of the Government to inform them- 
               <br />
               selves that this was an important measure, and to bring it 
               <br />
               down at the proper time. I do not think it is possible that 
               <br />
               suﬂicient <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> can be given to the Bill, unless the

               case, the practice of bringing down a Government Bill four 
               <br />
               days before the time the Government declare it was their 
               <br />
               desire to adjourn is a practice which cannot be deiended on 
               <br />
               any precedent or ground whatever, except that of extreme 
               <br />
               urgency, in which case we would not desire to fetter the

               Sir JOHN THOMPSON. It is not usual to oppose a 
               <br />
               Bill on the ﬁrst reading; and I think my hon. friends 
               <br />
               opposite have been unduly alarmed at the word “ consolida- 
               <br />
               tion ” which my hon. colleague used in presenting this Bill. 
               <br />
               The fact is that the amendments he proposes to make in 
               <br />
               the North-West Territories Act are few and simple. He 
               <br />
               stated them. I think, as being only three. It will be 
               <br />
               desirable to have the three Acts relating to the North-West 
               <br />
               Territories—not the whole legislation, as the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               for Quebec (Mr. Laurier) has said, relating to the North- 
               <br />
               West—consolidated, as they would be by passing this 
               <br />
               Bill, because that would avoid an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">incoherent</span> kind of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> which it would be very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> for the North 
               <br />
               West Legislature to administer. But, as I have said, the 
               <br />
               amendments are very simple, and I think, when the Bill is 
               <br />
               printed and laid before hon. gentlemen, they will not ﬁnd 
               <br />
               it so formidable or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">requiring.</span> so much attention as the word 
               <br />
               “ consolidation ” seems to lead them to imagine. I do 
               <br />
               not think we are Open to the reproach of delaying this Bill 
               <br />
               until within the last four days of the Session. There is 
               <br />
               not, on either side, the slightest idea that the House will 
               <br />
               close before the end of next week at the earliest, and, if the 
               <br />
               task of consolidating these three Statutes is too formidable 
               <br />
               a one, it may be thought desirable that legislation should be 
               <br />
               conﬁned to the amendment of the Acts at this Session. I 
               <br />
               think, however, that the Bill should be new advanced a 
               <br />
               stage, and laid before the House, so that it may see whether 
               <br />
               it is of such a formidable character as is supposed.
