            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCMULLEN.</span> I desire to say a few words 
               <br />
               upon this very important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> It has been 
               <br />
               several times before Parliament; on several oc- 
               <br />
               casions we have discussed the whole uestion with 
               <br />
               regard to the dual language in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Torth-lVest,</span> 
               <br />
               and also in regard to separate schools. N ow, for 
               <br />
               many years back the question of separate schools, 
               <br />
               not only in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> but in some of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces, has caused a great deal of 
               <br />
               strife and bitterness, and has given considerable 
               <br />
               trouble to the Government, and to members of 
               <br />
               Parliament generally in dealing with it. For my 
               <br />
               part, had I been in the House at the time the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“’est</span> Act was passed, I do not think I 
               <br />
               would have given my sanction to a full-ﬂedged 
               <br />
               system of separate schools being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established,</span> in 
               <br />
               that country. My impression is that under the 
               <br />
               circumstances it was imprudent. At the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> 
               <br />
               time, we know well that in Ontario where 
               <br />
               separate schools have been in existence for many 
               <br />
               years, the Catholicpopulation of that province, as 
               <br />
               was stated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by,</span> the hon. gentleman who moved this 
               <br />
               motion, have not taken advantage of that system 
               <br />
               in many cases, and we ﬁnd that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they,</span> are sending 
               <br />
               theirchildren in increased numbers to the common 
               <br />
               schools. Now, I do not think that it is an easy mat-‘ 
               <br />
               for to wipe out by law anythin that was looked 
               <br />
               upon as a privilege by a certain c ass of the commun- 
               <br />
               ity ; I have never read, in fact, where such a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privi-</span> 
               <br />
               lege has been abolished by arbitrary enactment of this 
               <br />
               kind. People belonging to the Catholic faith have 
               <br />
               certain conscientious convictions of their Own; they 
               <br />
               claim that it is their rightand their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty.</span> to give 
               <br />
               their children a certain amount of religious educa- 
               <br />
               tion in connection with secular education. I do 
               <br />
               not wish for a moment to challenge their convic- 
               <br />
               tions upon that point. The fact of the matter 
               <br />
               is, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myyhumble</span> opinion, we are going too far at 
               <br />
               the present day, in our educational institutions, in 
               <br />
               the direction of secularism. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁer</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'frommy</span> hon.

               <br />
               if we had a little more religious instruction in our 
               <br />

               <br />
               favour such a curriculum in our common schOols as 
               <br />
               would allow every class to take advantage of them. 
               <br />
               If our Catholic people object to their children 
               <br />
               attending such a school, I would rather a thousand 
               <br />
               times consent to separate schools than to abolish 
               <br />
               religious teaching altogether. That is my view 
               <br />
               with regard to separate schools. Now, I am quite 
               <br />
               willing, as I said before, to coax our Catholic 
               <br />
               friends out of the use of these schools, and to in- 
               <br />
               duce them to come in with the rest of the com- 
               <br />
               munity and educate their children along with ours. 
               <br />
               If they are not willing, however, to do so, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ifythey</span> 
               <br />
               claim, as they have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right,</span> to do, the privilege of 
               <br />
               educating their children in their own schools and 
               <br />
               teaching them certain dogmas of their own church, 
               <br />
               I do not wish fora moment to deprive them of that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right.</span> I would claim that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right'myself,</span> and am 
               <br />
               willing to accord it to them. Now, let us look at 
               <br />
               the condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“</span> things in some of the states that 
               <br />
               have been referred to by my hon. friend. I think 
               <br />
               the school population of the State of New York is 
               <br />
               about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">8004”)</span> between the ages of ﬁve and sixteen. 
               <br />
               I have heard it stated on good authority that200,~ 
               <br />
               000 of these children never attend a Sabbath school, 
               <br />
               never receive any religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               family, and, perhaps, never hear the word God 
               <br />
               mentiOned unless in profanity. Now, these parents 
               <br />
               have no desire to send their children to a Sabbath 
               <br />
               school or to any place where they would get 
               <br />
               religious instruction. \Vould it not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a,</span> 
               <br />
               hundred times better if these children got a 
               <br />
               sprinkling of religious instruction in the common 
               <br />
               school rather than none at all? What a magniﬁ-
