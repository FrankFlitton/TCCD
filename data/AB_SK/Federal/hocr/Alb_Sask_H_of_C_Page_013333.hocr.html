               <br />
               courts. They had thought that this was a matter which 
               <br />
               had better be left to the Council in question. He regret- 
               <br />

               impossible to get the measure through at this late period

               The action taken by the Senate would add very cousider-

               <br />
               English or French, and, if the proceedings were to 
               <br />
               published in the most prevalent language, Cree should be 
               <br />
               chosen for the purpose.” 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With</span> these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">observations</span> the amendments were 
               <br />
               concurred in without any objections being made, 
               <br />
               so far as I have been able to see, by any hon. Incin- 
               <br />
               ber on the ﬂoor of this House ; and I was either 
               <br />
               present or ought to have been present, and I there- 
               <br />
               fore share in the blame attachable to the proceed- 
               <br />
               ings on that occasion. Then, I think it was in the 
               <br />
               year 1880, this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> Territories Act was 
               <br />
               again dealt with, and again we ﬁnd this clause, 
               <br />
               which I venture to call an objectionable clause ; 
               <br />
               and I believe that on that occasion also it was 
               <br />
               passed through both Houses of Parliament without 
               <br />
               objection being made by any hon. member on either 
               <br />
               side of the House. And ﬁnally, last Session, in 
               <br />
               the proposition submitted to us by the Government 
               <br />
               in the Bill then brought down, the same clause is 
               <br />
               to be found ; and although the Bill did not advance 
               <br />
               very far, so far as it did go, no objection appears 
               <br />
               to have been made to the clause. N ow, Sir, all 
               <br />
               this may appear, perhaps, to form some good 
               <br />
               reason against the proposition I have now the 
               <br />
               honor to make. I venture to think, however, that 
               <br />
               that is not so. The enactment in question is as 
               <br />
               follows :—— 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “Either the English or the French language maybe 
               <br />
               used by any person in the debates of the said Council, and 
               <br />
               in the proceedings before the courts, and both those lan- 
               <br />
               guages shall be used in the records and journals of the 
               <br />
               said Council, and the ordinances of the said Council shall 
               <br />
               be printed in both those languages.” 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I venture to say that if a constitution were 
               <br />
               framed for a new country, it would never occur to 
               <br />
               any person to do so foolish a thing as to stipulate 
               <br />
               for two ofﬁcial languages. I venture to think that, 
               <br />
               with the knowledge which there is on the subject 
               <br />
               at this time, it never would occur to any person 
               <br />
               that it was a proper thing to create or perpetuate, 
               <br />
               as the case might be, two official languages ; and 
               <br />
               yet practically that was what was done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-W’est</span> Act. What is the explanation, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, of this extraordinary piece of legislation, 
               <br />
               which appears to have been assented to by the 
               <br />
               House on three or four different occasions without 
               <br />
               objection on the part of any one ‘.’ It is not to be 
               <br />
               found in the Treaty of Cession, although a very 
               <br />
               large number of persons seem to be under the 
               <br />
               impression that by the treaty negotiated at the 
               <br />
               time this countr was ceded to the British Crown, 
               <br />
               the right of the nguage was guaranteed to the 
               <br />
               French. As I say—and the fact cannot be too 
               <br />
               widely known or too often repeated—that is not 
               <br />
               so. The mistake is one which very generally pre- 
               <br />
               vails ; and on looking at articles on this subject— 
               <br />
               articles by very learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men—J</span> have been sur— 
               <br />
               prised that this statement has been very generally 
               <br />
               made and very generally accepted. But there is

               the Quebec Act. That Act went a good deal 
               <br />
               further than the treaty, as we all know. The treaty 
               <br />
               guaranteed to the French people their religion, and 
               <br />
               that so far as the laws of Great Britain permitted ; 
               <br />
               but the Quebec Act went much further. It re- 
               <br />
               stored to them their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laws—~the</span> civil laws to which 
               <br />
               they had been accustomed ; and it restored to their 
               <br />
               church certain rights and privileges which are enj oy- 
               <br />
               ed to this day ; but it dealt not with this question 
               <br />
               of language. Well, the next stage Would be per- 
               <br />
               haps in 1791, when the Province of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               was constituted ; and at the time of the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion of that Province the language was not dealt 
               <br />
               with either ; though very shortly afterwards, it is 
               <br />
               perfectly true as an historical fact, the French 
               <br />
               members of the Assembly then constituted did 
               <br />
               claim the right, and enforced the right, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to‘use</span> their 
               <br />
               language ; and I believe the proceedings were car- 
               <br />
               ried on in both languages in that Assembly—how- 
               <br />
               ever, not by any statute law, or by anything more 
               <br />
               than a resolution of the Assembly, which had a 
               <br />
               perfect right to so resolve and so act. Well, we 
               <br />
               come down to the time of the Rebellion and the 
               <br />
               Real Union of the Provinces in 1840 by the Act of 
               <br />
               that (late ; and there, so far from the lang-

               who was sent out here to investigate the causes of

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rebellion—a</span> report which was recognised on

               ment, a clause was introduced into the Union Act 
               <br />
               of 1841 by which the use of the French languagewas 
               <br />
               absolutely prohibited instead of being permitted.

               subject is a clause prohibiting the use of the 
               <br />
               French language. That was followed in the Par-

               liament of the United Provinces by an Address 
               <br />

               <br />
               was repealed. Now, Sir, I come down to 1867, to

               <br />
               the permission is restricted to this Parliament and
