               <br />
               to exercise that power. This Parliament can wait, 
               <br />
               and it will be time enough, when it is asked to 
               <br />
               make a constitution and laws for the different 
               <br />
               Provinces which may be established there, to con- 
               <br />
               sider the circumstances of the Territories and the 
               <br />
               Provinces to be established, and to see then whether 
               <br />
               it is advisable that the two languages should be 
               <br />
               preserved, or to provide that only one language 
               <br />
               shall be used. At present, I ask what great harm 
               <br />
               is the dual language doing to the N <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orth-VVest</span> Ter-

               ritories? Let all hon. gentlemen who have taken 
               <br />
               the other side of this question or have listened to 
               <br />
               the speeches of the promoter of the Bill, and the 
               <br />
               other hon. gentlemen made both in and outside of 
               <br />
               this House, let all those who may have felt excited 
               <br />
               because it was held out to them that a great wrong 
               <br />
               and injustice was being done to their fellow country- 
               <br />
               men in this matter, consider this question. The other

               day my hon. friend from North Bruce (Mr. McNeill) 
               <br />
               said he was willing to go a long distance to meet the 
               <br />
               views of his French fellow-citizens, but he was not 
               <br />
               willing to sacriﬁce his own ﬂesh and blood. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce of his own ﬂesh and blood is he asked to 
               <br />
               make? I ask this House and the people of this 
               <br />
               country, who have studied this question and who 
               <br />
               may be somewhat excited in regard to it, what 
               <br />
               sacriﬁce of the hon. gentleman’s ﬂesh and blood is 
               <br />
               made by leaving the constitution of the North- 
               <br />
               VVest Territories such as it is, until this Parliament 
               <br />
               is called upon to divide those Territories into Pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and make a constitution for each Province ‘2 
               <br />
               It simply leaves them in those Territories the 
               <br />
               liberty, if they desire, to use the two languages. 
               <br />
               They are not forced to use the French language. 
               <br />
               The English speaking people there are not obliged 
               <br />
               by law to learn that language, or to use it in the 
               <br />
               Legislature or to study it. They may use the 
               <br />
               English language if they will. There is no com- 
               <br />
               pulsion. Then, what great harm is it to them ‘3 
               <br />
               And, further, they are not even called upon to pay 
               <br />
               for the translation of the public documents into 
               <br />
               the French language. Then, where are they in- 
               <br />
               jured, where are their rights and privileges 
               <br />
               interfered with, because the law says that those 
               <br />
               who desire to do so may use.the French language 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“Est</span> Council, or that their public 
               <br />
               records shall be printed in both languages? Does 
               <br />
               that do any harm to them, or take away from 
               <br />
               them any right ‘3 If this matter is looked at calmly 
               <br />
               and in a proper spirit, it will be seen that this pro- 
               <br />
               vision does no harm to anyone, takes away no 
               <br />
               privilege, imposes no hardship, and does not make 
               <br />
               the English speaking population do what they do 
               <br />
               not wish to do. If it should have the effect of dif-

               fusing more knowledge amongst some part of the 
               <br />
               population of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“7est</span> Territories, would it 
               <br />
               not be of some beneﬁt to them to have these docu-

               and this is a point which I strongly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelw-that</span> this 
               <br />
               time is inopportune; that this discussion should

               not have been raised either in the country or in the 
               <br />
               House on the question, because the time has not

               <br />

               <br />
               any Provinces which may be created there. If the

               leaders on both sides were to come together and 
               <br />
               adopt some common basis of amendment or motion 
               <br />
               which, although, perhaps, it might not be in 
               <br />
               entire accord with my views, would restore

               assumptions which are to be deduced from the

               to say that they entertain no hatred to the French 
               <br />

               <br />

               enough to say that they wish them no harm ; but

               I ask any unprejudiced man who has followed the 
               <br />
               speeches which have been made in this House, or

               tirely different state of things. These hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle</span> 
               <br />
               men have not brought forWard any proof in this 
               <br />
               House or in the country to justify that state- 
               <br />
               ment. I would ask on what particular question, 
               <br />
               since 1867, have the French people united 
               <br />
               on a matter of this kind? They have not 
               <br />
               united in any vote in this House or in any 
               <br />
               election in this Dominion. Look at the last general 
               <br />
               elections for the Dominion. There are some 45,000 
               <br />
               French people in Nova Scotia, and there is not one 
               <br />
               representative of that nationality from that Pro- 
               <br />
               vince in this House. Is that any evidence of their 
               <br />
               uniting in order to get inﬂuence and power to use 
               <br />
               it to the detriment of the English speaking people 
               <br />
               of this country? In Prince Edward Island, the 
               <br />
               population is not so lar e as in Nova Scotia. I 
               <br />
               think the population is a. ut 109,000 or 110,000,
