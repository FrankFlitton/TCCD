               The hon. Minister of Justice argued that 
               <br />
               chapter twenty-eight of thirty-four and ﬁve 
               <br />
               Victoria was a doubt removing Act. 
               <br />
               That is probably not an inapt expression. 
               <br />
               But what doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">didnit-</span> remove? It did not we-

               move any doubt upon the question We are 
               <br />
               debating. I did not pretend to say, for in- 
               <br />
               stance, that this subsection 4 would no long- 
               <br />
               er apply. It removed a doubt as to the 
               <br />
               particular matter being dealt with in the 
               <br />
               Act. The very fact that it had removed 
               <br />
               that doubt showed that there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Was</span> a doubt

               even then with the authorities in Great

               Britain as to whether the parliament of

               think that Act does anything but indirectly
