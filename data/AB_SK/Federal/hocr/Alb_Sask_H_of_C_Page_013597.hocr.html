               I understood the Minister of Justice to 
               <br />
               say, in answer to a question by the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition (Mr. Borden) that, under 
               <br />
               the Order in Council that had been passed 
               <br />
               it would be competent for the representation 
               <br />
               of the province of Quebec to be reduced to 
               <br />
               any number. If that is so, it he can, by 
               <br />
               an Act of parliament approved by Order 
               <br />
               in Council by the imperial government, re- 
               <br />
               duce the representation in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, why cannot he do the same thing 
               <br />
               under the statute which gives power for the 
               <br />
               entry into confederation of the terri- 
               <br />
               tory known at that time as Prince 
               <br />
               Rupert’s Land? The only difference 
               <br />
               is in the heading, and that cannot 
               <br />
               affect the case—let it be called Prince 
               <br />
               Rupert’s Land or Quebec, the effect is the 
               <br />
               same. There is another thing which, I say 
               <br />
               with all due deference, the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice forgot when giving the opinion which 
               <br />
               was spoken of in the House this afternoon. 
               <br />
               He forgot the well-known rule of law 
               <br />
               with regard to the repeal of statutes. Every 
               <br />

               Now, with the indulgence of the House 
               <br />
               let us apply this principle to the case before 
               <br />
               us. Here we have an Act showing how the 
               <br />
               calculation of representation is to be made 
               <br />
               as between these four provinces. The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice says that this is by impli- 
               <br />
               cation repealed. He does not contend that 
               <br />
               there has been an express repeal, nor does 
               <br />
               the right hon. mover (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) of the second reading of the Bill. 
               <br />
               But, because certain Orders in Council, 
               <br />
               which have the effect of statutes as provided 
               <br />
               for in the Act, have, or are said to have a 
               <br />
               certain effect, therefore, you must, by im- 
               <br />
               plication read into section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4</span> ‘seven’ instead 
               <br />
               of ‘four,’ and apply it to seven provinces 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead</span> of four, or you are not giving the 
               <br />
               smooth and easy construction required for 
               <br />
               the purposes of this Bill. But the authority 
               <br />
               I have quoted makes it clear that if we can 
               <br />
               find a construction of the two which is con- 
               <br />
               sistent with the non-repeal of the earlier 
               <br />
               statute, we must accept that interpretation. 
               <br />
               That is why we say that the Act must have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               the meaning that we give it. \Vc preserve 
               <br />
               intact the provision with regard to the one- 
               <br />
               twentieth, and we give full force and effect 
               <br />
               to the Orders in Council which the minister 
               <br />
               refers to. The fact is, there was a business 
               <br />
               going on with these four provinces as 
               <br />
               partners. The other provinces wanted to 
               <br />
               come in, and were asked to come in. An 
               <br />
               arrangement mutually satisfactory was 
               <br />
               made for them to enter the partnership. it 
               <br />
               is contended, therefore, that there should not 
               <br />
               be the same construction of the bargain 
               <br />
               among the four as between themselves that 
               <br />
               there would have been if the others had not 
               <br />
               entered. The better interpretation of the 
               <br />
               law is that the new provinces should be 
               <br />
               held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the bargain that they made. leaving 
               <br />
               the other bargain intact, and so there was 
               <br />
               no repeal.
