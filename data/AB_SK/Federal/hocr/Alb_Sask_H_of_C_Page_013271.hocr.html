               other our French Canadian citizens will become

               Anglo-Saxon. Now, I do not know Whether he

               means Anglo-Saxons of America or Anglo-Saxons 
               <br />
               of England. A great many attempts have been 
               <br />
               used, by promises and threats, and even by force, 
               <br />
               to make the French Canadians Yankees, but they 
               <br />
               have all failed, and I do not think that by legis-

               <br />
               important to us, is, that by proper and fair treatment 
               <br />
               we can keep the French people of this country true 
               <br />
               and loyal Canadians, loyal to the only form of 
               <br />
               Government which we have in Canada, the 
               <br />
               Government of Canada by Canadians, under the 
               <br />
               name of the Sovereign Lady, around whose 
               <br />
               throne the free people of England also govern 
               <br />
               themselves. There is no country under the 
               <br />
               sun in which fanaticism in politics or bigotry 
               <br />
               in religion is more dangerous than in Canada. 
               <br />
               Our materials are most inﬂammable, and it is not 
               <br />
               only culpable, but it is indeed a political crime for 
               <br />
               any public man to set the spark to that inﬂam- 
               <br />
               mable material. We must frown down fanaticism, 
               <br />
               whether it be shown on the ﬂoor of this House or on 
               <br />
               the streets of Hull, for if it be allowed to take its 
               <br />
               course, this country would not only be an im- 
               <br />
               possible one to govern, but an unﬁt one to live

               view of the feeling which has been aroused in

               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House—«necessarily</span> aroused, as I have shown—— 
               <br />
               and in view of the fact that there was no real 
               <br />
               pressing grievance to be remedied by this legisla— 
               <br />
               tion, that there was no outcry from the North-

               <br />

               <br />
               proceedings in French; this question could have 
               <br />
               Well been left in abeyance. I will not say 
               <br />
               that the whole thing originated with my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, for he says it did not, but I know that if 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman did not cause the petition to 
               <br />
               be sent from the North-West Council, it was, at all 
               <br />
               events, not sent until after he visited the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories. I think the origin of the trouble 
               <br />
               may be very naturally traced to the same source 
               <br />
               as the origin of the trouble we are now dealing 
               <br />
               with in this House. The grievance in the North- 
               <br />
               West Territories was a small one, an inﬁnitesimal 
               <br />
               one, and I think it might have been borne with a. 
               <br />
               little longer rather than that bitter feelings should 
               <br />
               have been aroused. I think We could have waited

               is not one French Canadian in it. The ﬁne con- 
               <br />
               stituency which I represent is largely English and 
               <br />
               Protestant, but at the same time it is largely liberal, 
               <br />
               and I shall be very much disappointed if the broad 
               <br />
               and liberal sentiments which I am tryin to express

               <br />
               English-speaking Protestants of my riding, which 
               <br />
               is in the heart of the great Province of Ontario. I 
               <br />
               do not hope to catch votes, nor am I afraid of losing 
               <br />
               votes by the course which I take. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">While</span> I may

               ture to make an appeal to my French fellow

               such as that contained in the amendment of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice, without alarm. Although 
               <br />
               they may not like everything that is in that propo- 
               <br />
               sition, they have no ground for alarm, in my

               towards them by the majority on both sides of this

               them not to ask for anything unreasonable, or for 
               <br />

               Mr. WHITE (Renfrew). At this stage of the 
               <br />
               debate, and after the many lucid and able argu- 
               <br />
               ments that have been advanced on both sides, I 
               <br />
               cannot hope to add anything to the information of 
               <br />
               the House, or to interest it on this question to any 
               <br />
               degree. Nor, Sir, would I have ventured to 
               <br />
               have said a word were it not that I do not 
               <br />
               Wish to record a silent vote upon the question 
               <br />
               now before the House. In the debate that has 
               <br />
               taken place during the last ﬁve or six days, I 
               <br />
               have been struck with the great unanimity 
               <br />
               with which hon. members who opposed the pro- 
               <br />
               position of my hon. friend from North Simcoe (Mr. 
               <br />
               McCarthy) have opposed, not the Bill itself, but 
               <br />
               the preamble with which that Bill has been intro- 
               <br />
               duced. It has been stated by many hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men who have spoken upon this question, that the 
               <br />
               Bill itself was an innocent measure, but that its 
               <br />
               preamble is one calculated to excite the feelings of 
               <br />
