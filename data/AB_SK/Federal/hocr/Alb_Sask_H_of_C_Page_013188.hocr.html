               <br />
               Then, take the case of England. It is notorious 
               <br />
               that the Celts in the west did not fuse with 
               <br />
               the rest of the population of the island, and 
               <br />
               during several centuries that circumstance was 
               <br />
               a source of weakness, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">embarrassment,</span> and 
               <br />
               a clog upon England. If the Celts, and Anglo- 
               <br />
               Saxons, and Normans had not mingled in 
               <br />
               England and formed one race, but lived as separate 
               <br />
               races in England to-day, does anyone suppose that 
               <br />
               England would occupy the place among the nations 
               <br />
               of the world which she does occupy? Take the case of 
               <br />
               Scotland. Is it not notorious that the Highlanders 
               <br />
               of Scotland did not amalgamate with the Low- 
               <br />
               landers, and is it not a fact that that was a source 
               <br />
               of weakness to that country ‘3 Sir Walter Scott, 
               <br />
               who knew the nature of Scotchmen as well as any 
               <br />
               man who ever lived, perfectly expresses the feel- 
               <br />
               ings of the Highlanders of Scotland when he puts 
               <br />
               into the mouth of a typical Chieftain the words 
               <br />
               with which we are all familiar : 
               <br />
               “ The stranger came with iron hand 
               <br />

               <br />
               And then, after giving a magnificent picture of the 
               <br />
               barren fastnesses into which they were driven, he

               Sir, it is notorious, as I say, that those words re- 
               <br />
               present the sentiment of the Highlanders of Scot— 
               <br />
               land, as maintained for very many generations, 
               <br />
               and that it is only within comparatively recent 
               <br />
               days that that unfortunate feeling of distrust and 
               <br />
               dislike between these races has died away ; 
               <br />
               and I venture to say that anyone who knows the 
               <br />
               circumstances of that country is prepared to 
               <br />
               endorse what I say when I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“assert</span> that nothing 
               <br />
               has more contributed to that better and 
               <br />
               happier condition of things which now exists 
               <br />
               than the more general use of the English 
               <br />
               language in the Highlands of Scotland. Take 
               <br />
               the case <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> France. Will anyone say that if 
               <br />
               France <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> were not inhabited by the great and 
               <br />
               homogeneous people that she has, but were in- 
               <br />
               habited by the Celts and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gallo~Romans,</span> Iberians, 
               <br />
               Franks and Norsemen—each preserving their own 
               <br />
               institutions, usages and individuality, and speak- 
               <br />
               ing their own language, she could be the great and 
               <br />
               powerful and stable nation she is to-day ? And so 
               <br />
               I believe that here in Canada, if our races were 
               <br />
               amalgamated, we should be stronger than we are 
               <br />
               at the present moment. We all know that our 
               <br />
               French Canadian friends have many qualities 
               <br />
               characteristic of their race, great and good quali- 
               <br />
               ties, which are not characteristic of the race to 
               <br />
               which we belong ; and I think we may say, on the 
               <br />
               other hand, that we have good qualities character- 
               <br />
               istic of our race which are not so highly developed 
               <br />
               Mr. MCNEILL.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               in theirs ; and I think we may fairly conclude that 
               <br />
               if there were a blending of the races, that blend- 
               <br />
               ing would be beneﬁcial to both ; but in any case it 
               <br />
               cannot be doubted that it would add to the 
               <br />
               solidarity of the Dominion. Then, I think, there 
               <br />
               can be no question of the correctness of the assertion 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend, that this perpetuation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> 
               <br />
               languages has a tendency to keep races apart and 
               <br />
               to preserve and maintain race distinctions ; and 
               <br />
               the other proposition, the reverse of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that/“though</span> 
               <br />
               I cannot go so far as some of the quotations which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend read taken by themselves would 
               <br />
               seem to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go—appears</span> to me to be perfectly cor- 
               <br />
               rect also, that the use of one language is a 
               <br />
               wonderful solvent of race distinctions. It further 
               <br />
               seems to me to be self-evident, that the enforcing 
               <br />
               by statutory enactment, so far as statutory enact- 
               <br />
               ment can enforce it, the use of distinct languages 
               <br />
               has a tendency to perpetuate a plurality of lan- 
               <br />
               guages, and to prevent the advance throughout the 
               <br />
               population of. any one of those languages which has 
               <br />
               a natural tendency to become dominant. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               all these propositions I believe to be true and unas- 
               <br />
               sailable ; but I hope no hon. gentleman in this 
               <br />
               House, whether he be amongst my French 
               <br />
               Canadian friends or amongst my English-speaking 
               <br />
               friends, will for one moment suppose that because 
               <br />
               I hold these propositions to be true, I also believe 
               <br />
               that the dual language should not have been per- 
               <br />

               And I venture to think that it would be well if 
               <br />
               that rooted conviction of the greatest political 
               <br />
               thinker Britain ever produced, was also the rooted 
               <br />
               conviction of some of our theoretical political 
               <br />
               philosophers of the nineteenth century. It no 
               <br />
               more follows that because we think it would be 
               <br />
               to the advantage of Canada that we should have 
               <br />
               one homogeneous race here, that because we think 
               <br />
               that our races would more speedily become homo- 
               <br />
               geneous if one language only were used, we would

               <br />
               Chamber who would say that when Canada passed 
               <br />

               <br />
               of their mother tongue should have been denied to 
               <br />
               the gallant defenders of their soil. Is there any 
               <br />
               man who will say that on the day when Montcalm 
               <br />
               fell on the Plains of Abraham there should have

               passed away forever from his compatriots the 
               <br />
               right to the freest and fullest use of that tongue 
               <br />
               which they had learned at their mother’s knee, 
               <br />
               which is interwoven with the very threads of 
               <br />
               life, which is inseparably connected with every 
               <br />
               joy and sorrow, with every emotion, with every 
               <br />
               thought, from infancy to the grave ? I venture to 
               <br />
               say that no one will say so, and I venture to say 
               <br />
               that any such treatment of the vanquished would 
               <br />
               have been nil-English and unjust, would have 
               <br />
               been tyrannical and cruel. I will go further and
