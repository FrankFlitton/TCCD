               in view of the troubles that have taken place ini 
               <br />
               other provinces, I think we should be very careful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> 
               <br />
               in dealing wit-h this subject here. If there is any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span> 
               <br />
               one principle more than anotherby which we should 
               <br />
               be governed it is that principle that we have ac- 
               <br />
               knowledged, the principle which We have in every

               whether at the time that this Act was written 
               <br />
               this provision for educational powers was over~

               <br />
               very few words upon it. I am satisfied that this 
               <br />
               Bill meets with general approbation in the North- 
               <br />
               \\'est <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'licrritories,</span> and I shall raise no discussion 
               <br />
               with regard to the stand that my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Muskoka (Mr. O’Brien) takes in reference to it; 
               <br />
               but I will say this : That this question of education 
               <br />
               is one on which there is very little said in the 
               <br />
               North-West 'l'erritories, and had it been included 
               <br />
               in this Bill I, for one, would have stood up for separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools. You may say that ever since the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NorthJVest</span> has been the No1'tli~\\'cst, and in fact 
               <br />
               when it was originally settled, the ﬁrst schools that 
               <br />
               ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Were.</span> established there were Catholic schools, and 
               <br />
               I cannot myself see why we should take any rights 
               <br />
               away from these peo )le which they had. I believe 
               <br />
               in fair-play the world over. Even if the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics are now in a minority, there is no reaSon 
               <br />
               why the majority should dictate to them, and say : , 
               <br />
               You shall not have what was granted to you when ' 
               <br />
               you firSt came into Confederation, as we might say. I 
               <br />
               There will be time enough when we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">divit</span> ed into

               <br />
               to discuss this question. Then, if we are to have 
               <br />
               a new constitution it will be good and seasonable 
               <br />
               time to discuss this question. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but.</span> at the present 
               <br />
               time I say : Let it alone. Now, with regard to 
               <br />
               the provisions of section 2 of the Bill now before 
               <br />
               the House. That section provides that there shall I 
               <br />
               be twenty-twomembers in the Legislative Assembly, 
               <br />
               but when the Bill comes up in the Committee I 
               <br />
               shall move that the number be increased to twenty- 
               <br />
               five members. “"e have had taken from us three 
               <br />

               saying that we should have two additional mem- 
               <br />
               bers in that district. “’hen in 1888 the proportion 
               <br />
               of the members was granted it was taken from the 
               <br />

               <br />
               proper estimate by the last census, it is only 
               <br />
               fair that. we should take the same proportion 
               <br />
               now as was taken three years ago—~that is, by 
               <br />
               number of names on the. voters’ list. If 
               <br />
               the division was fair, then it is fair now. 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that in Alberta there were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">6,492</span> on the 
               <br />
               voters’ list, and that divided by six would give 
               <br />
               1.08:3 voters which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each</span> member in the district. of 
               <br />
               Alberta represented. In Assiniboia, cast and west, 
               <br />
               there were 7,255 names,which. for eleven members, 
               <br />
               would give each a representation of 659 voters, as 
               <br />
               against 1,082 for Alberta. Now, I am only asking 
               <br />
               for two members, which will leave me still to the 
               <br />
               good, with each member representing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">816</span> voters in 
               <br />
               Alberta as against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iii’illin</span> Assinihoia. Ithink I have 
               <br />
               a just claim in asking for these two additional 
               <br />
               members, and if there were a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">redistrilmtirm</span> accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the number of names on the voters' list at 
               <br />
               the present time I think Alberta would be entitled 
               <br />
               to four members instead of two. I may say that I 
               <br />
               have heard no complaints from any portion of 
               <br />
               Alberta with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regardito</span> the clauses of this Bill. 
               <br />
               They have not even found fault with the represen- 
               <br />
               tation, as they thought I would look after that 
               <br />
               myself. i have my schedule drawn out in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refer-</span>

               debated at such length, and with, as I thought, 
               <br />
               unnecessary warmth, the subject of the introduction 
               <br />
               into the North-West of any provision with respect 
               <br />
               to education. My hon. friend to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">left:</span> spoke 
               <br />
               about this subject as if an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attempt.</span> were heingmade 
               <br />
               to interfere directly or indirectly with the rights 
               <br />
               which are secured by compact to the Province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, the Province of Ontario and the Province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba. I do not understand that any in- 
               <br />
               timation was given in that direction, and if it was, 
               <br />
               it certainly should not, so far as I understand the 
               <br />
               question. have any sympathy or support from me. 
               <br />
               I think those rights are suﬁiciently guaranteed by 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, and I have not 
               <br />
               heard that any agitation exists in any of those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces for thepurpOSe of having any of those rights 
               <br />
               interfered with. I would not have said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a.</span> word on 
               <br />
               this Bill except for the remarks made by these hon.

               by the silence of one or all of its members from 
               <br />
               expressing its views when those territories are 
               <br />
               erected into provinces. M y opinion is now, and 
               <br />
               has been for years, that when that time comes you
