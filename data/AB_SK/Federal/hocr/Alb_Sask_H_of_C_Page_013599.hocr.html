               Now, with the indulgence of the House, 
               <br />
               I shall urge but one objection to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argu&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               ments advanced by the opposition. They 
               <br />
               pretend that a contract or partnership has 
               <br />
               been entered into, but the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               was also one of the contracting parties. It 
               <br />
               should be borne in mind that the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec agreed to having a ﬁxed repre- 
               <br />
               sentation of sixty-ﬁve members, but it is 
               <br />
               but fair that it should be given a compensa- 
               <br />
               tion, and that the other provinces should 
               <br />
               have their representation reduced. It is 
               <br />
               a policy of give and take. That was a 
               <br />
               well understood principle from the very 
               <br />
               outset. as shown by subsection 2 of section 
               <br />
               51 which says: 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               There shall be assigned to each of the other 
               <br />
               provinces such a. number of members as will 
               <br />
               bear the same proportion to the number of its 
               <br />
               population (ascertained at such census) as 
               <br />
               the number 65 bears to the number of the

               So, if there was anything in the minds of 
               <br />
               the fathers of confederation it was that 
               <br />
               representation was to be based on popula- 
               <br />
               tion. Such was the principle adopted at the 
               <br />
               time. Quebec was to have sixty-five members 
               <br />
               and the other provinces were to be given a 
               <br />
               proportionate number. Such was the system 
               <br />
               adhered to by the framers of confederation.

               The hon. member of Lincoln (Mr. Lan-

               caster) has also referred to the interpreta- 
               <br />
               tion of treaties. But he should not forget 
               <br />
               that treaties must be interpreted as against 
               <br />
               the stipulating party. Now, it is agreed that 
               <br />
               as the province of New Brunswick has not 
               <br />
               the required population, it cannot rightly 
               <br />
               claim more members than the number which 
               <br />
               the government contemplate allotting to the 
               <br />
               province. Were the matter open to doubt 
               <br />
               the province should not be given, the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the doubt; but, on the contrary, 
               <br />
               the treaty should be construed conformably 
               <br />
               to common law, that is to say, in favour of 
               <br />
               the main clause of the contract, instead of 
               <br />
               the exception.

               It is with a good deal of diﬂidence that I

               approach the discussion of this question. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman stated in intro-

               ducing this Bill that it was his intention to 
               <br />
               bring in a measure which would be sub-

               mitted to both parties in this House to 
               <br />
               agree upon. He stated that he was following 
               <br />
               English precedent, and especially the doc- 
               <br />
               trine laid down by him and his followers 
               <br />
               when they were in opposition, when they 
               <br />
               declared that if they had an opportunity of 
               <br />
               introducing a Redistribution Bill it would 
               <br />
               be drawn on those lines and would be 
               <br />
               perfectly fair, a Bill which ought to be 
               <br />
               acceptable to all parties in the House. The

               Bill introduced by the right hon. gentleman

               and his statement in introducing it led me

               to believe that the Bill would be submitted

               ing the Bill to the House. The principle 
               <br />
               adopted in England has been set forth by 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. 
               <br />
               He has shown that the English Bill was the 
               <br />
               result of a conference, which consisted on 
               <br />
               behalf of the opposition of Lord Salisbury 
               <br />
               and Sir Stafford Northcote. They met time 
               <br />
               and again in the Privy Council. The 
               <br />
               question that arose was as to the number of 
               <br />
               members which should be assigned to Eng- 
               <br />
               land, the number to Scotland and the num- 
               <br />
               ber to Ireland. They also had to decide the 
               <br />
               principle as to whether a suburban popula- 
               <br />
               tion should be attached to a rural popula- 
               <br />
               tion, and they decided the principle that a 
               <br />
               suburban population should be attached to 
               <br />
               the cities and an urban population should 
               <br />
               remain with the counties. The conference 
               <br />
               decided upon all the leading principles of 
               <br />
               the Bill, they ﬁxed the unit of representa- 
               <br />
               tion for England, for Scotland and for Ire- 
               <br />
               land, the unit for the counties and the unit 
               <br />
               for the cities ; all the leading principles of 
               <br />
               the Bill were agreed upon by the conference, 
               <br />
               and then it was referred to the committee 
               <br />
               for the purpose of delimiting the various 
               <br />
               ridings. As my hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition stated, that committee con- 
               <br />
               sisted of gentlemen from different sections 
               <br />
               of the country. They had as asistants ofﬁ- 
               <br />
               cers of the Royal Engineers, and they made 
               <br />
               a delimitation to which no objection could 
               <br />
               possibly be taken. If I understand the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman, he intends that a con- 
               <br />
               ference, composed of members whom he 
               <br />
               may select and whom the opposition may 
               <br />
               select, should settle the principles which 
               <br />
               should be adopted in the delimitation of the 
               <br />
               different constituencies. That is perfectly 
               <br />
               fair, we were perfectly willing to accept that 
               <br />
               proposition. Viewing the conference as re- 
               <br />
               presenting the principles laid down by the 
               <br />
               opposition in 1892, as interpreted by the 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Davies, by the Hon. Mr. Mills 
               <br />
               and by Mr. Dalton McCarthy, it was to be 
               <br />
               a conference designed to come to a mutual 
               <br />
               agreement, the same as the English con- 
               <br />
               ference in 1884, which settled the principles 
               <br />
               upon which the delimitation was to take 
               <br />
               place. The right hon. gentleman in intro- 
               <br />
               ducing this Bill is ﬁxing the number of re— 
               <br />
               presentatives for the different provinces. I 
               <br />
               suppose he does not intend on the second 
               <br />
               reading to include that principle. As I under- 
               <br />
               stood him, the question as to whether we 
               <br />
               are to have a reduced representation in 
               <br />
               Ontario is to be left with the Supreme 
               <br />
