               Simcoe which has already been answered. 
               <br />
               but with respect to which I wish again to 
               <br />
               put the view we take; because it would be 
               <br />
               a point of the greatest importance it‘ the 
               <br />
               argument of the hon. gentleman were well 
               <br />
               founded. The hon. gentleman stated that 
               <br />
               one important reason why the system of 
               <br />
               separate schools in the Territories should 
               <br />
               be abolished. and abolished at once, was that 
               <br />
               by allowing it to remain we were riveting 
               <br />
               the system on the future provinces : and the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman relied on the provision of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, which says : 
               <br />
               that nothing in the Act of any province—- 
               <br />
               and he was referring to the provinces which 
               <br />
               might hereafter be established—should take 
               <br />
               away or prejudicially affect any right or 
               <br />
               privilege with respect to denominational 
               <br />
               schools which any class of persons have. by 
               <br />
               law. in the province at the time of the Union. 
               <br />
               The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman’s</span> argument, of course. 
               <br />
               was that if this system were allowed to 
               <br />
               stand until provinces are created, we would, 
               <br />
               by force of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               be unable to withdraw that system, and that 
               <br />
               it would be riveted on the provinces. As has 
               <br />
               been shown by the hon. member for Both- 
               <br />
               well. the provisions of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act relate only to the provinces 
               <br />
               which were entering into the Union at that 
               <br />
               time. and to the provinces which were named 
               <br />
               in the last section of the Act as entitled 
               <br />
               to be admitted into the Union, and have no 
               <br />
               relation whatever to the provinces which are 
               <br />
               to be created out of the Territorial district 
               <br />
               of the connt1v. That is clearly seen when 
               <br />
               we come to the British statute of 1871. 
               <br />

               of our territories, and, as the hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior has said, enables this Par- 
               <br />
               liament to decide what the constitutions of 
               <br />
               those provinces shall be. We claim, there- 
               <br />
               fore, that the constitutional system which 
               <br />
               was established with regard to schools and 
               <br />
               with regard to language in 1875 ought to 
               <br />
               be maintained for the same reasons as 
               <br />
               those which dictated its creation, and that 
               <br />
               this condition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂairs</span> should last. at least. 
               <br />
               while the affairs of the Territories are under 
               <br />
               the control of this Parliament. What the 
               <br />
               constitution of the future provinces shall 
               <br />
               be. in view of the pledges which have been 
               <br />
               referred to, or in view <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> any other set of 
               <br />
               circumstances, will be for Parliament to 
               <br />
               decide when it decides to create those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. I hope, therefore, that the House 
               <br />
               will be careful to—day not to disturb the 
               <br />
               arrangement- so wisely made in 1875, and 
               <br />
               which is as useful to the Territories now 
               <br />
               as it was then.
