               <br />
               to the nations it had subdued by its armies. 
               <br />
               In Sicily, where important Greek settlements had 
               <br />
               fallen into its power, a regular persecution was 
               <br />
               organised against the language, the customs, 
               <br />
               the opinions of the conquered. It succeeded 
               <br />
               in making of them irreconcilable enemies 
               <br />
               who rose against it at the hour of danger. Rome, 
               <br />
               on the contrary, courted the sympathies of the 
               <br />
               Greeks whom she had conquered. She encouraged 
               <br />
               the study of their language; she preserved their 
               <br />
               laws, respected their customs, their religion, their 
               <br />
               schools. The result of the two policies is written 
               <br />
               in history. Carthage was destroyed, when every- 
               <br />
               thing seemed to promise her success and domina- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the world and to her name an everlasting glory. 
               <br />
               What Carthage did, the Normans attempted in 
               <br />
               England after the conquest. There again the per- 
               <br />
               secution saw the victims victorious in the long 
               <br />
               struggle, and England was founded, to continue the 
               <br />
               traditions, the success and the glory of the Roman 
               <br />
               Empire. If the proud and magic “Civis Sum 
               <br />
               Romanus ” has had a rival in the talismanic “ I 
               <br />
               am a British subject,” it is due, in a great meas- 
               <br />
               ure, to the liberal and generous policy of Eng- 
               <br />
               land, more than to the fear of her military power. 
               <br />
               The founder of the German Empire, Frederick 
               <br />
               the Great, understood the advantages which the 
               <br />
               conservative principles of the Catholic religion 
               <br />
               could give him in the Catholic provinces which 
               <br />
               he had subdued. He protected his new subjects 
               <br />
               in spite of the narrow-minded advisers who pre- 
               <br />
               dicted that the court of Vienna Would be served, 
               <br />
               in its intrigues, by the protection given to the 
               <br />
               Catholics of Silesia. The great emperor took no 
               <br />
               heed of those short-sighted counsels. In one of 
               <br />
               his letters I read these memorable words : 
               <br />
               “ Emperor Joseph continues his work of secular- 
               <br />
               isation without interruption. Here everybody 
               <br />
               remains as he was. I respect the rights of posses- 
               <br />
               sion, upon which society is founded.” And his 
               <br />
               Catholic provinces of Silesia remained faithful to 
               <br />
               him. Examples of the same kind are to be found 
               <br />
               in the history of all the great nations of Europe, 
               <br />
               where union began under the warm and beneﬁcial 
               <br />
               inﬂuence of generosity and forbearance, leaving

               to have been guilty of such a cruel <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anachronism.</span> 
               <br />
               Why, Mr. Speaker, leaving the largest pos~ 
               <br />
               sible margin for the shortcomings, nay, the 
               <br />
               faults of a part of our clergy—and I am ready 
               <br />
               to admit that such amargin can be made use of—I 
               <br />
               aﬂirm, without fear of contradiction, that no more 
               <br />
               admirable and uninterrupted succession and tradi— 
               <br />
               tion of loyalty and devotion to the British Crown 
               <br />
               can be traced than to the history of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic Episcopacy of Lower Canada. I say, 
               <br />
               hoping that my words are not'unparliamentary, 
               <br />
               that no more undeserved, no more unwarranted 
               <br />
               slander was ever written than the page of our 
               <br />
               H <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">award</span> where those unfortunate utterances of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Norfolk are recorded. Disloyal 
               <br />
               and selﬁsh, the bishops of Quebec ! Who refused 
               <br />
               and repudiated the tempting offers, not of the 
               <br />
               Americans alone, but of the French generals Whom 
               <br />
               the Catholic King of France had sent to assist the 
               <br />
               thirteen colonies in their rebellion against England? 
               <br />
               Was he disloyal, Mr. Speaker, the eminent Metro— 
               <br />
               politan of Quebec, who ordered a. Thanksgiving day 
               <br />
               to be observed, a solemn Te Deum to be sung in honor 
               <br />
               of the victory of Trafalgar, won by Nelson over 
               <br />
               the French forces, and who, in his pastoral letter, 
               <br />
               speaking of the reverse of the French arms, said 
               <br />
