               <br />

               <br />
               are to be found in any section of the Dominion; 
               <br />
               and I ﬁnd that in the same measure that we respect 
               <br />
               their rights, feelings, opinions, and prejudices 
               <br />
               even, will they be found to respect ours. And just 
               <br />
               here, Sir, I would say that the true friends of the 
               <br />
               minority in the Province of Quebec are not those 
               <br />
               who, for any reason, seek to stir up religious or 
               <br />
               racial prejudices on the one side or the other, and 
               <br />
               that about the most dangerous foes we of that 
               <br />
               minority have to dread are those, from without the 
               <br />
               Province, who busy themselves discovering griev- 
               <br />
               ances which we do not feel to be such—0r, perhaps, 
               <br />
               of which we know nothing,——and for which they 
               <br />
               are ever ready to prescribe heroic treatment. I 
               <br />
               would warn such to leave us to ourselves, for we 
               <br />
               are quite capable of protecting our own interests. 
               <br />
               And, for one, I have conﬁdence enough in their 
               <br />
               sense of fair play and justice, to believe that, if left 
               <br />
               to the free exercise of their own impulses, the 
               <br />
               French Canadian majority will do all that in them 
               <br />
               lies — by legislation or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">otherwise—«</span> to render 
               <br />
               our position still more pleasant and secure. 
               <br />
               The French Canadians are, as a rule, quite as 
               <br />
               tolerant as their neighbors; and, at times, I am 
               <br />
               forced to the conclusion that in some things they 
               <br />
               are, perhaps, even a little more so. In illustration 
               <br />
               of this I would like to refer brieﬂy to my own 
               <br />
               personal experience with them in public life ; and 
               <br />
               my statement may, perhaps, prove a revelation to 
               <br />
               many to whom the idea of French domination is 
               <br />
               such a terrible bogey. Notwithstanding that about 
               <br />
               two-thirds of the electors of the County of Chateau- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,guay</span> are French Roman Catholics, that con- 
               <br />
               stituency has been represented in the Parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada for 30 years by English Protestants, my 
               <br />
               late father and myself. In my own three elections, 
               <br />
               my opponents were Roman Catholics; yet, in no 
               <br />
               instance was there any attempt on the part of 
               <br />
               residents of the county to raise the race or religion 
               <br />
               cry against me, and I have yet to learn of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               vote in any of these contests that was influenced 
               <br />
               by such considerations. I am naturally very proud 
               <br />
               of this record of my electors; but I must go still 
               <br />
               further, and say that, since I have enjoyed the 
               <br />
               honor of a seat in this House, no French Canadian 
               <br />
               priest or layman has ever intimated to me, directly 
               <br />
               or indirectly, the faintest whisper of a suggestion 
               <br />
               as to the course it might he wished I should pursue 
               <br />
               on any public question whatsoever. Having re- 
               <br />
               peatedly sent me here as their representative, 
               <br />
               without exacting pledge or promise, they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> left 
               <br />
               me absolutely to the exercise of my own discretion 
               <br />
               and best judgment. I am, of course, aware that 
               <br />
               my remarks have been a little aside the question

               make any reference to the short Bill which has been 
               <br />

               fallen from the lips of the hon. members of this

               <br />
               which has been aroused since last year. When the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy), 
               <br />
               the other evening, denied that he should be styled 
               <br />
               an agitator, I believe he did not say exactly What 
               <br />
               was correct, for anyone who peruses the speeches 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman has made on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> occa— 
               <br />
               sions must see that the expressions he used in 
               <br />
               those speeches are proof that he is the principal pro- 
               <br />
               moter of this agitation. I have. in my hand a copy 
               <br />
               of a speech delivered by him in the city of Ottawa 
               <br />
