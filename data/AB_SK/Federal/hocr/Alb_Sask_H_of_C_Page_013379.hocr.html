               ment that they should consider sub-section ‘2. The 
               <br />
               next is a very useful sub-section, and will meet a 
               <br />
               difficulty which occurred in Calgary, but this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub</span> 
               <br />
               section will work in this way : The Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly is to have power to determine by an or- 
               <br />
               dinance where a deputy sheriff may be appointed. 
               <br />
               and then it is provided that each sheriff “shall 
               <br />
               appoint a deputy or deputies at such places within 
               <br />
               the district ” as are determined by the Legislative 
               <br />
               Assembly. I think the sheriff in Regina has juris~ 
               <br />
               diction as far as Moose Jaw in the west. and as far 
               <br />

               <br />
               Station, and Moose Jaw will be represented by an- 
               <br />
               other member. Each of these places will urge the 
               <br />
               Assembly to pass an ordinance compelling the sheriff 
               <br />
               to appoint a deputy, so that you will have three de- 
               <br />
               puties. Speaking subject to correction, I believe that 
               <br />
               all over the Dominion the sheriff is only obli red to 
               <br />
               have one deputy, but here you put this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">burden</span> on 
               <br />
               the sheriff at Regina, who is not paid within one- 
               <br />
               tenth as much as most of the sheriffs throughout 
               <br />
               the Dominion. This will reduce his income, and 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior, who knows the North- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\\~'est</span> Well, knows what the scanty income of the 
               <br />
               sheriffamounts to. It will reduce the income of 
               <br />
               the sheriffs to such a small sum that you cannot 
               <br />
               get a respectable man to take the office. Let me 
               <br />
               point. out, further, that you are making a provision 
               <br />
               here for the deputy sheriff giving bonds. The sheriff 
               <br />
               has given bonds; he is to be responsible for him-

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">])E\\'I)NEY.</span> I have had a communication 
               <br />
               from the sheriffin my district since this Bill was 
               <br />
               printed, and he did not appear to object to the 
               <br />
               power of appointing deputies. but he did ask that 
               <br />
               the deputy should be compelled to give security. 
               <br />
               There is no particular object in that which I can 
               <br />
               see. I suppose the sheriff could take security 
               <br />
               from his deputy when be appointed him.

               Mr. DE\\'I)NEY. No representation has been 
               <br />
               made to me, but I understand there have been re- 
               <br />
               quests made for more judicial districts. There 
               <br />
               was a difficulty in getting different processes and 
               <br />
               taking out registration papers, and they wanted 
               <br />
               more judicial districts, which meant more judges 
               <br />
               and a full court. That was thought to be advis-

               able, bnt that if it was found necessary, in the

               Mr. FLINT. I think there is a great deal of 
               <br />
               weight in what the member for Assiniboia (Mr. 
               <br />
               Davin) says. I think that it is almost too hard 
               <br />
               upon sheriffs to compel them to appoint deputies. 
               <br />
               I also observe here that the Legislative Assembly 
               <br />
               is given power to prescribe the duties of the 
               <br />
               deputies. I should think it would be better 
               <br />
               that each sheriff should appoint a deputy, leav- 
               <br />
               ing it to be inferred that the powers of the 
               <br />
               deputy are the usual powers of a deputy 
               <br />
               under the common law, or under any law of this 
               <br />
               Parliament. But here we give a legislative body 
               <br />
               power to confer powers upon deputies, which may 
               <br />
               possibly differ from the owers of the sheriffs them- 
               <br />
               selves. There is no detmition. in this Act of the 
               <br />
               powers of the sheriffs and clerks, and I think 
               <br />
               we are going out of our way to allow the Legisla- 
               <br />
               tive Assembly to deﬁne the powers of deputies
