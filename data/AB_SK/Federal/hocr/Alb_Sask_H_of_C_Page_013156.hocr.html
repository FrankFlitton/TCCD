               member for North Simcoe (Mr. McCarthy). Imay

               believe that I am entitled to feel at home in this

               <br />
               to show the disadvantage of the dual language has 
               <br />
               quoted to us part of the report of Lord Durham 
               <br />
               or of Mr. Buller as we may choose. It has 
               <br />
               already been read by the hon. the Minister 
               <br />
               of Public Works and I will not cite it, but 
               <br />
               it was quoted by the hon. gentleman (Mr. Mc 
               <br />
               Carthy), to show that there was a struggle between 
               <br />
               the two races at that time. I say, Sir, that it is 
               <br />
               not a fair argument, and that it does not give afair 
               <br />
               idea of the actual situation in this country. But 
               <br />
               if we go back to this time, what do we see that the 
               <br />
               French people were ﬁghting for ‘2 They were 
               <br />
               ﬁghting for their love of British institutions. They 
               <br />
               were ﬁghting to obtain their rights, and as a result 
               <br />
               of that ﬁght, they ﬁnally succeeded in obtaining 
               <br />
               responsible Government. It was no wonder that 
               <br />
               Lord Durham found the people a little excited at 
               <br />
               that time, but the quotation does not represent the 
               <br />
               situation of the country either then or at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time. To show the inconvenience of the dual 
               <br />
               language, the hon. gentleman (Mr. McCarthy), has 
               <br />
               cited certain extracts from the newspapers or 
               <br />
               magazines. I may say that I believe the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman in his researches for the truth, was 
               <br />
               sincere, but I also say, that if he had the intention 
               <br />
               of misleading this House, he could not have sought 
               <br />
               information from better sources to attain this 
               <br />
               object. One of his quotations was the following, 
               <br />
               which I will read with your permission :— 
               <br />

               “ ‘ We are Englishmen speaking the French language,’ 
               <br />
               said the late Sir George Cartier, the colleague and close 
               <br />
               personal friend of Sir John A. Macdonald. Before this he 
               <br />
               was the undis uted leader ofthe French Canadian element 
               <br />
               in Canada : three years later he was unmercifnlly beaten 
               <br />
               at the polls for Montreal East by an obscure young 
               <br />
               lawyer by the name of Jetté. The crushin defeat was 
               <br />
               the French Canadian way of punishing Sir eorge for his 
               <br />
               ultra-loyal speech and the misrepresentation it embodied. 
               <br />
               Not that French Canadians are not well affected to the 
               <br />
               Empire as things go ; onl it must be understood they 
               <br />
               are well affected as Frenc Canadians.”

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I say, Sir, that this extract, as well as the other 
               <br />
               which has been cited by the hon. gentleman, is a 
               <br />
               tissue of falsehoods. We all know very well—and 
               <br />
               it does not take a very long memory to recall the 
               <br />
               facts of the election between Sir George Cartier 
               <br />
               and the Hon. Mr. Jetté. I may say, by the way, 
               <br />
               that Mr. J etté was not an obscure lawyer and this 
               <br />
               is one of the ﬁrst falsehoods in the quotations. 
               <br />
               Mr. J etté was one of the leading barristers of the 
               <br />
               Province of Quebec and very shortly after he was 
               <br />
               made a judge of the Superior Court and he has 
               <br />
               added honor to the bench in the administration of 
               <br />
               justice. This, however, only shows the sources 
               <br />
               from which the hon. gentleman has taken his 
               <br />
               imormation. The defeat of Sir George Cartier 
               <br />
               cannot in any way be assigned to the reasons 
               <br />
               which are mentioned in that article. Gentlemen 
               <br />
               from Montreal know exactly the cause of that 
               <br />
               defeat, and if I recollect well the terminus of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway had something to do 
               <br />
               with it,and Sir George Cartier had,besides,perhaps, 
               <br />
               a little quarrel with some high dignitaries of the 
               <br />
               church, which helped to bring about that result. 
               <br />
               His defeat was in no way connected with the

               most str1 ing and curious things in the soclal life of 
               <br />
               Lower Canada is the latent hate which the French and 
               <br />
               English-speaking races have for each other. It is a sad 
               <br />
               thing to say, but truth requires that it should be said, 
               <br />
               that English-speaking people, no matter whether they 
               <br />
               are English Irish or Scotch, have rarely a good word for 
               <br />
               their French neighbors; and it is still sadder and more 
               <br />
               unaccountable that of all those English-speaking eople, 
               <br />
               the Irish are those between whom and the Frenc there

               seems to be the least rapport and the greatest enmity.” 
               <br />
               This was written in 1885, and although I am not 
               <br />
               an old man, I can give evidence upon this point, 
               <br />
               and I can, from my own knowledge, declare that 
               <br />
               this statement is a complete falsehood; I live in 
               <br />
               Arthabaska, surrounded by the Counties of 
               <br />
               Megantic, Drummond and Richmond, where there 
               <br />
               is a mixed population, and which counties are 
               <br />
               fair sample of the condition of things existing in 
               <br />
               counties inhabited by people of different races. I 
               <br />
               speak from experience, when I say that 
               <br />
               there are no better friends than the English 
               <br />
               and the French in my section of the country. 
               <br />
               I know as a practicing lawyer that when there are 
               <br />
               discussions or quarrels, they are not betWeen Eng- 
               <br />

               <br />
               between English among themselves and French 
               <br />
               among themselves ; and that statement Will be cor-

               roborated by every member who resides in those 
               <br />
               sections of the country. It will be corroborated 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Stanstead (Mr. Colby), the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Compton (Mr. Pope), and the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Richmond (Mr. Ives) ; in fact, 
               <br />
               Sir, by all the members who represent what are 
               <br />
               called English counties, in which there is a mixed 
               <br />
               population. This was given as an argument to 
               <br />
               show the great inconvenience of the dual languages, 
               <br />
               and when we come to examine the facts, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that they turn the hon. gentleman’s argument 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> himself. The hon. gentleman has spoken 
               <br />
               o the Hon. Mr. Mercier, and he has told us that 
               <br />
               he represented the opinions and feelings of his 
               <br />
               countrymen. I presume, Sir, that is not altogether 
               <br />
               admitted by hon. gentlemen on the other' side of 
               <br />
               the House. However, I say that the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man could not ﬁnd any argument there ; what he 
               <br />
               brought as an argument would, in that instance, 
               <br />
               turn against him also. Mr. Mercier did not re- 
               <br />
               ceive a very strong support in the English

               counties in the general election of 1886; but 
               <br />
               since that time the Protestant and English 
               <br />
               minority in the Province have manifested their 
               <br />
               approval of the course of Mr. Mercier on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion; and if Mr. Mercier, under 
               <br />
               provocation, has not always measured his 
               <br />
               words, in his legislation he has given entire 
               <br />
               satisfaction to the English minority. I go 
               <br />
               further, and I say that he has given them 
               <br />
               their full share of the patronage and favors, 
               <br />
               and I am glad he has done so, and I think 
               <br />
               that in every Province the minority should 
               <br />
               be treated in a particularly considerate manner. 
               <br />
               Now, when Mr. Mercier came before the people in 
               <br />
               1886 what was the result in the County of Megan- 
               <br />
               tic, for instance? He was in Opposition at that 
               <br />
               time, and the candidate opposing his policy, Mr. 
               <br />
               Johnson, was returned by a majority of 280. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(The</span>
