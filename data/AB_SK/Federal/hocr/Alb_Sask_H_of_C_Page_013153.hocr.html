            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Well, Mr. Speaker, the kindness of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman surpasses anything I could have 
               <br />
               imagined. He is so good; he is so kind; he 
               <br />
               would have wished to choke us, not by any harsh 
               <br />
               means, not by any aggravating measures, but only 
               <br />
               by a choking process. That is all. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman must know that the French Canadians 
               <br />
               have contributed, and do contribute, largely, and 
               <br />
               within their means, and according to their num- 
               <br />
               bers, to the prosperity of this country. They-do 
               <br />
               it in their own way. They do not do it in English; 
               <br />
               they do it in French. I wonder if an act done in 
               <br />
               French is not as good as if it were done in 
               <br />
               English. I wonder if the hon. gentleman, when 
               <br />
               he gives something to charity, or puts some money 
               <br />
               on the plate on Sunday, for the poor, does not as 
               <br />
               good an act as my hon. friend, on the other side, 
               <br />
               who speaks French. The hon. gentleman may 
               <br />
               be sure that the day will come, when he speaks 
               <br />
               French, when he will see that I am right. I am 
               <br />
               convinced that he is learning French now. He is 
               <br />
               now against us because he does not know French, 
               <br />
               because he does not understand the acts of our 
               <br />
               people ; he does not know what literature we 
               <br />
               have; he cannot read it, he cannot appreciate it, 
               <br />
               he cannot understand it, and, therefore, we must 
               <br />
               forgive him a great deal on account of that 
               <br />
               ignorance, a word which I do not use in any bad 
               <br />
               sense, but in reference to his ignorance of that 
               <br />
               language. The hon. gentleman says that, if such 
               <br />
               a policy had been pursued as he indicates, it would 
               <br />
               have made the French Canadians speak English. 
               <br />
               That is what he wants to do now, but this we will 
               <br />
               not allow him to do, to adopt a principle that may be 
               <br />
               used afterwards from one end of the Confederacy 
               <br />
               to the other. That Will not be allowed. I am 
               <br />
               sure the large majority of this House do not in- 
               <br />
               tend to break this Confederation into two or three 
               <br />
               parts. They do not intend to destroy this 
               <br />
               country. This hon. gentleman speaks of uniting 
               <br />
               the country; he says he wants a united people all 
               <br />
               speaking the same language ; and yet he is doing 
               <br />
               his best to divide this country, to divide us as to 
               <br />
               races, to put the French and Catholics on one side, 
               <br />
               and the Protestants on the other side. He will not 
               <br />
               succeed in that attempt. I know a great many 
               <br />
               Protestants who will not agree to that, and I know 
               <br />
               many Catholics who will not allow it. If we intend 
               <br />
               to prosper in this country, and to see our institu- 
               <br />
               tions succeed, we must be united, and we must not 
               <br />
               be quarrelling as we have been for the last few 
               <br />
               days, and must not divide our people by races. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman thinks that by his Bill he is 
               <br />
               destroying us. He will see, before many days or 
               <br />
               many hours are over, that his little scheme has the 
               <br />
               contrar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect,</span> that it is uniting us on both sides 
               <br />
               of the case against him, that it is nnit' us as 
               <br />
               one man. And what good will that do? that 
               <br />
