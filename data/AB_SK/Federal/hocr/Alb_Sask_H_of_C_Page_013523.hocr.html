               ernment towards our legislative assembly was of 
               <br />
               late years most unfriendly. Year after year, the

               chairman of the executive journeyed to Ottawa

               Territories before the Government, and year after

               year these just claims were contemptuously dis- 
               <br />
               regarded. The assembly appealed time and again 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lfor</span> some deﬁnite subsidy, to do away with the

               <br />
               does not appear any evidence, from the 
               <br />
               Queen’s Speech or from the Estimates now

               before us, that there is an intention of doing
