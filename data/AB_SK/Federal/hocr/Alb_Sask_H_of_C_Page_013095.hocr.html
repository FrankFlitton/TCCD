               licy, and I condemned it as a bad policy. But I say that the 
               <br />
               act of its being a bad policy does not always relieve you 
               <br />
               from your obligation that you entered into, which obligation 
               <br />
               you must carry out,even though it is under a bad policy. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, it is not a good thing to drink champagne, for instance. 
               <br />
               If you drink enough of it, and drink it often enough, it 
               <br />
               will tear your liver to pieces. But if a man who is fond 
               <br />
               of champa ne were to order some from Mr. Bate, and then, 
               <br />
               when Mr. ate sent the bill, he were to sit down and write 
               <br />
               to him and say : “ Dear Sir, drinking champagne is a mis 
               <br />
               take; it is bad for the liver; it is not conductive to general 
               <br />
               health; I have given up drinking champagne and as a mat- 
               <br />
               ter of principle I won’t pay your bill.” Why, what would 
               <br />
               Mr. Bate say to him ? He would say, “ You are under 
               <br />
               obligation to pay. and I will hold you to it.” Well, I will 
               <br />
               not trouble the House with the letters, but I have letters 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here</span> from a number of these men who say they came in 
               <br />
               here having before their eyes pamphlets in which this 
               <br />
               very North-West Act of 1883 was quoted ; they came 
               <br />
               in here with that promise of a second homestead playing 
               <br />
               on their wills, and what did they ﬁnd ? Why, they 
               <br />
               had scarcely fulﬁlled the conditions for getting a second 
               <br />
               homestead- three years it takes; on the 25th of May 
               <br />
               the clause was put in and it requires three years 
               <br />
               to perfect the conditions to get a second homestead; 
               <br />
               and on the 2nd June, 1886, the second homestead was done 
               <br />
               away with. They, of course, point out what a very unjust 
               <br />
               thing it is. You see how irritating it is to those who came 
               <br />
               in, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">188i,</span> 1885 and 1886. The men who came in from the 
               <br />
               25th May, 1883, or before, up to the 2nd June, 1884, could 
               <br />
               go, owing to the change that my hon. friend the late Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Interior made, and get a second homestead. The 
               <br />
               principle has been acknowledged. But men who came in in 
               <br />
               1885 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1886,</span> with this same Act on the statute-book, 
               <br />
               cannot get a second homestead, because, as I tell you, the 
               <br />
               amendment that I was able to effect in 1887 only went the 
               <br />
               one year. Last year I did not bring it up, fora lamentable 
               <br />
               reason—because we had lost the man who had been such an 
               <br />
               ornament to this House. It may be said—I know that 
               <br />
               arguments of this kind are sometimes used—that this was 
               <br />
               permissive. I will say this for the late Minister, that he 
               <br />
               never attempted to press that objection ; but I will call the 
               <br />
               attention of the Minister of Interior to the argument on 
               <br />
               that head. The 37th clause of the Dominion Lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> 
               <br />
               1883, reads as follows :—

               head is entirely removed. If we look at section 2, chapter

               was taking away, not a possibility of getting a second 
               <br />
               homestead at the discretion of the Minister, but taking 
               <br />
               away a right which it acknowledges in express terms. It 
               <br />
               is hardly necessary to take up the time of the House with 
               <br />
               the second branch of the second homestead question, be- 
               <br />
               cause the Minister can deal with that administratively. 
               <br />
               But I will say this, as I have pointed out before, that I can 
               <br />
               see no advantage and no magic in the six-mile limit, and I 
               <br />
               pointed out, when I had the honor of an interview with the 
               <br />
               Minister of Interior when I ﬁrst came down, that one of the 
               <br />
               best settlers north of Peuse, Joseph Young, who has cul- 
               <br />
               tivated every acre of his homestead and preemption 
               <br />
               cultivatable, has next to him a cancelled homestead, but he 
               <br />
               cannot enter on it. It would be a very desirable thing for 
               <br />
               him if he could do so, for he has two stalwart sons and a 
               <br />
               family, and he is one of our best farmers. He came into the 
               <br />
               country with nothing and he is a well-to-do man to-day, and in 
               <br />
               no year, not even in 1886, did he fail to have a crop; he has had 
               <br />
               a crop every year, but he is a thoroughpaced farmer and is a 
               <br />
               ﬁrst-rate man. He cannot, however, homestead that can- 
               <br />
               celled homestead adjoining his own, and what is the use of 
               <br />
               his going away? He is forty-ﬁve years old and does 
               <br />
               not want to go away six miles. But that, I repeat, 
               <br />
               is a matter which can be dealt with administratively, and 
               <br />
               so I will not trouble the House further with it beyond 
               <br />
               calling attention to a petition I have here which was pres- 
               <br />
               ented to the Minister. It was sent to him by a large num- 
               <br />
               ber of agricultural societies, urging this question of second 
               <br />
               homesteading, and also urging that time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> give for pay- 
               <br />
               ment of pre-emptions. I will say this, as I said to the 
               <br />
               farmers, that I think there is no need of their being very 
               <br />
               anxious about their being allowed time. So far as my 
               <br />
               experience of the department goes, no bona ﬁde farmer has 
               <br />
               ever been pressed for his pre-emption paymentif he could 
               <br />
               show that he was going along in a bona-ﬁde manner. I 
               <br />
               have always found that Mr. Smith, and the department here, 
               <br />
               the moment they were satisﬁed that the man was a bona 
               <br />
               ﬁde settler, were willing to agree to any reasonable represent- 
               <br />
               ations made, prowded the matter was all right. So I never 
               <br />
               felt nervous in regard to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matzer.</span> I will only add this 
               <br />
               further, that tha farmers around Moose Jaw and elsewhere 
               <br />
               are very anx10us they should be given ﬁve years in which 
               <br />
               to pay for their pre—emptions. I will make a further com- 
               <br />
               ment on this resolution, because there is one clause in it 
               <br />
               with which I do not agree. It reads: 
               <br />
               
            </p>

         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 1742 3006 3123 3132">
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               “ Should it be found necessary in the future to withhold public lands 
               <br />

               <br />
               alternate quarter sections be granted instead of alternate sections." 
               <br />

               So one part of the resolution is, inadvertently, contrary to 
               <br />
               the other. In one part it says that 320 acres are necessary, 
               <br />
               and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">another</span> part it states that alternate quarter sections

               should be given to the railway. I have here a long commu- 
               <br />
               nication that I received this morning from the agricultural 
               <br />
               society of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mouse</span> Jaw, referring to this part of the resolution 
               <br />
               and strongly condemning it,strongly emphasising this view, 
               <br />
               that they require to summer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fallow,</span> to go into mixed 
               <br />
               farming, and that farmers cannot raise crops proﬁtably in 
               <br />
               the North-West unless th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">xy</span> summer fallow. Part of the 
               <br />
               land has to be fallowed this year while crops are 
               <br />
               raised on another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pa.</span> t, and crops should be grown 
               <br />
               this year on land which was summer fallowed last year. 
               <br />
               If you do not adopt that you will not farm successfully, and
