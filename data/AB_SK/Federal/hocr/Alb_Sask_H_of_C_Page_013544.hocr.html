               <br />
               who hold the view that it is yet too early 
               <br />

               the opinion of a very large majority of the

               people when I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say»</span> that the conditions have

               now reached a stage when it would be ad-

               vantageous to those people as well as to 
               <br />
               the entire Dominion, to have this question 
               <br />
               settled without further loss of time. Some 
               <br />
               hon. members may be aware of the fact 
               <br />
               that Within the past two weeks the ques- 
               <br />
               tion has been debated in the local legis- 
               <br />
               lature at Regina, and by a vote of 23 to 7, 
               <br />
               I think, in a House of 31 members, it was 
               <br />
               decided that it was a matter of regret that 
               <br />
               this question had not been taken up and 
               <br />
               an endeavour made to settle it this present 
               <br />
               year. Perhaps, as the House is now in 
               <br />
               Committee of Supply, it may not be a 
               <br />
               proper occasion for me to discuss the pro— 
               <br />
               vincial establishment question at length, and 
               <br />
               there may be another opportunity of doing 
               <br />
               so before the close of the session.

               But I want to point out that until pro- 
               <br />
               vincial powers are granted to the people 
               <br />
               of the North-west Territories, the responsi- 
               <br />
               bility devolves upon this parliament of pro- 
               <br />
               viding for the services which come within 
               <br />
               the purview of the North-west Assembly. 
               <br />
               Those services are much the same as the 
               <br />
               services performed by the various pro- 
               <br />
               vincial governments, with a few minor 
               <br />
               exceptions. The services for which the 
               <br />
               North-west Assembly is responsible are 
               <br />
               the same as those of which the provincial 
               <br />
               governments have charge. We know that 
               <br />
               the various provincial governments have 
               <br />
               deﬁnite and ﬁnal arrangements with the 
               <br />
               federal power as to the amount of money 
               <br />
               they shall receive from the Dominion 
               <br />
               exchequer yearly, and they are themselves 
               <br />
               responsible for performing certain duties. 
               <br />
               But with regard to the North—west Terri- 
               <br />
               tories at the present time, that responsi- 
               <br />
               bility devolves upon this parliament, and 
               <br />
               especially upon the Department of the In- 
               <br />
               terior. In reality the business of governing 
               <br />
               the North—west Territories is but a branch 
               <br />
               of the department in the charge of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior. The services which the 
               <br />
               North-west Assembly performs in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories are just as important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and}</span> 
               <br />
               possibly more so than any of the services 
               <br />
               that are performed by this federal parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. The subjects of education and local 
               <br />
               public works are possibly just as important 
               <br />
               to the people up there as any of the sub- 
               <br />
               jects with which this parliament has to 
               <br />
               deal. As I said, the subjects of legislation 
               <br />
               in the North-west Territories are very 
               <br />
               similar to those dealt with by the various 
               <br />
               local legislatures of the provinces. I will 
               <br />

               been thought wise in that country, where 
               <br />
               the population is yet sparse, and until the
