               change may be made, because I think no change can be 
               <br />
               made that will not be an improvement on the present 
               <br />
               system. During the seven years that I occupied the position 
               <br />
               of Lieutenant Governor, I carried out the duties connected 
               <br />
               with that disagreeable portion of my ofﬁce to the best of 
               <br />
               my ability; and in looking back over those years, I do not 
               <br />
               consider that if I had to perform those duties over again, I 
               <br />
               could perform them with greater justice or conscientious- 
               <br />
               ness than I did. In regard to another important matter 
               <br />
               which has been referred to by my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan</span> (Mr. Macdowall), namely, the appeal made 
               <br />
               on behalf of the half-breeds, I may say that the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment are giving very serious attention to that matter, and 
               <br />
               I am sure that they feel inclined to do all they possibly can 
               <br />
               to carry out the views expressed by my hon. friends from the 
               <br />
               North West. With regard to the appeals also made on behalf 
               <br />
               of the scouts and the Mounted Police who were engaged dur- 
               <br />
               ing the rebellion, for scrip, that is a matter which it appears 
               <br />
               to me should receive the favorable consideration of the 
               <br />
               Government, and I shall exercise what little inﬂuence I 
               <br />
               have to bring about the wishes of my hon. friend. With 
               <br />
               regards to the remarks of the hon. member for North N or- 
               <br />
               folk (Mr. Charlton), I may say that I do not agree with 
               <br />
               him in the views he has expressed with regard to our land 
               <br />
               laws. The hon. member for Selkirk (Mr. Daly) spoke very 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">freely</span> on that subject, when I think my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Norfolk was not in the House, stating that on several occa- 
               <br />
               sions he has diﬂ'ered from the hon. gentleman on the subject 
               <br />
               of our land laws as compared with those of the United 
               <br />
               States. He, as Well as some other hon. members, consider our 
               <br />
               land laws as liberal if not more liberal than those of the 
               <br />
               United States. However, I am not as well acquainted with 
               <br />
               those laws as the hon. gentleman opposite ; but it does 
               <br />
               appear to me very singular that hon. gentlemen should 
               <br />
               differ so much in that respect. One feature of the United 
               <br />
               States land regulations may be more liberal than ours, 
               <br />
               tor while within the railway belt, some 50 to 80 miles 
               <br />
               on each side of the railway, what is known as the 
               <br />
               chequer-board system is adopted, outside this belt a settler 
               <br />
               can homestead on every quarter-section. That may be 
               <br />
               better than our policy, and I do not see how our 
               <br />
               policy can be improved except as suggested by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Marquette (Mr. Watson) by giving land grants 
               <br />
               to railways in alternate townships instead of in alternate 
               <br />
               sections. I agree with him in that entirely, and I may say 
               <br />
               that the Government in dealing with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anywapplication</span> made 
               <br />
               to them are acting upon that View, and in future when any 
               <br />
               land grants are given, they will be given in that way. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Wellington (Mr. McMullen) and 
               <br />
               several other members have diverged a good deal from 
               <br />
               what I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expected</span> would be the line of the debate. That hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman came loaded with ﬁgures which I was not quite 
               <br />
               able to follow, and which I am not able at present to con- 
               <br />
               trovert. I may say that I was also loaded up with ﬁgures, 
               <br />
               but unfortunately I have left my gun behind me. But I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ</span> from the hon. gentleman in the conclusions he has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrived</span> at, and I hope to take some other opportunity of 
               <br />
               glVlng a comparison as to the cost of management of the 
               <br />
               North-West under the present Government with the cost 
               <br />
               during the years the hon. gentleman’s friends were in 
               <br />
               power. I can show him that our management has been 
               <br />
               inﬁnitely more economical than theirs. Now the hon. 
               <br />
               member for South Norfolk stated that he thought that our 
               <br />
               policy had been wrong in not putting up to competition coal 
               <br />
               lauds, pasture lands and timber lands. Well, we have a very 
               <br />
               large coal area, and I am not aware that there is any great 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">flemand</span> or rush for those coal lands, and I do not think that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> they were put up at auction we would derive more beneﬁt 
               <br />
               from them than we do now. It requires very large capital 
               <br />
               to enter into the coal mining enterprise, and for that reason 
               <br />
               there is not avery great demand in that direction. Our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0081</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">area</span> is of immense extent, and the coal is a very

            </p>
            
         </div>

               valuable commodity, which should be carefully handled and 
               <br />
               protected, and in whatever we do our great aim should be 
               <br />
               to have it worked as economically as possible, and get it 
               <br />
               into the hands of the settlers at as cheap a rate as possible. 
               <br />
               I intend to take measures similar to those taken in the 
               <br />
               United States in order to prevent any monopoly of our coal 
               <br />
               deposits, and will bring in an amendment to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> 
               <br />
               when dealing with our Lands Act. With regard to our 
               <br />
               ranche lands, Ido not think, if they were put up at auction, 
               <br />
               we should derive any more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnancial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honoﬁi</span> from them 
               <br />
               than we do The policy, when leases were ﬁrst established, 
               <br />
               was to induce ranchemen to bring capital into the country 
               <br />
               in order to start the cattle industry there. The price 
               <br />
               we have obtained for those leases has not been extravagant, 
               <br />
               but a great many of those who have leases are not paying 
               <br />
               their rent, and I do not think they intend paying it, as they 
               <br />
               do not consider the privileges they derive from their leases 
               <br />
               suﬂicient to induce them to pay their rent. I do not think 
               <br />
               if we were to put those ranches up at auction that we would 
               <br />
               get any greater beneﬁt from them than we do. As regards 
               <br />
               timber limits, no doubt the hon. gentleman knows that for 
               <br />
               some years past they have been put up at competition. 
               <br />
               With regard to the land law generally, in which of late I 
               <br />
               have taken special interest, I feel very much in the same 
               <br />
               way as do my colleagues in the North-West. I am an 
               <br />
               anxious as they are that we should do all we can in the in- 
               <br />
               terest of the settlers. In all new countries, whether mining 
               <br />
               or agricultural, the early pioneer is the one who has to face 
               <br />
               the greatest difﬁculties, and the one we ought to protect 
               <br />
               and assist as much as possible. I was glad to hear from 
               <br />
               the hon. member fr0m Marquette and others that the inter- 
               <br />
               view we had this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">morning</span> in regard to matters generally 
               <br />
               in the N orth-West was satisfactory, and that some 
               <br />
               conclusions I had arrived at were satisfactory to those 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen. I shall be always willing at any 
               <br />
               time to receive their suggestions and do my share 
               <br />
               in bringing about any changes which will be in the 
               <br />
               interests of the settlers. It is hardly the time for me 
               <br />
               to answer the hon. member from North Wellington. I 
               <br />
               may say that my impression is that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂicials‘are</span> not 
               <br />
               overpaid, and I may tell the hon. gentleman that I had this 
               <br />
               morning an appeal from the members of the west who 
               <br />
               waited upon me, and who certainly know What they are 
               <br />
               talking about, to increase the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">salaries</span> of certain ofﬁcials in 
               <br />
               the Nerth-West Territories. I do not think I need <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">detain</span>

               the House longer except to thank my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) for bringing this matter up, and 
               <br />
               giving me an opportunity of hearing the different views of 
               <br />
               hon gentlemen, which will be of great assistance to the
