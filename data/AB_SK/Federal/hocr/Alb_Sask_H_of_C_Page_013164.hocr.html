               nationality and of remodelling many nationalities 
               <br />
               into one? Suppose Austria, which is composed of 
               <br />
               many nationalities, which has Poles, and Czechs, 
               <br />

               convert all these different nationalities into Ger- 
               <br />
               mans, I would like to know how long the Austrian 
               <br />
               Empire would be likely to endure ? In my opinion 
               <br />
               it would not last a year. There can be no doubt 
               <br />
               whatever that the result would be the very reverse 
               <br />
               of establishing a united population. Instead of 
               <br />
               having an empire federated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together.</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> 
               <br />
               nationalities, you would have that empire broken 
               <br />
               into fragments and several independent states 
               <br />
               springing out of its remains. Governments are 
               <br />
               dear to men in proportion as they preserve to them 
               <br />
               what they most dearly prize, and a man must be so 
               <br />
               environed that he must feel that he has laid his 
               <br />
               nationality aside before it case become to him a

               <br />
               the history of Europe when other grounds of union 
               <br />
               were sought than those of nationality, when religion 
               <br />
               was made the basis of political unity and when 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’"every</span> man, who in faith, diﬂ'ered from the established 
               <br />

               <br />
               such, and was denied the ordinary rights of a sub- 
               <br />

               <br />
               countries to-day. James I and Charles I regarded 
               <br />
               unity of religion as necessary to the existence of a 
               <br />

               I need but refer to a few 
               <br />
               instances. At the Cape Colony there are 
               <br />
               two races : the Dutch and the English. 
               <br />
               Both languages are used in the legislature as both 
               <br />
               are used here. In the courts, the law provides 
               <br />
               that the superior court judges may permit the use 
               <br />
               of both languages and that the judges and magis- 
               <br />
               trates of inferior courts must, that the barristers 
               <br />
               and attorneys have the right to use both languages ; 
               <br />
               and it also provides that if one-third of the electors 
               <br />
               in any judicial district ask for the conduct of the 
               <br />
               judicial business of the district in both languages, 
               <br />
               their request must be granted. Then, if you look 
               <br />
               at the Island of Mauritius, that island was without 
               <br />
               a representative government of any sort until 1885. 
               <br />
               The Governor then was authorised by letters 
               <br />
               patent to provide for the election of a council. 
               <br />
               The voters’ list was prepared and the Governor, 
               <br />
               in sending home to the Colonial Secretary a copy 
               <br />
               of that list, tells him that 3,300 on the list are 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics, 4‘50 Protestants, 295 Hindoos

               <br />
               rule which governs. It is held that every man who 15

               a British subject, and entitled to be a voter is en- 
               <br />
               titled to know in the only language he understands 
               <br />
               what his rights are. That is a question of conven— 
               <br />
               ience and it is treated in every instance as a ques-

               regarded as the mark of a British subject par ex- 
               <br />
               cellence. A foreign tongue is not regarded as a 
               <br />
               mark of inferiority, but as an instrument of com- 
               <br />
               munication which the Government have a right to 
               <br />
               use when they can best promote their relations 
               <br />
               with the people by using that language, Whether It 
               <br />

               The hon. gentleman always forgets how very 
               <br />
               slowly a language dies. If you have a large
