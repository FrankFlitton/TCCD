               which we admitted Manitoba, and looking 
               <br />
               at the character of the legislation, I do not

               able at this late hour to occupy the time

               of the House by any attempt to criticise this 
               <br />
               long and very important debate. I desire 
               <br />
               to say this, however, which I think ought to 
               <br />
               be said : that I am not the one who is break- 
               <br />
               ing faith in moving the passage of this am- 
               <br />
               endment. Because in 1875. in the condition 
               <br />
               things were at that time, this separate school 
               <br />
               enactment was passed, on what principle 
               <br />
               can it be said that in 1891- the repeal of that 
               <br />
               clause will be a breach of faith? Surely 
               <br />
               that is not a fair way to put it. This Par—

               <br />
               powers and the authorities that were granted 
               <br />
               to the North-west. and the change in any 
               <br />
               one of these enactments cannot by any fair- 
               <br />
               minded man be characterized as a breach 
               <br />
               of faith. Can any great harm be done to 
               <br />
               any class of people who have gone in there 
               <br />
               and who are permitted to deal with this 
               <br />
               subject in their own Local Legislature ? 1 
               <br />
               am not seeking to deprive any person of 
               <br />
               separate schools; I am not going into that 
               <br />
               argument. I have my own views about 
               <br />
               them, and though I would agree with the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Wellington (Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Mullen) in saying that I would sooner see a 
               <br />
               separate school system than a secular 
               <br />
               system, I see no necessity at all for a secular 
               <br />
               school system displacing a separate school 
               <br />
               system. I am free. to say that, but it does 
               <br />
               appear to me to be an abuse of language to 
               <br />
               say that we should not give this power to 
               <br />
               the people of the North-west. who have en- 
               <br />
               ormous powers from us already, who are not 
               <br />
               abusing those powers, who are quite as in- 
               <br />
               telligent, I think, as the ordinary constitu- 
               <br />
               ents that we represent here, and to give them 
               <br />
               power to‘ decide and dispose of this question 
               <br />
               amongst themselves, can hardly be treated 
               <br />
               as a breach of faith. Why, the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for West Assiniboia, with the knowledge 
               <br />
               he has of the people of the North-west, with 
               <br />
               the knowledge he has of the autonomy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> 
               <br />
               Legislative Council, tells us that he doubts 
               <br />
               very much whether the separate school 
               <br />
               system will be abolished. But is there any 
               <br />
               reason why, in a matter of that kind, they 
               <br />
               should not have the power ? Are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> not 
               <br />
               quite as competent to deal with their schools 
               <br />
               as British Columbia was at the time of the 
               <br />
               Union, as British Columbia is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today;</span> as 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island was. as Prince Ed-

               ward Island is, and so with the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces ? When you talk about heart-burn- 
               <br />
               ings, and when you talk about peace, do not 
               <br />

               those provinces which have complete power 
               <br />
               over their schools. The trouble that is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span>

               stantly occurring does not come from those
