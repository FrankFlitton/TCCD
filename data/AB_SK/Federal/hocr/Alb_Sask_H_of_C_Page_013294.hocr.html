               the occasion. Provinces have been driven almost 
               <br />
               to revolt; there has been discontent in Ontario 
               <br />
               and in Quebec ; but when you apply the principle 
               <br />
               of Provincial rights, when you allow the people to 
               <br />
               deal with their own local affairs as they please, 
               <br />
               the question is settled always in the way the 
               <br />
               people desire it to be settled. So it should be 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> Territories. They have 
               <br />
               an equal right to speak with the people of 
               <br />
               the older Provinces, and I, for one, will not be a 
               <br />
               party to taking away that right, which, if my own 
               <br />
               Province was interested, I would expect to have 
               <br />
               given to it. I believe if we apply the principles of 
               <br />
               provincial rights we are treading upon safe ground, 
               <br />
               upon ground we have travelled before, upon a well 
               <br />
               tried and beaten path which has always led us out 
               <br />
               of difﬁculties ; but, if you abandon that, and 
               <br />
               take up some other ground and say that Parlia- 
               <br />
               ment should deal with this subject, whether com— 
               <br />
               petent or not, or whether it possesses the requisite 
               <br />
               information or not, you are entering a sea of difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culties, from which I, at least, see no safe haven.

               The hon. member for West Durham (Mr. Blake), 
               <br />
               who made an able and brilliant speech the other 
               <br />
               night, did not deal in many historical arguments, 
               <br />
               but he gave us two from modern history : the one 
               <br />
               with respect to the question of the use of the dual 
               <br />
               languages in Schleswig-Holstein, and the other with 
               <br />
               respect to their use in Poland, and he asked 
               <br />
               us to pay great respect to the recommendations 
               <br />
               of the English statesmen in those two cases. I 
               <br />
               have no doubt that any recommendation by 
               <br />
               English statesmen, experienced in matters of this 
               <br />
               kind, would carry great weight. Upon What 
               <br />
               lines did they go? Just On the lines that we are 
               <br />
               asking you shall go now : to leave it to the 
               <br />
               people to decide how many languages they shall 
               <br />
               have, or if they shall have but one. That was the 
               <br />
               proposition which the English Secretary of State 
               <br />
               made in his despatch with reference to the Schles- 
               <br />
               wig-Holstein question and that was the same 
               <br />
               proposition which the great powers of Europe made 
               <br />
               with reference to the settlement of the language 
               <br />
               question in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Poland;</span> Therefore, if these great 
               <br />
               English precedents are to have any weight, if hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, some of whom I have in my 
               <br />
               eye now who pay very great respect to the opinions 
               <br />
               and recommendations of English statesmen, will 
               <br />
               pay weight to these opinions I have referred to, 
               <br />
               they will vote for the resolution of the member for 
               <br />
               West Assiniboia (Mr. Davin) and leave this matter 
               <br />
               to the people, who are best qualiﬁed to judge of it 
               <br />
               themselves. ‘ I Wish to say a few words with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the amendment of the hon. the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. I am opposed to that amendment, as I 
               <br />
               stated in my opening remarks, upon the ground 
               <br />
               that it is a half—and—half measure, for it gives with 
               <br />
               one hand what it withholds with the other. By it 
               <br />
               you declare that you have a half belief in the 
               <br />
               right of the people to decide this question, but 
               <br />
               that you have not full conﬁdence in them. It 
               <br />
               seems to me to be a hesitating, half-hearted Tory 
               <br />
               proposition. You say: “ We will give them the 
               <br />
               power to determine whether their proceedings and 
               <br />
               speeches shall be in one or two languages, but, oh, 
               <br />
               we cannot trust the eople to decide as to Whether 
               <br />
               their ordinances shal be published inone or two 
               <br />
               languages.” That is all nonsense. Why withdraw 
               <br />
               from the people of the Territories the right to de- 
               <br />
               termine whether one, two or three languages shall 
               <br />
               be used? It may be that the Germans will go to

               <br />
               to this amendment, because it leaves this question 
               <br />
               which has given rise to so much trouble, so much 
               <br />
               heartburning and so much turmoil in the same 
               <br />

               year. You will have the same debate, and you 
               <br />
               will have more bitterness imported into it than 
               <br />
               now. We have had on this occasion the restrain- 
               <br />
               ing inﬂuence which comes from the fact that the 
               <br />
               great leaders occupying the front benches on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House have united to give us wise 
               <br />
               counsel, to commend us to be prudent, to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cau~</span> 
               <br />
               tious, to refrain from exciting language, and to re—

               member that underlying this question there are 
               <br />
               others which may result in the disruption of the 
               <br />
               whole Dominion. The debate, so far, has been 
               <br />
               conducted with an abstinence from exciting 
               <br />
               language which is certainly commendable, but 
               <br />
               if you keep this question open, what guarantee 
               <br />
               have you that this commendable abstinence from 
               <br />
               violent language is going so be repeated next year? 
               <br />
               The hon. member for North Simcoe will doubtless 
               <br />
               bring up this question again next year, for he would

               reason for going half way in this matter. If we

               <br />
               Ontario nearly one hundred years old, to show that 
               <br />
               the people of Ontario, United Empire Loyalists 
               <br />
               as they were, were not unworthy then to be trusted

               with the disposition of a matter similar to the 
               <br />
               one now before us. Did these people a hundred 
               <br />
               years ago act harshly or tyrannically? No. The 
               <br />
               First Minister showed that they acted in a 
               <br />
               broad and generous spirit, and that they pub- 
               <br />
               lished their ordinances and their debates in

               the hon. gentleman has cited is directly against 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“lest</span> are as qualiﬁed to-day—nay, if we 
               <br />
               judge from the spread of education; if we can 
               <br />
               judge from the increase of toleration which has 
               <br />
               been going on among the people of North America 
               <br />
               for the last hundred years—they are more qualiﬁed 
               <br />
               to deal with this question in a broad, generous and 
               <br />
               free spirit than were their forefathers. I see 
               <br />
               nothing but procrastination, delay and danger, in 
               <br />
               this amendment of the Minister of Justice, and I 
               <br />
               oppose it upon the ground that I do not believe it 
               <br />
               will give satisfaction to the people more imme- 
               <br />
               diately interested, or will work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effectively</span> or justly 
               <br />
               if carried into law.
