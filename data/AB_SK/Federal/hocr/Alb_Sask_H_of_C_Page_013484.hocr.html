               <br />
               gard to the elections. Let us look at the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act and see if there is anything 
               <br />
               in it like this: That Act provides that the 
               <br />
               voters’ lists shall be made up from time to 
               <br />
               time when the Government sees ﬁt, and that 
               <br />
               when the voters’ lists are to be revised a 
               <br />
               general proclamation is to issue appointing 
               <br />
               a registration clerk for each electoral dis- 
               <br />
               trict in the province. That proclamation 
               <br />
               ﬁxes the day for the closing of the lists, 
               <br />
               which day shall be not less than four weeks 
               <br />
               from the date of the proclamation. During 
               <br />
               these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,four</span> weeks every elector has an op- 
               <br />
               portunity of sending to that registration 
               <br />
               clerk. a sworn declaration showing that he 
               <br />
               is entitled to vote, and if the registration 
               <br />
               clerk does not put upon the list every one 
               <br />
               of those persons whd furnishes him with a 
               <br />
               proper declaration, he is subject to a heavy

               <br />
               then there is a revision. A revising ofﬁcer

               the Dominion Act and unden the Manitoba

               opportunity, there is no possible chance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of,</span> 
               <br />
               a man getting his name upon the list unless

               the enumerator is willing to put him 
               <br />
               upon the list. Now. Mr. Speaker, it is well 
               <br />
               known by the Government, and also, I think, 
               <br />
               generally in this House, that the North-west 
               <br />
               Assembly is composed very largely of Con- 
               <br />
               servatives. I shall, with your permission, 
               <br />
               Sir, read a resolution which that body pass-

               <br />
               true, that was not particularly within their 
               <br />
               jurisdiction, but a subject in which each 
               <br />
               one of them was interested as a citizen of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and one in which they felt 
               <br />
               there was such a strong public interest in 
               <br />
               the Territories that they were justiﬁed in
