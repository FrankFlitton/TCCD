               agitation in Ontario, as had the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who last addressed the House to lay an unjustiﬁ— 
               <br />
               able charge against the hon. gentleman for West 
               <br />
               Durham (Mr. Blake). If those charges had not 
               <br />
               been made I would not have addressed the House 
               <br />
               on this question. Although I admire very much, and 
               <br />
               I am sure every member of this House and every 
               <br />
               true Canadian must admire the broad and patriotic 
               <br />
               speech of the member for West Durham, of whom I 
               <br />
               am a great admirer and follower, I cannot agree with 
               <br />
               him on the main question before the House at the 
               <br />
               present time. I believe, and it is my honest judgment, 
               <br />
               although I may be wrong, that, as in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-\Vest</span> 
               <br />
               Territory there are so few French~speaking people, 
               <br />
               and still fewer, if the information I have received 
               <br />
               is correct, who read French, it would be better not 
               <br />
               to have a dual language in that country at the 
               <br />
               present time. While I differ from the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman, I am sure he will give me credit for 
               <br />
               honesty of judgment in dealing with this subject. 
               <br />
               While not committing myself to vote for the Bill 
               <br />
               before the House I candidly express my view on 
               <br />
               this question and I believe also the view of my 
               <br />
               constituents. I may say to the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works, who has just entered the Chamber, that 
               <br />
               I do not think he was justiﬁed in making 
               <br />
               the attack he did upon us. It is not within my 
               <br />
               recollection that in the Province .of Ontario any 
               <br />
               Catholic or any number of Catholics have been 
               <br />
               treated with intolerance or their worship interfered 
               <br />
               with in any respect whatever, with the one or two 
               <br />
               exceptions which are so frequently referred to, and 
               <br />
               in those cases there was no interference with wor— 
               <br />
               ship. It is true that in Toronto, Where feeling 
               <br />
               runs high, when there were large demonstrations 
               <br />
               on one, two or three occasions, rows have been 
               <br />
               stirred up and little conﬂicts have taken place ; 
               <br />
               but at no place, and certainly not in the riding 
               <br />
               which I represent, where there is a very large Pro- 
               <br />
               testant majority, have the hon. gentleman’s co- 
               <br />
               religionists failed to enjoy the greatest possible 
               <br />
               liberty to worship God in any way they pleased, 
               <br />
               and in my riding they have been assisted, as every 
               <br />
               Catholic throughout that section will bear witness, 
               <br />
               very materially by their Protestant neighbors. I 
               <br />
               repeat that the insinuations made in the speech of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Public Works were very unjustiﬁ- 
               <br />
               able, and his appeal to his fellow Canadians, irres- 
               <br />
               pective of party, to stand by him on this occasion, 
               <br />
               was simply an attempt to pull wool over their 
               <br />
               eyes, for he knew that if there was any agitation 
               <br />
               in Ontario, if there was any intolerance in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> 
               <br />
               to this question, it was owing to the action of his 
               <br />
               own political friends for whom he had not a word

               I would call the attention of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance and of the House, to what I consider has 
               <br />
               been a gross misuse of the vote of this House 
               <br />
               in this connection last year. In the Auditor 
               <br />
               General’s Report for 1888-1889 I ﬁnd that this 
               <br />
               House, after consideration and consultation, 
               <br />
               voted a sum of $5,338 for the stationery of the 
               <br />
               Senate. That amounted to about the same per 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capita</span> as was voted for our stationery here. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd, however, that these gentlemen of the Senate 
               <br />
               instead of spending the sum we voted spent 
               <br />
               $12,412.88. This is a matter which requires a 
               <br />
               good deal of explanation. It is perfectly useless 
               <br />
               or us to attempt to limit the expenditure, if we 
               <br />
               vote four or ﬁve thousand dollars for a particular 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">department</span> or branch of the Le islature, and if they 
               <br />
               spend ten or twelve thousan dollars. When I 
               <br />
               take up the details of that expenditure I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               they are not such as would commend them to our 
               <br />
               serious judgment. Among the items I ﬁnd 99 
               <br />
               thermometers, fromwhich I would suppose that each 
               <br />
               gentleman in the Senate requires a thermometer to 
               <br />
               test the temperature of the chamber for himself.

               <br />
               several barometers, l2 tourists’ cases at $127 (I

               suppose some of them intended to make a journey 
               <br />

               <br />
               cabinets, writing desks, deed'boxes, despatch boxes, 
               <br />
               pocket diaries, letter cases, and a lot of other things

               which at ﬁrst sight do not appear to be at all 
               <br />
               necessary. The principle which I wish to call 
               <br />
               attention to is the disregard aid to the control 
               <br />
               which this Chamber shoul exercise on the 
               <br />
               expenditure of public money. When we vote 
               <br />
               $5,800 and they spend $12,000 it is a ﬂagrant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis.</span>

               supposed to control the expenditure of the public 
               <br />
               money. I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’the</span> Minister should give some

               explanation of this extraordinary expenditure
