               This is the debate. But no reasons were given, no

               This address was passed, it is true, but we have a

               very long and able speech made by Mr. Justice 
               <br />
               Rouleau. Unfortunately that gentleman is only

               an cx~0ﬁcio member of the Council, and could 
               <br />
               not give his vote against the address that was

               presented at the time. Now, I wish to refer, 
               <br />
               m <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass-ant,</span> to some of the judge’s remarks. 
               <br />
               It appears that the hon. member for North 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Simcoe</span> has some admirers in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-“’est</span> 
               <br />
               Territories; that he has created a certain school, 
               <br />
               which, however, is no school at all. He has 
               <br />
               followers there——anti-Frenchmen. When His 
               <br />
               Excellency the Governor General visited that 
               <br />
               country last summer, at Calgary they built an 
               <br />
               arch over the roadway opposite the hotel, and, 
               <br />
               of course, the most appropriate motto that could 
               <br />
               be put on that arch was the motto of His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency’s <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coat-ofarms—sans</span> changer. But that 
               <br />
               was French, and the people had the greatest 
               <br />
               objection to put a French motto in the streets of 
               <br />
               Calgary. So they went on and translated it, and 
               <br />
               put up the words “no change.” But as the arch 
               <br />
               happened to be opposite a hotel, the poor hotel- 
               <br />
               keeper did not have a single customer on that (lay, 
               <br />
               because everybody was afraid to go in there for 
               <br />
               fear that they would get no change. But here is 
               <br />
               something extraordinary, Mr. Speaker, though not 
               <br />
               a similar case, which happened a few years ago in 
               <br />
               the Province of Ontario, in a little town called-— 
               <br />
               shall I name it ?——St. Thomas. There is in that 
               <br />
               town ayoung ladies’ school, and although they 
               <br />
               may be admirers of the hon. member, still they 
               <br />
               love the French language in that institution. 
               <br />
               Of course, they had to have a motto for their 
               <br />
               school. It was somewhat of an ambitious motto, 
               <br />
               I dare say, and, perhaps, it well became this in— 
               <br />
               stitution, because it was a. very good institution. 
               <br />
               Of course, an institution, like a nobleman, must 
               <br />
               have a motto, if nothing else. They had to have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> motto from some other language than the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish, and without having the fear of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Simcoe before their eyes, they 
               <br />
               adopted—not a Latin or a Greek motto—but a 
               <br />
               French motto, because all great men have French 
               <br />
               mottoes, and in that respect they differ from my 
               <br />
               hon. friend, whose motto is anti-French. Well, 
               <br />
               they selected a sentence in English, which, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trans-</span> 
               <br />
               lat-ed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span> French, would make a splendid motto. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Their</span> Idea. was to convey the impression that their 
               <br />
               Institution was second to none in the country ; 
               <br />
               and they took the two shortest words they could 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">find</span> in the English language and translated them 
               <br />
               Into French. They took “ second to none,” which 
               <br />
               means “ never behind,” and so they looked up a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French</span> dictiona and found that a literal transla- 
               <br />

               of my hon. friend from Berthier (Mr. Beausoleil),

               we refused to accept the suggestion that had been 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W’est</span> Assiniboia (Mr.

               the amendment of the hon. member for Berthier, 
               <br />
               because the history of What has taken place in 
               <br />
               Manitoba is certainly not satisfactor , and is a 
               <br />
               proof that if in the future we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treats-(Tin</span> the same 
               <br />
               manner as we have been in the past, we are not so 
               <br />
               certain about the safety of our rights and interests. 
               <br />
               As I told you a little While ago, under the Consti— 
               <br />
               tution of Manitoba we have rights in regard to our 
               <br />
               language and to our schools, and those rights and 
               <br />
               claims cannot be interfered with. Moreover, at the 
               <br />
               time of Confederation, our then Lieutenant Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor, whom I am glad to see on the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir</span> Adams Archibald, took every precaution 
               <br />
               to prevent friction between the two classes of 
               <br />
               the community who were then very excited after 
               <br />
               the little rebellion that had taken place. 
               <br />
               The then Lieutenant Governor gave to each class 
               <br />
               of the community a fair, just and proper repre- 
               <br />
               sentation. Although the French had a small 
               <br />
               majority and the Catholics a small majority, the 
               <br />
               Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Housenand</span> we had two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Houses—swans</span> divid- 
               <br />
               ed into 24 constituencies and sub-divided, so that 
               <br />
               12 members were given to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishvspeakin</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">r</span> 
               <br />
               Protestant community, and 12 members who couh 
               <br />
               be returned by Roman Catholics, whether Irish, 
               <br />
               English or French. The U per House was com- 
               <br />
               posed of seven members, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an:</span> the Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               were given a majority of one on account of a 
               <br />
               majority of people of that faith in the Province. 
               <br />
               Thus the then Lieutenant Governor dealt with the 
               <br />
               question in a liberal-minded manner, to the satis- 
               <br />
               faction of every class. Later on we were asked to 
               <br />
               abolish our Legislative Council. The Council was 
               <br />
               the only safeguard we possessed after the inﬂux of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> had taken lace, and the Catholic and
