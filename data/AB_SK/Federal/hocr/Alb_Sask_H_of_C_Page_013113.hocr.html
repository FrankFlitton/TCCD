               Mr. DEWDNEY. WhenI introduced this Bill for the 
               <br />
               special purpose of consolidating the three Acts now in ex- 
               <br />
               istence, my principal reason was that last Session the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly consolidated the NOrth-West Ordin- 
               <br />
               ances, and I thought it would be very convenient to have 
               <br />
               the N orth-West Territories Act also consolidated. How- 
               <br />
               ever, some hon. gentlemen Opposite thought it was too late 
               <br />
               in the Session to put through this Bill; but I thought, sub- 
               <br />
               sequently, that if they would agree to raise no question on 
               <br />
               the clauses not amended, we might possibly be able to put 
               <br />
               through the amendment. Since that, several hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men have informed me, that probably there would be con- 
               <br />
               siderable discussion on some of the old clauses of the Bill 
               <br />
               which I do not propose to amend, and, as the amendments 
               <br />
               I did propose are not of a serious character, and several hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on both sides have expressed a wish that, if pos- 
               <br />
               sible, I might allow the measure to remain over for another 
               <br />
               Session, I beg to move that the order be discharged.
