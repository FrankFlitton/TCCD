               from York (Mr. Mulock) asks the question : 
               <br />
               Why are not these lands populated ? What 
               <br />
               I say is this : If you had visited these Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories in 1882 you would have thought, as 
               <br />
               we all thought, as I dare say my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Winnipeg (Mr. Martin) thought, 
               <br />
               that these Territories were going to ﬁll up ; 
               <br />
               in fact, that the population would ﬂow into 
               <br />
               them. That was our opinion, and we were 
               <br />
               perfectly certain of it. And now take the 
               <br />
               calculations that were made by the hon. 
               <br />
               baronet, the Secretary of State, when he 
               <br />
               was Finance Minister. These calculations

               have been quoted here as though they were 
               <br />

               <br />
               say this. There was more power in such

               There were two things in these calculations.

               There was. ﬁrst. power—steam—go-ahead;

               <br />
               what has taken place since. I heard Mr.

               <br />
               the impossibility of getting through the “ sea 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ticinations of those who opposed them. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, what form did the adverse criticisms 
               <br />
               upon their policy take ? Their opponents 
               <br />
               went about. saying that the building of the 
               <br />
