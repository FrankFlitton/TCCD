     three years, or four years from now, this

     so far as the province of Ontario is con

     cerned, even four years from now, this 
     <lb/>
     government will not carry half a dozen

     state of affairs will be found to exist in! 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and in those two new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The present government will find that the

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Carleton, Ont). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are 
     <lb/>
     called, I would like to say a few words 
     <lb/>
     with respect to a matter that was mentioned 
     <lb/>
     in the House yesterday. Let me, in the first 
     <lb/>
     place, speak of the letter of February 23rd, 
     <lb/>
     which evidently was not received by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister. May I be permitted to 
     <lb/>
     say that I understood from the remarks of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister yesterday that there 
     <lb/>
     was rather a reflection on Mr. Rogers in the 
     <lb/>
     suggestion that the letter had not been re<lb break="no"/>ceived. I rather gathered that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister had some doubts as to whether or 
     <lb/>
     not the letter was written. Perhaps I mis<lb break="no"/>understood the right hon. gentleman, but 
     <lb/>
     it is, I think, right to say that very ample 
     <lb/>
     evidence was forthcoming of the writing 
     <lb/>
     and of the sending of the letter, and while 
     <lb/>
     we at once accept most unreservedly the 
     <lb/>
     statement of the Prime Minister that he 
     <lb/>
     (lid not receive it, still I would think that, 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances, it would be a per<lb break="no"/>fectly proper thing to include that letter in 
     <lb/>
     the correspondence which is about to be 
     <lb/>
     printed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Since the discussion of yesterday a state<lb break="no"/>ment has been made by His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti. I will come to that 
     <lb/>
     a little later on. Let me say that I know 
     <lb/>
     nothing of the circumstances under which 
     <lb/>
     a delegate of the Holy See was in the first 
     <lb/>
     place brought to this country beyond what 
     <lb/>
     has been stated by gentlemen on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House, who are well qualified to 
     <lb/>
     make such statements, because they have 
     <lb/>
     personal knowledge of that which they 
     <lb/>
     state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I gather from them the Delegate Apos<lb break="no"/>tolic came to this country in 1897, not at 
     <lb/>
     the instance of the bishops of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church in Canada, but at the in<lb break="no"/>stance of some forty Liberal members of 
     <lb/>
     parliament who are members of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church. I understand that there 
     <lb/>
     was no demand for the appointment of a 
     <lb/>
     delegate by the bishops or clergy. In mak<lb break="no"/>ing that statement, of course, I rely entirely

     on what has been said by hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the other side. by the right hon. Prime 
     <lb/>
    Minister. by the hon. member for La<lb break="yes"/>belle (Mr. Bourassa) and others who 
     <lb/>have very frankly stated the position 
     <lb/>of affairs in that regard. The delegate came 
     <lb/>to this country. as the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Labelle has stated, because there was a 
     <lb/>certain misunderstanding between the laity 
     <lb/>and the clergy of the church. I understood 
     <lb/>him to say that the difference arose in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the Manitoba school question, 
     <lb/>which was made (a political question. Thus, 
     <lb/>I venture to suggest, not on lily own 
     <lb/>authority at all, but from what has 
     <lb/>been said by hon. gentlemen on the other 
     <lb/>side of the House, that the delegate came 
     <lb/>to this country in the first place on account 
     <lb/>of a political question which arose in this 
     <lb/>country and that his functions have been 
     <lb/>to some extent at least political and per<lb break="no"/>haps more political than ecclesiastical. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now the right hon. gentleman has laid a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of stress upon the fact that no com<lb break="no"/>munication from the executive of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the boundary question had 
     <lb/>
     come to this government before the month 
     <lb/>
     of January last. But, my hon. friend was 
     <lb/>
     not unaware that that question had been 
     <lb/>
     brought up in the Manitoba legislature. He 
     <lb/>
    was not. unaware that resolutions, unanim<lb break="no"/>ously concurred in by his own political 
     <lb/>friends in Manitoba, had been passed by 
     <lb/>thc legislature of that province: and when 
     <lb/>he sent his letter into the Northwest in: 
     <lb/>the month of September last. announcing 
     <lb/>that, new provinces would be created in the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories, he knew perfectly 
     <lb/>well that the question would be to the fore 
     <lb/>as soon as the Bill was introduced for the 
     <lb/>purpose of creating.r those provinces. There<lb break="no"/>fore. the boundary question was to all in<lb break="no"/>tents and purposes to the fore, and very 
     <lb/>much to the fore, during the present year 
     <lb/>in connection with the legislation which is 
     <lb/>now before the House for discussion and 
     <lb/>in connection with the distribution of terri<lb break="no"/>tory attending the creation of these prov<lb break="no"/>inces. It has been very much to the fore 
     <lb/>during the last few months especially. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     I referred yesterday to certain press com<lb break="no"/>ments on the subject. but I did not refer to 
     <lb/>
     them very fully. I will take the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of mentioning them again, because 
     <lb/>
     they are significant. I have here an article

     in the press in regard to it. Other hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who are more famliar with that 
     <lb/>
     publication can speak better in that regard. 
     <lb/>
     I am about to read a statement which would

     <lb/>
     that the source to which I refer is a very

     <lb/>
     in the same speech to which I have referred,

     Liberal party in this country, and especi<lb break="no"/>ally to the Prime Minister and the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice, let us observe what that journal 
     <lb/>
     has said with regard to this boundary ques<lb break="no"/>tion, because it is sometimes important to 
     <lb/>
     consider the utterances of great political 
     <lb/>
     organs upon political questions. It is de<lb break="no"/>sirable in the present instance to do so, in 
     <lb/>
     order to lead up to the incident to which at<lb break="no"/>tention has been drawn only yesterday. On 
     <lb/>
     the 17th of February 'Le Soleil' editorially 
     <lb/>
     made the remarks, which have been trans<lb break="no"/>lated as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In proportion to her big sisters Manitoba will 
     <lb/>
     count as little more than a large county. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is one of the reasons invoked by Mani<lb break="no"/>toba's delegates to obtain an enlargement of 
     <lb/>
     her territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another. Quebec and Ontario have 
     <lb/>
     extended their limits, the one to the west, the 
     <lb/>
     other to the east, to attain on the north the 
     <lb/>
     shores of James bay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Manitoba aspires to the shores of Hudson bay, 
     <lb/>
     on the northeast. It would be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     withdraw her boundaries several hundred miles 
     <lb/>
     towards the north, to cut the district of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan and Athabaska, and encircle that of 
     <lb/>
     Keewatin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Manitoba is asking for treble her existing 
     <lb/>
     territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This enlargement is hardly possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The district of Saskatchewan opposes it, at 
     <lb/>
     least the part directly interested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The finances of Manitoba in their actual state 
     <lb/>
     are not made to attract the free residents of 
     <lb/>
     the districts. Manitoba has a debt of $4,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     The school legislation of the little province is 
     <lb/>
     not of a nature to attract the immigrants who 
     <lb/>
     people the districts. The Northwest has its 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. Manitoba has abolished them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Every good act has its reward, every bad act 
     <lb/>
     its chastisement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Manitoba will remain lowest with her pre<lb break="no"/>tentious law. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Those, it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, are 
     <lb/>
     very significant words coming from a jour<lb break="no"/>nal which claims to be under the actual con<lb break="no"/>trol and direction of the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, and which is said—and without con<lb break="no"/>tradiction up to the present time—which is 
     <lb/>
     said to have been at the moment of these 
     <lb/>
     editorial utterances, under the direct control 
     <lb/>
     of the Minister of Justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Under these circumstances, what took 
     <lb/>
     place ? The delegates from Manitoba ar<lb break="no"/>rived in Ottawa on the 16th day of Febru<lb break="no"/>ary. They came here for the express pur<lb break="no"/>pose of discussing with the government the 
     <lb/>
     extension of the boundaries of Manitoba ; 
     <lb/>
     they met the right hon. gentleman and the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General, and perhaps some 
     <lb/>
     other members of the cabinet. According 
     <lb/>
     to their statement, they were told by the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman that if they would 
     <lb/>
     remain a few days in Ottawa he would send 
     <lb/>
     for them again, and perhaps be prepared 
     <lb/>
     to give them an answer. They were not 
     <lb/>
     sent for by the right hon. gentleman again 
     <lb/>
     although they remained in the city of Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa until the 23rd day of February. I 
     <lb/>
     do not know whether the exact date has

     been given, but before they left Ottawa, and 
     <lb/>
    some time between the 20th and the 23rd      
     <lb/>of February, they received a letter from 
     <lb/>His Excellency, Monseigneur Sbarretti. I 
     <lb/>make no criticism upon His Excellency in 
     <lb/>extending to them that invitation; I make 
     <lb/>no criticism upon them for courteously ac<lb break="no"/>cepting that invitation. Let us consider, 
     <lb/>however, how far the situation had devel<lb break="no"/>oped up to that time. Legislation in regard 
     <lb/>to the schools in the Northwest was about 
     <lb/>being brought down; it even then had just 
     <lb/>been brought down by the administration— 
     <lb/>or at least by a portion of the administra<lb break="no"/>tion, because two members of the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration had not been consulted. I will cor<lb break="no"/>rect myself and say that legislation had 
     <lb/>been brought down by the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>in the name of the whole administration. 
     <lb/>but with the authority of only a part of 
     <lb/>the administration. It is true that we had 
     <lb/>very direct avowals from the Minister of 
     <lb/>Agriculture and from the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral yesterday, that they were thoroughly 
     <lb/>familiar with the terms of the legislation 
     <lb/>as originally brought down and that they 
     <lb/>thoroughly approved of it as originally 
     <lb/>brought down. I am making no criticism 
     <lb/>so far as they are concerned, because the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister certainly had their appro<lb break="no"/>val and the approval of the Minister of 
     <lb/>Customs, but he had not the approval of 
     <lb/>the Minister of Finance nor of the Minister 
     <lb/>of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I do not know to what extent any con<lb break="no"/>sultations had been had with His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency in regard to the terms of this legis<lb break="no"/>lation. The statement has been made in 
     <lb/>
     the public press—I called my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's attention to it yesterday, I invited 
     <lb/>
     him to make some explanation with regard 
     <lb/>
     to it—and the statement has been made 
     <lb/>
     across the floor of the House, that His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency had been consulted with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the terms of this legislation. I am not 
     <lb/>
     at present making any criticism about that; 
     <lb/>
     I am only mentioning it to lead up to what 
     <lb/>
     follows, because, educational matters in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories were considered, if in 
     <lb/>
     these consultations it is a little difficult to 
     <lb/>
     believe that the schools of Manitoba were 
     <lb/>
     absolutely ignored in these discussions and 
     <lb/>
     that the boundaries of Manitoba were never 
     <lb/>
     mentioned. What follows ? The interview 
     <lb/>
     took place. I made no comment yesterday 
     <lb/>
     with regard to that, because I thought it 
     <lb/>
     was not advisable for me to do so, as we had 
     <lb/>
     not yet the version of His Excellency before 
     <lb/>
     us, and I thought we were entitled to have 
     <lb/>
     his version of what took place before we 
     <lb/>
     should make much comment upon this par<lb break="no"/>ticular incident. Last night, His Excellency, 
     <lb/>
     I believe, gave out an interview which has 
     <lb/>
     been published in the newspapers of to<lb break="no"/>day, and I will follow the example of my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend yesterday, by placing the 
     <lb/>
     whole of that interview on ' Hansard,' in 
     <lb/>
     order that we may have the full benefit 
     <lb/>
     of the explanation that has been given.

     Monseigneur Sbarretti last night handed out 
     <lb/>for publication the following statement :<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I think it my duty to declare that the press 
     <lb/>
     report of a conference with the Manitoba dele<lb break="no"/>gates is not altogether exact and that it is 
     <lb/>
     given in such a way as to make a false impres<lb break="no"/>sion on the minds of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These are the facts : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Taking occasion of the presence in Ottawa of 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Mr. Campbell, the attorney-general of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, whom I had met in a friendly way 
     <lb/>
     more than a year ago, I invited him to come to 
     <lb/>
     see me. I never met Hon. Mr. Rogers, nor did 
     <lb/>
     I have any communication with him. On the 
     <lb/>
     evening before his departure for the west, Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary 23rd, Mr. Campbell came. I asked him if 
     <lb/>
     something could not be done to improve the 
     <lb/>
     condition of the Catholics of his province with 
     <lb/>
     respect to education. I pointed out that in the 
     <lb/>
     cities of Winnipeg and Brandon, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics were paying double taxes. I urged 
     <lb/>
     my request on the ground of fairness and jus<lb break="no"/>tice and referring to his mission to Ottawa I 
     <lb/>
     remarked that from the point of view of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba government some action on these 
     <lb/>
     lines would be politically expedient and tend 
     <lb/>
     to facilitate the accomplishment of his object, 
     <lb/>
     inasmuch as Catholics in any territory which 
     <lb/>
     might be annexed to Manitoba would naturally 
     <lb/>
     object to losing the right they had to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and to be subjected to the educational 
     <lb/>
     conditions which existed in Manitoba. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell then asked me what would be my de<lb break="no"/>sire in this respect. I then gave him the 
     <lb/>
     memorandum which has already appeared in 
     <lb/>
     the press. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This is the sum and substance of my inter<lb break="no"/>view with Mr. Campbell. The federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment had absolutely no knowledge of it. It 
     <lb/>
     was a private conversation and simply intended 
     <lb/>
     to express a suggestion and a desire that the 
     <lb/>
     condition of the Catholics in the respect I 
     <lb/>
     have mentioned would be improved. Any other 
     <lb/>
     assumption or interpretation is altogether un<lb break="no"/>founded. I think my right of speaking to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell in a private way and on my own 
     <lb/>
     responsibility cannot be disputed. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I notice that my hon. friends opposite 
     <lb/>
     cheer very much the statement of His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency that ' Catholics in any territory 
     <lb/>
     which might be annexed to Manitoba would 
     <lb/>
     naturally object to losing the right they 
     <lb/>
     had to separate schools, and to be sub<lb break="no"/>jected to the educational conditions which 
     <lb/>
     existed in Manitoba.' That is what they 
     <lb/>
     cheer, as I understand. I am amazed at 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen. The other day we 
     <lb/>
     had the ex-Minister of the Interior rise in 
     <lb/>
     his place and publicly thank the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, without whose aid, he said, 
     <lb/>
     the Catholics of Manitoba could not have 
     <lb/>
     been deprived of those rights—publicly 
     <lb/>
     thanked the right hon. gentleman for having 
     <lb/>
     come to the aid of the majority in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and prevented the Conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernment from restoring to the minority those 
     <lb/>
     rights of which they had been deprived. The 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman has declared this to 
     <lb/>
     be a happy solution of a difficult situation ; 
     <lb/>
     but hon. gentlemen opposite cheer the ut<lb break="no"/>terance which I have just quoted. Their 
     <lb/>
     attitude is a little incomprehensible to my<lb break="no"/>self, and I think it must be incomprehensible

     Excellency does say. He is an able and ac<lb break="no"/>complished man, brought up in one of the 
     <lb/>
     best schools of diplomacy in the world; 
     <lb/>
     a diplomat; a man who, I am sure, would 
     <lb/>
     make no suggestion, to Mr. Campbell or to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers, which he did not feel himself 
     <lb/>
     able to carry out. And let us see if my

     Conditions which the right hon. gentleman

     himself stated in 1897 were absolutely satis<lb break="no"/>factory not only to himself, but to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the province of Quebec. Politically 
     <lb/>
     expedient—what does that mean ? Let us 
     <lb/>
     consider it for a moment. It would be 
     <lb/>
     politically expedient for the government of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, which desired an extension of its 
     <lb/>
     boundaries, to make certain amendments 
     <lb/>
     to that law which the Prime Minister had 
     <lb/>
     declared to be a happy solution of a dif<lb break="no"/>ficult situation. Politically expedient—who 
     <lb/>
     had the power to extend those boundaries? 
     <lb/>
     The government of this country—hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen sitting on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House. There was one and only one power in 
     <lb/>
     this country that could deal with that ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and that is the power represented by 
     <lb/>
     the fourteen or fifteen gentlemen who sit 
     <lb/>
     around the Council board of Canada; and 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency declared that 'from the 
     <lb/>
     point of view of the Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
     some action on these lines would be politi<lb break="no"/>cally expedient.' Now, there is only one pos<lb break="no"/>sible meaning to that, and it is this ; His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency must have thoroughly believed that 
     <lb/>
     he had the authority to suggest to these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen that if they acceded to his de<lb break="no"/>mand, to his request with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     school laws of Manitoba, there would be 
     <lb/>
     such an extension of the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba as the government of that 
     <lb/>
     province desired. I am reluctant to 
     <lb/>
     believe that His Excellency would have 
     <lb/>
     made any such suggestion unless he 
     <lb/>
     believed he had authority of some kind. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know Whether he received aut<lb break="no"/>hority from or had any discussion with the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman or with any other 
     <lb/>
     minister of the Crown. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     whether we shall receive any information 
     <lb/>
     on that subject. I do not know whether

     my right hon. friend will think it advis<lb break="no"/>able to give us any information. I do

     remember, however, that after the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman had declared, in answer to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Monk) and in answer to myself, only last 
     <lb/>
     session, that every document in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Com<lb break="no"/>pany had been brought down, the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance weeks afterwards read a docu<lb break="no"/>ment which had not been brought down, and 
     <lb/>
     used it for the purpose of debate; and 
     <lb/>
     the government justified their action in 
     <lb/>
     that regard by declaring in effect that if a 
     <lb/>
     document of a confidential character came 
     <lb/>
     into their possession, they were perfectly 
     <lb/>
     justified in denying in this House that any 
     <lb/>
     such document existed. I do not know what 
     <lb/>
     denials or what statements we shall receive 
     <lb/>
     in this regard; but it is interesting to 
     <lb/>
     observe another thing in this statement of 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency, and it is this: that there 
     <lb/>
     is no direct statement in it, so far as I 
     <lb/>
     have been able to observe, that he did not 
     <lb/>
    have the authority which he assumed on that. 
     <lb/>
     occasion. He has said, and the Prime 
     <lb/>
       Minister has said. that that interview was 
     <lb/>
     not arranged on behalf of the government 
     <lb/>
     or at the instance of the government; but 
     <lb/>
     I do not observe any statement of His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency that he did not consider him<lb break="no"/>self to have authority to make the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion which he did make to the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell on that occasion. If there was a<lb/>
               <lb/>   
     <lb/>
     supposed authority, or if beyond that there 
     <lb/>
     was real authority given on behalf of this 
     <lb/>
     government, or given by any member of this 
     <lb/>
     government, how does the action of the 
     <lb/>
     members of this administration contrast 
     <lb/>
     with their attitude in 1896? Then their 
     <lb/>
     cry, at least in most of the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, was: No coercion; hands oft 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. That was their answer to a re<lb break="no"/>medial order and remedial legislation pro<lb break="no"/>posed by a Conservative administration with<lb break="no"/>in the strict terms of the constitution. 
     <lb/>
     But what has been suggested might 
     <lb/>
     rightly be regarded, I think, as a remedial 
     <lb/>
     order of another type—as a remedial order 
     <lb/>
     of an unconstitutional and unwarranted 
     <lb/>
     character ; and I for one am surprised that 
     <lb/>
     upon the statement of His Excellency, which 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt is absolutely accurate in 
     <lb/>
     every respect, there should have been this 
     <lb/>
     suggestion to the members of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am not concerned wth the question as 
     <lb/>
     to whether or not His Excellency should 
     <lb/>
     be recalled; as I said yesterday, he is not 
     <lb/>
     responsible to us in any sense, he is res<lb break="no"/>ponsible only to his superiors. But the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this country are responsible to 
     <lb/>
     us, and if there has been any suggestion of 
     <lb/>
     this kind by or on behalf of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of this country, or by or on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of any member of it, then I say the coun<lb break="no"/>try will demand. and I think the people will 
     <lb/>
     demand, the dismissal or retirement of any 
     <lb/>
     member of this government who ventured to 
     <lb/>
     confer upon His Excellency any authority

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>  
        

     of that kind. His Excellency is not respon<lb break="no"/>sible to us, but the members of the admin<lb break="no"/>istration are. This was not an ecclesiastical 
     <lb/>
     matter, it concerned no ecclesiastical mat<lb break="no"/>ters in no way whatever, it was to all in<lb break="no"/>tents and purposes a purely political matter, 
     <lb/>
     the extension of the boundaries of the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Manitoba. I venture to think that 
     <lb/>
     in addition to the explanations which 
     <lb/>
     were given to the Prime Minister yesterday 
     <lb/>
     in this regard, there should be some further 
     <lb/>
     explanations made to the House and to the 
     <lb/>
     country to-day, in view of the very frank 
     <lb/>
     statement which has been made by His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency, and which I have brought to the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House. I move the ad<lb break="no"/>journment of the House.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName> (Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister). Mr. Speaker, in the exchange of 
     <lb/>
     courtesies which usually prevail between 
     <lb/>
     the two sides of the House, it has been cus<lb break="no"/>tomary up to this time for my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     when he intended to move the adjournment 
     <lb/>
     of the House in order to bring up some im<lb break="no"/>portant question, to give me some intima<lb break="no"/>tion of his intention ; but my hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     for some reason of his own which I do not 
     <lb/>
     know, has thought it advisable on this oc<lb break="no"/>casion to depart from the practice hitherto 
     <lb/>
     followed by himself and by his predeces<lb break="no"/>sors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Allow me to say to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend that I received no intimation 
     <lb/>
     whatever of the extended remarks which he 
     <lb/>
     offered to the House yesterday. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I thought it 
     <lb/>
     advisable yesterday to give no notice what 
     <lb/>
     ever to my hon. friend that I intended to 
     <lb/>
     make a statement which concerned myself 
     <lb/>
     personally, and to dispute a statement which 
     <lb/>
     had appeared in the newspapers on a pre<lb break="no"/>vious day. Nor did I believe, nor do I be<lb break="no"/>lieve yet, when a member of this House 
     <lb/>
     finds himself attacked in a newspaper in a 
     <lb/>
     manner which he thinks is unwarranted, 
     <lb/>
     that he requires to give any notice of his 
     <lb/>
     intention to rise in his place and make an 
     <lb/>
     explanation, particularly when the matter 
     <lb/>
     is in no way controversial. It is also the 
     <lb/>
     general rule that when a member of the 
     <lb/>
     House gives his word in contradiction to 
     <lb/>
     alleged facts stated in a newspaper, his 
     <lb/>
     word is accepted, nor do I understand my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend to dispute that rule. But to<lb break="no"/>day my hon. friend has thought it advis<lb break="no"/>able, for reasons of his own, to bring up a 
     <lb/>
     matter which is essentially controversial, 
     <lb/>
     because it implies a censure by the House, 
     <lb/>
     and, therefore, I would have expected that 
     <lb/>
     the usual courtesy would have been extend<lb break="no"/>ed to me. Had I been informed of his in<lb break="no"/>tention, perhaps I would be in a better posi<lb break="no"/>tion to give him an answer, which I think I 
     <lb/>
     can give him nevertheless on this occasion. 
     <lb/>
     I must say that in the multiplicity of busi<lb break="no"/>ness which I have to attend to I had read 
     <lb/>
     only cursorily the statement which appear<lb break="no"/>ed in the newspapers, given by His Excel<lb break="no"/>

     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3948</fw>
     

     lency, Monseigneur Sbarretti, the Apostolic 
     <lb/>
     delegate, and which my hon. friend read a 
     <lb/>
     moment ago. But all this is not very much 
     <lb/>
     to the point. We have to-day, according to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman, a new phase of this 
     <lb/>
     question, and I am glad to say that we have 
     <lb/>
     a new phase, because it is a confirmation 
     <lb/>
     and a corroboration of the statement I made 
     <lb/>
     yesterday on the floor of this House. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend referred to my statement yes<lb break="no"/>terday that up to the month of January 
     <lb/>
     last we had no information, no official in<lb break="no"/>formation, of the intention of Manitoba to 
     <lb/>
     make an application for an extension of her 
     <lb/>
     boundaries. Why did I do that ? My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, for a reason, explained the alleged 
     <lb/>
     interview which was said to have taken 
     <lb/>
     place between Mr. Rogers, Mr. Campbell 
     <lb/>
     and the Apostolic delegate. In that inter<lb break="no"/>view Monseigneur Sbarretti was reported 
     <lb/>
     to have said that it would facilitate matters 
     <lb/>
     if these gentlemen would consent to the res<lb break="no"/>toration of separate schools in Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     and that if that had been done before it 
     <lb/>
     would have facilitated the extension of their 
     <lb/>
     boundaries towards the west. Well, Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     stated that I could hardly believe that His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency could have used such language, 
     <lb/>
     because then and there Mr. Rogers would 
     <lb/>
     have answered, and could have answered to 
     <lb/>
     the Apostolic delegate that there never had 
     <lb/>
     been by the government of Manitoba any 
     <lb/>
     demand upon this government to extend 
     <lb/>
     their boundaries prior to the month of <choice><sic>Jan<lb break="no"/>nary</sic><corr>January&gt;</corr></choice> last, and therefore Monseigneur Sbar<lb break="no"/>retti could not, in my judgment, have used 
     <lb/>
     such language in the presence of Mr. Rogers. 
     <lb/>
     Now to-day we have the confirmation of my 
     <lb/>
     opinion that Monseigneur Sbarretti had 
     <lb/>
     never spoken in that way to Mr. Rogers, for 
     <lb/>
     the very good and obvious reason that Mons<lb break="no"/>eigneur Sbarretti never saw Mr. Rogers. 
     <lb/>
     There are many things in that interview 
     <lb/>
     published by Mr. Rogers which turn out 
     <lb/>
     to be not altogether according to the facts. 
     <lb/>
     You have the impression from the interview 
     <lb/>
     which was published yesterday, that the 
     <lb/>
     Apostolic delegate had sent an invitation to 
     <lb/>
     the delegates of the Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
     who were in Ottawa, to discuss with him 
     <lb/>
     this question of the extension of the boun<lb break="no"/>daries of the province of Manitoba. Is that 
     <lb/>
     according to the facts as we know them 
     <lb/>
     to-day? No, Sir, we find that the invita<lb break="no"/>tion of Monseigneur Sbarretti was not at 
     <lb/>
     all extended to the delegates of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Manitoba, he says he never knew 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers ; but the invitation was ex<lb break="no"/>tended, not to the delegates, but to Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell whom he know before, and whom 
     <lb/>
     he treated as a friend. It is a very differ<lb break="no"/>ent thing to have an official interview and 
     <lb/>
     conversation with the delegates of a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and a private interview and con<lb break="no"/>versation between His Excellency and a 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who happened to be in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     at the time, and who was a member of the 
     <lb/>
     government of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, there are many things alleged 
 


            <pb n="3949" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_3949.jpg"/>

     in this interview which I might comment 
     <lb/>
     upon. It is quite evident from the explan<lb break="no"/>ation of His Excellency, and is indeed ob<lb break="no"/>vious to all, that this interview was not a 
     <lb/>
     public discussion, it was merely a friendly 
     <lb/>
     conversation between two gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     had met together to discuss a question 
     <lb/>
     which they had previously discussed. Now, 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend has hinted, or has attempted 
     <lb/>
     to create the impression, that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada was actuated by sinister 
     <lb/>
     motives with regard to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and that we refused to extend 
     <lb/>
     her boundaries because we wished to punish 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba for having abolish<lb break="no"/>ed separate schools. To establish his point 
     <lb/>
     he quotes a statement in a Quebec news<lb break="no"/>paper, thc 'Soleil,' which is a newspaper 
     <lb/>
     friendly to myself and which claims to be 
     <lb/>
     my organ. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sir, it is very strange that whenever a 
     <lb/>
     newspaper friendly to the government says 
     <lb/>
     something which the hon. gentleman thinks 
     <lb/>
     is favourable to themselves, he at once 
     <lb/>
     holds the government responsible for the 
     <lb/>
     statement. Well, does he hold me respon<lb break="no"/>sible, for instance, for the attitude of the 
     <lb/>
     'Globe' upon this occasion, or of the other 
     <lb/>
     newspapers who do not support the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ? And if I am not to be held re<lb break="no"/>sponsible for the attitude taken by the 
     <lb/>
     ' Globe,' why in the name of common sense 
     <lb/>
     should I be held responsible for the opinion 
     <lb/>
    of the 'Soleil ?' There would be just as 
     <lb/>much reason in one as in the other. 'Le 
     <lb/>Soleil'  is a paper friendly to myself. But, 
     <lb/>because 'Le Soleil' is friendly to myself 
     <lb/>and wants to serve me, surely it does not 
     <lb/>follow that under any circumstances, I am 
     <lb/>bound to be responsible for everything ap<lb break="no"/>pearing in 'Le Soleil,' or in any newspaper. 
     <lb/>It would be absurd to say that because men 
     <lb/>agree upon political matters, they will there<lb break="no"/>fore see eye to eye in everything. There 
     <lb/>are other matters than politics on which men 
     <lb/>can differ in opinion. And it is, to my 
     <lb/>thinking, a position unworthy of my hon. 
     <lb/>friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) to say that the 
     <lb/>government should be supposed to have been 
     <lb/>actuated by belief in a certain line of policy 
     <lb/>because that policy was supported by a 
     <lb/>certain newspaper. The day has not yet come 
     <lb/>when the Canadian government must look 
     <lb/>for its policy or the ground for its opinions 
     <lb/>to newspapers, however respectable those 
     <lb/>newspapers may be. We decide these mat<lb break="no"/>ters upon our own lines and according to 
     <lb/>our best judgment. But the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has endeavoured to convey the idea— 
     <lb/>he did not say it in so many words—that 
     <lb/>there had been a sort of understanding. He 
     <lb/>did not use the word 'conspiracy,' but he 
     <lb/>intended to convey the idea, if he meant 
     <lb/>anything at all, that there had been a con<lb break="no"/>spiracy between the government of Can<lb break="no"/>ada,—and in particular myself and the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick)—and Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Sbarretti to do certain things,— 
     <lb/>that is to say, that the extension of the 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3950</fw>


     boundaries of Manitoba should depend on 
     <lb/>
     the restoration of separate schools in that 
     <lb/>
     province. Why, we have only to take the 
     <lb/>
     facts in chronological order as they are 
     <lb/>
     known to have occurred to show how un<lb break="no"/>founded, how absolutely unfounded, how 
     <lb/>
     devoid even of the shadow of foundation, 
     <lb/>
     such an assertion as that made by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend is. What are the facts ? As 
     <lb/>
     stated yesterday, we received in the month 
     <lb/>
     of January, towards the end of it, the re<lb break="no"/>quest of the Manitoba government for a 
     <lb/>
     conference. We agreed to that conference, 
     <lb/>
     and it took place on the 17th of February. 
     <lb/>
     There were present a subcommittee of coun<lb break="no"/>cil and the question was discussed. We 
     <lb/>
     told the delegates that they should have an 
     <lb/>
     answer at an early day. That answer they 
     <lb/>
     had on the floor of this House four days 
     <lb/>
     later, on the 21st of February, when I intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Autonomy Bills, and in the course 
     <lb/>
     of my explanation stated our position with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the boundaries of Manitoba was 
     <lb/>
     clearly defined. It was two days after<lb break="no"/>wards, on the 23rd of February, that the 
     <lb/>
     conference took place between His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency Monseigneur Sbarretti and Mr. Camp<lb break="no"/>bell. When that conference took place, the 
     <lb/>
     decision of this government was already 
     <lb/>
     known. We had stated what we would do. 
     <lb/>
     We had stated that we would reserve the 
     <lb/>
     northern portion of Saskatchewan to be an<lb break="no"/>nexed to Manitoba or not as circumstances 
     <lb/>
     might suggest, and the extension of the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries should take place to Hudson 
     <lb/>
     bay if there was an opportunity to do so, 
     <lb/>
     after conference. The policy of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was thus determined, and could 
     <lb/>
     not be affected by anything that might 
     <lb/>
     take place in the conference between His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency the apostolic delegate and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell. But, Sir, there is more. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) wants to 
     <lb/>
     know whether or not there was any ques<lb break="no"/>tion between the government of Canada and 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti as to the extension 
     <lb/>
     of the boundaries of Manitoba. As I said a 
     <lb/>
     moment ago, I have not seen the state<lb break="no"/>ment of His Excellency,—I have not read it 
     <lb/>
     critically—but the answer to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's question he already has before him- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     he has only to read that statement. He 
     <lb/>
     has read it, and in it he finds that Monsei<lb break="no"/>gneur Sbarretti says explicitly that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had nothing at all to do with his 
     <lb/>
     own action. That ought to suit the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend and ought to convince 
     <lb/>
     him that he cannot make any political cap<lb break="no"/>ital on that line. I have only to refer to 
     <lb/>
     the words of Monseigneur Sbarretti when 
     <lb/>
     he says himself—and his words are in the 
     <lb/>
     memory of every member of this House— 
     <lb/>
     that he stated to Mr. Campbell that if they 
     <lb/>
     would restore the separate schools in Man<lb break="no"/>itoba, it would be politically expedient. Why?  
     <lb/>
     In what manner ? In respect of any action 
     <lb/>
     to be taken by this government ? No ; but 
     <lb/>
     because the people in the Territories would 
     <lb/>
     then have no objections to going into Man<lb break="no"/>

itoba. There you have the whole meaning 
     <lb/>
     of this matter of political expediency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. What do these 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen mean ? Would they sug<lb break="no"/>gest that there is something behind ? They 
     <lb/>
     seek to prove their case by the words of 
     <lb/>
     the Apostolic delegate, and I give them his 
     <lb/>
     words making clear his own meaning. It 
     <lb/>
     would be, politically expedient. Why ? On 
     <lb/>
     account of any action to be taken here ? 
     <lb/>
    No, but because the people in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories who were affected would 
     <lb/>have no objection to be taken into the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. That is all there is in 
     <lb/>the matter. Yet, in the face of a statement 
     <lb/>so obvious as this, you have the leader of a 
     <lb/>great party doing his best to show that 
     <lb/>there was something hidden on the part of 
     <lb/>the government of Canada in this matter. 
     <lb/>A few moments ago my hon. friend said 
     <lb/>that we would fight this question out else<lb break="no"/>where. I accept that challenge without any 
     <lb/>qualification. We will fight out this ques<lb break="no"/>tion in this House. We will fight it out else<lb break="no"/>where. We will fight it out on the charge 
     <lb/>that hon. gentlemen opposite have brought 
     <lb/>to the attention of the House. I have no 
     <lb/>fear about the result. This is not the first 
     <lb/>time in the thirty years of my experience 
     <lb/>that I have seen the Tory party playing 
     <lb/>this part of endeavouring to arouse the pre<lb break="no"/>judices of the people. We shall meet again 
     <lb/>and shall discuss this question elsewhere. 
     <lb/>In the mean-time, I accept the challenge of 
     <lb/>my hon. friend that we are responsible to 
     <lb/>the people ; and that responsibility we shall 
     <lb/>not decline, but shall meet it in due time.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Hon. GEORGE E. FOSTER</persName> (North Tor<lb break="no"/>onto). Mr. Speaker, the unwonted heat the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>
     developed in his speech was unnecessary to 
     <lb/>
     remind us of the weakness of his argument 
     <lb/>
     in the opening, and, in fact, during the 
     <lb/>
     greater part, of his remarks. Though so 
     <lb/>
     valiant, though he has fought for thirty 
     <lb/>
     years and is willing to fight for ever so 
     <lb/>
     many years more, he found himself obliged 
     <lb/>
     to plead the baby act in the very first sen<lb break="no"/>tence of his speech. His hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden), 
     <lb/>
     he said, had not given him notice that he 
     <lb/>
     was going to bring this new and unheard-of 
     <lb/>
     and unexpected question before the House. 
     <lb/>
     And this great, strong man of battle for 
     <lb/>
     thirty years endeavoured to make a little 
     <lb/>
     cheap capital against my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition by imputing to him 
     <lb/>
     a want of courtesy. But, as he thinks it 
     <lb/>
     over the right hon. gentleman will remember 
     <lb/>
     that yesterday my hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition gave notice that he would 
     <lb/>
     again discuss this matter. And the reason 
     <lb/>
     he did not so fully discuss it yesterday was 
     <lb/>
     that there had been no word uttered by 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti, and, for very good 
     <lb/>
     reasons and very prudent reasons, I think, 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) refused 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3952</fw>
        

     to fulfil the whole purpose of the discussion 
     <lb/>
     until Monseigneur Sbarretti had either been 
     <lb/>
     heard from or had refused to say anything 
     <lb/>
     about this matter. So that I do not think 
     <lb/>
     there was very much in that matter of lack 
     <lb/>
     of courtesy. My right hon. friend may re<lb break="no"/>fine on the technical point but he certainly 
     <lb/>
     came here yesterday fully prepared to make 
     <lb/>
     as much as he possibly could out of this 
     <lb/>
     question politically. My right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     is, I have no doubt, doing some thinking 
     <lb/>
     these days. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. And whether he and his 
     <lb/>
     colleagues and his followers are doing much 
     <lb/>
     thinking or not we may be certain that the 
     <lb/>
     people of this country are doing some think<lb break="no"/>ing these days and I must say there is good 
     <lb/>
     material and plenty of it. But, Sir, let us 
     <lb/>
     ask now what my right hon. friend took 
     <lb/>
     such pains to deny yesterday. He took 
     <lb/>
     great pains to deny absolutely and categori<lb break="no"/>cally a great many things which are alto<lb break="no"/>gether of secondary importance. For in<lb break="no"/>stance he made a point against the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers because he said that they had 
     <lb/>
     not been invited on the initiative of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government to have a conference 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa with reference to the extension 
     <lb/>
     or the boundaries. Neither did Mr. Rogers' 
     <lb/>
     statement declare that the invitation was on 
     <lb/>
     the initiative of the Dominion government. 
     <lb/>
     It might have been implied from that letter 
     <lb/>
     that it was or it might not, but in all con<lb break="no"/>science what difference did it make whether 
     <lb/>
     the invitation went from my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend in reply to a request or whether it 
     <lb/>
     was on his own initiative. As far as the 
     <lb/>
     facts of the case go what difference did it 
     <lb/>
     make ? But there was a very authoritative, 
     <lb/>
     a very absolute and a very much cheered 
     <lb/>
     denial on the part of my right. hon. friend of 
     <lb/>
     that first statement made by Mr. Rogers. 
     <lb/>
     He thought he had triumphantly floored his 
     <lb/>
     opponent when he contended that the 
     <lb/>
     interview had not taken place on his initia<lb break="no"/>tive. He made another strong point in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the interivew in that the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba government had from 1896 up to Janu<lb break="no"/>ary of this year made no step by way of 
     <lb/>
     initiative towards getting an extension of 
     <lb/>
     their boundaries. The Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
     I suppose is a fairly sensible government. 
     <lb/>
     They knew that their legislature had backed 
     <lb/>
     up the demand for an extension of territory. 
     <lb/>
     It had done it once, it had done it a second 
     <lb/>
     time and possibly a third time, but 
     <lb/>
     a claim for extension of territory waits 
     <lb/>
     generally for the favourable period and 
     <lb/>
     during all this time there was the 
     <lb/>
     prospect of the erection of new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in the Northwest, a prospect 
     <lb/>
     coming closer to fulfilment and it was felt 
     <lb/>
     that the time when the Territories were to 
     <lb/>
     be erected into provinces would be an oppor<lb break="no"/>tune moment for the Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
    to press for an extension of their boundaries, 


            <pb n="3953" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_3953.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3953</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 6, 1905</fw> 
         

     so that the argument based upon that point 
     <lb/>
     was scarcely worth the time it took to state 
     <lb/>
     it. It was within the right of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     government to choose their own time and 
     <lb/>
     the time chosen was that of the approaching 
     <lb/>
     creation of provinces in the west. Then 
     <lb/>
     they pressed their claim and I say that was 
     <lb/>
     an opportune time. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man tried to make something out of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that he stated his policy with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the extension of Manitoba's boundaries 
     <lb/>
     on February 21st, and that therefore there 
     <lb/>
     was no reason at all for any person no 
     <lb/>
     matter what his position to attempt to gain 
     <lb/>
     influence for any purpose over the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     government by holding out to them the idea 
     <lb/>
     that their territories might be enlarged. I 
     <lb/>
     take issue with my right hon. friend in that 
     <lb/>
     respect. He did not state in detail the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion government with reference  
     <lb/>
     to the extension of those Territories. He 
     <lb/>
     simply stated that they did not propose to 
     <lb/>
     extend those Territories until after con<lb break="no"/>ference with other provinces, and that steps 
     <lb/>
     would be taken at once or as soon as con<lb break="no"/>venient to call the  representatives of the  
     <lb/>
     ditferent provinces that might be interested  
     <lb/>
     to come together and to talk this matter 
     <lb/>
     over. It would have been possible to extend   
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba boundaries to the northwest,  
     <lb/>
     to the north or to the northeast at any time ;  
     <lb/>
     these districts were all perfectly open and 
     <lb/>
     they lay there with all their possibilities. 
     <lb/>
     Let us come to one other point, to the very 
     <lb/>
     small point that was taken to-day that 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur  Sbarretti did not see Mr.  
     <lb/>
     Rogers, he did not know Mr. Rogers, he had 
     <lb/>
     no conversation with Mr. Rogers, and that  
     <lb/>
     therefore the whole argument was against 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers. My right hon. friend must  
     <lb/>
     have taken leave of his senses. Was  
     <lb/>
     the Hon. Colin Campbell down here on a  
     <lb/>
     private pleasure trip ? Was he down here 
     <lb/>
     as a private citizen ?   He was down here  
     <lb/>
     with his colleague Mr. Rogers as a delega<lb break="no"/>tion of the Manitoba government backed 
     <lb/>by the resolutions of their legislature as<lb/>official as any commission could be made.<lb/>They were here on an official visit and for<lb/>an official occasion and it does not matter<lb/>a single bit as to whether this conference<lb/>was had with Mr. Rogers or Mr. Campbell.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>.  Oh, oh. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. FOSTER.  Or with the two of them <lb/>together.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh ; order.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>   <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. It was with an accredited<lb/>representative of the Manitoba government.<lb/>But oh, says my right hon. friend—and this<lb/>is his final argument—this was a private<lb/>conference. It was not a public conference.<lb/>In what way would a conference take place ?<lb/>Would it be supposed that Monseigneur<lb/>Sbarretti would put an advertisement in the<lb/>newspapers, would send a bellman about the<lb/>streets to tell everybody that at a certain<lb/>hour he was going to meet the representa<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3954</fw>
         

     tives of the Manitoba government to talk 
     <lb/>
     over certain matters of policy ?   Would he do 
     <lb/>
     that ? In what way could any conference 
     <lb/>
     take place between these gentlemen that 
     <lb/>
     would not ncessarily be a private confer<lb break="no"/>ence ? But it was not private in this sense 
     <lb/>
     that both of the contracting parties have 
     <lb/>
     thought that it was their right and their duty 
     <lb/>
     to take the public into their confidence and 
     <lb/>
     to tell them what transpired at that confer<lb break="no"/>ence. So there does not appear to be much 
     <lb/>
     in that argument. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         There were certain things that my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend however did not deny and they 
     <lb/>
     are quite as remarkable as the things that 
     <lb/>
     he did deny. He has been told times with<lb break="no"/>out number to his face in this House and 
     <lb/>
     he has not once risen to deny it, it has been 
     <lb/>
      very courteously brought to his attention 
     <lb/>
     to-day and he has thoroughly ignored it, that 
     <lb/>
     before he brought down his educational 
     <lb/>
     clause on February 21, 1905, there had been 
     <lb/>
     numerous conferences between himself and 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of that Bill. Will the premier 
     <lb/>
     deny it now ? He does not. Mr. Speaker, I 
     <lb/>
     ask you, I ask this House, I ask the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country if it has come to this that in 
     <lb/>
     Canada the representative of any church I 
     <lb/>
     do not care what it is— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear. hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FOSTER. Through its accredited high<lb break="no"/>est head—must be visited by the premier of 
     <lb/>
     this country before he dares to bring down 
     <lb/>
     the policy to be adopted for the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FOSTER.  The right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has not denied it yet. Then I wish to ask 
     <lb/>
     one other question to aid this thoughtfulness 
     <lb/>
     that I am sure is pervading the country at 
     <lb/>
     the present moment. Is it proper for the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman as leader of a govern<lb break="no"/>ment to have frequent conferences with the 
     <lb/>Papal ablegate in Ottawa with reference to<lb/>a dominant part of his policy in creating<lb/>new provinces and to give the go-by to the<lb/>representatives of the people of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment ?<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
         Mr. Speaker, the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man did not consult the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior who represented the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, who was their sole 
     <lb/>
     representative in the cabinet in reference to 
     <lb/>
     the educational clauses of the Bill, but he 
     <lb/>
     sits in abject silence and allows me to state 
     <lb/>
     here in the House endorsed by that silence 
     <lb/>
     that he did care to consult the Papal delegate 
     <lb/>
     here in Ottawa. The right hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government did not consult the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding). Will the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman tell me now whether 
     <lb/>
     he consulted on that educational clause more 
     <lb/>
     frequently the one than the other, his Post<lb break="no"/>master General or the Papal ablegate ?  
     <lb/>
     Why all this trouble and talk in the country 
     <lb/>
     because Monseigneur Sbarretti  goes to the

     representative of the Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
     and tries to get something for his people 
     <lb/>
     there ? Why all this heated denial, this hedg<lb break="no"/>ing, this twisting. this turning, in respect 
     <lb/>
     of a province which is able to defend 
     <lb/>
     itself, which has the absolute legislative 
     <lb/>
     power confirmed by the highest judicial 
     <lb/>
     authority in the British empire, which 
     <lb/>
     is able to stand up like a man and 
     <lb/>
     defend itself, if it wants to or which 
     <lb/>
     is able like a free man to give what it 
     <lb/>
     pleases if it gives it out of its own generosity 
     <lb/>
     and good will ? Why all this fuss about 
     <lb/>
     such a thing as that, whilst, when it comes to 
     <lb/>
     a question of infants in arms, the wards 
     <lb/>
     of my right hon. friend, when their man<lb break="no"/>hood and their rights for ever are to be given 
     <lb/>
     to them or abridged from them, my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend ignores the Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     ignores other members of his cabinet, but 
     <lb/>
     consults the Papal ablegate. Now, Sir, de<lb break="no"/>spite the fiery and incendiary speech of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
     <lb/>
     which may be repeated here to-day—I do 
     <lb/>
     not know—my position is simply this that 
     <lb/>
     if there was a high representative of the 
     <lb/>
     Methodist church, of the Anglican church, 
     <lb/>
     of the Presbyterian church or of any other 
     <lb/>
     church in this country who was here in 
     <lb/>
     such a position as the Papal ablegate, and if 
     <lb/>
     he were consulted in the same way I should 
     <lb/>
     make exactly the same objection. This 
     <lb/>
     country is not going to have any semblance 
     <lb/>
     of alliance between church and state. The 
     <lb/>
     people of this country come from a stock 
     <lb/>
     who absolutely denied that doctrine years 
     <lb/>
     ago, who fought for its overthrow and en<lb break="no"/>throned the opposite one in the constitution 
     <lb/>
     and laws of their country, and the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada are born and bred to the 
     <lb/>
     same idea and they will stand by it. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment may be as valiant as he pleases 
     <lb/>
     but I tell him that he has raised by 
     <lb/>
     his tortuous course a question in this coun<lb break="no"/>try which far transcends the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     controversy. Why is Monseigneur Sbar<lb break="no"/>retti here ? My hon. friend (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) gave what he considered he 
     <lb/>
     could fairly gather from what he knew of 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances that led to the coming 
     <lb/>
     here of Monseigneur Sbarretti : What were 
     <lb/>
     they ? Dare I analyze them for a moment? 
     <lb/>
     I think we may take the risk even though 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle may frown 
     <lb/>
     against it. I ask this first question in order 
     <lb/>
     to clear matters : Were there any spiritual 
     <lb/>
     difficulties between the bishops and clergy 
     <lb/>
     and the church Catholic of this country 
     <lb/>
     which made it necessary primarily that the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate should be sent to this coun<lb break="no"/>try ? There were no such. It has so been 
     <lb/>
     stated. It has not been denied. That gen<lb break="no"/>tleman would never have been asked for as 
     <lb/>
     he was asked for in his own handwriting by 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman who leads this 
     <lb/>
     government if it had not been that there 
     <lb/>
     was trouble in the Reform camp, that there 
     <lb/>
     was very deep seated trouble and the right 


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3956</fw>
       

     hon. gentleman conceived that it would be 
     <lb/>
     a good stroke of party policy to bring a very 
     <lb/>
     celebrated, distinguished and high dignitary 
     <lb/>
     of the church to minister to his spiritual 
     <lb/>
     consolation ? To minister to the spiritual 
     <lb/>
     needs of my devout friend the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice ? To minister even to the clear 
     <lb/>
     white conscience of my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle ? Oh, no, it was not spiritual con<lb break="no"/>solation they wanted. It was party political 
     <lb/>
     consolation. That and that alone was the 
     <lb/>
     prime motive of the movement for bringing 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate to this couotry. Who 
     <lb/>
     brought him ? Here is a letter.

     Eminence,—I made known to you in the month 
     <lb/>
     of August last, when Your Eminence did me the 
     <lb/>
     honour to grant me an audience, the happy re<lb break="no"/>sult which the mission of Monseigneur Merry 
     <lb/>
     Del Val had accomplished among the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, and the profound impression which 
     <lb/>
     his high Christian virtues and his talents as a 
     <lb/>
     statesman-I say statesman, and the expression 
     <lb/>
     is not too strong—

    Having now returned to my country for seve<lb break="no"/>ral months. I wish to make known to Your 
     <lb/>Eminence that if these happy results are to re<lb break="no"/>main permanent and efficacious, it is desirable, 
     <lb/>if not necessary, that the mission of Monseig<lb break="no"/>neur Merry Del Val should be renewed, or 
     <lb/>rather continued, and that she should be present 
     <lb/>in the midst of us for a more or less prolonged

     I have established, since my return, that 
     <lb/>
     there is among a certain class of Catholics an 
     <lb/>
     underhand agitation against the work accomp<lb break="no"/>lished by Monseigneur Merry Del Val, a work

     of pacification, concord and union.

            <p>
     The same reason of state which inspired His

     Holiness in the affairs of France, and which 
     <lb/>
     caused him to preseribe to the Catholics of 
     <lb/>

     Such is the opinion of a great number of the

     Now, Sir, that letter is signed by Wilfrid

     Laurie r; it was written, I imagine, to His 
     <lb/>
     Eminence Cardinal Rampollo. So much with 
     <lb/>
     reference to that.

            </p>

            <p>
     Let us carry this out a little further. 
     <lb/>
     Not only was this letter written by the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman, who then led and who 
     <lb/>
     now leads the government, but a certain 
     <lb/>
     counsel was arranged for who was accredit<lb break="no"/>ed and instructed by this government to 
     <lb/>
     visit Home and to bring about what the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman had made a beginning 
     <lb/>
     of in the letter which I have just read. The 
     <lb/>
     agent whom they used as an intermediary 
     <lb/>
     was appointed by this government after 
     <lb/>
     they had dismissed—for purposes of state 
     <lb/>
     I wonder, or what ?—one of the best and 
     <lb/>
     most eminent of the legal counsel that this 
     <lb/>
     government has ever had in the city of Lon<lb break="no"/>don. On the 26th of November. at Rome. 
     <lb/>
     in the year 1897, Mr. Russell writes the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing letter :

     <lb/>
     and for party reasons alone, that it is urged.

     <lb/>
     suggest to Your Eminence how desirable it

     service, I unreservedly accept that state<lb break="no"/>ment. It matters little on the point at issue.

 <p>
     Taking these letters as being genuine, and 
     <lb/>
     there is no doubt about it, I think we have 
     <lb/>
     found thus far in our analysis that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Papal ablegate was not brought here 
     <lb/>
     and is not here to-day on account of spiri<lb break="no"/>tual difficulties that have arisen in the Cath<lb break="no"/>olic church of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Nor asked for by the 
     <lb/>
     bishops or clergy of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. This also is suggested to 
     <lb/>
     me : that it is not on record and cannot be 
     <lb/>
     substantiated, that such a personage was 
     <lb/>
     asked for by the bishops and the clergy of 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic church in this Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of Canada. If that is wrong, it is quite 
     <lb/>
     in order for those who know all about it 
     <lb/>
     to deny that assumption; but as it is not 
     <lb/>
     denied, it goes to strengthen the analysis 
     <lb/>
     I am making, and the conclusion that 'par 
     <lb/>
     consequence' the only reason for the able<lb break="no"/>gate being asked to come, and being here 
     <lb/>
     to-day, is in order to help the Reform gov<lb break="no"/>ernment out of difficulties into which they 
     <lb/>
     had involved themselves, and to help them 
     <lb/>
     out of that confusion and trouble by the in<lb break="no"/>tervention of a higher dignitary of the church. 
     <lb/>
     This House and this country will know in 
     <lb/>
     a moment whether that inference is a viol<lb break="no"/>ent one or a fair one. Why, in the whole 
     <lb/>
     tenor of those letters, the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's and the accredited agent's, there 
     <lb/>
     is no assumption that he has come here 
     <lb/>
     for spiritual or church purposes. It is all 
     <lb/>
     put on the basis of political or state rea<lb break="no"/>sons. What were the difficulties he was 
     <lb/>
     to settle ? If they had put it honestly in 
     <lb/>
     black and white, they would have said: the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties amongst Reformers and between 
     <lb/>
     Reformers. and Conservatives, and we want 
     <lb/>
     a high dignity of the church to come here 
     <lb/>
     and help us to smooth out those political 
     <lb/>
     difficulties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there is another very singular thing 
     <lb/>
     which Mr. Russell put into that statement 
     <lb/>
     of his to His Eminence, that is, that his 
     <lb/>
     senders. including the right hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     who leads the government, writing in 1897, 
     <lb/>
     after the right hon. gentleman had declared 
     <lb/>
     that he had settled satisfactorily the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba school question, had instructed Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Russell to remind His Holiness through His 
     <lb/>
     Eminence that they did not pretend to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that ' the concessions were perfect, but 
     <lb/>
     they begged His Holiness to take them as 
     <lb/>
     the beginning of <choice><sic>justire</sic><corr>justice</corr></choice>.' Now, Sir, is that 
     <lb/>
     straightforward conduct ? The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, I said, is paying for his tor<lb break="no"/>tuous policy. So he is. In 1896 he saw a 
     <lb/>
     bridge by which he could get into power; 
     <lb/>
     he was anxious to cross the bridge; he 
     <lb/>
     threw his principles, the constitutional prin<lb break="no"/>ciples on which he had prided himself so 
     <lb/>
     much, to the winds; he also threw to the 
     <lb/>
     winds his solicitude for the Catholic minor<lb break="no"/>ity in Manitoba; and after he had crossed 
     <lb/>
     the bridge by a promise to more than one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     half of this Dominion that he was the 
     <lb/>
     champion of provincial rights, and by a

     promise to the forty-one per cent which 
     <lb/>
     has been referred to in this House that 
     <lb/>
     he would give them something more and 
     <lb/>
     better than the Tupper government could 
     <lb/>
     give by the Remedial Bill, and had attained 
     <lb/>
     p-wer by these means, he negotiated pri<lb break="no"/>vately or publicly with the Manitoba gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and then announced to the coun<lb break="no"/>try that he had settled the question. As 
     <lb/>
     an honourable statesman, he ought to have 
     <lb/>
     allowed it to remain settled. The Manito<lb break="no"/>ba government came to him and said : this 
     <lb/>
     is our utmost concession ; and if he, as the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of this country, took it as 
     <lb/>
     their utmost concession, why should he send 
     <lb/>
     an agent to Rome to say to His Holiness : 
     <lb/>
     I do not offer this concession as a perfect 
     <lb/>
     settlement ; it is only the beginning of jus<lb break="no"/>tice ; send out your highest dignitary to re<lb break="no"/>side permanently in Ottawa, so that, by in<lb break="no"/>sistence, by methods proper in themselves 
     <lb/>
     from our standpoint, he can bring to bear 
     <lb/>
     a tireless, resistless pressure, in times of 
     <lb/>
     party stress, in time of provincial trouble, 
     <lb/>
     when a government has a small support, 
     <lb/>
     may be, to tide them over, or when they 
     <lb/>
     are exceedingly anxious to get their rights 
     <lb/>
     in point of territory, he shall be in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to use the influence which he knows 
     <lb/>
     so well how to use, and backed up by us 
     <lb/>
     at the proper time this beginning of 
     <lb/>
     justice may blossom out into the perfect 
     <lb/>
     fulfilment of separate schools for the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. That is why Monseig<lb break="no"/>neur Sbarretti is here today. If it had not 
     <lb/>been for that reason and that policy of 
     <lb/>conduct, he would not be here to-day. What 
     <lb/>futile reasoning for the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, after thirty years of political battle, 
     <lb/>to get up and make this kind of defence 
     <lb/>before the country, and think it will go 
     <lb/>down with the people: "Monseigneur Sbar<lb break="no"/>retti did what he was brought here to do; 
     <lb/>did what I asked him to be sent here for; 
     <lb/>did what I sent an agent to Rome to get 
     <lb/>him appointed to do; he did it, but he had 
     <lb/>no authority from me to deliver the goods.' 
     <lb/>Does the right hon. gentleman see the two 
     <lb/>horns of his dilemma ? You brought him 
     <lb/>here; you have kept him here for those five 
     <lb/>or eight years ; you brought him for those 
     <lb/>purposes; you have kept him for those pur<lb break="no"/>poses; and when he comes to the final, cru<lb break="no"/>cial point, and uses his influence, you dis<lb break="no"/>own him. If that is not cowardice, then 
     <lb/>let it go by its own imputation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     But my right hon. friend does worse than 
     <lb/>
     that. He gets up before this House and 
     <lb/>
     this country, and says : 'If Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sbarretti made that promise of an extension 
     <lb/>
     of the boundaries of Manitoba as a politi<lb break="no"/>cal consideration to the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba for those two proposed amendments, 
     <lb/>
     he did it without any authority or any well- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     grounded hope that we would supplement 
     <lb/>
     his promise.' Come now, I will put a ques<lb break="no"/>tion to my right hon. friend : Suppose that 
     <lb/>
     Monseigneur Sbarretti had obtained those 
     <lb/>
     two amendments made in the Manitoba law, 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3962</fw>
          

     and then had come to you and told you 
     <lb/>
     what he had done, and had read the whole 
     <lb/>
     of that correspondence, giving the raison 
     <lb/>
     d'etre of his being here, would you have re<lb break="no"/>fused to implement it ? There is a question 
     <lb/>
     for my right hon. friend. I will put an<lb break="no"/>other, which is more searching still : When 
     <lb/>
     you say that Monseigneur Sbarretti held 
     <lb/>
     out a political consideration to the envoys 
     <lb/>
     from Manitoba, and that he had no right to 
     <lb/>
     do it, what estimate do you place on Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Sbarretti yourself? I refuse to be<lb break="no"/>lieve that a high dignitary of the church, 
     <lb/>
     such as Monseigneur Sbarretti is, a man 
     <lb/>
     of his training and his parts, would by a 
     <lb/>
     trick endeavour to get two amendments for 
     <lb/>
     his co-religionists in the Manitoba school 
     <lb/>
     law, unless he knew that if they were 
     <lb/>
     granted, the other thing would be. Along 
     <lb/>
     what by-ways and crooked paths the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman is forcing himself now, as 
     <lb/>
     a result of his misdeeds, to tread with sor<lb break="no"/>row and humiliation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I have no more to say on this 
     <lb/>
     question at the present time, except to re<lb break="no"/>iterate again that my right hon. friend may 
     <lb/>
     take this home and keep it. The people of 
     <lb/>
    Canada demand that there shall be no pos<lb break="no"/>sible alliance between church and state in 
     <lb/>this country. A bishop of the Methodist 
     <lb/>church has no more right to be consulted 
     <lb/>than a layman of the Methodist church 
     <lb/>in reference to political matters in this 
     <lb/>country. And so with reference to every 
     <lb/>other representative of every other church. 
     <lb/>But can you compare a bishop of the Me<lb break="no"/>thodist church or a bishop of the Anglican 
     <lb/>church with Monseigneur Sbarretti? Who 
     <lb/>does not know that, with my right hon. 
     <lb/>friend in power, when Monseigneur Sbar<lb break="no"/>retti, representing forty-one per cent of the 
     <lb/>people of this country, makes a plea, he 
     <lb/>holds out a hope, through his authority of 
     <lb/>a fulfilment that can be given by no other 
     <lb/>church or collection of churches in this 
     <lb/>country. Now, I can see that some one 
     <lb/>will rise on the other side and declare that 
     <lb/>I have made an incendiary speech. Why, 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman himself, seeing 
     <lb/>that he had no argument, had to have re<lb break="no"/>course to that kind of declamation, and it 
     <lb/>was very signfificant of the weakness of 
     <lb/>his case. For Monseigneur Sbarretti him<lb break="no"/>self I have every respect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Quite a number of skeptics 
     <lb/>
     on that side of the House. But I show 
     <lb/>
     my respect for Monseigneur Sbarretti by 
     <lb/>
     clearing him of the imputations which the 
     <lb/>
     position of my right hon. friend fastens up<lb break="no"/>on him. So far as the Papal ablegate's pos<lb break="no"/>ition in this country is concerned, so far as 
     <lb/>
     his position as a spiritual envoy from the 
     <lb/>
     Church of Rome is concerned, he is welcome 
     <lb/>
     to this country may he stay here and grow 
     <lb/>
     up with this country and help to make 
     <lb/>
     it great. So far as his mission is confined 
     <lb/>
     to spiritual purposes in his own church, 
 

            <pb n="3963" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_3963.jpg"/>

     to the reconcilement of differences of doc<lb break="no"/>trine, or of polity, or of church govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or anything in that broad domain, no 
     <lb/>
     one will cavil with his existence here, and 
     <lb/>
     no one but will wish him a long and happy 
     <lb/>
     stay. But when he undertakes, presuming 
     <lb/>
     on the raison d'etre of his position in this 
     <lb/>
     country, to set up a claim that he can 
     <lb/>
     interfere in the politics of Canada and use 
     <lb/>
     inducements by his interference, then I say 
     <lb/>
     that no protest can be too strong against 
     <lb/>
     that, and I believe it will be supported by 
     <lb/>
     the voice of Canada.

     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. McCARTHY</persName> (North Simcoe). 
     <lb/>
     One thought occurred to me when the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) was 
     <lb/>
     addressing this House : How long is he pre<lb break="no"/>pared to stand by the principles he has en<lb break="no"/>unciated this afternoon ? Coming from 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, and as a consti<lb break="no"/>tuent of the hon. member for North Toronto, 
     <lb/>
     I have a right to ask him this : Are these 
     <lb/>
     clothes which he puts on this afternoon to 
     <lb/>
     be discarded as were the clothes he wore 
     <lb/>
     prior to 1896 should he be again defeated ? 
     <lb/>
     If he was speaking sincerely this afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     I would welcome his declaration and would 
     <lb/>
     be pleased with it. But I have heard him 
     <lb/>
     stand on platforms in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and denounce the late Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy for the views which he entertained, 
     <lb/>
     I have heard him say that no such sec<lb break="no"/>tarian cry as Mr. McCarthy dared to raise 
     <lb/>
     would ever have any effect in this country ; 
     <lb/>
     I have heard him say, when Mr. McCarthy 
     <lb/>
     was speaking on behalf of Manitoba in 
     <lb/>
     another school case, that he must not for<lb break="no"/>get minorities ; I have heard him say that 
     <lb/>
     to sit in a Conservative administration he 
     <lb/>
     would bury those principles, and he did 
     <lb/>
     bury them from 1882 to 1896. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     I ask the hon. gentleman now whether he 
     <lb/>
     has cast off for ever the yoke of the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     under which he lived from 1882 to 1896 ?

     <lb/>yoke, when one of his colleagues who now 
     <lb/>sits beside him, hounded Dalton McCarthy 
     <lb/>from one end of Ontario to the other, saying 
     <lb/>that he was not worthy to be called a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant champion, because, forsooth, he had 
     <lb/>a Catholic stepdaughter who lived in his 
     <lb/>house.

     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. May I ask my hon. friend

     a question ? Does he refer to me when

     heard what I said. I said his colleague

     who sat beside him, the hon. member for

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Mr. Haggart dealt at great length with the

     school question, and then launched out into a 
     <lb/>
     personal attack on Mr. Dalton McCarthy whom 
     <lb/>
     he called ' that little gentleman.' Mr. McCarthy

     was, the minister said, putting on airs and

     Those are the words of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Lanark. Now why do I say that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman from North Toronto lived 
     <lb/>
     under the yoke of the hierarchy of Que<lb break="no"/>bec from 1882 to 1896 ?

     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. What do you call the

     hierarchy of Quebec, please ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. McCARTHY</persName>. I am not speak<lb break="no"/>ing disrespectfully of them, I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing as I would of the Synod of my own 
     <lb/>
     church, or the general assembly of the 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterian church. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     must know what the hierarchy of his own 
     <lb/>
     church is. The hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Bourassa) spoke of it the other day. 
     <lb/>
     Now I ask the hon. gentleman from North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto, who has just made a speech, if he 
     <lb/>
     was sincere ? If I thought he was sincere 
     <lb/>
     I would not be speaking as I am now.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. McCARTHY</persName>. It is all very 
     <lb/>
     well to say, hear, hear, but I tell you I 
     <lb/>
     come from a stock that knows what it is 
     <lb/>
     to be jeered at, just as you are jeering at 
     <lb/>
     me now. I know that prior to 1896 they 
     <lb/>
     hounded us from one end of Canada to 
     <lb/>
     the other. They spoke disrespectfully of us,

     they told us we were bigots, they told us 
     <lb/>
     that the views we were then expressing, 
     <lb/>
     which were in accord with their own views 
     <lb/>
     to-day, were not sincere, and were not in 
     <lb/>
     accord with our convictions. In 1896 when 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Dalton McCarthy defined his policy on 
     <lb/>
     the Jesuits Estates Bill, what was the 
     <lb/>
     position of the hon. gentleman then ? We 
     <lb/>
     then pointed out to them that they were 
     <lb/>
     leading to the very trouble that exists to<lb break="no"/>day, they were recognizing in that Bill a 
     <lb/>
     Papal power which was thereby given the 
     <lb/>
     right and power to dispose of. some millions 
     <lb/>
     of the peoples' money in this country. These 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, who take another position 
     <lb/>
     to-day, said then : Let us stand by pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, toleration and moderation, 
     <lb/>
     let that go on as it is. And when we ob<lb break="no"/>jected to the dual language clause in the 
     <lb/>
     Territorial Act, and in the Manitoba Act, 
     <lb/>
     what did these hon. gentlemen say then? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Who are 'we.'

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. MCCARTHY</persName>. Mr. Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy. I do not think the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     can deny that I have a right to say ' we.' I 
     <lb/>
     do not think the hon. gentleman will deny 
     <lb/>
     that I have the right to say 'we.' The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Northumherland (Mr. Coch<lb break="no"/>rane) will remember having seen me in some 
     <lb/>
     of these campaigns, when mud was thrown 
     <lb/>
     at us because of the position we took. 
     <lb/>
     When we asked you not to coerce Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     were you acting under the dictation of the 
     <lb/>
     heirarchy or not ? I say most explicitly 
     <lb/>
     you were. And when the bishops of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church threatened to excommun<lb break="no"/>cate the opponents of the Tupper govern<lb break="no"/>ment, when the bishops of that church 
     <lb/>
     talked about the opponents of that govern<lb break="no"/>ment as ' hell-inspired hypocrites,' were you 
     <lb/>
     acting under the dictation of the heirarchy 
     <lb/>
     or not ? Were you under the yoke of the 
     <lb/>
     'heirarchy or not ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. What does the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) mean by 
     <lb/>
     ' yoke ' ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. MCCARTHY</persName>. If the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Lennox) wants to know, I will 
     <lb/>
     tell him. The hon. gentleman allowed that 
     <lb/>
     yoke to be placed upon him in 1896, when 
     <lb/>
     he contested the riding of North Simcoe. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman remembers the result, 
     <lb/>
     and I do not want to rub it in too much, as 
     <lb/>
     it would be painful to him to recollect that 
     <lb/>
     he lost his deposit. I say I am perfectly 
     <lb/>
     justified in what I have said so far ; and I 
     <lb/>
     point out that this very trouble which has 
     <lb/>
     taken place was brought to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of Finance (Mr. Foster) 
     <lb/>
     when he was in the governments of Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald and Sir John Thompson. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Dalton McCarthy urged them both to get 
     <lb/>
     rid of section 14 of that Act—Mr. Dal<lb break="no"/>ton McCarthy had moved to have it re<lb break="no"/>pealed. But the hon. gentleman voted in 
     <lb/>favour of allowing it to remain on the 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3966</fw>
         

     statute-book, and that is largely the cause 
     <lb/>
     of the present difficulty. And now, forsooth. 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman says that this Papal dele<lb break="no"/>gate is improperly interfering in our affairs. 
     <lb/>
     In that I am prepared to agree with him, 
     <lb/>
     and I do agree with him. But I want sin<lb break="no"/>cerity. And, if I do nothing more than draw 
     <lb/>
     attention to what has taken place in the 
     <lb/>
     past and to what is taking place now, I 
     <lb/>
     shall show to the satisfaction of every 
     <lb/>
     reasonable man that it only depends on 
     <lb/>
     which party is in power, because whichever 
     <lb/>
     one is in power always do these things. 
     <lb/>
     You only get a corporal's guard in this 
     <lb/>
     House to vote for a straight motion against 
     <lb/>
     any such position as is being taken to-day. 
     <lb/>
     I say that advisedly, and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) knows it. 
     <lb/>
     What was the position in 1896 ? It was 
     <lb/>
     this : The hierarchy of Quebec were behind 
     <lb/>
     the Tapper government, and were threaten<lb break="no"/>ing to excommunicate the people who re<lb break="no"/>fused to vote in favour of the Tupper gov<lb break="no"/>ernment at their dictation.

     about Archbishop Cleary, of Kingston, and

     his speeches? What about Archbishop La<lb break="no"/>fleche? In 1896, the bishops of the Roman

     I deny absolutely what the hon. gentleman

     House a Bill to coerce the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba at the request and under the dictation

     the first time that a McCarthy has stood 
     <lb/>
     alone in this House; and, please God, if 
     <lb/>
     necessary, it will not be the last. I say that, 
     <lb/>
     in 1896—and hon. gentlemen opposite do not 
     <lb/>
     seem to like me to get too close to that—we 
     <lb/>
     found the state of alfairs that I have spoken 
     <lb/>
     of. And here is the peculiarity of the situ<lb break="no"/>ation. In that year, we found the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who are now in opposition in close 
     <lb/>
     alliance with the bishops of the church of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. It became neces<lb break="no"/>sary, apparently, if justice was to be done, for 
     <lb/>
     the Papal power to be asked to interfere. If 
     <lb/>
     we are to believe what we have heard with<lb break="no"/>in the last two days, the Papal delegate 
     <lb/>
     came to settle some difficulties—and un<lb break="no"/>questionably they were difficulties with re<lb break="no"/>gard to political affairs,—between the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on this side of the House and 
     <lb/>
     their bishops. If the Papal delegate is in<lb break="no"/>terfering I declare his action is highly im<lb break="no"/>proper and I denounce it. But, I want this 
     <lb/>
     House and country to understand that if 
     <lb/>
     the respective parties expect to make capital 
     <lb/>
     out of it, their whole record on the subject 
     <lb/>
     should be considered. Take the history of 
     <lb/>
     Canada from confederation down to the 
     <lb/>
     present day, and how many members have 
     <lb/>
    ever stood up to vote squarely on an issue 
     <lb/>of this kind? Twenty-one, I believe, is the 
     <lb/>

     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3968</fw>



largest number that ever united to prevent 
     <lb/>such encroachments as these, in regard to 
     <lb/>which, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Foster) 
     <lb/>would lead us to believe, he was so sincere 
     <lb/>in protesting. If so it is the first time in 
     <lb/>twenty-three years that he has so spoken.

            <p><persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. W. H. BENNETT</persName> (East Simeoe). I do 
     <lb/>not know that I need say much in reply to 
     <lb/>the hon. member (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) who 
     <lb/>has just taken his seat. That hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has displayed his political stock in 
     <lb/>trade. I think the House and the country 
     <lb/>will acknowledge that the late Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy was a man of considerable emi<lb break="no"/>nence both at the bar and in this House. His 
     <lb/>record is history. But I do not know that 
     <lb/>anybody would venture to express a belief 
     <lb/>that the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. 
     <lb/>L. G. McCarthy) will ever be noticed in his<lb break="no"/>tory. The hon. gentleman spoke at a meet<lb break="no"/>ing in Toronto at short time ago, and was then 
     <lb/>very boastful of his Protestantism and of 
     <lb/>the Protestantism of his family before him. 
     <lb/>He told the people assembled on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion that the cry of equal rights and oppo<lb break="no"/>sition to French domination in Canada was 
     <lb/>the cry he had always raised in North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe; that on that policy he had nailed his 
     <lb/>colours to the mast and would stand or fall 
     <lb/>by them. There was a contest last fall in 
     <lb/>North Sinicoe. as there was in the rest of 
     <lb/>the Dominion, and I challenge the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman to produce a scintila of proof that he 
     <lb/>even opened his mouth upon the equal rights 
     <lb/>question or any such question as he has 
     <lb/>dealt with before the House to-day.

     <lb/>been in issue in my campaign last election. 
     <lb/>I stated that in the first and second cam<lb break="no"/>paigns it was an issue. But, if the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman wants to know I can tell him that I 
     <lb/>can produce evidence that I stated at

     election was whether or not the Collingwood 
     <lb/>
     harbour should have the benefit of a large 
     <lb/>
     grant of government money. And that was 
     <lb/>
     the whole question. As to the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's (Mr. L. G. McCarthy's) political 
     <lb/>
     stock in trade in that riding, I can tell the 
     <lb/>
     House that it does not carry the people as 
     <lb/>
     his late uncle used to do. In the township of 
     <lb/>
     Vespra the late Dalton McCarthy used to 
     <lb/>
     get a majority of about one hundred ; the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member (Mr. L. G. McCarthy) was in 
     <lb/>
     a minority of thirty in the last election. 
     <lb/>

<p>
     This hon. gentleman was in a minority 
     <lb/>
     of thirty, and Sir, this hon. gentleman in<lb break="no"/>stead of parading this racial revenge ques<lb break="no"/>tion and this religious question in North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe is always toadying to the other ele<lb break="no"/>ment. He had an appointment to make in 
     <lb/>
     Barrie a little while ago and, expecting that 
     <lb/>
     the township of Tiny which has a large 
     <lb/>
     French vote would be attached to North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe. the hon. gentleman threw aside all 
     <lb/>
     his Protestant friends and pushed them 
     <lb/>
     over in favour of a French Canadian Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic. Will the hon. gentleman deny 
     <lb/>
     that ? I think he won't. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. MCCARTHY</persName>. I will deny one 
     <lb/>
     part of it. that I had any anticipation that 
     <lb/>
     the township of Tiny was going into North 
     <lb/>
     Simcoe. I will admit that I recommended 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of Emile Sevigny as care<lb break="no"/>taker of the public building in Barrie and 
     <lb/>
     i am not ashamed of that appointment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. That shows how deep 
     <lb/>
     his Protestantism is. He had his friends 
     <lb/>
     riding the Protestant horse for him from 
     <lb/>
     end to end of the riding and yet they all 
     <lb/>
     had to be thrown overboard when at the 
     <lb/>
     last moment the hon. gentleman driven to 
     <lb/>
     'the wall—for he had a majority of only 
     <lb/>
     thirty or forty—was in this position that 
     <lb/>
     he had to toady to the Catholic vote, and 
     <lb/>
     he dared not open his mouth in North Sim<lb break="no"/>coe on that question, and had he dared to 
     <lb/>
     do so he would not be here to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now apart from the speech of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman what is all this question about? 
     <lb/>
     It is, as has been put by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, a question as to whether or not 
     <lb/>
     any member of this government is respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the presence of the Papal delegate 
     <lb/>
     in this country and if any member of this 
     <lb/>
     government or of the government as a whole 
     <lb/>
     commissioned the Papal ablegate to have 
     <lb/>
     this conference with Mr. Colin Campbell. 
     <lb/>
     We heard a denial yesterday by one member 
     <lb/>
     of the government. What was that? When 
     <lb/>
     it was charged by some gentlemen on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House that the government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada as constituted to-day had asked for 
     <lb/>
     the presence of the Papal ablegate in this 
     <lb/>
     country, up gravely rose the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General to say that he as a member of the 
     <lb/>
     government had not asked for the presence 
     <lb/>
     of the Papal ablegate here. His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate does not say that he did 
     <lb/>
     not consult some member of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment as to this interview with Mr. Colin 
     <lb/>
     Campbell. He makes a specific statement 
     <lb/>
     that he was not instructed by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. but he did not make the statement 
     <lb/>
     that some hon. member of this cabinet did 
     <lb/>
     not ask him to have that interview and 
     <lb/>
     there is no denial by every member of the 
     <lb/>
     government specifically on that point. It 
     <lb/>
     has gone forth in the public press. it has 
     <lb/>
     gone forth from the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and hon. gentlemen on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House that in all these negotiations the 
     <lb/>
     premier, day in and day out, has consulted 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3970</fw>
          

     the Papal ablegate as to the terms of this 
     <lb/>
     measure. That is not denied. The premier 
     <lb/>
     has had ample opportunities of denying it 
     <lb/>
     but he has not done so. The position of the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate is reduced to this that he 
     <lb/>
     has made a specific denial of the statement 
     <lb/>
     that he was instructed by the government, 
     <lb/>
     but he has not made a specific denial of 
     <lb/>
     the statement that he was not consulted 
     <lb/>
     by some member of it. Every one admits 
     <lb/>
     the ability and the standing of the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate in the church of which he is so 
     <lb/>
     distinguished a member, and does any one 
     <lb/>
     believe that the Papal ablegate would be 
     <lb/>
     so lost to any sense of common reason that 
     <lb/>
     he of his own accord and off his own bat, 
     <lb/>
     would go about negotiating as he has been 
     <lb/>
     doing ? I am not going to traverse the 
     <lb/>
     ground that has been gone over by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Toronto as to the 
     <lb/>
     equestrian performances of the premier on 
     <lb/>
     this question. The Prime Minister has 
     <lb/>
     played this game of fast and loose on this 
     <lb/>
     question from end to end of Canada. He 
     <lb/>
     has gone before Ontario posing as a per<lb break="no"/>fect Ajax defying the lightning as one who 
     <lb/>
     has been assailed by the hierarchy, and ask<lb break="no"/>ing Protestant votes on that score. It is 
     <lb/>
     amusing to read the utterances of that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in Ontario when he felt that he 
     <lb/>
     had not the power of the church behind him. 
     <lb/>
     Let me read his utterance in Toronto on a 
     <lb/>
     certain occasion when he thought it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary for the exigencies of his political 
     <lb/>
     party to make a bid for Ontario support. 
     <lb/>
     At a great meeting in September, 1889, in 
     <lb/>
     Toronto speaking on the Jesuits Estates 
     <lb/>
     Bill, he said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Now I believe that the whole of that Act 
     <lb/>
     would have passed without any trouble what<lb break="no"/>ever, but for the fact that the name of the Pope 
     <lb/>
     is prominently introduced in it, and that it 
     <lb/>
     was construed in such a manner as to mean a 
     <lb/>
     thing which I shall presently discuss—that it 
     <lb/>
     was putting the supremacy of the Pope over the

     to-day and treat in that slighting manner 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate in Canada as he did on 
     <lb/>
     that occasion in Toronto. In the speech, as 
     <lb/>
     it is reported, he was not meeting with a 
     <lb/>
     very responsive welcome, and during the 
     <lb/>
     course of his address certain things that he 
     <lb/>
     mentioned were hissed by the audience, and 
     <lb/>
     he saw that he had to go the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     horse. And what did he do ? He made ex<lb break="no"/>actly that kind of an appeal knowing of 
     <lb/>
     course it might touch the palate of the 
     <lb/>
     crowd although he was ridiculing the church 
     <lb/>
     of which he is a member. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman then as usual had two strings 
     <lb/>
     to his bow. His language then was very 
     <lb/>
     different from that in his address at a great 
     <lb/>
     meeting in the province of Quebec when 
     <lb/>
     he said that he thanked God there was not 
     <lb/>
     an Orangeman in the Liberal party. And 
     <lb/>
     how they cheered him to the echo when he 
     <lb/>
     volunteered that statement voluntarily to 
     <lb/>
     them ! The right hon. gentleman has never 
     <lb/>
     denied that statement since. I have heard 
     <lb/>
     it charged in this House, I have seen gentle<lb break="no"/>men with stacks of declarations of gentle<lb break="no"/>men who were present and what was the re<lb break="no"/>sult, there was no specific denial that he 
     <lb/>
     had made those statements. The fact is he 
     <lb/>
     has been pirouetting on both toes and he 
     <lb/>
     is where he is to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As far as this meeting between these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen from Manitoba and the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate is concerned, I have only this to 
     <lb/>
     say that I believe the Papal ablegate was 
     <lb/>
     quite within his commission and his duties 
     <lb/>
     in inviting these gentlemen to meet him. 
     <lb/>
     He had a perfect right to do that. The 
     <lb/>
     Papal delegate came to this country at the 
     <lb/>
     request of the right hon. gentleman and 
     <lb/>
     his political friends and he has been in 
     <lb/>
     close touch with the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     all through these proceedings and has had 
     <lb/>
     frequent consultations with the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in reference to the terms to be 
     <lb/>
     contained in these Bills. These statements 
     <lb/>
     have all gone forth specifically, that the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman had these meetings 
     <lb/>
     and the right hon. gentleman has had ample 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to deny it but has not done so. 
     <lb/>
     It is with the right hon. gentleman that 
     <lb/>
     the quarrel of the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     rests and not with the Papal ablegate at 
     <lb/>
     all. The Papal ablegate has a perfect 
     <lb/>
     right to be in this country just as any other 
     <lb/>
     gentleman might have as a plenipotentiary or 
     <lb/>
     ambassador to any power, but I do say that 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country will hold the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman and the members of 
     <lb/>
     his government responsible for what has 
     <lb/>
     gone on. Talk about the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man leading a responsible and united party 
     <lb/>
     which is behind him on this question. Why 
     <lb/>
     it is openly seen by the attitude of the On<lb break="no"/>tario members not only of the cabinet, but 
     <lb/>
     of the House that they are all in a condi<lb break="no"/>tion of doubt and fear on this question. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. Postmaster General will not dare 
     <lb/>
     to take up the challenge that was thrown 
     <lb/>
     to him by my hon. friend from South York 
     <lb/>

     (Mr. Maclean) the other day to resign his 
     <lb/>
     seat and let the question be tested in the 
     <lb/>
     country. The hon. member for London 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Hyman), who is discharging the duties 
     <lb/>
     of the Minister of Public Works and has 
     <lb/>
     been discharging them for the past year, 
     <lb/>
     dare not go to the city of London for re<lb break="no"/>election as Minister of Public Works. Why? 
     <lb/>
     Because of this incubus of the school ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I need not refer to other reasons 
     <lb/>
     that deter that hon. gentleman from going 
     <lb/>
     back there, but if the school question were 
     <lb/>
     out of the issue altogether I doubt very 
     <lb/>
     much if he would seek a contest there. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman dare not go back to his rid<lb break="no"/>ing and face this school question as it pre<lb break="no"/>sents itself to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people of Canada have no quarrel 
     <lb/>
     with the Papal ablegate. They have no 
     <lb/>
     quarrel with the powers at Rome for send<lb break="no"/>ing the Papal ablegate here to do what he 
     <lb/>
     came to do. He came here to try and get 
     <lb/>
     restitution of rights, from certain gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who obtained power and place by misrepre<lb break="no"/>sentation and fraud as against the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic electors of this country which some 
     <lb/>
     day they will answer for and must answer 
     <lb/>
     for and the people are biding their time to 
     <lb/>
     get even with them. There is one consola<lb break="no"/>tion for hon. gentlemen who sit upon the 
     <lb/>
     treasury benches and those who support 
     <lb/>
     them and that is that they will have the 
     <lb/>
     full tenure of the five year parliament be<lb break="no"/>cause they will not venture to test public 
     <lb/>
     feeling before their time expires. I should 
     <lb/>
     not have risen but for the remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Simcoe. I think the 
     <lb/>
     House is tired of the changes rung by that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman in regard to the part which he 
     <lb/>
     has played in the political history of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     While that hon. gentleman dilates at great 
     <lb/>
     length in this House he is as silent as a 
     <lb/>
     mouse on this question when he goes into 
     <lb/>
     North Simcoe. I have had placed in my hand 
     <lb/>
     the issue of the Toronto newspaper which 
     <lb/>
     published the speech made by that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman in Toronto on the occasion of the 
     <lb/>
     Massey Hall meeting which will prove that 
     <lb/>
     what I stated was actually borne out by 
     <lb/>
     the facts. Speaking at that meeting Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy said :

     Hawkstone he mentioned this question. The

     made for certainly he was right in describ<lb break="no"/>ing it as an inflammatory speech. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, in that speech, certainly tried to 
     <lb/>
     inflame the minds of those in this country 
     <lb/>
     who distrust or dislike the Catholic church 
     <lb/>
     and the Catholic religion. The whole tenor 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman's speech, was such as 
     <lb/>
     to raise Protestant prejudice and Protestant 
     <lb/>
     feeling against this government because he 
     <lb/>
     implied that this government, led by a 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic, was in constant touch with 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic church in regard to 
     <lb/>
     secular affairs in this country. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member himself on former occasions has 
     <lb/>
     complained, that he and his government 
     <lb/>
     when he was in the government, was sub<lb break="no"/>jected to similar attacks, not to similar at<lb break="no"/>tacks by Liberals or by those opposed to 
     <lb/>
     him, but similar attacks from the ranks of 
     <lb/>
     his own party when the late member for 
     <lb/>
     West York (Mr. Wallace) and the present 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     separated themselves from the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party ceased their support of the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive government in 1896 and tried, as mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government then said, to raise 
     <lb/>
     Protestant and English speaking feeling 
     <lb/>
     against the government at that time. Sir, I 
     <lb/>
     would like the hon. member for North Tor<lb break="no"/>onto to recall a speech he made in 1896, 
     <lb/>
     when, replying to an interruption from the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey, he used these 
     <lb/>
     words, and I think perhaps he will admit 
     <lb/>
     that when he uttered these broad-minded 
     <lb/>
     words he was more of a statesman than he 
     <lb/>
     is to-day in making what he himself has 
     <lb/>
     characterized as an inflammatory speech. 
     <lb/>
     What did the hon. gentleman then say? He 
     <lb/>
     was not then representing a strong Protes<lb break="no"/>tant constituency in the Protestant pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, but he was a member of 
     <lb/>
     the then government of Sir Charles Tupper, 
     <lb/>
     representing the maritime provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     he said this, referring to a speech which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey had quoted or 
     <lb/>
     alluded to as his authority:

     hon. friend the leader of the government

     assumptions, on implications and assump<lb break="no"/>tions which are not borne out by the inter<lb break="no"/>view of Mr. Rogers and which are still less 
     <lb/>
     borne out, but are in fact absolutely re<lb break="no"/>futed by the statement issued by the Apos<lb break="no"/>tolic delegate. The hon. gentleman quoted 
     <lb/>
     some words from Mr. Rogers' statement and 
     <lb/>
     he pointed out that something might be im<lb break="no"/>plied by that statement. I venture to say, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that anybody who reads the statement 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Rogers, in Winnipeg, will say that 
     <lb/>
     there is a great deal more implied in that 
     <lb/>
     statement than there is actually contained 
     <lb/>
     in it, and that there is an evident intention 
     <lb/>
     by the wording of the statement to make im<lb break="no"/>plications and insinuations that the gentle<lb break="no"/>man who gave that statement did not dare 
     <lb/>
     to come out and state as matters of fact. 
     <lb/>
     These implications and insinuations are not 
     <lb/>
     founded on facts, but they are false to the 
     <lb/>
     record and they are untrue. Sir, the very 
     <lb/>
     first thing that would strike anybody in 
     <lb/>
     reading that statement, the first thing which 
     <lb/>
     i I confess, myself, impressed me was that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers had met the ablegate here in

     When speaking a few moments ago, the

     leader of the opposition laid stress upon the

     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition made that state<lb break="no"/>ment he knew that yesterday the Prime

     The leader of the opposition is unfair, he 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     denials, and that he was at liberty to as<lb break="no"/>sume that there had been collusion and 
     <lb/>
     arrangement between the government, or 
     <lb/>
     any member of the government, and the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate. In view of the denial of 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister and of Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sbarretti, the leader of the opposition this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon allowed the impression to remain 
     <lb/>
     on the House that he was not aware yet, 
     <lb/>
     that he had heard no denial yet, and that 
     <lb/>
     the public were still in doubt as to whether 
     <lb/>
     the members of the government, or the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister himself, had authorized the 
     <lb/>
     statement which was attributed to Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Sbarretti. There is nothing clear<lb break="no"/>er before the public of Canada to-day than 
     <lb/>
     the fact, in the first place, that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment themselves, through the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter, had stated that they knew nothing 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3976</fw>
         

     whatever about it, that no authority was 
     <lb/>
     ever given to Monseigneur Sbarretti for such 
     <lb/>
     a proposal ; and further, that Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sharretti himself has declared that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had no information of or connec<lb break="no"/>tion with that statement on his part. I 
     <lb/>
     therefore say that the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion was disingenuous and unfair to the 
     <lb/>
     government, as well as to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country, whom he trys to lead away from 
     <lb/>
     the true facts.

            </p>

            <p>
     An impression was tried to be created this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon that the right hon. the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the government was inconsistent in the fact 
     <lb/>
     that he had said at one time that the pre<lb break="no"/>sent school arrangements in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba were satisfactory, and that there 
     <lb/>
     had been brought about by his interven<lb break="no"/>tion a satisfactory settlement of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba school question ; not by coercion, not 
     <lb/>
     by remedial legislation, but by conciliation 
     <lb/>
     and negotiation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The other day, when the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position was criticising the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     he used several adjectives, and one state<lb break="no"/>ment he made, slurring it over as if it were 
     <lb/>
     a matter of no account, was that Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier was a great conciliator. Sir, I do 
     <lb/>
     not think that anybody in this House or 
     <lb/>
     in this country has ever applied a truer and 
     <lb/>
     more apt expression towards the leader of 
     <lb/>
     this government. Sir Wilfrid Lauricr has 
     <lb/>
     stood out, not only among the public men 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, but among the public men of 
     <lb/>
     the empire, as having succeeded, by con<lb break="no"/>ciliation, in solving questions which no coer<lb break="no"/>cion could ever solve. I venture to say that 
     <lb/>
     in the history of Canada Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
     <lb/>
     will be held up as the brightest example of 
     <lb/>
     a statesman who, without coercion or force, 
     <lb/>
     has been able to bring about an entente cor<lb break="no"/>diale between the different peoples, the 
     <lb/>
     different religions, the different nationali<lb break="no"/>ties in this country, and who has been able 
     <lb/>
     to demonstrate that by conciliation majori<lb break="no"/>ties and minorities can live together in 
     <lb/>
     peace and work for the progress, the ad<lb break="no"/>vancement and the good government of the 
     <lb/>
     country. I said a few moments ago that the 
     <lb/>
     intention of gentlemen opposite was to 
     <lb/>
     show that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was incon<lb break="no"/>sistent. The settlement of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     school question was the settlement of a diffi<lb break="no"/>culty under a certain condition at that time 
     <lb/>
     existing. The law had been passed by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of Manitoba, there were difficul<lb break="no"/>ties then existing, and the settlement was 
     <lb/>
     a settlement under a condition of affairs 
     <lb/>
     which was not absolutely satisfactory, pro<lb break="no"/>bably, to either side. The Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba, the Roman Catholics of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, would have liked to have had much 
     <lb/>
     more. The Protestant element would, per<lb break="no"/>haps, like to exert a greater influence and 
     <lb/>
     to have taken away more of the rights, or 
     <lb/>
     the privileges, if you will, of the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba. If there are two extremes 
     <lb/>
     warring against each other, irreconcilable in 
     <lb/>
     most cases one might say, but who are will<lb break="no"/>ing and ready, by conciliation, to come to

     a common standpoint where their differences 
     <lb/>
     will vanish, both sides may agree to a fair 
     <lb/>
     and just and equitable compromise. That 
     <lb/>
     was the basis of the settlement of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba school question. But, Sir, to say that 
     <lb/>
     because that was the settlement, and that 
     <lb/>
     it was on the whole satisfactory to both 
     <lb/>
     sides of the controversy at that time, does 
     <lb/>
     not mean that under any circumstances in 
     <lb/>
     the future, or under a new condition of 
     <lb/>
     affairs existing in the adjoining new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, such a settlement must necessarily 
     <lb/>
     be absolutely satisfactory for ever. We have 
     <lb/>
     a totally different condition of affairs in re<lb break="no"/>gard to our school legislation in the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. We have a new start to be made. 
     <lb/>
     We have a condition of affairs existing to<lb break="no"/>day in these Territories which gives certain 
     <lb/>
     rights to the minorities in the way of se<lb break="no"/>parate schools. To maintain these rights by 
     <lb/>
     our legislation, we give in the future a 
     <lb/>
     guarantee that these rights shall be main<lb break="no"/>tained. Some people may consider that the 
     <lb/>
     condition in the Territories is not better, 
     <lb/>
     nor even so good, as the condition of affairs 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba to-day ; but, however that 
     <lb/>
     may be, the proposition in this legislation 
     <lb/>
     is a settlement of the question. Perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     as in the case of Manitoba, you may call it 
     <lb/>
     a compromise, and probably the two ex<lb break="no"/>tremes to the controversy may say that the 
     <lb/>
     legislation we propose is not satisfactory, 
     <lb/>
     but a compromise has to be reached between 
     <lb/>
     these extremes. You cannot get a compro<lb break="no"/>mise which will be absolutely acceptable 
     <lb/>
     to the extreme adherents of one side 
     <lb/>
     or the other, but you may get a compromise 
     <lb/>
     which will be acceptable to the common 
     <lb/>
     sense of the great mass of the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country. I believe that by this Bill we have 
     <lb/>
     attained that desirable end. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The question of the boundaries of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba has been discussed, and this question 
     <lb/>
     is perhaps the raison d'etre of this whole 
     <lb/>
     discussion this afternoon. A complaint is 
     <lb/>
     made—perhaps not actually made by any<lb break="no"/>body on the floor of this House, although 
     <lb/>
     it is implied—a complaint is made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers that the boundaries of Manitoba have 
     <lb/>
     not been moved westward, because of the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties connected with the school ques<lb break="no"/>tion. There is no justification whatever for 
     <lb/>
     any such statement. There are newspaper 
     <lb/>
     rumours of all kinds. I regret to say that 
     <lb/>
     our friends opposite in their press are quite 
     <lb/>
     equal to the manufacture of newspaper 
     <lb/>
     rumours of all kinds. I regret to say that 
     <lb/>
     they feed on these rumours. They have 
     <lb/>
     not much else to feed upon, Mr. Speaker. 
     <lb/>
     They have been beaten over and over and 
     <lb/>
     over again, when the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     have been appealed to and have had an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of pronouncing on their policy 
     <lb/>
     and their utterances in comparison. with our 
     <lb/>
     policy and our utterances. We heard just 
     <lb/>
     such language here session after session be<lb break="no"/>tween 1890 and 1900. We heard that the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal government was to be swept out 
     <lb/>
     of power in 1900 the moment the people had 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3978</fw>
        

     an opportunity of judging our record and 
     <lb/>
     our policy. We all know the result. All 
     <lb/>
     through the last parliament we had hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite talking very loudly in 
     <lb/>
     this House about what they were going to 
     <lb/>
     do when the elections came on. They im<lb break="no"/>pressed a good many people in the country. 
     <lb/>
     They are loud-mouthed and denunciatory ; 
     <lb/>
     and they are like some people who think 
     <lb/>
     that by saying a thing very often you act<lb break="no"/>ually make it true. But the result of the 
     <lb/>
     election in November, 1904, showed them 
     <lb/>
     that their loudest denunciations and loudest 
     <lb/>
     assertions were mere empty wind, and the 
     <lb/>
     government came back with a larger ma<lb break="no"/>jority than any party in Canada had got 
     <lb/>
     in many years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Where was their 
     <lb/>
     leader ? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH2">Mr. FISHER</persName>. I will not say anything 
     <lb/>about that ; I do not wish to indulge in per<lb break="no"/>sonalities. But in that connection I would 
     <lb/>like to refer to a statement which I saw 
     <lb/>in a Conservative newspaper within the 
     <lb/>last day or two—I am sorry I cannot re<lb break="no"/>member which paper it was. The state<lb break="no"/>ment was that the people of Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>and the people of Quebec were inferior in 
     <lb/>intelligence and superior in bigotry and pre<lb break="no"/>judice to the people of Ontario. It is easy 
     <lb/>enough to see where a sentiment of that 
     <lb/>kind comes from ; it comes from the dis<lb break="no"/>appointed ambitions of men who tried to be 
     <lb/>elected in those provinces and had to suffer 
     <lb/>the defeat which their party and their 
     <lb/>policy deserved.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     There is one thing more which I wish to 
     <lb/>
     say a few words about ; and, coming as I 
     <lb/>
     do from the province of Quebec, perhaps I 
     <lb/>
     know a little more about these matters than 
     <lb/>
     the great mass of English speaking or Pro<lb break="no"/>testant members of this House. It may be 
     <lb/>
     a little delicate for one who does not be<lb break="no"/>long to the Roman Catholic church to speak 
     <lb/>
     about the action of Catholics in regard to 
     <lb/>
     their own church, or about the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     which may have arisen in the internal 
     <lb/>
     economy of that church in this country. 
     <lb/>
     But, having lived among the Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, it may not be out 
     <lb/>
     of place for me to say a word or two in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the coming of the Papal ablegate. 
     <lb/>
     In 1890 a request was made by certain peo<lb break="no"/>ple belonging to the Catholic church for a 
     <lb/>
     permanent representative of the Pope in 
     <lb/>
     Canada. That was not the first time that 
     <lb/>
     a request of that kind had been placed be<lb break="no"/>fore the head of the Catholic church. Those 
     <lb/>
     of us who can look back a little in the his<lb break="no"/>tory of this country can remember the con<lb break="no"/>dition of affairs in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     before 1896. We can remember that as 
     <lb/>
     long ago as 1876 there was an election in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, in which it was 
     <lb/>
     notorious that leading dignitaries, of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church took an active part—such 
     <lb/>
     an active part that the Tory candidate in 
     <lb/>
     that election was elected ; such an active

     part that certain Liberals who did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve in the interference of the church in 
     <lb/>
     secular aifairs, such as political matters, 
     <lb/>
     made a protest to Rome, and asked that a 
     <lb/>
     delegate should be sent from the Pope to 
     <lb/>
     regulate those affairs within the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church in Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. BERGERON. What election was 
     <lb/>
     that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FISHER. It was the election of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Langevin, in Charlevois. The case was tried 
     <lb/>
     in the courts, and the interference of the 
     <lb/>
     church was proved. Somebody on the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the House a little while ago talked 
     <lb/>
     about proof—when was proof required, when 
     <lb/>
     was proof given, and so on. I think it was 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber<lb break="no"/>geron). I cannot quote the exact volume 
     <lb/>
     of the reports in which that case appears ; 
     <lb/>
     but the hon. gentleman, who is a lawyer, 
     <lb/>
     can find it himself, and he will see that 
     <lb/>
     the proof was given. I do not think it was 
     <lb/>
     the only case, but it was the one I had in 
     <lb/>
     my mind at the moment. The Papal dele<lb break="no"/>gate was sent to Canada, not to interfere 
     <lb/>
     in political matters, or with legislation, but 
     <lb/>
     to prevent the interference in political mat<lb break="no"/>ters of certain dignitaries of the church, 
     <lb/>
     whose influence it was well known had been 
     <lb/>exerted.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. On whose behalf ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr.FISHER. My hon. friend from Beau<lb break="no"/>harnois can remember. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Jacques Cartier  (Mr. Monk) can re<lb break="no"/>member. I daresay the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto  (Mr. Foster), if he searched 
     <lb/>
     his historial reminiscences, could remember. 
     <lb/>
     It was exerted on behalf of the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive government, who for long years carried 
     <lb/>
     a large majority of the constituencies in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec by reason of the assistance of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic church, and only by reason of that 
     <lb/>
     assistance. Coming down to 1896, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto was a member 
     <lb/>
     of the then Conservative government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Sometimes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FISHER. Sometimes. He knows that 
     <lb/>
     before the elections of 1896, there were cer<lb break="no"/>tain changes in that government, and that 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who were chosen to fill the 
     <lb/>
     places naturally given to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec were well known to be representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the ultramontane wing of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party of that province ; and it is 
     <lb/>
     not very much of a jump for me to suppose 
     <lb/>
     that the gentlemen who controlled the then 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party and the then Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive government remembered what had oc<lb break="no"/>curred in days gone by, when Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald, having on the one hand the Tory 
     <lb/>
     Orange organization of the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario, and on the other hand the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church organization of the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, ruled this country for so many years 
     <lb/>
     by means of that unholy alliance.

         Mr. BERGERON. For the good of the   
     <lb/>country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FISHER.  The hon. member says ' for     
     <lb/>the good of the country.' I can only point<lb/>to the condition of the country in 1896.<lb/>Surely the hon. gentleman must admit that<lb/>it was for the evil of the country that the<lb/>government were then carrying on the<lb/>affairs of Canada.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. SPROULE.  Which element of the  
     <lb/>combination is the unholy one ?<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FISHER. The combination was un<lb break="no"/>holy, not either elements of it. It was the 
     <lb/>
     alliance, the combination of the two sets of 
     <lb/>
     people who held diametrically opposite 
     <lb/>
     views, who were joined together in an un<lb break="no"/>holy alliance to keep the government in 
     <lb/>
     office. My hon. friend from East Grey re<lb break="no"/>belled against it himself, he found it quite 
     <lb/>
     beyond endurance ; and when, in 1896 an 
     <lb/>
     effort was made to coerce Manitoba by the 
     <lb/>
     government of which the member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto was a member, the member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey and others rebelled against the alli<lb break="no"/>ance, and stepped out from the support of 
     <lb/>
     that party on that occasion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. SPROULE. Very much like the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member and his friends who fought against 
     <lb/>
     the church and took it into court ; now they 
     <lb/>
     are on the other side and are returning to 
     <lb/>
     the church. They want to appeal to both 
     <lb/>
     sides. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FISHER. I do not know what the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman means by referring to the 
     <lb/>
     church. I take it that he has been follow<lb break="no"/>ing the lead given this afternoon by the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition and the member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto, who pretend that in our pre<lb break="no"/>sent legislation we have been consulting the 
     <lb/>
     church, and going to the heads of the church 
     <lb/>
     for permisson to introduce this legislation. 
     <lb/>
     That has been denied by the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the House, and denied by the state<lb break="no"/>ment of Monseigneur Sbarretti himself. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore the insinuation which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman makes and the implication sug<lb break="no"/>gested by the leader of the opposition and 
     <lb/>
     the member for North Toronto, are absolu<lb break="no"/>tely unfounded and untrue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. SPROULE. The hon. gentleman said 
     <lb/>
     he did not know what I meant: I was re<lb break="no"/>ferring to his own statement when he told 
     <lb/>
     of the time his party took the church into 
     <lb/>
     court and fought the church ; but now they 
     <lb/>
     are entering into an alliance with the church 
     <lb/>
     and getting the church to help them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. FISHER. That is what I deny, the 
     <lb/>
     insinuation which the hon. gentleman and 
     <lb/>
     his colleagues are making is absolutely un<lb break="no"/>founded and has no justification in any form 
     <lb/>
     or shape. Mr. Speaker, in 1896 an  effort was 
     <lb/>
     made to pursue that kind of policy, the 
     <lb/>
     effort was made by the then government to 
     <lb/>
     carry the province of Quebec in the same 
     <lb/>
     way. A little while ago the member for 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">3981</fw> <fw type="dateline">APRIL 6, 1905</fw> 
       

     North Toronto, in opening his speech, made 
     <lb/>
    a remark which I cannot help but consider 
     <lb/>almost offensive, when he said the right hon. 
     <lb/>leader of the government started in by doing 
     <lb/>the baby act. Now. without saying any<lb break="no"/>thing about the delicacy of such language, 
     <lb/>I do desire however to state that if ever 
     <lb/>there was a man in Canada who has never 
     <lb/>shown the white feather on any occasion 
     <lb/>when he required to take courage, to take 
     <lb/>heart, and to stand before the people and 
     <lb/>boldly tell them what they should do, it is 
     <lb/>the right hon. the leader of this government. 
     <lb/>I remember when, in the campaign of 1896 
     <lb/>at the time the Manitoba school question 
     <lb/>was before the country. the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman went down into his own constituency 
     <lb/>in the city of Quebec, when the people of 
     <lb/>that province were more or less excited on 
     <lb/>the question which was then occupying all 
     <lb/>minds, and he led them into the Way of 
     <lb/>peace, he showed them that justice and 
     <lb/>consideration ought to be given to provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights in Manitoba; and in the ensu<lb break="no"/>ing elections we saw that by his courage, by 
     <lb/>the justice of his- pleas, and the justice of 
     <lb/>his position, he was able to defeat the gov-. 
     <lb/>ernment in the province of Quebec itself, 
     <lb/>when the Conservative party, by the help 
     <lb/>of the ultramontane press and members, 
     <lb/>hoped to carry the province by an enormous 
     <lb/>majority in favour of the Tupper govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Sir, there never has been in the his<lb break="no"/>tory of Canada an exhibition of greater 
     <lb/>moral courage and of greater devotion to 
     <lb/>duty, whatever the cost might be. I re<lb break="no"/>member another Occasion when the right 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman went to the city of Toronto, 
     <lb/>at a time there was an agitation being car<lb break="no"/>ried on throughout the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>in relation to the Jesuit Estates Act. The 
     <lb/>right hon. gentleman faced a great audience 
     <lb/>in the ultra Protestant city of Toronto, and 
     <lb/>the first cheer that arose during his speech 
     <lb/>was on his mentioning the name of Col. 
     <lb/>O'Brien, who was then supposed to be the 
     <lb/>champion of Protestantism in Ontario; the 
     <lb/>right hon. gentleman showed that audience 
     <lb/>the justice of his position. and the actual 
     <lb/>condition of affairs in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. and before he had spoken for twenty 
     <lb/>minutes, he had that audience in the hollow 
     <lb/>of his hand, and when he sat down he re<lb break="no"/>ceived an applause which has never been 
     <lb/>equalled in that great Protestant city of 
     <lb/>Toronto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. May I ask the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman why they do not put up a candidate 
     <lb/>
     in that city today ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH2">Mr. FISHER</persName>. Because we do not want 
     <lb/>
     to give you and your friends an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to raise fanatical prejudices on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Sir, for the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto to imputc cowardice to the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the government, is going from 
     <lb/>
     the sublime to the ridiculous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is pretty strong 
     <lb/>
     language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3982</fw>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH2">Mr. FISHER</persName>. The case requires strong 
     <lb/>
     language. but if it is not parliamentary, I 
     <lb/>
     can withdraw it, but nevertheless I want 
     <lb/>
     to say it. The right. hon. gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     charged a few minutes ago with having 
     <lb/>
     shows heat when he rose to speak in reply 
     <lb/>
     to the leader of the opposition. I do not 
     <lb/>
     wonder that one who has seen what has 
     <lb/>
     been going on here during the last few days 
     <lb/>
     shows heat; I do not wonder that a man 
     <lb/>
     who has his country's good at heart shows 
     <lb/>
     heat when he sees the efforts of the press 
     <lb/>
     of a great party in this country devoting 
     <lb/>
     itself to stirring up religious strife and na<lb break="no"/>tional prejudice. Sir. heat is required to put 
     <lb/>
     down such action as that, and to challenge 
     <lb/>
     it, and to meet it. I say that the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party and the Liberal government are ready 
     <lb/>
     at all times to fight such a policy whenever 
     <lb/>
     it is attempted to be carried on in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. Sir, the question at issue is the false 
     <lb/>
     assertion that this government has refused 
     <lb/>
     to extend the boundaries of Manitoba west<lb break="no"/>ward because of the school question. The 
     <lb/>
       right hon. leader of the government, in in<lb break="no"/>troducing this Bill a few weeks ago, gave a 
     <lb/>
     clear and explicit statement of the reasons 
     <lb/>
     why the boundaries of Manitoba could not 
     <lb/>
     be extended to the westward, and in that 
     <lb/>
     statement and those reasons there was not 
     <lb/>
     a single suggestion that the boundary ques<lb break="no"/>tion had any connection whatever with the 
     <lb/>
     school question. The reasons were explicit, 
     <lb/>
     and they are shown in the papers laid on 
     <lb/>
     the table of the House. The reasons given 
     <lb/>
     were that the people west of Manitoba did 
     <lb/>
    not wish to be joined to Manitoba and pre<lb break="no"/>ferred to be in the new provinces, and we 
     <lb/>
     had to consider the people who were con<lb break="no"/>cerned rather than the desire of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Manitoba. And, as I am reminded 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend from Centre York (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell.) why did not they extend it in 
     <lb/>
     1884. when Manitoba made the request. The 
     <lb/>
     reasons given then were very much as they 
     <lb/>
     have been given now in the answer to the 
     <lb/>
     memorial of the government of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     Those reasons were conclusive with the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party in 1884: they are doubly 
     <lb/>
     strong today. The conditions which made 
     <lb/>
     the westward extension undesirable then 
     <lb/>
     have been intensified by the development of 
     <lb/>
     the country. And these reasons, and these 
     <lb/>
     reasons only, caused the government to reply 
     <lb/>
     to the government of Manitoba and say that 
     <lb/>
     the boundaries of Manitoba could not be 
     <lb/>
     extended westward, but that the whole of 
     <lb/>
     that territory must go into the two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. It is assuming a great deal—un<lb break="no"/>fortunately hon. gentlemen opposite and 
     <lb/>
     their press live on assumptions and they 
     <lb/>
     therefore must assume a great deal—but 
     <lb/>
     there is no justification for the assumption 
     <lb/>
     that the school question was in any way 
     <lb/>
    connected with the decision of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment that the boundary of Manitoba could 
     <lb/>I not be extended to the west. I will not deal 
     <lb/>with this question longer. I regret exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly that to-day and yesterday, as several

     been taken up in dealing with these ques<lb break="no"/>tion which are really extraneous to the legis<lb break="no"/>lation before the House, and the bringing up 
     <lb/>
     of which here can serve only one purpose, 
     <lb/>
     and that purpose is the continuance of the

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName> (South York). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, in taking up the special subject of 
     <lb/>
     debate this evening I intend to read another 
     <lb/>
     document in order to place it on record, a 
     <lb/>
     document which bears very pointedly on 
     <lb/>
     the question that has been raised. It is a 
     <lb/>
     letter that was sent to His Holiness the 
     <lb/>
     Pope by the members of the government 
     <lb/>
     and by the members of parliament, and 
     <lb/>
     which was referred to in the remarks which 
     <lb/>
     I made yesterday. That document, which 
     <lb/>
     was sent, I believe, in 1896 or 1897, was as 
     <lb/>
     follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Most Holy Father,—We, the undersigned, 
     <lb/>
     members of the Senate and members of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons of Canada, and represent<lb break="no"/>ing therein the Liberal party, present our<lb break="no"/>selves before Your Holiness as respectful and 
     <lb/>
     devoted children of holy church, to complain 
     <lb/>
     of the existence of a state of things which, 
     <lb/>
     if allowed to continue, must be extremely 
     <lb/>
    dangerous to the constitutional liberties of this 
     <lb/>country, as well as to the interests of the 
     <lb/>church itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Your Holiness has already been made aware 
     <lb/>
     of the conduct and attitude of certain pre<lb break="no"/>lates and of certain members of the secular 
     <lb/>
     clergy who, during the general elections in 
     <lb/>
     this country, in the month of June last, inter<lb break="no"/>vened in a violent manner in restraint of 
     <lb/>
     electoral freedom, taking sides openly for the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party, and going so far as to de<lb break="no"/>clare guilty of grievous sin those of the 
     <lb/>
     electors who would vote for the candidates of 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Sincerely attached to the institutions of our 
     <lb/>
     country, which ensure to us Catholics the 
     <lb/>
     most complete liberty, we respectfully repre<lb break="no"/>sent to Your Holiness that these democratic 
     <lb/>institutions under which we live, and for which 
     <lb/>Your Holiness has many times expressed senti<lb break="no"/>ment of admiration and confidence, can only 
     <lb/>exist under perfect electoral freedom. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Far be it from us to refuse to the clergy 
     <lb/>
     the plenitude of civil and political rights. 
     <lb/>
     The priest is a citizen, and we would not, for 
     <lb/>
     a single instant, deprive him of the right of 
     <lb/>
     expressing his opinion on any matter submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the electorate but when the exercise 
     <lb/>
     of that right develops into violence, and when 
     <lb/>
     that violence, in the name of religion, goes 
     <lb/>
     to the extent of making a grievous sin out of 
     <lb/>
     a purely political act, there is an abuse of 
     <lb/>
     authority of which the consequences cannot but 
     <lb/>
     be fatal, not only to constitutional liberty, 
     <lb/>
     but to religion itself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     If, in a country such as ours, with a population 
     <lb/>
     consisting of persons of various creeds, and 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3984</fw>
          

     wherein the Protestant denominations are in a 
     <lb/>
     majority, Catholics did not enjoy, in all matters 
     <lb/>
     relating to legislation, the same political free<lb break="no"/>dom as their Protestant fellow-countrymen, 
     <lb/>
     they would ipso facto be placed in a position 
     <lb/>
     of inferiority, which would prevent them from 
     <lb/>
     taking the legitimate part which they are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to take in the government of the 
     <lb/>
     country, with the possibility, moreover, of 
     <lb/>
     conflicts between the various groups of the 
     <lb/>
     population, which history shows to be ever 
     <lb/>
     fraught with danger. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then again, an active and violent interven<lb break="no"/>tion of the clergy in the domain of political 
     <lb/>
     question submitted to the people must, of 
     <lb/>
     necessity, produce against a great mass of 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic population a degree of irritation 
     <lb/>
     manifestly and prejudicial to that respect 
     <lb/>
     which religion and its ministers ever inspire 
     <lb/>
     and command. Some twenty years ago, His 
     <lb/>
     Holiness Pius IX, your illustrious and la<lb break="no"/>mented predecessor on the pontificial throne, 
     <lb/>
     acting through the Sacred Congregation of the 
     <lb/>
     Propaganda, deemed it his duty to put a stop 
     <lb/>
     to certain abuses of a similar character, and 
     <lb/>
     forbade the intervention of the clergy in poli<lb break="no"/>tics. This prohibition was generally respected 
     <lb/>
     so long as His Eminence Cardinal Taschereau 
     <lb/>
     was able to guide the church in Canada, but 
     <lb/>
     since old age and infirmities have paralyzed 
     <lb/>
     his guiding hand, the abuses to which your 
     <lb/>
     illustrious predecessor had put a stop, have 
     <lb/>
     begun again, and threaten once more to create 
     <lb/>
     trouble among us, and to compromise, not 
     <lb/>
     only Catholic interests in this country, but 
     <lb/>
     the peace and harmony which should exist be<lb break="no"/>tween the various elements of our population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again affirming our absolute devotion to the 
     <lb/>
     faith of our fathers and to the church of which 
     <lb/>
     your are the supreme head, affirming our 
     <lb/>
     respect and attachment for the person of 
     <lb/>
     Your Holiness, our attachment to the interests 
     <lb/>
     of our country and to the Crown of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, its aegis and protector, we beg that 
     <lb/>
     Your Holiness will renew in our behalf the 
     <lb/>
     most wise prescriptions and prohibitions of 
     <lb/>
     your predecessor protect the consciences of 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic electors, and thus secure peace 
     <lb/>
     in our country by the union of religion and of 
     <lb/>
     liberty—a union which Your Holiness has 
     <lb/>
     many times extolled in those immortal en<lb break="no"/>cyclicals whose precious teachings we desire in 
     <lb/>
     all things to follow; and lastly, grant to the 
     <lb/>
     children of the church now addressing Your 
     <lb/>
     Holiness the apostolic benediction.

     This letter, which was sent by the forty 
     <lb/>
     immortals of this country to His Holiness 
     <lb/>
     the Pope, complained of certain political 
     <lb/>
     grievances which they had in this country, 
     <lb/>
     supporting the request already made that 
     <lb/>
     he would send a delegate to this country 
     <lb/>
     to look after their interests and to protect 
     <lb/>
     them from what is here set forth, namely, 
     <lb/>
     the unfair interference of the clerics in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec with the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     electors. and especially with the rights of 
     <lb/>
     members of parliament. I must say that 
     <lb/>
     I am rather disappointed in the opinion I 
     <lb/>
     had formed of the clergy of Quebec after 
     <lb/>
     the high commendation of their conduct 
     <lb/>
     given by the member for Labelle (Mr. Bour<lb break="no"/>assa) last night, when I see that he has 
     <lb/>
     stigmatized, more than any one I know, 
     <lb/>
     with these forty immortals from Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     the clergy of that province. They have 
     <lb/>
     charged them with all kinds of political in<lb break="no"/>terference, they charged them with inter<lb break="no"/>fering with the rights of the people to vote, 
     <lb/>
     and they asked His Holiness to interfere 
     <lb/>
     with these clergy in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, so that when the hon. member for La<lb break="no"/>belle says that members from Ontario have 
     <lb/>
     been throwing stones at the clergy of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, he has evidently forgotten that he and 
     <lb/>
     forty others signed this document to have 
     <lb/>
     a delegate sent out here to regulate the 
     <lb/>
     clergy of the province of Quebec. As a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of fact, the ablegate was sent out here ; 
     <lb/>
     we have had three or four of them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I understand my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend read from a certain petition asking 
     <lb/>
     that a delegate be sent here. Would he be 
     <lb/>
     kind enough to repeat the part of the peti<lb break="no"/>tion in which that was included ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I said this docu<lb break="no"/>ment set out the grievances and that other 
     <lb/>
     missions and presentations made at Rome 
     <lb/>
     requested a delegate to be sent out and 
     <lb/>
     especially the letter of the right hon. the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, which asked that an able<lb break="no"/>gate be sent to this country and he was sent. 
     <lb/>
     We have the facts that these gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     all engaged in politics, after stigmatizing 
     <lb/>
     the clergy of Quebec, undertook a mission 
     <lb/>
     to Rome to get His Holiness' consent to 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of an ablegate to this coun<lb break="no"/>try for political purposes, that that ablegate 
     <lb/>
     has practically had a political mission, that 
     <lb/>
     that ablegate from Rome has been here as 
     <lb/>
     an appanage of the Grit machine in this 
     <lb/>
     country and that especially he was to be 
     <lb/>
     the Papal policeman with a big stick to keep 
     <lb/>
     the bishops and clergy of this country in 
     <lb/>
     order. This is a fair inference to draw 
     <lb/>
     from the representations that were made to 
     <lb/>
     Rome and from the conduct of the able<lb break="no"/>gate in this country. I know it for a fact— 
     <lb/>
     at least I have seen it stated and I do not 
     <lb/>
     think it will be denied—that at the recent 
     <lb/>
     election and at other times Liberal candi<lb break="no"/>dates in all parts of the country, or some 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>

     of them, when they had a grievance against 
     <lb/>
     any of the clergy of the church of Rome, 
     <lb/>
     immediately telephoned to the big police<lb break="no"/>man at Ottawa to take his big stick and 
     <lb/>
     wire back disciplining the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     clergyman who dared to hold an opinion 
     <lb/>
     of his own in regard to politics.

     <lb/>
     laughing, but they laugh when the facts are

     brought home to them. The truth is, and 
     <lb/>
     it is admitted on the other side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     that this Papal ablegate was brought to 
     <lb/>
     this country as an appanage of the Grit 
     <lb/>
     machine, that he is the policeman with the 
     <lb/>
     big stick to discipline the bishops and the 
     <lb/>
     clergy of the Roman Catholic church and 
     <lb/>
     that those who, more than any one else, 
     <lb/>
     stigmatized the hierarchy and'clergy of Que<lb break="no"/>bec were the forty immortals who signed 
     <lb/>
     that document on that occasion.

     <lb/>
     charged this side of the House with en<lb break="no"/>kindling the flames of ill-feeling in this 
     <lb/>
     country. I want to know who lit the flame, 
     <lb/>
     who set the heather on tire over this ques<lb break="no"/>tion.

     of a solid Quebec to coerce the minority 
     <lb/>
     in regard to educational matters in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. That is what caused the flame. 
     <lb/>
     that is what lit the torch, or in other words. 
     <lb/>
     the torch was carried and fired the moment 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman introduced that 
     <lb/>
     Bill.

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W F. MACLEAN</persName>. We will see about 
     <lb/>
     that. We have heard about a bolt in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia over this Bill and we will hear more 
     <lb/>
     of it. What else has fanned the flame? 
     <lb/>
     The thing that fanned the flame was the dis<lb break="no"/>covery by the great Protestant element of 
     <lb/>
     this country that the right hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister had deceived them. He told them by 
     <lb/>
     his conduct in the elections of 1896 that 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba question had been settled. 
     <lb/>
     that in this country there was to be no 
     <lb/>
     more coercion, that the sunny ways had 
     <lb/>
     settled this question and these people took 
     <lb/>
     him at his word. They accepted the pledge 
     <lb/>
     which he made when, as the hon. Minister 
    

            <pb n="3987" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_3987.jpg"/>

     of Agriculture said, he went to Toronto in 
     <lb/>
     1889 and made that speech from which we 
     <lb/>
     had a quotation this afternoon, that speech 
     <lb/>
     in which he said that 'no Italian priest shall 
     <lb/>
     tithe or toll in our Dominion.' He went to 
     <lb/>
     Toronto and made that speech and what has 
     <lb/>
     fanned the flame is that these people of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and these people of the west now 
     <lb/>
     find that an Italian priest is in this country 
     <lb/>
     for that very purpose and that he was 
     <lb/>
     brought here by the right hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     The fact that the people have discovered 
     <lb/>
     all these things has helped to fan the flame. 
     <lb/>
     What more has fanned the flame? It is 
     <lb/>
     the discovery of how this Bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced into parliament in so far as it has 
     <lb/>
     been divulged in this debate. It has been 
     <lb/>
     proved that the sub-committee which drew 
     <lb/>
     up this Bill was composed of the Secretary 
     <lb/>
     of State, the Minister of Justice and the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, and no one else as far as 
     <lb/>
     we know. Something else has come out 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon which will still further fan 
     <lb/>
     the flame and it is that the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     all along was in consultation with the Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop of Ephesus as regards this school 
     <lb/>
     clause and as regards the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. Is it not enough to fan the 
     <lb/>
     flame when the great Protestant majority 
     <lb/>
     of this country, the 59 per cent, find that 
     <lb/>
    the Bill dealing with the educational liber<lb break="no"/>ties of the people of the west was drawn, 
     <lb/>brought forward and introduced into this 
     <lb/>parliament by these three members of the 
     <lb/>government with the assistance of the Papal 
     <lb/>ablegate and that not one of the ministers 
     <lb/>who represent the great Protestant body 
     <lb/>of this country as consulted, but that they 
     <lb/>were ignored in the matter? Is not that 
     <lb/>something to fan the flame? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:EMME1">Mr. EMMERSON</persName>. That is not true. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Then it rests 
     <lb/>
     with the hon. gentleman to state who were 
     <lb/>
    there. I am speaking of the committee now 
     <lb/>and that is all the knowledge we have. The 
     <lb/>hon gentleman is there to increase our 
     <lb/>knowledge. All we want are the actual 
     <lb/>facts, but, so far. I say the public mind is 
     <lb/>inflamed and the Protestant mind is justly 
     <lb/>inflamed by this conduct. What further 
     <lb/>has inflamed the public mind? What has 
     <lb/>lighted the torch? It is the constant dis<lb break="no"/>covery of duplicity and deception in con<lb break="no"/>nection with this matter. The flame was 
     <lb/>still further fanned by the letter of Mr. 
     <lb/>Rogers, which was published yesterday, and 
     <lb/>we know what was in that letter. We know, 
     <lb/>according to Mr. Rogers, that the delegate 
     <lb/>from Manitoba—and we will have to con<lb break="no"/>fine it now to the Attorney General of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, Mr. Campbell—was asked by the Papal 
     <lb/>ablegate to put two certain clauses in the 
     <lb/>school law of Manitoba. It was intimated 
     <lb/>to him that if they would do that the bound<lb break="no"/>aries of his province would be extended to 
     <lb/>the north and it was also stated that the 
     <lb/>reason why his province had not had its 
     <lb/>boundaries extended to the west was be<lb break="no"/>
            


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3983</fw>
            

     cause of the school law of Manitoba. Is not 
     <lb/>
     that something to inflame the public mind, 
     <lb/>
     to increase this fire that seems to be burn<lb break="no"/>ing all over the country? But, who is doing 
     <lb/>
     it? Is it being done by this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House or by the Conservative press? Per<lb break="no"/>haps somewhat, but everything that is done 
     <lb/>
     is based on these revelations of duplicity. 
     <lb/>
     of deception and of ignoring of the public 
     <lb/>
     right and the right of the people of the west 
     <lb/>
     to be consulted in this matter. Again I ask, 
     <lb/>
     as did my hon. friend from North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster) this afternoon, if the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate was to be consulted, if he was con<lb break="no"/>sulted, it he was waited upon, as he was 
     <lb/>
     repeatedly waited upon by the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister. and if this matter was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed why was not the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior consulted, why was not the Finance 
     <lb/>
     Minister consulted, why was not Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain consulted, why were not the people of 
     <lb/>
     the west consulted? And still further will 
     <lb/>
     the public mind he inflamed to-day when it 
     <lb/>
     is known, as it knows now, that practically 
     <lb/>
     the statement made by the Papal ablegate 
     <lb/>
     and published to-day is a confirmation in 
     <lb/>
     substance of what was stated in Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>
     letter. Here is the crux of the whole mat<lb break="no"/>ter and it was not denied; grant, for the 
     <lb/>
     moment, that the Papal ablegate had the 
     <lb/>
     right to discuss the school question in this 
     <lb/>
     interview with the Manitoba minister, he 
     <lb/>
     coupled the school question up with the 
     <lb/>
     boundary question where he had no juris<lb break="no"/>diction, but where apparently he claimed 
     <lb/>
     to have authority to propose a settlement 
     <lb/>
     of the school question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is the crux; that is a thing that 
     <lb/>
     is not denied. It is asserted by Mr. Rogers, 
     <lb/>
     it is not denied by the ablegate and it is not 
     <lb/>
     denied by the government. The kernel of 
     <lb/>
     the whole matter lies in this that the able<lb break="no"/>gate discussed the boundary question of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba in connection with the school ques<lb break="no"/>tion. I want to know if the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice had night interviews or any other 
     <lb/>
     kind of interviews with the Papal ablegate ? 
     <lb/>
     I want to know if the Secretary of State 
     <lb/>
     has been in communication with the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate ? I want to know if it is not true 
     <lb/>
     that the Secretary of State, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, the Prime Minister and the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate, were daily holding interviews 
     <lb/>
     about this school question and discussing 
     <lb/>
     the matter in all its shapes and forms, while 
     <lb/>
     the people of the west and the minister from 
     <lb/>
     the west and Mr. Haultain were ignored. 
     <lb/>
     Is there any wonder why the country has 
     <lb/>
     been fanned into flame when the people 
     <lb/>
     discover these things ? I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     if the Minister of Finance and the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior had any interviews with the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate. I do not suppose they will 
     <lb/>
     admit it, but all the other gentlemen have 
     <lb/>
     to admit it ; the Prime Minister had an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity of denying it and he did not 
     <lb/>
     deny it, and his colleague who followed 
     <lb/>
     him was not able to deny it. The additional 
     <lb/>
     fact, which goes to the public to-morrow, 
     <lb/>

     will still further fan the flame, when it is 
     <lb/>
     known that the Papal ablegate was in the 
     <lb/>
     city of Ottawa all the time in constant con<lb break="no"/>sultation with the ministers, and that those 
     <lb/>
     who are directly interested were not con<lb break="no"/>sulted. I have read the letter which the 
     <lb/>forty immortals sent to Rome, asking for 
     <lb/>protection from the clericals of Quebec, 
     <lb/>and the letter of Mr. Russell has also been 
     <lb/>read here. This evidence proves that the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister. or Sir Wilfrid Laurier the 
     <lb/>private individual, induced the Holy See to 
     <lb/>send an ablegate to this country and to 
     <lb/>send him here for a political purpose; for the 
     <lb/>political purpose of being the policeman with 
     <lb/>the big stick to regulate the clergy of Que<lb break="no"/>bec ; and, also for the purpose of something 
     <lb/>else. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I will come to 
     <lb/>
     that in a moment, but I say now to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of Canada that whether act<lb break="no"/>ing as an individual or not, if he induced 
     <lb/>
     the Holy See to send an ablegate here for 
     <lb/>
     the political purpose which is confessed in 
     <lb/>
     his letter, he is responsible for everything 
     <lb/>
     that the Papal ablegate has done in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with our politics in this country. It is 
     <lb/>
     now confessed that the Papal ablegate did 
     <lb/>
     interfere in our politics. He submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba ministers certain clauses he wish<lb break="no"/>ed to be put in the Bill ; he told them if 
     <lb/>
     they would pass these clauses they might 
     <lb/>
     have their boundaries extended, and that 
     <lb/>
     their failure to give relief to the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     in the past was the reason why an exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the provincial boundaries was den<lb break="no"/>ied. I do not agree with all that has been 
     <lb/>
     said in this debate as to the right of the 
     <lb/>
     ablegate to be here. I say he is here as a 
     <lb/>
     political agent in connection with the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, and the Prime Minister and the 
     <lb/>
     government and its supporters are respon<lb break="no"/>sible for the conduct of that ablegate in 
     <lb/>
     this country. It is up to the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, either to endorse what the ableg<lb break="no"/>ate did in that interview with Mr. 
     <lb/>Campbell or to repudiate it, and if 
     <lb/>he repudiates it, to ask for the recall 
     <lb/>of the Papal ablegate. We are told as a 
     <lb/>matter of fact that he has been recalled and 
     <lb/>that he is to leave the country—or rather 
     <lb/>it is put in a more polite way–that he is to 
     <lb/>go back to Rome to explain his conduct in 
     <lb/>this matter. I believe they are most anx<lb break="no"/>ious to get him out of the country ; I believe 
     <lb/>the Minister of Justice has already drawn 
     <lb/>up his passports, and that the member for 
     <lb/>Labelle asked to be allowed to drive the 
     <lb/>hack that will take the cardinal to the sta<lb break="no"/>tion, and that the Postmaster General is to 
     <lb/>be there in his weeds, to weep and to say : 
     <lb/>not an revoir but adieu.

     Russell wrote in connection with the school 
     <lb/>
     question, that the first instalment had been 
     <lb/>
     granted, but, that a further instalment was 
     <lb/>
     to come, and the Minister of Justice to all 
     <lb/>
     intents and purposes, is pledged to give that 
     <lb/>
     other instalment and not to rest until he re<lb break="no"/>stores the school rights of the Catholics of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and also gives separate schools to 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories. It is clear that 
     <lb/>
     the ablegate has been brought to Canada 
     <lb/>
     for two purposes : to discipline the clergy 
     <lb/>
     and the bishops of Quebec, and to assist the 
     <lb/>
     government in securing separate schools 
     <lb/>
     for the Northwest. And he has been work<lb break="no"/>ing on these lines in connection and in con<lb break="no"/>junction with the government and there<lb break="no"/>fore the government is responsible for every<lb break="no"/>thing he has done. The people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     will hold him responsible for everything he 
     <lb/>
     has done, until they either repudiate him 
     <lb/>
     and ask for his withdrawal, or else endorse 
     <lb/>
     his conduct. It is this deception that has 
     <lb/>
     been practised all through in connection with 
     <lb/>
     our public affairs that has set the spark 
     <lb/>
     into a flame and fired the heather all over 
     <lb/>
     Canada. I am somewhat of a protectionist 
     <lb/>
     and so is the member for Labelle, who is 
     <lb/>
     especially a protectionist in regard to mat<lb break="no"/>ters concerning Quebec. But the member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle is not the protectionist I am, 
     <lb/>
     for I am in favour of the home product as 
     <lb/>
     regards the bishops and the clergy of the 
     <lb/>
     country, and I do not believe in bringing 
     <lb/>
     from the outside a policeman with a big stick 
     <lb/>
     to regulate them. I believe the bishops and 
     <lb/>
     the clergy of the province of Quebec are 
     <lb/>
     able to manage their own affairs.

     <lb/>
     opposite, who pretend to be the great cham<lb break="no"/>pions of the clergy of Quebec, are the men 
     <lb/>
     who asked His Holiness to send over an 
     <lb/>
     ablegate who would regulate them and keep 
     <lb/>
     them in their place. The bishops and clergy 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Quebec resent this con<lb break="no"/>duct of hon. gentlemen opposite, in bringing 
     <lb/>
     in a prince of the church for their political 
     <lb/>
     purposes. I believe to-day that the great 
     <lb/>
     majority of the hierarchy of Quebec are 
     <lb/>
     not rejoiced to see what has happened, but 
     <lb/>
     they recognize that a mistake was made 
     <lb/>
     and that things will be better in the future 
     <lb/>
     if there is no more ablegate in this country. 
     <lb/>
     I think it has been made clear here to-day 
     <lb/>
     that the ablegate has interfered improperly 
     <lb/>
     in Canadian politics, and it has been made 
     <lb/>
     clear that everything that has occurred in 
     <lb/>
     this country, which has inflamed the public 
     <lb/>
     mind, is the direct result of the conduct 
     <lb/>
     of hon. gentlemen opposite. They asserted 
     <lb/>
     that they had settled the school question, 
     <lb/>
     that it was buried for all time and they 
     <lb/>
     would never resurrect it ; yet they have 
     <lb/>
     been guilty of that very thing. Again I 
     <lb/>
     tell the Prime Minister, who made that 
     <lb/>
    quotation in a speech in Toronto, ' No Ita<lb break="no"/>lian priest shall tithe or toll in these Dom<lb break="no"/>

inions,' that the people of Toronto have 
     <lb/>
     found him out as the very man who brought 
     <lb/>
     a Papal ablegate to this country for that 
     <lb/>
     very purpose. This is the issue before this 
     <lb/>
     country, and I leave it with the House and 
     <lb/>
     the country. The proposal is to establish a 
     <lb/>
     connection between church and state in the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, and to allow a denomina<lb break="no"/>tional interest to tithe and toll the school 
     <lb/>
     lands of those two free provinces. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen may laugh and jeer at it, but 
     <lb/>
     that is the issue that is to be decided in 
     <lb/>
     the country. It may he laughed at in this 
     <lb/>
     House ; but every man from Ontario, every 
     <lb/>
     man from the west–nay, more, every man 
     <lb/>
     from the maritime provinces—will be asked 
     <lb/>
     to account for his conduct in regard to this 
     <lb/>
     effort which is being made to establish a 
     <lb/>
     connection between church and state, and 
     <lb/>
     to share the public school funds of this 
     <lb/>
     country with one denomination to the ex<lb break="no"/>clusion of every other. Another thing which 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen will have to settle, whether 
     <lb/>
     they be of the government or private mem<lb break="no"/>bers, is the way in which this legislation has 
     <lb/>been introduced into this House—how only 
     <lb/>one side has been consulted and every other 
     <lb/>interest has been ignored. Sometimes it is 
     <lb/>necessary to say a word in the interest of 
     <lb/>a majority. There is a majority of fifty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>nine per cent in this country that is en<lb break="no"/>titled to fair-play, and that majority says 
     <lb/>to-day that it has not been given that fair- 
     <lb break="yes"/>play which it had a right to expect from 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman when that majority 
     <lb/>gave their confidence to him, and when he 
     <lb/>in return gave a pledge, which they took 
     <lb/>from him on his honour, and which pledge 
     <lb/>to-day is broken and in the dust. That is 
     <lb/>the issue, and on that the public will judge 
     <lb/>hon. gentlemen opposite. The fifty-nine per 
     <lb/>cent do not want to do anything unfair to 
     <lb/>the minority ; but those who compose that 
     <lb/>fifty-nine per cent are of that character 
     <lb/>that if they think an attempt is being made 
     <lb/>to manacle or interfere with the educa<lb break="no"/>tional freedom of those great provinces in 
     <lb/>the west, they will resent it. All that the 
     <lb/>people of the province of Ontario say to-day 
     <lb/>is what they said before. They said in 
     <lb/>1896 : Hands off Manitoba ; and they say 
     <lb/>again to the province of Quebec : Hands off 
     <lb/>the new provinces in the west ; leave them 
     <lb/>alone ; let them manage their own affairs, 
     <lb/>especially their school affairs, as you have 
     <lb/>full liberty to manage yours. That is all 
     <lb/>they say ; and if the fifty-nine per cent of 
     <lb/>this country are to he charged with fanning 
     <lb/>a flame and stirring up creed and race wars 
     <lb/>in this country, I say it is not just to make 
     <lb/>that charge, because they have not done it ; 
     <lb/>but they have said to the government, in a 
     <lb/>fair and respectful way : Leave these new 
     <lb/>provinces to settle their own educational 
     <lb/>affairs. On the other hand, the charge 
     <lb/>comes home to hon. gentlemen opposite, and 
     <lb/>they must give an account of themselves to 
     <lb/>the people of Ontario. Where is the Post<lb break="no"/>master General to-day, who was so anxious 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3992</fw>
     

     yesterday to repudiate the letter of the forty 
     <lb/>
     immortals ? He did not want to be identi<lb break="no"/>fied with it ; and yet is he not responsible, 
     <lb/>
     being a member of the government, for 
     <lb/>
     every political act of his colleagues ? He 
     <lb/>
     is trying to escape the responsibility, but 
     <lb/>
     he will be held responsible for it, and so 
     <lb/>
     will every other member from the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, my advice to the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is—not that I want to see him force 
     <lb/>
     the ablegate out of the country ; but he had 
     <lb/>
     better have an explanation from the able<lb break="no"/>gate, and if that explanation is not satis<lb break="no"/>factory, he must repudiate him. Another 
     <lb/>
     thing he must do, and I tell him now ; he 
     <lb/>
     must withdraw this school clause from that 
     <lb/>
     Bill. That Bill will never pass this House 
     <lb/>
     or this parliament in its present shape. Leave 
     <lb/>
     that school clause out, and leave the courts 
     <lb/>
     to interpret what the constitutional rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minority in the province are, and we 
     <lb/>
     in Ontario and the west will be satisfied. 
     <lb/>
     That is all we want. But do not try to fet<lb break="no"/>ter when you have no right to fetter ; do 
     <lb/>
     not claim constitutional interference when 
     <lb/>
     you have no right to interfere. So far as I 
     <lb/>
     am able to prevent it, and other members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, that clause will never go on the 
     <lb/>
     statue-book of this country. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. E. M. MACDONALD</persName> (Pictou). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, the hon. member for South York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. W. F. Maclean) has been busily en<lb break="no"/>gaged for the past three-quarters of an hour 
     <lb/>
     in his favourite occupation of fanning the 
     <lb/>
     flame of religious discord in this country ; 
     <lb/>
     but the bellows do not seem to be working 
     <lb/>
     as well as they did yesterday, and the flame 
     <lb/>
     is not being fanned with the same alacrity 
     <lb/>
     as was displayed yesterday afternoon. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend, coming from the premier pro<lb break="no"/>vince, the largest province of this Dom<lb break="no"/>inion, is accustomed to speak, and I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry to say a great many other gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who come from that province, 
     <lb/>
     are in the habit of speaking of On<lb break="no"/>tario as if it were the whole Dominion. The 
     <lb/>
     time was in the history of this country 
     <lb/>
     when our friends who sit on the opposite 
     <lb/>
     side of the House claimed to be the national 
     <lb/>
     party, the party which stood for a united 
     <lb/>
     Canada all round. That is not the song they 
     <lb/>
     sing now. We hear Ontario spoken of as 
     <lb/>
     if there were no other portion of this whole 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and those of us who come from 
     <lb/>
     the maritime provinces and the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, and who, in the exercise of our 
     <lb/>
     rights as members of parliament venture to 
     <lb/>
     express our views on matters of ordinary 
     <lb/>
     importance, are pilloried by the Tory news<lb break="no"/>papers as being more liable to be corrupted 
     <lb/>
     than those who possess the high ideals of 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen from the province of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     Sir, I want to resent any such imputation. 
     <lb/>
     We, from Nova Scotia, may not belong to 
     <lb/>
     such a big province in area ; but we come 
     <lb/>
     from a Province to which the Tory party 
     <lb/>
     were forced to go not long ago in despera<lb break="no"/>

     tion to get a leader. If those gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     sing the song of Ontario so smoothly think 
     <lb/>
     their province is the premier one, how is it 
     <lb/>
     that they cannot scare up a leader from 
     <lb/>
     among the men they send to this House ? 
     <lb/>
     All this excitement, all this religious 
     <lb/>
     flame that my hon. friend speaks about, 
     <lb/>
     comes from the allegation that the claim 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Manitoba to have its 
     <lb/>
     boundaries enlarged was not conceded by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government the moment it 
     <lb/>
     was asserted, because there was inter<lb break="no"/>ference from the Papal ablegate in this 
     <lb/>
     country. That is the charge in a nutshell, 
     <lb/>
     and I want to examine it for a moment. 
     <lb/>
     The attitude assumed by our friends from 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba is a most dictatorial one. With<lb break="no"/>out saying a word with regard to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of having an enlargement of their 
     <lb/>
     boundaries for a long period of years, they 
     <lb/>
     suddenly woke up on the 16th of January 
     <lb/>
     last and said they wanted to have their 
     <lb/>
     boundaries extended west, north and east, 
     <lb/>
     cutting into one province, asuming a large 
     <lb/>
     portion of territory in another, and taking 
     <lb/>
     out of the new provinces to be constructed 
     <lb/>
     a third portion of territory. They want to 
     <lb/>
     have it done right away, not a moment of 
     <lb/>
     hesitation. No interests are to be con<lb break="no"/>sidered, even the interests of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario are to be disregarded, and I 
     <lb/>
     assume that the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) is one of those 
     <lb/>
     who agree with the proposition that although 
     <lb/>
     Premier Whitney may think they have some 
     <lb/>
     claims, yet they are not to be considered 
     <lb/>
     at all by this coterie of politicians that 
     <lb/>
     happen to be in charge and who are just 
     <lb/>
     now demanding it. Let me say, as coming 
     <lb/>
     from one of the smaller provinces of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, that they also have a right to 
     <lb/>
     be considered in regard to this subject. The 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, minor in size, though important as a 
     <lb/>
     factor in the confederation, no later than 
     <lb/>
     a month ago passed a strong resolution in 
     <lb/>
     which they represented to the federal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that on this question of the accre<lb break="no"/>tion of the provinces the rights of the smal<lb break="no"/>ler provinces should be considered. We 
     <lb/>
     hear about Manitoba being a postage stamp 
     <lb/>
     on the map. Well, we who come from 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, although it may be a postage 
     <lb/>
     stamp on the map, we come as one of the 
     <lb/>
     partners in this confederation, and we say 
     <lb/>
     that we have the same interest as New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick to be considered before any ad<lb break="no"/>dition is made to the territory of any pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Let me remind you, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that the province of New Brunswick, through 
     <lb/>
     their legislature, asserted no less than a 
     <lb/>
     month ago that by reason of the accretion of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of Ontario and Quebec which 
     <lb/>
     was made a few years ago, their position, 
     <lb/>
     as regards their representation in this 
     <lb/>
     House has been imperilled, according to 
     <lb/>
     the decision of the Supreme Court and the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council, for all time to come. The 
     <lb/>
     
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3994</fw>
     

     same thing may occur in regard to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. And are we to be told that this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment who were asked on the 17th of 
     <lb/>
     February to add to the territory of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, because they took four days to ans<lb break="no"/>wer it, and answered it in this House, are 
     <lb/>
     doing this at the dictation of the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     and of the Papal ablegate to this country ? 
     <lb/>
     I say that the federal government would 
     <lb/>
     be recreant to the interests of every pro<lb break="no"/>vince in this Dominion if they did not 
     <lb/>
     hesitate long and seriously before they de<lb break="no"/>cided to increase the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba or any other province by one foot 
     <lb/>
     of territory. Now these are the facts upon 
     <lb/>
     which these gentlemen base the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion that because they did not get, in four 
     <lb/>
     days time, what they asked for, that there<lb break="no"/>fore there is some interference from out<lb break="no"/>side. Our friends opposite grow almost 
     <lb/>
     hysterical over the failure of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to grant these demands, which every 
     <lb/>
     one of them, on deliberation, will concede 
     <lb/>
     are demands that should be well weighed 
     <lb/>
     as affecting the rights and status of every 
     <lb/>
     province in this confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now let us examine somewhat critically 
     <lb/>
     the position of affairs in regard to this 
     <lb/>
     whole question over which the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South York spoke so excitedly. In 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba the premier has 
     <lb/>
     been negotiating for some time with Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop Langevin in regard to the postlon of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in that province. It is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that these negotiations conducted 
     <lb/>
     through Archbishop Langevin have reached 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate. These negotiations 
     <lb/>
     were initiated by the Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
    some time ago and Mr. Campbell, the At<lb break="no"/>torney General of Manitoba, had an inter<lb break="no"/>view with the Papal ablegate with regard 
     <lb/>to this question. Were they initiated by 
     <lb/>this government, or even at the suggestion 
     <lb/>of this government? The statement of 
     <lb/>facts that has been issued by this buccaneer 
     <lb/>member of the Manitoba government do not 
     <lb/>contain the faintest suggestion that these 
     <lb/>negotiations were initiated by any member 
     <lb/>of this government. On the contrary, we 
     <lb/>have the fact stated that the Attorney 
     <lb/>General of Manitoba consulted with the 
     <lb/>ablegate a year ago; we have the fact as<lb break="no"/>serted and not denied that negotiations 
     <lb/>have been going on for a long time between 
     <lb/>the premier of Manitoba and Archbishop 
     <lb/>Langevin on behalf of the Papal ablegate. 
     <lb/>Now these gentlemen come down to Ottawa 
     <lb/>of their own accord, at their Own sug<lb break="no"/>gestion. Who asked them to come ? Did 
     <lb/>this government ask them to come? On 
     <lb/>the contrary, the correspondence laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the House last night by the First 
     <lb/>Minister showed conclusively that when 
     <lb/>these gentlemen woke up on the 16th of 
     <lb/>January they wrote to Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
     <lb/>and asked that they might be permitted 
     <lb/>to come down and discuss this question. 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="3995" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_3995.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
        

     No doubt, at the instance of Premier Rob<lb break="no"/>lin, Attorney General Campbell and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers intended to see the ablegate when 
     <lb/>
     they came down here in regard to this 
     <lb/>
     school question—there is not the slightest 
     <lb/>
     doubt about it—and they did go and see 
     <lb/>
     the ablegate. Now what took place ? We 
     <lb/>
     have a statement of alleged facts given 
     <lb/>
     to the people of this country. Is it issued 
     <lb/>
     by the man who is supposed to guide the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba, by the premier of that 
     <lb/>
     province? Does he venture to give his 
     <lb/>
     official sanction to any statement of facts 
     <lb/>
     in regard to this matter? Not at all. Is 
     <lb/>
     it issued by the Attorney General of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba, the man who had the 
     <lb/>
     interview with the ablegate? If we are 
     <lb/>
     going to have any official statement as to 
     <lb/>
     the negotiotions, as to what was said and 
     <lb/>
     done, and if we are going to have this flame 
     <lb/>
     of religious discord fanned in this country 
     <lb/>
     by our hon. friends opposite, at least we 
     <lb/>
     should expect them to start this flame ago<lb break="no"/>ing by some facts based upon the state<lb break="no"/>ment of a man who was present and who 
     <lb/>
     took part in the interview. Why, Sir, my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the leader of the opposition is 
     <lb/>
     too good a lawyer—and we recognize him 
     <lb/>
     in our province as a good lawyer—he is 
     <lb/>
     too good a lawyer not to know that hear<lb break="no"/>say testimony is not worth anything, and 
     <lb/>
     the statement of Mr. Rogers upon which 
     <lb/>
     all this flame of religious discord is to be 
     <lb/>
     started up is the worst kind of hearsay 
     <lb/>
     testimony, it is testimony that my learned 
     <lb/>
     friend, if he were a judge, would not listen 
     <lb/>
     to for one moment, and would reject if it 
     <lb/>
     were offered in evidence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the result is that we have all this 
     <lb/>
     excitement based upon what ? Upon a state<lb break="no"/>ment of facts made by a gentleman in regard 
     <lb/>
     to certain things within his own knowledge? 
     <lb/>
     No, Sir, mark that. While we have been 
     <lb/>
     discussing in this House and the news<lb break="no"/>papers have been discussing for days cer<lb break="no"/>tain alleged facts in regard to certain things, 
     <lb/>
     no public man has yet ventured to state 
     <lb/>
     that he knows anything of these things of 
     <lb/>
     his own knowledge. But we have this hear<lb break="no"/>say statement, and hearsay statements as 
     <lb/>
     well as any other old statement are sufficient 
     <lb/>
     material just now for certain gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     fan a flame of religious discord. We have 
     <lb/>
     in addition to the statement two insinu<lb break="no"/>ations. The first insinuation is that Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid wanted time to enable the invita<lb break="no"/>tion of the Papal ablegate to be acted upon. 
     <lb/>
     Well, now, what do we find ? We find that 
     <lb/>
     the interview with the premier of this coun<lb break="no"/>try took place on February 17, we find 
     <lb/>
     that the interview with the ablegate took 
     <lb/>
     place on February 23. In the meantime the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the government had been formu<lb break="no"/>lated in regard to the western boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and it was announced in this 
     <lb/>
     House and in the country what the policy of  
     <lb/>
     the government was. Could it be possible, 
     <lb/>
         


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">3996</fw>
        

     is it reasonable to suggest to any sane man 
     <lb/>
     that a statement made two days after an 
     <lb/>
     announcement of policy in this House, could 
     <lb/>
     be taken as being indicative of an intention 
     <lb/>
     to have anything to do with, or any influence 
     <lb/>
     upon, this government in determining that 
     <lb/>
     policy ? Yet that is what is being asserted. 
     <lb/>
     Then we are told that the ablegate's sug<lb break="no"/>gestion was made with the full knowledge 
     <lb/>
     and consent of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, which 
     <lb/>
     is the second insinuation. And what do 
     <lb/>
     we find ? We find that the premier of this 
     <lb/>
     country solemnly stated yesterday: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>I assert that if Mr. Rogers stated that Mon<lb break="no"/>seigneur Sbarretti did press him to make the 
     <lb/>suggestion of terms and conditions which he 
     <lb/>says Monseigneur Sbarretti did with my knowl<lb break="no"/>edge, he states something which is not in ac<lb break="no"/>cordance with truth. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>Could any statement be more categori<lb break="no"/>cally denied than that? And no member 
     <lb/>of this House ventures for one moment to 
     <lb/>declare that that denial should not be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted with the fullest credence. Let us 
     <lb/>look at what the ablegate said in regard 
     <lb/>to this matter: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>This is the sum and substance of my inter<lb break="no"/>view with Mr. Campbell. The federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment had absolutely no knowledge of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>And yet, as I say, upon hearsay testi<lb break="no"/>mony, upon inferences which the youngest 
     <lb/>child would not draw and which no judge 
     <lb/>in this country would venture to think of 
     <lb/>considering in a case tried before him, this 
     <lb/>House is being detained to listen to asser 
     <lb/>tions such as we have heard for two days 
     <lb/>past. And this is done, because hon gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite have been eight years in op<lb break="no"/>position and have exhausted every possible 
     <lb/>effort to tarnish in the slightest degree the

     <lb/>as to what went on—every hon. member 
     <lb/>will agree that Mr. Rogers' statement must 
     <lb/>be discarded as hearsay testimony. The

            <p>On the evening before his departure for the

            <p>I urged my request on the ground of fairness

            <p>My hon. friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) this afternoon en<lb break="no"/>deavoured to build an argument upon a 
     <lb/>certain construction which he put upon the 
     <lb/>words 'politically expedient.' Let me sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the reasonable attention of the House 
     <lb/>what the inference to be drawn from these 
     <lb/>words is. For whom was this to be 'politi<lb break="no"/>cally expedient' ? Was it for the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the country that, for the third time 
     <lb/>had received a mandate from the people, 
     <lb/>and by an overwhelming vote, by a major<lb break="no"/>ity greater than ever known in the history 
     <lb/>of the country ? What would be the neces<lb break="no"/>sity for this government to descend to ' poli<lb break="no"/>tical expediency ' ? In whose interest would 
     <lb/>the course suggested be 'politically expedi<lb break="no"/>ent' then? Unquestionably in that of the 
     <lb/>Manitoba government, the government that 
     <lb/>had been interviewing Archbishop Lange<lb break="no"/>vin, the government whose Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral had been interviewing the ablegate 
     <lb/>endeavouring to arrange to obtain poli<lb break="no"/>tical support—as I would say, if I were to 
     <lb/>use the style of argument of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>opposite—in return for making these con<lb break="no"/>cessions. For whom else could it be 'poli<lb break="no"/>tically expedient' than for the government 
     <lb/>that was talking of having a dissolution 
     <lb/>some of these days, and was looking for 
     <lb/>political support ? I submit that the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of my hon. friend and the inference 
     <lb/>he attempted to draw were wholly unwar<lb break="no"/>ranted. Who were the people who were 
     <lb/>chasing this ablegate in relation to the 
     <lb/>schools ? Were they the members of this 
     <lb/>government? On the contrary, the indis<lb break="no"/>putable evidence of the facts before us, 
     <lb/>shows conclusively who were engaging in 
     <lb/>these 'political expedients.' For, what does

     <lb/>Roblin's job, as an hon. friend suggests— 
     <lb/>when we come to get the whole story about 
     <lb/>this political pirate from Manitoba, it may 
     <lb/>be found that there are some little things 
     <lb/>yet to be said that will not be heard with 
     <lb/>very great satisfaction by our friends who 
     <lb/>have raised this question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, we are told, in the light of facts 
     <lb/>such as I have outlined—outlined fairly, I 
     <lb/>submit—that the Protestant feeling in this 
     <lb/>country should be roused against this gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and against the leader. That is the 
     <lb/>argument that hon. gentlemen opposite have 
     <lb/>been making and to whom are we asked to 
     <lb/>look for guidance? To the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. R. L. Borden) who leads the op<lb break="no"/>position. Well, that hon. gentleman knows 
     <lb/>very well that his entrance into political 
     <lb/>life was signalized by the advocacy of the 
     <lb/>coercion of the province of Manitoba. He 
     <lb/>knows that the then leader of the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative party, recognizing his legal abilities, 
     <lb/>was anxious that the hon. gentleman should 
     <lb/>lend those abilities to the advocacy of the 
     <lb/>cause of the coercion of Manitoba, to which 
     <lb/>that leader was then committed. The hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) did not en<lb break="no"/>ter political life under auspices of so clear 
     <lb/>and unequivocal a character as to be able 
     <lb/>to hold out very alluring hopes even to my 
     <lb/>hon. friend from South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>Maclean), who might be looking for a 
     <lb/>leader on this question. Or, are we to look 
     <lb/>to our hon. friend (Mr. Foster) who ad<lb break="no"/>dressed us this afternoon and who reads us 
     <lb/>a moral lecture every time he gets on his 
     <lb/>feet. This hon. gentleman assumes a high 
     <lb/>moral attitude. As he soars above ordinary 
     <lb/>mortals, and as 'his tongue drops manna. 
     <lb/>and makes the worst appear the better 
     <lb/>reason, he fancies that the people of this 
     <lb/>country are deluded by the sermonettes he 
     <lb/>gives us. Why, Sir, what is the political 
     <lb/>history of that hon. gentleman? Born in 
     <lb/>the province of New Brunswick, represent<lb break="no"/>ing the county of King's, his native county, 
     <lb/>he was driven thence after four or five 
     <lb/>years. He found a resting place, for a 
     <lb/>moment, in the county of York—but, as an 
     <lb/>hon. friend behind me remarks, he dare not 
     <lb/>go back. He flitted about St. John for a 
     <lb/>while; and then the people of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick took summary methods of dealing 
     <lb/>with him and drove him away politically, 
     <lb/>not only from St. John, but from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of New Brunswick for ever. And the 
     <lb/>result has been that for some years past 
     <lb/>he has been a political Ishmaelite. He has 
     <lb/>been going up and down this country like 
     <lb/>a lonely pelican of the wilderness, like a 
     <lb/>solitary sparrow on the liousetop, looking for

     some nest in which he might sit and from 
     <lb/>
     which he might descant upon the decay 
     <lb/>
     of political virtue in Canada. At last he 
     <lb/>
     has found, in an adjoining constituency to 
     <lb/>
     that of my hon. friend from South York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. W. F. Maclean), a place that was will<lb break="no"/>ing to take him in. And, coming back to 
     <lb/>
     the political arena once more, he proceeds, 
     <lb/>
     absolutely oblivious to the past record. Like 
     <lb/>
     the ostrich he puts his head in the sand and 
     <lb/>
     fancies that no one sees what is going on. 
     <lb/>
     Metaphorically he has put his head in the 
     <lb/>
     sand and says to the people of Canada : Do 
     <lb/>
     not look at my history previous to 1900, but 
     <lb/>
     gaze on this apostle of virtue, this George 
     <lb/>
     Eulas Foster, who has come to life again. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend who descanted upon this 
     <lb/>
     question so glibly was a leading mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the former government of this 
     <lb/>
     country. He talks about Italian pre<lb break="no"/>lates who are going to take tithes 
     <lb/>
     from interference in the political affairs 
     <lb/>
     of this country. He talks with great 
     <lb/>
     glibness, with a great deal of energy but 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend was the associate of gentle<lb break="no"/>men who were very glad not so many years 
     <lb/>
     ago to look to these gentlemen for aid and 
     <lb/>
     comfort and were fanning the flames of reli<lb break="no"/>gious discord—only they were doing busi<lb break="no"/>ness from the other end of the line. What 
     <lb/>
     do we find they were doing in those days ? 
     <lb/>
     The history is embalmed in the records of 
     <lb/>
     our courts. I refer the hon. gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     is looking for data on which to discuss 
     <lb/>
     matters likely to give rise to discord not to 
     <lb/>
     take hearsay statements from buccaneer 
     <lb/>
     politicians but to look at the Supreme Court 
     <lb/>
     reports of the Dominion of Canada. What do 
     <lb/>
     we find that the associates of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     who descants on political virtue to-day were 
     <lb/>
     doing in the past when he blossomed and 
     <lb/>
     flourished as a minister of the Crown 7 We

     find in evidence here that in those days some 
     <lb/>
     of the clergy in the province of Quebec dis—

            <p>Let me say further that the hon. member 
     <lb/>for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) and I regret 
     <lb/>that he is not here—was engaged in other 
     <lb/>political matters in this country in 1896 
     <lb/>which touched on religious matters and fan<lb break="no"/>ning the flames of religious discord was a 
     <lb/>favourite occupation of the hon. gentleman

     <lb/>friends in 1896 in Quebec and other places 
     <lb/>in this country ? We find that they were 
     <lb/>aware of and assented to the issuing of a 
     <lb/>mandement dealing with the question of 
     <lb/>how people should vote. In a sermon of 
     <lb/>Bishop Lafleche in 1896, after quoting the

            <p>This is the record or the member for 
     <lb/>North Toronto in 1896. a record which he 
     <lb/>would fain forget. And of course he tells 
     <lb/>us to-day that as long as the grass grows 
     <lb/>and water runs he is not going to do the 
     <lb/>like again. The only difference now is that 
     <lb/>while he is trying to carry on the same 
     <lb/>game he is now trying to work upon the 
     <lb/>Protestants of this country instead of on 
     <lb/>our Roman Catholic friends. And he tells 
     <lb/>us he is not going to do this again because 
     <lb/>he was beaten, forsooth, in 1896 and in 1900 
     <lb/>and in 1904. That is not the Spartan-like

     member for North Toronto or any man in

     this country after so long an experience in

     political life with such a record as

     this talks as he talks in this House 
     <lb/>
     it is not likely that the Protestants of this

     friend from South York (Mr. W. F. Mac<lb break="no"/>lean). We all recognize our friend from 
     <lb/>
     South York, the W. R. Hearst of Canadian 
     <lb/>
     politics, the gentleman who runs sensational 
     <lb/>
     journals. He is a well known advocate of 
     <lb/>
     public ownership. and he is so able an ad<lb break="no"/>vocate-and I am going to give him credit

     friend who comes along with all these fet<lb break="no"/>ishes of his, according to the eloquent speech

     of the hon. member for Beauce (Mr. Beland) 
     <lb/>
     last night, not so many years ago instead

     of being a stout advocate of provincial

     rights, an expression which he rolls as a

     <lb/>
     going up and down this country and in this 
     <lb/>
     House demanding a strong central govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and saying that the intention of the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation was that power 
     <lb/>
     should be centred in the federal government 
     <lb/>
     in Ottawa, and that there should not be 
     <lb/>
     found in the various centres of Canada 
     <lb/>
     little legislatures exercising varied powers 
     <lb/>
     but that everything should be done in this 
     <lb/>
     great central body. The record of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is hardly as inconsistent as that of 
     <lb/>
     his coadjutor from North Toronto, but on 
     <lb/>
     this question of provincial rights he has not

     much license to speak in this House or in

            </p>

            <p>
     Then we are asked to follow the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who has had a long career in poli<lb break="no"/>tics and a gentleman whom I am sure we 
     <lb/>
     respect. because I think he is the only 
     <lb/>
     one of the four that believes in this talk 
     <lb/>
     that he is giving us. I am free to say that 
     <lb/>
     I believe that. but I am also free to say 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend from East Grey is in 
     <lb/>
     very strange company. Was he not a fol<lb break="no"/>lower of old Sir John ? In the United 
     <lb/>
     States it used to be the proud boast of men 
     <lb/>
     who had been through the war that they 
     <lb/>
     had fought with Grant and it is only a short 
     <lb/>
     time in Canada since the Shibboleth of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservatives was that they had been with 
     <lb/>
     Sir John. Now what was Sir John's his<lb break="no"/>tory on this question of provincial rights ? 
     <lb/>
     He was the great centralist as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for South York told' us. Every 
     <lb/>
    one knows that Sir John Macdonald was 
     <lb/>not a federationist, or a legislative unionist. 
     <lb/>that he was not an advocate of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial powers. or of the recognition of 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4002</fw>
         

     the rights of provincial legislatures to con<lb break="no"/>trol certain questions, merely conceding to 
     <lb/>
     them those questions that could not be kept 
     <lb/>
     from them. Why, the day was when the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative powers in this country assert<lb break="no"/>ed that the King was not present in a pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislature, that this parliament was 
     <lb/>
     the only power that had the right to pass 
     <lb/>
     license laws. and we all recollect the occa<lb break="no"/>sion when Sir John Macdonald asserted the 
     <lb/>
     right, as a legislative unionist, of this fed<lb break="no"/>eral parliament to pass a Liquor License 
     <lb/>
     Act. We all remember the time when he 
     <lb/>
     asserted on a question in relation to the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the courts the right of the 
     <lb/>
     federal government to appoint King's Coun<lb break="no"/>sel's. And we also remember that in the 
     <lb/>
     days when the battle went on in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario, the little tyrant, as they 
     <lb/>
     called him, maufully withstood the efforts 
     <lb/>
     of Sir John Macdonald, the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) and some other 
     <lb/>
    old veterans on the other side in the 
     <lb/>House who sought to filch from On<lb break="no"/>tario her rights, legislatively and terri<lb break="no"/>torially, and that the men who are 
     <lb/>now claiming to represent provincial rights 
     <lb/>and who speak about them as if they were 
     <lb/>something sacred are the very men who 
     <lb/>spent all their lives battling against provin<lb break="no"/>cial rights and in favour of the centraliza<lb break="no"/>tion of power. Although we have to respect 
     <lb/>the hon. member for East Grey because he 
     <lb/>is sincere, I am sure that when he talks 
     <lb/>about provincial rights he must feel a 
     <lb/>twinge of regret that he is departing from 
     <lb/>the policy of the old leader under whom 
     <lb/>he entered politics and under whose poli<lb break="no"/>tical aegis he developed in this parliament. 
     <lb/>There was not an hon. gentleman on the 
     <lb/>other side of the House who supported Sir 
     <lb/>John Macdonald who knew anything about 
     <lb/>provincial rights. The word sits very 
     <lb/>strangely on their tongues. They were never 
     <lb/>provincial rights people. They never knew 
     <lb/>what provincial rights were. and yet they 
     <lb/>are coming here to-day and talking about a 
     <lb/>proposition in which they assert that the 
     <lb/>compact recognized by Sir John Macdonald 
     <lb/>and by all the fathers of confederation as 
     <lb/>being the essential element in the formation 
     <lb/>of this confederacy, namely, that the rights 
     <lb/>of minorities in all the provinces of this Do<lb break="no"/>minion should be respected, is one which 
     <lb/>shall not be kept. They come here and in the 
     <lb/>name of provincial rights go back on their 
     <lb/>record, go back on the traditions of their 
     <lb/>old leader who sleeps in Cataraqui cemetery 
     <lb/>at Kingston, they forget the great position 
     <lb/>that he once occupied in this parliament,
     <lb/>and there are none so poor as do him re<lb break="no"/>verence because they turn to those proposi<lb break="no"/>tions that were advocated by his traditional 
     <lb/>opponent, Sir Oliver Mowat. Shall we fol<lb break="no"/>low these men to-day upon this question ? 
     <lb/>Or shall those of us, who represent not mere<lb break="no"/>ly what may be called Protestant constitu<lb break="no"/>encies but who represent constituencies, even 
     <lb/>though they come from smaller provinces, 
     <lb/>

     where people are guided by the principle 
     <lb/>
     that here, in Canada, the lines of race and 
     <lb/>
     religion must be obliterated, and who de<lb break="no"/>mand that we shall be Canadians one and 
     <lb/>
     all, not rather follow him, who, during his 
     <lb/>
     long life, not merely on the testimon of 
     <lb/>
     his friends but on the testimony of those 
     <lb/>
     who ought to be his friends, but who have 
     <lb/>
     for a peculiar reason, become opponents of 
     <lb/>
     his, battled for civil and religious rights in 
     <lb/>
     the province where he was born and bred ? 
     <lb/>
     I want to know if there is any one who has 
     <lb/>
     studied the history of Canada who does not 
     <lb/>
     recognize that great leader of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party every year of whose career as a pub<lb break="no"/>lic man is marked by progress and by some 
     <lb/>
     effort on behalf of the rights both civil and 
     <lb/>
     religious of the provinces of this confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. But, talking about the ablegate be<lb break="no"/>ing brought to this country, I want to know 
     <lb/>
     whether there is a man who will say 
     <lb/>
     that the sons of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church who had sutfered by reason of the 
     <lb/>
     tyranny exercised on behalf of the Conser<lb break="no"/>vative party should not go to the head of 
     <lb/>
     their church and ask for the intervention 
     <lb/>
     of that dignitary by the appointment of a 
     <lb/>
     representative in Canada in order to see that 
     <lb/>
     the system of interference in politics which 
     <lb/>
     had hitherto prevailed should be obliterated 
     <lb/>
     from this country. That is why the able<lb break="no"/>gate came to Canada. Everybody knows 
     <lb/>
     that is so, and everybody knows that the 
     <lb/>
     reason why Quebec spoke in 1896 as she 
     <lb/>
     did and as she has spoken since is because 
     <lb/>
     the great heart of the French people rose 
     <lb/>
     above all those limitations which had bound 
     <lb/>
     them and because the people of that province 
     <lb/>
     recognized that in their great leader they had 
     <lb/>
     a man who was ever ready to stand for 
     <lb/>
     equal rights for all and special privileges 
     <lb/>
     for none. As he stood for the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces in 1896 so he stands to-day 
     <lb/>
     for the constitutional rights of minorities 
     <lb/>
     and the recognition of the principles which 
     <lb/>
     the confederation compact involves and 
     <lb/>
     which were embodied in the constitution. 
     <lb/>
     But, cries such as we have heard here to<lb break="no"/>day are not new. My little province down 
     <lb/>
     by the sea has not turned its ear to any 
     <lb/>
     such appeals as seem to avail in other por<lb break="no"/>tions of Canada. But, in the county from 
     <lb/>
     which I come and in which I have run 
     <lb/>
     three federal elections. I want to say that 
     <lb/>
     in every fight we have had to contend 
     <lb/>
     against the canvass which was being made 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of the Conservative party amongst 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant and Presbyterian section of 
     <lb/>
     the electors in these words: Surely you 
     <lb/>
     will not vote for a Frenchman and a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic like Laurier. That was the shib<lb break="no"/>boleth of the Conservative party. But, our 
     <lb/>
     people rose above that. Our people recog<lb break="no"/>nized that he was the champion of civil 
     <lb/>
     and religious liberty in Canada, that he was 
     <lb/>
     possessed of a generous mind, that he was a 
     <lb/>
     believer in all that was going to make Can<lb break="no"/>ada great and her people happy, and they 
     <lb/>
     sent a unanimous delegation here to support 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4004</fw>
        

     him. Let me say that we are unanimously 
     <lb/>
     behind him to-day and further let me say 
     <lb/>
     that upon this question we know in whom 
     <lb/>
     we believe. We are not asked to follow 
     <lb/>
     any man whose record is of a character 
     <lb/>
     such as I have outlined as being possessed 
     <lb/>
     by some hon. gentlemen opposite. We know 
     <lb/>
     that when the excitement upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion passes away the Protestant people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada will recognize as in days that have 
     <lb/>
     gone, that in our great leader We have a 
     <lb/>
     pillar in the storm. a man who has stood 
     <lb/>
     above all these cries of race and religion, a 
     <lb/>
     man who rises above them and who sees 
     <lb/>
     with clear vision the path which we should 
     <lb/>
     follow and the principles by which we should 
     <lb/>
     be guided. So, I say that when the his<lb break="no"/>tory of this country comes to be Written 
     <lb/>
     our children's children will speak of the 
     <lb/>
     great leader of the Liberal party who has 
     <lb/>
     fought the battle of civil and religious lib 
     <lb/>
     erty and who has stood up for the rights 
     <lb/>
     of provinces and minorities as one whose 
     <lb/>
     name will ever shine with lustre so long 
     <lb/>
     as Canada has a history.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. T. S. SPROULE</persName> (East Grey). Mr. 
     <lb/>Speaker, if this took place in some countryi 
     <lb/>barnyard, I imagine I could hear some old 
     <lb/>farmer saying it is not the first time that he 
     <lb/>heard a great deal of noise and cackling 
     <lb/>for a very small egg. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) has taken an hour 
     <lb/>to enlighten us on the subject before the 
     <lb/>House and he has trotted out almost every 
     <lb/>subject under the sun which suggested itself 
     <lb/>to his mind but he has studiously avoided 
     <lb/>touching the question before the House, and 
     <lb/>I think it would be quite in order for me 
     <lb/>to ask, Mr. Speaker, to read the question 
     <lb/>before the House because the attention of 
     <lb/>the House has been directed to everything 
     <lb/>except that. The hon. gentleman treated 
     <lb/>us to a great many subjects: Roorbacks; 
     <lb/>cold storage, Mr. Rogers' statement must be 
     <lb/>discarded; absolutely untrue; sparrow on 
     <lb/>the house tops; pelican in the wilderness;

     reminds me of a story I heard when com<lb break="no"/>paratively a boy, of a would-be celebrated 
     <lb/>
     chemist, who, asked to demonstrate a propo<lb break="no"/>sition in chemistry said : Well boys, you 
     <lb/>
     will take an effervescent and you add a 
     <lb/>
     deliquescent and there will be a precipita<lb break="no"/>tion and that is a conglomeration and that 
     <lb/>
     amounts to a demonstration. The chemist 
     <lb/>
     defied any one to prove the proposition more 
     <lb/>
     logically than that, and the chemist's demon<lb break="no"/>stration is about on a par with the demon<lb break="no"/>stration we have had from the member for 
     <lb/>
     Pictou. It was a conglomeration in the 
     <lb/>
     highest sense of the word. He told us that 
     <lb/>
     Ontario thought she had all the intelligence 
     <lb/>
     of the world, but that we were not above 
     <lb/>
     going to the east to get a leader. Well, On<lb break="no"/>tario is like Simple Simon ; she knows a 
     <lb/>
     good thing when he sees it, and takes it. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The man he called a 
     <lb/>
     political Ismaelite was born in the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces but they discarded him, and we 
     <lb/>
     accepted him with gratitude and pleasure 
     <lb/>
     and I think he has given the member for 
     <lb/>
     Pictou and his friends one of the best drub<lb break="no"/>bings they have got for some time. Scrip<lb break="no"/>ture tells us that it was from the east the 
     <lb/>
     wise men came, and we have drawn many 
     <lb/>
     a wise man from the east, but if we are to 
     <lb/>
     judge from the sample we heard to-night I 
     <lb/>
     can assure him we are not likely to make 
     <lb/>
     any more pilgrimages east in search of wise 
     <lb/>
     men. The member for Pictou said that Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald was a legislative unionist 
     <lb/>
     and that the member for East Grey who 
     <lb/>
     championed political rights to-day was a 
     <lb/>
     great admirer of his. If the member for 
     <lb/>
     Pictou were as familiar with the political 
     <lb/>
     history of this House as he seems to be with 
     <lb/>
     the barnyards of Nova Scotia, he would 
     <lb/>
     know that the member of East Grey dis<lb break="no"/>agreed with Sir John Macdonald on many 
     <lb/>
     of these questions in regard to provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, and that the member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     was as sincere then as he is to-day upon the 
     <lb/>
     question we are now dealing with. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fact is admitted that the Attorney 
     <lb/>
     General of Manitoba had visited the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate. Who admitted it ? The member 
     <lb/>
     for Pictou made the pure bald statement 
     <lb/>
     without anything in the world to hack it up 
     <lb/>
     so far as we know except his own imagina<lb break="no"/>tion— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. Would the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman permit me to call his attention to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the ablegate's statement shows 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Campbell visited him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Did he say they had a 
     <lb/>
     conference ? He incidentally met him.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. Will my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     read for himself ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The ablegate says : I 
     <lb/>
     met him in a friendly way a year ago, but 
     <lb/>
     there is not one word with regard to a con<lb break="no"/>ference ; there is only the solitary statement

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4006</fw>
          

     that they met and the member for Pictou 
     <lb/>
     wove out the rest of the fairy tale, and pre<lb break="no"/>sented it to the House as a fact. The mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Pictou tells us that his province is 
     <lb/>
     not opposed to provincial rights. No, but if 
     <lb/>
     he represents his province, Nova Scotia is op<lb break="no"/>;posed to the extension of the boundaries 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba because it is one of the smaller 
     <lb/>
     provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. The attitude adopt<lb break="no"/>ed on that question was, that the smaller 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion should be con<lb break="no"/>sulted before the boundaries of any other 
     <lb/>
    province in the confederation were ex<lb break="no"/>tended. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. It was not that the 
     <lb/>smaller provinces should be consulted, but 
     <lb/>that Nova Scotia as a small province was 
     <lb/>opposed to enlarging other provinces be<lb break="no"/>cause it would make Nova Scotia com<lb break="no"/>paratively smaller. That is the only logical 
     <lb/>deduction from his remarks. The hon. 
     <lb/>member for Pictou told us that the hon. 
     <lb/>member for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) 
     <lb/>is singing the song of Ontario. Yes, he is 
     <lb/>singing the song of Ontario, and Ontario has 
     <lb/>sung a good many songs and they have all 
     <lb/>panned out well, and this one will also. He 
     <lb/>told us that the member for South York is

     The member for Pictou says that the Re<lb break="no"/>form party are fighting for the rights of the

     people, and one of his friends said that the 
     <lb/>
     Reform party fought the church a few years 
     <lb/>
     ago, and that it even took the church to the 
     <lb/>
     courts and that this is an evidence that the 
     <lb/>
     Reform party is not in favour of a Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate. Perhaps not, but it was the Re<lb break="no"/>form party that brought him here. The 
     <lb/>
     member for Pictou told us that we on this 
     <lb/>
     side dislike the Catholics and the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     church. That is a peculiar assertion on 
     <lb/>
     his part ; it has no foundation in fact, not 
     <lb/>
     the slightest in the world. So far as I know 
     <lb/>
     and I verily believe it, there is no senti<lb break="no"/>ment of dislike here either for a Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic or the Roman Catholic church. We 
     <lb/>
     have the same respect and veneration for 
     <lb/>
     that church that we have for other churches 
     <lb/>
     and for its members as we have for other 
     <lb/>
     members of the community. That state<lb break="no"/>ment of his only exists in his imagination 
     <lb/>
     and I want to say so. What is the gist of 
     <lb/>
     all this discussion this afternoon ? The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Agriculture gave us a very learned 
     <lb/>
     disquisition but he never touched the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. He tried to draw a red herring across 
     <lb/>
     the track like the member for Pictou who 
     <lb/>
     never mentioned the issue from the moment 
     <lb/>
     he rose till he sat down. He tried to do like 
     <lb/>
     that little fish that spouts out an inky fluid 
     <lb/>
     in the water so as to becloud everything— 
     <lb/>
     I see the hon. member for Pictou is leaving 
     <lb/>
     the House ; the sun has gone down. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. I will come back to 
     <lb/>
     oblige the hon. gentleman.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I am glad he came back.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Perhaps I was doing the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman an injustice. Unlike some 
     <lb/>
     of his friends he is willing to stay in the 
     <lb/>
     chamber and hear what is being said. Of 
     <lb/>
     all the speeches made on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House, none of them touched the sub<lb break="no"/>ject at all. The Prime Minister told us : 
     <lb/>
     we will fight this battle to the end upon the 
     <lb/>
     very line upon which it is brought into the 
     <lb/>
     House. What are the lines on which the 
     <lb/>
     battle was brought into this House ? What 
     <lb/>
     are the lines to-day? The interference of 
     <lb/>
     the church with the state. I tell him that we 
     <lb/>
     accept the challenge, and that we are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to meet him on every platform in the 
     <lb/>
     broad Dominion of Canada. He will find 
     <lb/>
     us ready for the battle, and willing to take 
     <lb/>
     our share in it. The allegation is that a re<lb break="no"/>presentative of the church has improperly 
     <lb/>
     interfered with the duties of the state. Who 
     <lb/>
     is responsible for that ? Not the ablegate. 
     <lb/>
     He is trying to do his duty, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     blame him ; he is representing his church. 
     <lb/>
     Who is responsible for it ? The men who 
     <lb/>
     brought him here—brought him under false 
     <lb/>
     pretenses if you can judge from the his<lb break="no"/>tory of the ablegate since he has been here. 
     <lb/>
     What did he come for ? To reconcile dif<lb break="no"/>ferences between them and their church 
     <lb/>
     that they were unable to reconcile for them<lb break="no"/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4008</fw>
   

     selves. As long as he was doing that we 
     <lb/>had no complaint to make. Is that the<lb/>work he is doing to-day ? Not at all. He<lb/>has gone beyond the bounds of that work,<lb/>
    and who is responsible for it ? Who is to 
     <lb/>blame ? Is it the ablegate ? No. He is 
     <lb/>reputed to be an able statesman, a 
     <lb/>diplomat, and he was brought here by men 
     <lb/>who think themselves statesmen, but who 
     <lb/>are not equal to the occasion. Who are 
     <lb/>they ? The Prime Minister was the first 
     <lb/>who sent to Rome, and he was joined by 
     <lb/>thirty-nine of his supporters. They are the 
     <lb/>parties who brought the ablegate here, who 
     <lb/>are responsible for his being here, who have 
     <lb/>been using him since, and who are bring<lb break="no"/>ing discredit on their church by the capa<lb break="no"/>city in which they are employing him. I 
     <lb/>say that if there is any objection to what 
     <lb/>the ablegate has done, we do not blame 
     <lb/>him, and have not a word to say against 
     <lb/>him ; but we blame the men who brought 
     <lb/>him and who have employed him in that 
     <lb/>work. They are the parties who are res<lb break="no"/>ponsible, and they are the parties who will 
     <lb/>be brought to book for it as soon as the 
     <lb/>voice of the people of Canada has an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of being heard on the subject. 
     <lb/>The memories of the people of Canada are 
     <lb/>not so short that they will forget it. They 
     <lb/>will not forget it by any means. I ask 
     <lb/>again, who brought him here ? I have an<lb break="no"/>swered that question, and can my answer 
     <lb/>be denied ? Is there any attempt to deny 
     <lb/>it? Not at all. There is and always has 
     <lb/>been in this country a dread of the interfer<lb break="no"/>ence of the church with the state, and there 
     <lb/>will be the same dread in the future ; and 
     <lb/>when we see the first indications of that 
     <lb/>interference cropping up, we want to stop 
     <lb/>it. That does not refer to one church more 
     <lb/>than another. When I say church, I in<lb break="no"/>clude every church, and we are ready to 
     <lb/>fight one as vigorously as another. I am 
     <lb/>speaking of a principle which is inherent 
     <lb/>in the constitution of the British empire. 
     <lb/>We have learned long since of the painful 
     <lb/>effects of the interference of the church 
     <lb/>with the rights of the state. That question 
     <lb/>was fought out, and the relative duties of 
     <lb/>each was assigned to it. But that question 
     <lb/>is cropping up to-day, and who are res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for it ? The present government ; 
     <lb/>they are the parties who have introduced 
     <lb/>that question. We are told that there is 
     <lb/>excitement in the country today. If there 
     <lb/>is, what is the occasion of it ? It is the 
     <lb/>danger apprended by the people of Canada 
     <lb/>that we are going to have the issue of state 
     <lb/>and church to fight over again. That is why 
     <lb/>there is excitement ; that is why so many 
     <lb/>letters and petitions are coming to Ottawa ; 
     <lb/>that is why there is such an intense feeling 
     <lb/>throughout the country against the present 
     <lb/>government. Is there today any interfer<lb break="no"/>ence with the affairs of the state by any 
     <lb/>church ? Need I ask that question after 
     <lb/>the information that has been given to this 
     <lb/>House several times during the last few 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="4009" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_4009.jpg"/>

     days? My answer is, yes, there is. By 
     <lb/>
     what church? By the representative of 
     <lb/>
     the Church of Rome, who was brought here 
     <lb/>
     by the present government. What impor<lb break="no"/>tant questions of state are under the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of parliament to-day? There are 
     <lb/>
     two. One relates to the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in the west. The other is 
     <lb/>
     the question of whether the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba shall be extended. These are 
     <lb/>
     two important questions which the state is 
     <lb/>
     dealing with to-day. We are erecting two 
     <lb/>
     new provinces and giving them provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights and provincial powers. Then, appli<lb break="no"/>cation is being made on behalf of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba for the extension of its 
     <lb/>
     boundaries, so that it may be of a size pro<lb break="no"/>portionate to the other provinces around it. 
     <lb/>
     It is much smaller to-day. Let me deal 
     <lb/>
     first with the question of erecting these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. One of the duties of the state 
     <lb/>
     is to assign certain rights to these provinces, 
     <lb/>
     among them the right to legislate with re<lb break="no"/>gard to education. The state is exercising 
     <lb/>
     its undoubted right to pass this legislation 
     <lb/>
     in this House. It is claimed, and not de<lb break="no"/>nied–no hon. gentleman in this House has 
     <lb/>
     dared to deny it up to the present—that the 
     <lb/>
     proposal in the Bill was submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate ; that several conferences 
     <lb/>
     over it took place between him and the pre<lb break="no"/>mier, if not between him and the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice and the Secretary of State as 
     <lb/>
     well ; and that it was made satisfactory to 
     <lb/>
     His Eminence before it was submitted to 
     <lb/>
     parliament or the country. Is that inter<lb break="no"/>ference by the church with the state ? Cer<lb break="no"/>tainly it is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is as plain as anything can be, and it 
     <lb/>
     has not been denied. Attention has been 
     <lb/>
     drawn to it several times, but neither the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister nor the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     have dared to get up in this House and deny 
     <lb/>
     it. Therefore we assume that it is an ad<lb break="no"/>mitted fact because there is no denial, and 
     <lb/>
     if there was any ground for denial there is 
     <lb/>
     no doubt the denial would be given. It is 
     <lb/>
     afterwards asserted and not denied, either, 
     <lb/>
     that the minister in the cabinet represent<lb break="no"/>ing Manitoba and the Northwest objected 
     <lb/>
     to a certain provision in the Bill—the clauses 
     <lb/>
     relating to education—and he struck, he 
     <lb/>
     left the cabinet, and carried his followers 
     <lb/>
     from the west with him. It was shown that 
     <lb/>
     there was trouble ahead, and there was a 
     <lb/>
     proposal to amend one or two clauses in that 
     <lb/>
     Bill. Several conferences took place with 
     <lb/>
     the western members on the one side and 
     <lb/>
     the premier, and with whom on the 
     <lb/>
     other ? With the Papal ablegate, to 
     <lb/>
     see if they could make some arrange<lb break="no"/>ment that would suit the Papal able<lb break="no"/>gate, and at the same time suit the member 
     <lb/>
     for Brandon and his followers in the west. 
     <lb/>
     Several times we were told that they had 
     <lb/>
     reached a conclusion satisfactory to both 
     <lb/>
     parties, but the next day the negotiations 
     <lb/>
     were off again. So we were kept in sus<lb break="no"/>pense day after day for nearly two weeks, 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4010</fw>
        

     until finally they reached a conclusion and 
     <lb/>
     it was announced to the House. But the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion was not announced to the House 
     <lb/>
     until after it was finally submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate and was found to be satis<lb break="no"/>factory to him. Therefore, I again ask the 
     <lb/>
     question : Is the church through its repre<lb break="no"/>sentative interfering with the state, is it or 
     <lb/>
     is it not ? Is the church interfering with 
     <lb/>
     the duties of the state, with the policy 
     <lb/>
     of the state, with the functions of the state ? 
     <lb/>
     I say it is, and this is the question that is 
     <lb/>
     interesting the Canadian people to-day, and 
     <lb/>
     this is the question which will be fought out 
     <lb/>
     in the future. The Prime Minister says : 
     <lb/>
     We are prepared to accept the challenge 
     <lb/>
     and we will fight it out. I tell him that it 
     <lb/>
     will be fought out. Well, when the Bill 
     <lb/>
     was first presented, some of the western 
     <lb/>
     members objected to some of the provisions, 
     <lb/>
     but when amendments were made that 
     <lb/>
    were satisfactory to the ablegate and satis<lb break="no"/>factory to the members of the west, they 
     <lb/>were announced to the House, then and not 
     <lb/>till then. Now, who is responsible more 
     <lb/>than anybody else for these educational 
     <lb/>clauses ? The Papal ablegate. I do not 
     <lb/>blame him, not at all ; he is trying to do 
     <lb/>what he believes to be a good work. But 
     <lb/>the government of this country have abne<lb break="no"/>gated their functions, and have given them 
     <lb/>over to the church, they have given them 
     <lb/>over to the representative of the church, and 
     <lb/>they have got him to do what they could 
     <lb/>not do themselves. They saw that the Papal 
     <lb/>delegate possessed the element of states<lb break="no"/>manship and desired to avail themselves of 
     <lb/>his diplomatic powers and his great foresight 
     <lb/>and statesmanship to help them out of what 
     <lb/>would otherwise have been a very difficult 
     <lb/>position, and he has succeeded in helping 
     <lb/>them out of it so far. But these were mat<lb break="no"/>ters of state policy about which the church 
     <lb/>should have no concern, and over which it 
     <lb/>should have no control. The church had no 
     <lb/>right to be consulted with regard to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now then we come to the question of the 
     <lb/>extension of Manitoba's boundaries. A con<lb break="no"/>ference was held with the government, they 
     <lb/>hear representatives, and say that an answer 
     <lb/>will be given in a few days. The First 
     <lb/>Minister, in dealing yesterday with the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Hon. Robert Rogers, said :

     ' A direct, an absolute and a categorical

     after all this is done does the denial hold

     gers says that the premier told him that an 
     <lb/>
     answer would be given in a few days. Well, 
     <lb/>
     the premier says, I have no remembrance 
     <lb/>
     of making such a statement, it is possible I 
     <lb/>
     may have done it, but I have a good mem<lb break="no"/>ory and I have no remembrance of it. In

     Papal ablegate to one of the delegates, and

     they visit the Papal ablegate. What takes

         It would be 'politically expedient,' and

     would help them to accomplish the mission

     on which they came here. Was not that

     diplomacy and an interference with the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the state ? Was not that an ad<lb break="no"/>mission that Hon. Robert Rogers' state<lb break="no"/>ment was correct ? And if Mr. Rogers came 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that the ablegate was an 
     <lb/>
     intermediary between the government and 
     <lb/>
     the delegate, was not there sufficient cir<lb break="no"/>cumstantial evidence to  justify him in 
     <lb/>
     reaching that conclusion ? In my judg<lb break="no"/>ment there was. Lawyers often depend on 
     <lb/>
     circumstantial evidence to establish a case. 
     <lb/>
     Even in the matter of life or death, the

     lawyer will tell the jury that circumstan<lb break="no"/>tial evidence is often much stronger and 
     <lb/>
     more reliable than direct evidence. The 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick), an

     Hon. Robert Rogers, when he assumed that

      government, and that the Minister of Justice

     to Hon. Colin Campbell to enable him to 
     <lb/>
     facilitate the object he had in view—the

     extension of the boundaries of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     He proposed to this end the alteration of the

     statute of Manitoba relating to education, 
     <lb/>
     by adding to section 125 two subsections. 
     <lb/>
     One was as follows :—

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

         That was one of the amendments. The

     other was to provide for exactly the same

     in the country—two carefully drawn, well-

     worded subsections to put in a statute. And 
     <lb/>
     what conclusion did the Manitoba delegates 
     <lb/>
     reach with regard to the matter ? I say 
     <lb/>
     the only conclusion they could come to was 
     <lb/>
     that these clauses were drawn up by the 
     <lb/>
     government here. And I think that they 
     <lb/>
     honestly believed that they were drawn up 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick). 
     <lb/>
     Does that hon. gentleman deny that he had

     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr.

     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I speak only of the gen<lb break="no"/>eral practise among politicians. As the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice has denied it, I have nothing 
     <lb/>
     more to say. But was it not natural that 
     <lb/>
     the delegate from Manitoba should come to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that the government's hand 
     <lb/>
     was behind it ? Was it the fine Italian 
     <lb/>
     hand alone that accounted for it ? How 
     <lb/>
     did he know our statutes so as to be able   
     <lb/>
     to draw clauses that would dove-tail into 
     <lb/>
     them and accomplish what was wanted in   
     <lb/>
     Manitoba ? Was there not some power be<lb break="no"/>hind him that prepared these subsections 
     <lb/>
     for him ? There must have been. And 
     <lb/>
     certainly it would not have been any one in 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba government, for they did not 
     <lb/>
     accept it. Now, it is admitted and not 
     <lb/>
     denied that the Papal ablegate took an im<lb break="no"/>portant part in preparing these Autonomy 
     <lb/>
     Bills to establish the two new provinces, in 
     <lb/>
     drawing up their educational clauses. It 
     <lb/>
     is admitted that conferences took place, 
     <lb/>
     that he was satisfied and accepted them. 
     <lb/>
     Now, if separate schools are fastened on 
     <lb/>
     half a continent there, who has done it ? 
     <lb/>
     The government through the representative 
     <lb/>
     of the church. He helped them to do it. 
     <lb/>
     And if he was successful in establishing 
     <lb/>
     them over 500,000 square miles of territory. 
     <lb/>
     is it any wonder that he attempted to go 
     <lb/>
     farther and fasten them on Manitoba as 
     <lb/>
     well ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When he had succeeded so well with 
     <lb/>
     the government of the day with his diplo<lb break="no"/>macy and with the craft which belongs 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4014</fw>
       

     to men of his position in getting the state 
     <lb/>
     to accept that, is it any wonder that he tried 
     <lb/>
     to go a little farther and attempted to add 
     <lb/>
    to his name something else that would em<lb break="no"/>bellish him in the history of fame if he 
     <lb/>could only compel Manitoba to give these 
     <lb/>separate schools. Why it is the most na<lb break="no"/>tural thing in the world. He had the same 
     <lb/>men to deal with, he had been successful 
     <lb/>with them once and he hoped to be success<lb break="no"/>ful with them again. He ventured a little 
     <lb/>further and he entered into communication 
     <lb/>with the delegates of Manitoba who came 
     <lb/>down here in a case of emergency in their 
     <lb/>strong desire to have justice done to their 
     <lb/>province, and he takes advantage of their 
     <lb/>necessity and of their dire necessity to play 
     <lb/>the game a little further. He endeavour<lb break="no"/>ed to secure from them the establishment 
     <lb/>of separate schools in Manitoba. Is this 
     <lb/>not another case of church interference with 
     <lb/>the rights of the state ? That was a state 
     <lb/>matter, that was a government policy and 
     <lb/>a function of the state and this was an 
     <lb/>interference with it. It is not denied, it is 
     <lb/>practically accepted by the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment and yet the First Minister says we 
     <lb/>will fight it out along these lines to the end. 
     <lb/>I will tell him to keep on with that fight 
     <lb/>and to congratulate himself on the result 
     <lb/>when he comes to the end of it. It is claim<lb break="no"/>ed and not denied that this proposal in the 
     <lb/>Bill was submitted and it was carried 
     <lb/>through. There is no doubt on that sub<lb break="no"/>ject. Now, we combine the statement of 
     <lb/>the Papal ablegate and the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with regard to the statement of 
     <lb/>the Hon. Robert Rogers. Three of the five 
     <lb/>specific items mentioned by Rogers which 
     <lb/>are known to the government are ad<lb break="no"/>mitted to be correct. As to the fourth one 
     <lb/>a lapse of memory is pleaded ; the First 
     <lb/>Minister says : I have no remembrance of 
     <lb/>it and I think I I would remember it if it was 
     <lb/>so—but he does not say it was not so. On 
     <lb/>the fifth one the government denies that 
     <lb/>they had any knowledge of what took 
     <lb/>place when the Manitoba delegates were 
     <lb/>with the Papal ablegate. Rogers never 
     <lb/>said they knew what took place but he 
     <lb/>assumed they did in consequence of the 
     <lb/>circumstances that surrounded it, and I say 
     <lb/>he was justified in that conclusion. Then 
     <lb/>we take the Papal ablegate's admission that 
     <lb/>he invited them ; as Rogers said an invita<lb break="no"/>tion came. When did it come ? Mr. Rogers 
     <lb/>says March 20, the Papal ablegate says : I 
     <lb/>think I met them on the 23rd or the 24th 
     <lb/>before they left for home. The invitation 
     <lb/>seems to have been on the 20th of March. 
     <lb/>When was the Bill to be introduced in the 
     <lb/>House to give separate schools to the two 
     <lb/>new provinces ? On the 21st of the month. 
     <lb/>When was the first disclosure to be given 
     <lb/>to the people whether or not their boundar<lb break="no"/>ies were to be extended ? On the 21st. Is it 
     <lb/>not natural to reach the conclusion that that 
   

            <pb n="4015" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_4015.jpg"/>

     invitation which went on the 20th of the 
     <lb/>
     month was in order to have the benefit of 
     <lb/>
     that conference before the information was 
     <lb/>
     given in this House and in order that the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister could take advantage of it. 
     <lb/>
     Was it not likely ? It seems the most like<lb break="no"/>ly thing in the world. That conference was 
     <lb/>
     held, the Manitoba delegates did not accept 
     <lb/>
     the invitation and respond to it as desired, 
     <lb/>
     by agreeing to grant separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     and what was the result ? The next day 
     <lb/>
     when the announcement was made they 
     <lb/>
     were told through the Prime Minister's 
     <lb/>
     speech in the House that their boundaries 
     <lb/>
     could not be extended. No reason was as<lb break="no"/>signed except that other provinces might be 
     <lb/>
     interested. Practically no reason whatever 
     <lb/>
     was assigned for it, but they have that sim<lb break="no"/>ple information. Robert Rogers says they 
     <lb/>
     were to get information in a few days. 
     <lb/>
     Afterwards Mr. Rogers writes a letter ask<lb break="no"/>ing whether the information was not forth<lb break="no"/>coming. The Prime Minister says he never 
     <lb/>
     received the letter but we have had evidence 
     <lb/>
     in this House that that letter was sent 
     <lb/>
     direct to the Prime Minister's own house. 
     <lb/>
     That was established by indisputable evi<lb break="no"/>dence. There was no doubt about that. 
     <lb/>
     Whether it ever went into the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister's hands I do not know, but it went 
     <lb/>
     to his house.

     we have the evidence of the party that

     important man. Allow me to finish with 
     <lb/>
     him. I say that the First Minister said : 
     <lb/>
     That letter may have reached my house,

     another plain fact ; there is no doubt of it 
     <lb/>
     whatever. The statements are admitted as

     which he meant ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The letter was handed to

     a messenger brought into the room for that 
     <lb/>
     purpose by the member who was charged 
     <lb/>
     with it. His word should be worth some<lb break="no"/>thing in this House. That messenger gives 
     <lb/>
     his word that he delivered the letter. Is 
     <lb/>
     he making out that that messenger was 
     <lb/>
     a liar or the member ? Which ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I have answered the

     question.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CALD2">Mr. CALDWELL</persName>. I am asking a ques<lb break="no"/>tion, are you sure that the letter delivered 
     <lb/>
     was the one that you referred to ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Did the messenger get 
     <lb/>
     any other letter ? Is he aware of any other 
     <lb/>
     letter which he got ? The messenger says 
     <lb/>
     he delivered it. The letter was handed to 
     <lb/>
     him by a member of parliament who says 
     <lb/>
     that this letter was the one written by 
     <lb/>
     Robert Rogers. Is that direct enough ? 
     <lb/>
     I might very properly ask whether the 
     <lb/>
     minister got a letter at all that day ; I 
     <lb/>
     might ask a dozen questions from some 
     <lb/>
     messenger, I am taking the evidence that 
     <lb/>
     has been submitted to this House, but 
     <lb/>
     that I think, is reliable and should be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted. Part of it is the evidence of an 
     <lb/>
     hon. minister of the Crown, part of it is that 
     <lb/>
     of an hon. member of parliament and the 
     <lb/>
     other portion of it is furnished by a mes<lb break="no"/>senger whom we believe to be telling the 
     <lb/>
     truth and by the record of the book which 
     <lb/>
     shows that the message was taken. What 
     <lb/>
     was the subject discussed ? The extension 
     <lb/>
     of the boundaries of Manitoba ; the school 
     <lb/>
     question. The Papal delegate admits that 
     <lb/>
     the suggestion was made that it will facili<lb break="no"/>tate business if you will make these two 
     <lb/>
     amendments to the school law. That is what 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers says ; that is what the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate admits. And then the ablegate 
     <lb/>
     admits that the proposed clauses of the 
     <lb/>
     Act read substantially as he gave them. 
     <lb/>
     Put the story all together and what is 
     <lb/>
     it ? It exactly confirms the statement made 
     <lb/>
     in the main by the Hon. Mr. Rogers. Now, 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate has a connection with 
     <lb/>
     the Autonomy Bill, he has a conference and 
     <lb/>
     his success in fastening separate schools 
     <lb/>
     upon two provinces naturally create a de<lb break="no"/>sire to go a little further and see if he could 
     <lb/>
     not extend that system to Manitoba. That 
     <lb/>
     is the most reasonable thing in the world. 
     <lb/>
     Why would he not do it ? He ventured to 
     <lb/>
     do it. What does this mean if it does not 
     <lb/>
     mean that there is interference with the 
     <lb/>
     duties of the state by somebody? Who 
     <lb/>
     is that somebody ? The representatives of 
     <lb/>

     a certain church. Who brought that some<lb break="no"/>body ? The present government. Who are

     charged with discharging the functions of 
     <lb/>
     the government or the functions of the state

     to-day ? The present government. Who 
     <lb/>
     have given over a portion of those functions 
     <lb/>
     to the Papal ablegate? The present gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Who is responsible then for that 
     <lb/>
     improper interference of his ? I say it is  
     <lb/>
    the present government and that they and 
     <lb/>they alone, will be held responsible for it. 
     <lb/>There is no doubt about it whatever. I ask: 
     <lb/>Is it to be continued? Will it be stopped 
     <lb/>right here? The people of Canada say it 
     <lb/>must be stopped and it will be stopped.

     <lb/>
     there is a stronger voice than that of the

     is a strong feeling created and that there is

     is excitement, anxiety, and noise, who 
     <lb/>
     is responsible for the whole of it ? 
     <lb/>
     -—The present government who intro<lb break="no"/>duced this subject and who brought 
     <lb/>
     this man here under false pretenses. There 
     <lb/>
     is no doubt about it whatever. The premier 
     <lb/>
     says we will fight this to the bitter end. Yes, 
     <lb/>
     we will fight it. He has given the challenge 
     <lb/>
     and I want to tell him in the name of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Canada that that challenge has 
     <lb/>
     been accepted. The same challenge was 
     <lb/>
     thrown down by the hon. Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) some nights ago when 
     <lb/>
     he said that this fight will never cease until 
     <lb/>
     we accomplish the end which we have in 
     <lb/>
     view. We accept that challenge and this 
     <lb/>
     fight is going on. I say that there shall be 
     <lb/>
     no cessation of it until we show that church 
     <lb/>
     that this is not one of the rights which be<lb break="no"/>long to a church, but that it is a right be<lb break="no"/>longing to the state, and if this govern<lb break="no"/>ment will not do their duty they must get 
     <lb/>
     out of office because the people will hold 
     <lb/>
     them to account. They themselves began 
     <lb/>
     it. They gave the challenge and they 
     <lb/>
     will be met on every platform in this broad 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada. This discussion is 
     <lb/>
     going on. We have the inalienable 
     <lb/>
     right of free speech in this country as in 
     <lb/>
     every British country in every part of the 
     <lb/>
     world. I say that we will transfer this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion from this tribunal to the high tri<lb break="no"/>bunal of the nation, we will let that tribunal 
     <lb/>
     speak and when the voice of the nation has 
     <lb/>
     been heard we will be vindicated in what 
     <lb/>
     we are doing to-day, because we are fight<lb break="no"/>ing the fight of constitutional government.

     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Hon. Wm. PATERSON</persName> (Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms). Mr. Speaker, having already 
     <lb/>spoken upon the second reading of 
     <lb/>the Bill I did not intend to say 
     <lb/>anything more, one speech only being al<lb break="no"/>lowed while the Speaker is in the chair, 
     <lb/>until the Bill is in committee. Nor, would 
     <lb/>I have spoken to-night, when another mo<lb break="no"/>tion made by the hon. leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) affords an opportu<lb break="no"/>nity for speaking, except for the reason that 
     <lb/>I think it is now time that there should per<lb break="no"/>haps be more speaking from this side of the 
     <lb/>House. I have abstained from endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to waste the time of the House—I do not 
     <lb/>want to use that expression in an improper 
     <lb/>way—taking up the time of the House—fur<lb break="no"/>ther than is necessary in order to intelli<lb break="no"/>gently discuss questions coming before us. 
     <lb/>To-day we are not engaged in discussing 
     <lb/>the question that is properly before us. We 
     <lb/>are not discussing a question of principle. 
     <lb/>We have been moved to adjourn the House 
     <lb/>to afford the hon. leader of the opposition an 
     <lb/>opportunity of supplementing the remarks he 
     <lb/>made yesterday in reference to the state<lb break="no"/>ment that was made by a brother Tory of 
     <lb/>his through the medium of the newspapers. 
     <lb/>He did not say—and I do not blame him for 
     <lb/>it—all that he perhaps should have said to 
     <lb/>the House yesterday and he took this oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of returning to it again. The oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity has been taken advantage of by 
     <lb/>other hon. gentlemen opposite and the ob<lb break="no"/>ject, as I conceive it, that these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen have is not to discuss whether 
     <lb/>church and state are being united in the 
     <lb/>Bill before this House or whether the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of provincial rights is involved ; the 
     <lb/>one object it seems to me, not judging un<lb break="no"/>charitably, of that letter, that manifesto— 
     <lb/>call it what you will—of Mr. Rogers, the 
     <lb/>speeches of the hon. leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>and the bringing it up in the House the sec<lb break="no"/>ond time, the speech of the hon. member 
     <lb/>for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) and the hon. 
     <lb/>member for South York (Mr. Maclean) were 
     <lb/>not to establish a principle or to declare 
     <lb/>that church and state shall not be united, 
     <lb/>but the object is that these men want to 
     <lb/>inflame the passions of the people of this 
     <lb/>country. There is no other object. A high 
     <lb/>object that is for gentlemen sitting in the 
     <lb/>parliament of Canada ! Upon what state<lb break="no"/>ment has this been brought up—a statement 
     <lb/>by Mr. Rogers. Who is he? The bosom friend 
     <lb/>of hon. gentlemen opposite, is he not? Why 
     <lb/>did he write that letter on the 23rd ? What 
     <lb/>did the hon. member for Macdonald (Mr. 
     <lb/>Staples) tell us—it was written and he rang 
     <lb/>the bell from room No. 6 and it was sent.

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. PATERSON.  No. 6 is the old room 
     <lb/>
     that we were in for 18 years and that the 
     <lb/>
     opposition are in now. When we were in 
     <lb/>
     opposition and when we occupied that room 
     <lb/>
     our leader used to visit us sometimes there. 
     <lb/>
     Did the hon. leader of the opposition visit 
     <lb/>
     that room when Mr. Rogers was there ? 
     <lb/>
     Has he seen Mr. Rogers ? Has he talked 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Rogers ? I ask the question and 
     <lb/>
     he does not deny it ; therefore, according to

          Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I may tell my hon.

     <lb/>
     that I was not in Ottawa at the time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. PATERSON. May I ask the hon.

            </p>

         Mr. R. L. BORDEN. No, I was not. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>     Mr.  PATERSON. Then he saw these

     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
         We can get something out of this cross- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     questioning. Here is a letter posted from 
     <lb/>
     No. 6; we find the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     in conversation with Mr. Rogers; we find  
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers' letter, and Mr. Rogers after

     a time tells us what is in this letter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. BARKER. Oh, no, you don't find  
     <lb/>
     the letter.    
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. PATERSON. I am alluding to Mr.

     Rogers' manifesto, if you may call it that. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. HENDERSON. Where did you find 
     <lb/>it ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
          Mr.  PATTERSON. In the 'Citizen.' An 
     <lb/>
     interview took place, as is alleged, between 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate and the Manitoba dele<lb break="no"/>gates, but, it now appears that it was only 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Campbell. There is great indig<lb break="no"/>nation expressed by hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site because some one on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, as they suppose, had arranged for 
     <lb/>
     that interview in some way. If there was 
     <lb/>
     something so very wrong in that interview, 
     <lb/>
     as these gentlemen suppose—notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing that any knowledge or any connection 
     <lb/>
     with it by any one on this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House is absolutely denied—what kind of  
     <lb/>
    characters are these gentlemen opposite  
     <lb/>who consort with the men who went there,  
     <lb/>and held that interview ? Mr. Rogers  pro<lb break="no"/>fesses to tell us what transpired, and what 
     <lb/>the ablegate said. I submit it would be of  
     <lb/>still greater interest to know what these   
     <lb/> people said in reply to the ablegate. If 
     <lb/>the thing was so very bad and so very  
     <lb/>wrong on the part of the ablegate, if it 
     <lb/>was such an encroachment of the church 
     <lb/>on the state, if it was such an awful thing, 
     <lb/>

     how is it that these Manitoba ministers

     <lb/>
     say : sir, you insult me ; the idea of try<lb break="no"/>ing to propose to this country  what you 
     <lb/>
     have proposed ; I will out of your house and 
     <lb/>
     never enter it again. But, Mr. Rogers, or 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Campbell, manifested no indignation, 
     <lb/>
     or at least the indignation was bottled up six 
     <lb/>
     weeks nearly before we heard anythingabout 
     <lb/>
     it. And yet these very gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     are the men who talk about this govern<lb break="no"/>ment having something to do with the 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who occupies a high position 
     <lb/>
     in connection with one of the churches of 
     <lb/>
     the land. My hon. friend from East Grey 
     <lb/>
     does not think that the ablegate drew up 
     <lb/>
     these clauses himself, and the only one 
     <lb/>
     he could think of was the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice, and when the Minister of Justice did 
     <lb/>
     not rise at once to contradict him—the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice would be on his feet all the 
     <lb/>
     time if he tried to keep contradicting all 
     <lb/>
     the suspicions of the member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey—the hon. gentleman took it for grant<lb break="no"/>ed that the charge was proven, till the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice thought it worth while 
     <lb/>
     to tell him that he was altogether mistaken. 
     <lb/>
     The member for East Grey wants to know 
     <lb/>
     who drew the clauses. I cannot tell. I 
     <lb/>
     believe the Colin Campbell he was inter<lb break="no"/>viewing is the Attorney General of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and it seems to me that it would be 
     <lb/>
     a more natural conclusion to arrive at that 
     <lb/>Mr. Campbell wrote the clauses than that 
     <lb/>they were written by the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice, who knew nothing about it at all. 
     <lb/>But talking about interviewing people and 
     <lb/>talking about rumours, with which the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition and his friends 
     <lb/>deal so largely. When the leader of 
     <lb/>the opposition got the emphatic denial 
     <lb/>of the Prime Minister yesterday, the best 
     <lb/>thing left for him to say, as he thought, 
     <lb/>was : well, this thing has been rumoured 
     <lb/>and why didn't the Prime Minister deny it 
     <lb/>sooner ?  That was a mighty poor refuge 
     <lb/>for the leader of the opposition to seek. 
     <lb/>But, I think there were some rumours a 
     <lb/>couple of years ago when the leader of the 
     <lb/>opposition and his band of trained followers 
     <lb/>made an excursion out west to try and 
     <lb/>capture the votes of the people. The mem<lb break="no"/>ber for East Grey was with the party, and 
     <lb/>rumour had it that when they got to Win<lb break="no"/>nipeg the member for East Grey left the  
     <lb/>party. Might I ask if that is true ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
          Mr. SPROULE. What has that to do 
     <lb/>
     with the question before the House ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
          Mr. PATERSON. May I ask the member 
     <lb/>
     for East Grey if that is true ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. SPROULE. If the question did not 
     <lb/>
     come from  a minister of the Crown I 
     <lb/>
     might deign to answer it, but it seems to 
     <lb/>
     me that the question is very far from the 
     <lb/>
     discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Mr. PATERSON. Well, then, I shall 
     <lb/>
      have to fall back on the rumour, and the

     rumour is that the member for East Grey

     left the party and got home before them. 
     <lb/>
     Will the leader of the opposition say why 
     <lb/>
     the member for East Grey left the party ? 
     <lb/>
     Was it because there was a rumour that 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition and some of

     His statement was, that owing to the visit

     <lb/>has the member for East Grey good reason 
     <lb/>to suspect that such a horrid thing hap<lb break="no"/>pened as that the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>when he was in the west on a political

     you get behind the scenes, and see the

     know what the hon. minister has said

     during my absence. I was out for a

     moment or two, but I have been told 
     <lb/>
     since I came into the chamber that he 
     <lb/>
     spoke of me being implicated in some 
     <lb/>
     way in the construction of a letter. All 
     <lb/>
     I can say to the hon. gentleman and 
     <lb/>
     this House is that, so far as my having 
     <lb/>
     anything to do with the construction of a 
     <lb/>
     letter in room No. 6 is concerned, it is ab<lb break="no"/>solutely untrue, and I know nothing of it. 
     <lb/>
     What I stated yesterday in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     letter were the simple facts. I was asked 
     <lb/>
     by the Hon. Mr. Rogers to see that that 
     <lb/>
     letter was immediately transmitted to the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister of this Dominion, and the 
     <lb/>
     messenger was particularly told that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers wanted that letter delivered to the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister immediately. because he 
     <lb/>
     was leaving that evening for Toronto.

     Mr PATERSON. Yes, I think the infer<lb break="no"/>ence is that way. The member for East

     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Oh, yes, he says he

     rang the bell. Well, now, there has been a 
     <lb/>
     complete denial given by the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     as to his having any connection whatever 
     <lb/>
     with the interview that took place between 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen. They should be more con<lb break="no"/>cerned to know what took place at that in<lb break="no"/>terview, what led up to it. Is there any 
     <lb/>
     truth in the rumours that were alluded to 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Pictou (Mr Mac<lb break="no"/>donald) that negotiations have been going 
     <lb/>
     on between the members of the Tory gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Manitoba and the clerical digni<lb break="no"/>taries of the church in that country. Is that 
     <lb/>
     true or is it not? Are we to take their test 
     <lb/>
     again and say that because these gentle<lb break="no"/>men don't deny it, therefore it is true? Are 
     <lb/>
     we to deal with them as they attempted to 
     <lb/>
     deal with the First Minister and the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice with regard to any rumours they 
     <lb/>
     hear?—and dear knows there are enough of 
     <lb/>
     them going about through the Tory papers 
     <lb/>
     nowadays—that because they don't deny 
     <lb/>
     the rumours therefore they are true. Where 
     <lb/>
     is the denial that the Manitoba government 
     <lb/>
     have been negotiating with the dignitaries 
     <lb/>
     of the church? Is it true or is it not? Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I judge from what we see in the news<lb break="no"/>papers that they will come out and tell us 
     <lb/>
     what has taken place in these negotiations 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the improvement of the con<lb break="no"/>dition of the children of the minority in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba, or at least what the 
     <lb/>
     minority consider would be an improve<lb break="no"/>ment. I cannot say more than what I see 
     <lb/>
     in the papers. Perhaps these hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men may be able to get an answer from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Rogers, or from Mr. Roblin, or from 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Campbell to know what has been done 
     <lb/>
     in that direction. But I want to say em<lb break="no"/>phatically that if it is the object of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite—and I do not see what 
     <lb/>
     other object they could have—to fan the 
     <lb/>
     flame of religious antagonism in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, they are engaged in a work that is not 
     <lb/>
     creditable to any man who engages in it. 
     <lb/>
     I think the people will ask them whether 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada is the proper 
     <lb/>
     place for members elected to represent all 
     <lb/>
     portions of this community to endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     excite one portion against another on mat<lb break="no"/>ters that come very close to their hearts. 
     <lb/>
     Great love is professed by some of them for 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate. Oh, how they admire 
     <lb/>
     him, how they respect him, and so on; then 
     <lb/>
     in another breath they call him a man who 
     <lb/>
     is conspiring against the liberties of the 
     <lb/>
     people. Take the 'World' of yesterday, the 
     <lb/>
     organ of my hon. friend opposite. Here I 
     <lb/>
     may say that if the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     holds the Prime Minister responsible for 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4026</fw>
           

     what appears in 'Le Soliel' and other papers 
     <lb/>
     all right, if that is to be the line, we will 
     <lb/>
     hold him responsible for what appears in 
     <lb/>
     the organs of his party.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The journal in ques<lb break="no"/>tion had declared itself to be under his par<lb break="no"/>ticular charge and direction and to be the

     the ' Soleil.' I read an extract from the edi<lb break="no"/>torial utterance of the ' Soleil ' of the 11th of 
     <lb/>
     February, and I also pointed out that, as 
     <lb/>
     we understood, the control of that paper 
     <lb/>
     was vested in a very important member of 
     <lb/>
     the present administration, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Yes, I heard what the

     hon. gentleman said; and I leave it to your 
     <lb/>
     judgment, Mr. Speaker, and to the members 
     <lb/>
     of the House, whether that connects the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister with the 'Soleil' as closely 
     <lb/>
     as the Toronto 'World' is connected with 
     <lb/>
     the hon gentleman who leads the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion. The editor of the 'World' is his sup<lb break="no"/>porter, to judge by his utterance, he is his 
     <lb/>
     right-hand man—if you leave the member 
     <lb/>
     for North Toronto out—in this House, and 
     <lb/>
     he will not deny it. He is not the one who 
     <lb/>
     was anxious to have the hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>
     come to Carleton with the hope of getting a 
     <lb/>
     seat in the House, when unfortunately he 
     <lb/>
     was defeated in his own province ; he is the 
     <lb/>
     man who rises and speaks for the party, the 
     <lb/>
     bosom friend of the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion. Surely, surely, the paper of that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman may be taken as indicating the 
     <lb/>
     views of the leader of the opposition, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the reasoning of the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition with regard to the 'Soleil.' 
     <lb/>
     What is one of the leading editorials in that 
     <lb/>
     paper to-day? Speaking of Monseigneur 
     <lb/>
     Sabatti—

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I am glad to be cor<lb break="no"/>rected, because it would be too bad to make 
     <lb/>
     a mistake with reference to his name, lest 
     <lb/>
     the wrong person should be summoned. But 
     <lb/>
     the organ of my hon. friend, known to be 
     <lb/>
     his organ because it is edited by one of his 
     <lb/>
     chief lieutenants, wants this reverend gen<lb break="no"/>tleman to be brought to the bar of the

     House. That is what they want to do with 
     <lb/>
     him. Now, then, I want to ask the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition, does he propose—if we 
     <lb/>
     are to hold him responsible, according to 
     <lb/>
     his own reasoning, for what appears in the 
     <lb/>
     Toronto 'World'—does he propose to bring 
     <lb/>
     —I had better say the Papal ablegate—be<lb break="no"/>fore the bar of the House? Is that the

     policy of the leader of the opposition and

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     does not deny it. Are we then bound to 
     <lb/>
     assume, by his silence in answering my 
     <lb/>
     question, that they propose to bring that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to the bar of the House? If 
     <lb/>
     that is a part of their policy, they had better 
     <lb/>
     bring Mr. Rogers too, because he has said 
     <lb/>
     a great many things in his manifesto which 
     <lb/>
     are very difficult to reconcile or to under<lb break="no"/>stand ; and if there is to be any examina<lb break="no"/>tion at the bar of the House as to what 
     <lb/>
     has transpired, it would be very nice to put 
     <lb/>
     some questions to Mr. Rogers. It would be 
     <lb/>
     very nice to ask him, in the first place, how 
     <lb/>
     he came to write that manifesto which any<lb break="no"/>body reading it would suppose to mean that 
     <lb/>
     he himself was the one who had the inter<lb break="no"/>view with the Papal ablegate. He speaks 
     <lb/>
     in the plural, the hon. gentleman says, and 
     <lb/>
     he was one of the deputation. And in the 
     <lb/>
     document also he speaks in the singular—he 
     <lb/>
     says 'I ' rather a mixed document. Like to 
     <lb/>
     know where the singular ceases and the 
     <lb/>
     plural commences. Like to know why he 
     <lb/>
     thought it necessary to write such a docu<lb break="no"/>ment. His indignation, it would seem, was 
     <lb/>
     aroused against this Papal delegate for 
     <lb/>
     daring to suggest such a thing to him, but 
     <lb/>
     he had no opportunity, apparently, to ex<lb break="no"/>press his indignation for six long weeks. 
     <lb/>
     And at last, when he had time to express 
     <lb/>
     his indignation, he carefully dug out from 
     <lb/>
     ' Hansard,' or somewhere else, correspond<lb break="no"/>ence that had taken place between certain 
     <lb/>
     parties years ago, when some members of 
     <lb/>
     this House professing the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     faith had communication with the head of 
     <lb/>
     their church in reference to matters in 
     <lb/>
     which there was feeling in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec in which these gentlemen resided. 
     <lb/>
     And these things are dragged in here. What 
     <lb/>
     for ? Why to work upon the feelings and 
     <lb/>
     passions of those whom hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     opposite hope to influence. But let me tell 
     <lb/>
     these hon. gentlemen one thing which, if 
     <lb/>
     they go on, I am sure they will find out for 
     <lb/>
     themselves. My province, which is also the 
     <lb/>
     province of the hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule), the province that I am proud 
     <lb/>
     to call my own, will not be led away by such 
     <lb/>
     unworthy cries as these. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I would like to read the

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Yes, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule) might read me letters. 
     <lb/>
     And am I uncharitable in saying that the 
     <lb/>
     object of the hon. gentleman in bringing up 
     <lb/>
     subjects like these, taking up the time of 
     <lb/>
     the House and delaying the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country, is to keep alive the feeling that has 
     <lb/>
     been created ? But that is the very reason 
     <lb/>
     why these hon. gentlemen must have their 
     <lb/>
     answer every time they bring these matters 
     <lb/>
     up. We must know whether their object 
     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I would like to ask the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman Mr. Paterson) whether, 
     <lb/>
     when he occupied hours of the time of this 
     <lb/>
     House in denouncing the Manitoba school 
     <lb/>
     law he was raising a race and religious cry? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Certainly not. The 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party does not do that. Certainly 
     <lb/>
     not. And we are challenged and told that 
     <lb/>
     if we go to the country we shall be de<lb break="no"/>feated. Does the hon. gentleman know 
     <lb/>
     that all these events the correspondence con<lb break="no"/>cerning which has been dug up by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers occurred before the election of 1900, 
     <lb/>
     when the country sent the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) back to 
     <lb/>
     carry on public affairs? Is he aware that 
     <lb/>
     this matter was before the country, and 
     <lb/>
     all the documents in ' Hansard,' before 1904 
     <lb/>
     when an appeal was made to the country, 
     <lb/>
     and when the Liberal party was again 
     <lb/>
     returned to power by a sweeping majority ? 
     <lb/>
     There is only one object in this that I can 
     <lb/>
     see, and that is the vain hope that, now that 
     <lb/>
     there is some feeling—and I am bound to 
     <lb/>
     confess a good deal of feeling—in the coun<lb break="no"/>try owing to the press. not alone the ' Toron<lb break="no"/>to World,' but papers from whom better 
     <lb/>
     might have been expected— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. What about the 
     <lb/>
     ' Globe' ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr PATERSON. If the 'Globe' differs 
     <lb/>
     with the government in reference to the 
     <lb/>
     Autonomy Bill as they understand it, hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite can get an idea of the 
     <lb/>
     'Globe's ' opinion of. Mr. Rogers if they read 
     <lb/>
     the editorial of to-day's issue. I have not 
     <lb/>
     the paper with me, but I think the Tories 
     <lb/>
     will find that the portrait of the man they 
     <lb/>
     have tried to magnify is not a flattering one 
     <lb/>
     as presented by the 'Globe.' I must not 
     <lb/>
     detain the House longer, having spoken at 
     <lb/>
     greater length than I had intended. But I 
     <lb/>
     make no apology. I have no desire to pro<lb break="no"/>long the debate, and I want the business of 
     <lb/>
     the House to go on. For that reason, I have 
     <lb/>
     remained silent sometimes when I would 
     <lb/>
     have liked to speak. And so have other 
     <lb/>
     members on this side. But, if this is to be 
     <lb/>
     made the arena in which the battle of poli<lb break="no"/>tical parties are to be fought out on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of attempts on the part of Liberal- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Conservatives, to arouse the passions and 
     <lb/>
     feelings of the country, I am prepared to 
     <lb/>
     take my part by speaking here when it 
     <lb/>
     becomes necessary. And the same is true 
     <lb/>
     of other hon. gentlemen on this side. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite will not deny the ' Ham<lb break="no"/>ilton Spectator ' as one of their organs. The 
     <lb/>
     hon member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker) 
     <lb/>
     dare not deny it. And what does the 
     <lb/>
     'Hamilton Spectator' say. Here it is— 
     <lb/>
     black line at the top, and the heading 'Never

     Hon. gentlemen opposite have had read 
     <lb/>
     'Le Soleil' and other Liberal papers, and 
     <lb/>
     sought to hold the government responsible 
     <lb/>
     for their utterances. The Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     has given his answer. But here is the organ 
     <lb/>
     of the Tory party in the city of Hamilton, 
     <lb/>
     where dwells the chief organizer, as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it—Mr. Barker—and I ask the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition : Is that the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal-Conservative party under him ? 
     <lb/>
     Well, Sir, if it be, all I can say is that it 
     <lb/>
     is unworthy of any party or any paper to 
     <lb/>
     take such a position as that which he has 
     <lb/>
     taken. Sir, what is implied in it, and what 
     <lb/>
     is in it ? That two-fifths of the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country can never expect to have one 
     <lb/>
     of their number, no matter how gifted, no 
     <lb/>
     matter how pro-eminent his abilities may 
     <lb/>
     be, to fill the first position in this land ; 
     <lb/>
     he cannot have that position because he is 
     <lb/>
     a French Canadian. That is something 
     <lb/>
     which I think the people of my province 
     <lb/>
     will not endorse. That is something which 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country will not endorse, 
     <lb/>
     and I hope to hear a repudiation of that 
     <lb/>
     from hon. gentlemen opposite, for it will be 
     <lb/>
     better for them to denounce such sentiments 
     <lb/>
     as that. Sir, all I want to say in conclu<lb break="no"/>sion is this : The attempt is made by the 
     <lb/>
     party opposite, in order to secure power, 
     <lb/>
     and it is made through their press, to at<lb break="no"/>tack the leader of this government, knowing 
     <lb/>
     the strong man that he is, and believing 
     <lb/>
     that if they can strike him down, they 
     <lb/>
     might then hope to attain office, and to this 
     <lb/>
     end you will find such articles as I have 
     <lb/>
     read to you and such expressions in this 
     <lb/>
     House. These attacks are made in order 
     <lb/>
     that he may be struck and that, by striking 
     <lb/>
     him and by possibly weakening his power, 
     <lb/>
     they will weaken the party which he leads. 
     <lb/>
     They tell us they have succeeded to such an 
     <lb/>
     extent that, as one hon. gentleman told us, 
     <lb/>
     only two counties in Ontario would return 
     <lb/>
     Liberal supporters of the Liberal govern<lb break="no"/>ment the county of Prescott and the coun<lb break="no"/>ty of Russell. They ask us : Why don't 
     <lb/>
     you open London ? Why don't you open 
     <lb/>
     other constituencies ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. London is not vacant. 
     <lb/>
     They say we dare not open a county. I 
     <lb/>
     would ask them : Do they suppose that if 
     <lb/>
     Centre Toronto, or London, or any other 
     <lb/>
     single constituency in this country, was 
     <lb/>
     opened and was carried by them that that 
     <lb/>
     would mean the inevitable return of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party to power ? Sir, if it was to 
     <lb/>
     be decided by the verdict of a single consti<lb break="no"/>tuency and on one question, I would say 
     <lb/>
     that the better place to open a consistuency 
     <lb/>
     would he in the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4030</fw>
    

     where they say these people are going to be 
     <lb/>
     bound and shackled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I am glad to hear that 
     <lb/>
     they approve of that ; I thought they could 
     <lb/>
     not do otherwise. If there happened to be 
     <lb/>
     an election there that would be a better test 
     <lb/>
     in reference to this question than any con<lb break="no"/>stituency you might open in another pro<lb break="no"/>vince. They tell us there is a departure 
     <lb/>
     from principle in this Bill. They say that 
     <lb/>
     the relations of church and state are em<lb break="no"/>bodied in this Bill. I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     how ? Are these separate schools, as they 
     <lb/>
     are termed in the Bill, in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     separate schools for Catholics alone ? No ; 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen know that they are minority 
     <lb/>
     schools for Protestants as well as Catho<lb break="no"/>lics. Do you say the provinces do not want 
     <lb/>
     them ? Then why have they kept them, as 
     <lb/>
     I am told they have ? As was pointed out 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott), while there may be a minority of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic faith in the Territories, taking 
     <lb/>
     them as a whole, there are several localities 
     <lb/>
     where the Protestants are in the minority, 
     <lb/>
     and if in some of these they desire to have 
     <lb/>
     their minority schools, they are, under the 
     <lb/>
     law which it is proposed to continue, the 
     <lb/>
     law of the Territories, enacted by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature representing these people, enabled to 
     <lb/>
     have their schools and to have their religi<lb break="no"/>ous instruction of a Protestant character and 
     <lb/>
     according to the Protestant faith. Where 
     <lb/>
     is the connection between church and state? 
     <lb/>
     Provincial rights ! Members talk about pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights who have not been noted for 
     <lb/>
     standing up for them in the past. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster), 
     <lb/>
     who made that inflammatory speech this af<lb break="no"/>ternoon—and he has admitted by the refer<lb break="no"/>ence which he made at the close that it was 
     <lb/>
     an inflammatory speech—gives us to under<lb break="no"/>stand that he is on that platform, admits 
     <lb/>
     that he hopes he may be able to climb into 
     <lb/>
     power, not, as he professed some years ago, 
     <lb/>
     by being in favour of securing liberty and 
     <lb/>
     rights to the minorities, but by being in 
     <lb/>
     favour of taking them away from whom ? 
     <lb/>
     As far as he is concerned, by taking out the 
     <lb/>
     clauses in the Bill that now gives liberty to 
     <lb/>
     the minority. He told us on a previous oc<lb break="no"/>casion that for three successive elections 
     <lb/>
     this question had been fought and the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party sustained, and, therefore, as 
     <lb/>
     long as grass grew and waters ran, he did 
     <lb/>
     not feel disposed to go against that will as 
     <lb/>
     thus three times expressed upon that ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Sir, a principle, if it is right, is right 
     <lb/>
     all the time. If minority rights were sacred 
     <lb/>
     in his eyes, as he said they were in 1896, 
     <lb/>
     minority rights ought to be sacred to him 
     <lb/>
     now, no matter how the election went. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     I am not going into the question ; I have 
     <lb/>
     spoken once, and I do not want to again 
     <lb/>
     take the opportunity of doing so. I am re<lb break="no"/>plying to what hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     have said in their speeches. All I have to 
     <lb/>

     say is that they may strike at the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, their papers may endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     inflame the people, as in that article which 
     <lb/>
     I have just read—and they confess that it 
     <lb/>
     is having its effect on the country, and that 
     <lb/>
     some friends of the Liberal party are not in 
     <lb/>
     accord with their friends on this Bill, and 
     <lb/>
     that may be true, and I shall regret if it 
     <lb/>
     continues so—but I want to say that, so 
     <lb/>
     far as I know, the Liberal parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     party, which ought to know as much about 
     <lb/>
     the nature of this Bill as any one, a party 
     <lb/>
     who, I believe, are as honest and conscien<lb break="no"/>tious as their fellow—men, are not divided, 
     <lb/>
     are not disunited on this Bill. And, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     when the time comes that this question has 
     <lb/>
     to be discussed before the people, as it will 
     <lb/>
     come, then it will be discussed in all its 
     <lb/>
     bearings, and Whatever the verdict may be, 
     <lb/>
    the government, and the members who have 
     <lb/>confidence in the government, will accept 
     <lb/>the verdict that may be rendered by the 
     <lb/>people. Prophesies as to what will occur 
     <lb/>are of no value. We had prophesies before 
     <lb/>the last election, great prophesies which ut<lb break="no"/>terly failed. All I have to say is 
     <lb/>that I believe the Liberal party stand 
     <lb/>to-day where they have ever stood. They 
     <lb/>stood on the principle of ruling this country 
     <lb/>in such a way as to give equal rights, 
     <lb/>liberties and privileges to all classes and 
     <lb/>creeds, and we are here to—day. There has 
     <lb/>been no departure. There was an attempt 
     <lb/>made by the Conservative party in 1896 to 
     <lb/>have this parliament enact a law which 
     <lb/>would override a law passed by a province 
     <lb/>which had the power to pass that law. 
     <lb/>They say that the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>who leads the government threw himself 
     <lb/>across the path and prevented it. Yes, 
     <lb/>because he said that the only way to accom<lb break="no"/>plish that was to accomplish it through the 
     <lb/>action of the local government which had 
     <lb/>the power under the constitution, as had 
     <lb/>been declared by the highest court in the 
     <lb/>empire. But, Sir, is that the case of the 
     <lb/>Territories ? Is that the case of this Bill? 
     <lb/>Are we seeking to override the law of the 
     <lb/>Territories, making them take something 
     <lb/>they do not want? We are simply continu<lb break="no"/>ing what the government and the legislature 
     <lb/>of the Territories enacted as their school 
     <lb/>law, and which their premier says, if he 
     <lb/>were a dictator to-morrow, he would not 
     <lb/>rescind or abrogate. Sir, where is the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of provincial rights in this? Yes, the 
     <lb/>attempt was made to have the country 
     <lb/>believe that the right hon. Prime Minister 
     <lb/>has gone back on the principles he professed 
     <lb/>and that he is no longer worthy of the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of the people. Well, I say we have 
     <lb/>confidence in him. They speak about what 
     <lb/>he did in; 1896. They unearthed the docu<lb break="no"/>ments and read them to-day. What has been 
     <lb/>the condition of this country since 1896 under, 
     <lb/>as their papers will say, a French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Prime Minister, or as they put it some<lb break="no"/>times, a French Prime Minister? What 
     <lb/>has been the condition of this country? 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4032</fw>
     

     What was it before 1896?—stagnation, no 
     <lb/>
     increase of population, an empty Northwest, 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Blake said at one time, trade almost 
     <lb/>
     paralyzed, hope in many breasts gone, divi<lb break="no"/>sions among the people like what I am 
     <lb/>
     afraid their efforts tending in that direction 
     <lb/>
     may produce again. And yes, there were 
     <lb/>
     divisions in the government as well and 
     <lb/>
     this was the result of it. Yet we find a 
     <lb/>
     member of that government standing up to<lb break="no"/>day and making the speech that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 
     <lb/>
     made, speaking in reference to this matter, 
     <lb/>
     belittling this government, or the members 
     <lb/>
     of this government, although he was a 
     <lb/>
     member of that government during the years 
     <lb/>
     of this stagnation and decay. What is the 
     <lb/>
     condition of the country to-day under Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier, French Canadian Premier 
     <lb/>
     though he is? We do not put it in that 
     <lb/>
     way; French by extraction, French in his 
     <lb/>
     ancestry. His ancestors were French and 
     <lb/>
     he is proud of it, yours may have been 
     <lb/>
     English and you are proud of it, yours may 
     <lb/>
     have been Irish and you are proud of it, 
     <lb/>
     mine were Scotch and I am proud of it. 
     <lb/>
     Still we are Canadians one and all, and Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier is Canada's Prime Minister. 
     <lb/>
     I say to the hon. gentleman opposite and 
     <lb/>
     to those whom my words may reach outside 
     <lb/>
     of this House who have given us their con<lb break="no"/>fidence in the times past that there is no one 
     <lb/>
     who will say that Sir Wilfrid Laurier by 
     <lb/>
     any unworthy motive can be swerved from 
     <lb/>
     what he believes to be the line of duty. 
     <lb/>
     Not only do I want to tell these people 
     <lb/>
     but I want to tell you younger members 
     <lb/>
     of the House who have come in here that 
     <lb/>
     I was here when the Liberal party lost the 
     <lb/>
     services of Edward Blake. It became a 
     <lb/>
    question who was to lead us. We were 
     <lb/>in opposition and a small minority too. 
     <lb/>There was one man amongst us who stood 
     <lb/>preeminent above all others, known and 
     <lb/>admitted, and of course the choice fell on 
     <lb/>him. He was asked to accept. He hesi<lb break="no"/>tated; no, he refused at first. Pressure was 
     <lb/>brought to bear upon him. I remember his 
     <lb/>reply: No, I am one of the minority in race 
     <lb/>and one of the minority in faith; I think 
     <lb/>that the party would do better to elect one 
     <lb/>of the majority. The reply of the Liberal 
     <lb/>parliamentary party was this: The Liberal 
     <lb/>parliamentary party do not ask a man what 
     <lb/>his race or ancestry have been. They do 
     <lb/>not ask at what altar he kneels. If they 
     <lb/>know him to have the qualities and the 
     <lb/>character that mark him out above all 
     <lb/>others for the position that is the man they 
     <lb/>want. Reluctantly he accepted it. For 
     <lb/>years he led us in opposition. Eight 
     <lb/>years in power under his leadership, eight 
     <lb/>years of unexanipled prosperity under his 
     <lb/>reign; eight years of national peace.

     plenty and prosperity and due largely to

     the right hon. gentleman who leads the

     under his happy influences, supported by

     the men who are around him, who have full

     confidence in him, there are in store years 
     <lb/>
     of progress and prosperity greater even than 
     <lb/>
     we have attained in the past, and, Sir, in 
     <lb/>
     this young country we must above all things 
     <lb/>
     be a united people, be Canadians one and all 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. E. B. OSLER</persName> (West Toronto). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I thought that this House had for 
     <lb/>
     the last two or three weeks and especially 
     <lb/>
     for the last two or three days been discus<lb break="no"/>sing a most serious question, a question 
     <lb/>
     that is recognized in this country, that is 
     <lb/>
    recognized by every hon. gentleman who has' 
     <lb/>spoken on the other side of the House, 
     <lb/>except the right hon. Prime Minister (Sir 
     <lb/>Wilfrid Laurier), as the most serious ques<lb break="no"/>tion we have had before this House in 
     <lb/>many and many a session of parliament. 
     <lb/>I suppose the strain of it has been too 
     <lb/>great, and therefore is has been arranged 
     <lb/>that we should have, for our relief, an 
     <lb/>exhibition of nigger minstrelsy and that a 
     <lb/>member of the government should be set up 
     <lb/>to do the Bardell and Pickwick sergeant 
     <lb/>Buzfuz act. He has done it admirably. He 
     <lb/>has done it to the entertainment of the hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen who sit in front of him and be<lb break="no"/>.hind him, but he has not done it to the 
     <lb/>edificntion of the country, nor has he ans 
     <lb/>weer the charges that are made against 
     <lb/>the government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The question before the House to-day is 
     <lb/>
     not the prosperity of the country; the ques<lb break="no"/>tion before the House to-day is not con<lb break="no"/>cerning old matters and old controversies 
     <lb/>
     between old members on this side and old 
     <lb/>
     members on that side of the House. The 
     <lb/>
     question before the country to-day is: shall 
     <lb/>
     we be governed by our own people or shall 
     <lb/>
     we be governed by a delegate representing 
     <lb/>
     a foreign authority ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. It has been admitted that

            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. It has been charged here

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. It has been charged here 
     <lb/>
    to-day, and it has not been denied, that 
     <lb/>the Prime Minister, although he did not con<lb break="no"/>sult the premier of the Territories, was in 
     <lb/>constant consultation withthe Papal able<lb break="no"/>gate in the framing of these educational 
     <lb/>clauses. I will give the Prime Minister an 
     <lb/>opportunity to deny that now, and if he de<lb break="no"/>nies it I shall withdraw all I am going to 
     <lb/>say ; I will not proceed farther. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Go on.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. That is the charge that is 
     <lb/>
     made. When the storm arose after this Bill 
     <lb/>
     was brought in, the Prime Minister and the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice, the next time they spoke, 
     <lb/>
     both said that the intention of that clause 
     <lb/>
     was simply to let things in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     remain as they are to-day. Is that true? 
     <lb/>
     If that be true, it took a whole month after 
     <lb/>
     the first Bill was introduced to get some<lb break="no"/>body to agree to the modification as we 
     <lb/>
     have it now. If the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice, and all the other 
     <lb/>
     members of the cabinet understood, or 
     <lb/>
     rather meant, that one thing should be em<lb break="no"/>bodied in that clause but found that another 
     <lb/>
     thing quite different was really in the clause 
     <lb/>

     as drawn—and that has been admitted by 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister and the members of his 
     <lb/>
     government—if that had been so, why 
     <lb/>
     should not that connection have been made 
     <lb/>
     within twenty—four hours  ? Why did it take 
     <lb/>
     a whole month of bickerings, of wranglings, 
     <lb/>
     of strife, which necessitated the resignation 
     <lb/>
     of one minister ; the most important minis<lb break="no"/>ter in connection with this Bill. It took a 
     <lb/>
     whole month of tribulation in the ranks of 
     <lb/>
     the government before any  change was 
     <lb/>
     made. The Prime Minister said that he did 
     <lb/>
     not understand that clause to mean what it 
     <lb/>
     did mean, the Minister of Justice said that 
     <lb/>
     he did not understand that clause to mean 
     <lb/>
     what it did mean.

            </p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. Did not the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice say that ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. No, I did not.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr.  OSLER</persName>. I beg the minister's par<lb break="no"/>don ; he said he did not understand it to 
     <lb/>
     mean what it did—what it was supposed to 
     <lb/>
     mean.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. It took a month to have 
     <lb/>
     that clause changed. It was not in the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister's power,  apparently, to 
     <lb/>
     change it to suit his own  views within that 
     <lb/>
     time. There was a power outside the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister and the Minister of Justice who 
     <lb/>
     had to be consulted before the concession 
     <lb/>
     was made that that clause should be 
     <lb/>
     changed.

            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. It is the only view sensible

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Sir WILLIAM MULOCK</persName>. It is the view  
     <lb/>
     evil-disposed persons take of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. OSLER</persName>. The colleague of the Post<lb break="no"/>master General took the view I take, name<lb break="no"/>ly, that  the meaning of the clause at first 
     <lb/>
     introduced, was so radically different from 
     <lb/>
     the clause now before us, that he resigned 
     <lb/>
     rather than accept it as first introduced, 
     <lb/>
     while he accepted it as now changed. 
     <lb/>
     The Prime Minister says that originally 
     <lb/>
     he intended the clause as it  in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     to-day. Was it not easy then, if he had the 
     <lb/>
     power to alter that clause to its present 
     <lb/>
     state, to do so without requiring the resig<lb break="no"/>nation of the Minister of the Interior ?

     pathetic appeal which the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance made to persuade himself that he was 
     <lb/>
     in favour of this Bill, he will find that the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance looked down at his 
     <lb/>
     venerable chief, and he pictured the disaster 
     <lb/>
     that would overtake the country if Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier were to resign. Great Heavens; 
     <lb/>
     there would not be another immigrant come 
     <lb/>
     to this country, we would be bankrupt, we 
     <lb/>
     would be a laughing stock. Well, if the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister resigned I think the country 
     <lb/>
     would be fairly resigned also. The Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance pictured what would happen if 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister would resign and the 
     <lb/>
     woeful disaster that would follow. I venture 
     <lb/>
     to say that consols would not fall one-eighth 
     <lb/>
     of a cent if the Prime Minister resigned. I 
     <lb/>
     venture to say that not one immigrant less 
     <lb/>
     would come into this country this year, and 
     <lb/>
     that the business of the country would go 
     <lb/>
     on and continue to be quite as prosperous 
     <lb/>
     as it is. The Prime Minister is being lauded 
     <lb/>
     as the man of conciliation. I say that in 
     <lb/>
     the manner in which he has introduced this 
     <lb/>
     Bill he has done more to cause racial and 
     <lb/>
     religious strife in this country than all his 
     <lb/>
     previous life of conciliation could counteract; 
     <lb/>
     and when his biography is written, instead 
     <lb/>
     of his epitaph being conciliation, as the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Agriculture suggested, it will be the 
     <lb/>
     reverse. In this one act, be it as honest, as 
     <lb/>
     straight, as simple in intention as it is 
     <lb/>
     claimed to be, yet, from the fact that he 
     <lb/>
     consulted outsiders and ignored the men 
     <lb/>
     who ought to have been consulted, he has 
     <lb/>
     brought about a state of things in Canada 
     <lb/>
     the effects of which not one man in this 
     <lb/>
     House will live to see wiped out.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I wish 
     <lb/>
     to say one or two words with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     remarks made by the hon. Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms with reference to myself. In the first 
     <lb/>
     place. it does seem to be a very considerable 
     <lb/>
     lowering of the dignity of parliament for a 
     <lb/>
     minister of the Crown to stand up in this 
     <lb/>
     House and make such an extraordinary ex<lb break="no"/>hibition of himself as the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms has made this evening. I hesitate to 
     <lb/>
     apply words to the conduct or the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, because I am afraid that I might 
     <lb/>
     transgress the rules of the parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     decorum. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Don't be afraid.

served anything very alarming about him, 
     <lb/>
     although he has a very loud voice. He is 
     <lb/>
     comparatively harmless. He is perhaps not 
     <lb/>
     as wise as the serpent, but after all he is 
     <lb/>
     as harmless as the dove. He has suggested 
     <lb/>
     as plainly as he could that I am in some 
     <lb/>
     way endeavouring to foment religious strife 
     <lb/>
     in this country— 
     <lb/>

            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on the other side say hear, hear. I want 
     <lb/>
     any one of those hon. gentlemen, when he 
     <lb/>
     comes to address this House to-night or on 
     <lb/>
     any future occasion, to point to one single 
     <lb/>
     word of mine during the progress of this 
     <lb/>
     debate which he can call in question in that 
     <lb/>
     regard. I am perfectly ready to be judged 
     <lb/>
     by my utterances ; but I do not want 
     <lb/>
     general statements of that kind applauded 
     <lb/>
     by men who apparently do not know that 
     <lb/>
     of which they speak. I have never said 
     <lb/>
     any word in this House or in this country 
     <lb/>
     which would suggest that any man, on ac<lb break="no"/>count of his race or religion, should not 
     <lb/>
     have the right to be Prime Minister of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. On the contrary, many times, in por<lb break="no"/>tions of this country where there was no 
     <lb/>
     man of the French race or who understood 
     <lb/>
     the French language, I have said, with re<lb break="no"/>gard to my right hon. friend who leads this 
     <lb/>
     House, that I saw no good reason why his 
     <lb/>
     fellow citizens of the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     should not entertain for him the very high<lb break="no"/>est possible admiration as a distinguished 
     <lb/>
     public man of their own race ; and I chal<lb break="no"/>lenge the production of any word I ever 
     <lb/>
     uttered such as the hon. Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms has endeavoured to-night to fasten 
     <lb/>
     upon me. Fomenting discord :—why, there 
     <lb/>
     was more in the speech of the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs to-night to foment race cries 
     <lb/>
     and religious discord than anything I have 
     <lb/>
     heard in this House since this debate began, 
     <lb/>
     and in his heart he knows it. And he knows 
     <lb/>
     the intent with which he quoted from the 
     <lb/>
     Hamilton ' Spectator ' ; no one knows it 
     <lb/>
     better than himself. He did it with a 
     <lb/>
     motive, and that motive is unworthy of any 
     <lb/>
     member of this House, and especially un<lb break="no"/>worthy of any man who strives to pose as 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Customs has done in 
     <lb/>
     this House ever since I have been a member 
     <lb/>
     of it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Did not the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman quote ' Le Soleil ' ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I did quote ' Le 
     <lb/>
     Soleil,' and I attached the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     its utterances to the Prime Minister, be<lb break="no"/>cause I knew that that paper was published 
     <lb/>
     by responsible men, and that those respon<lb break="no"/>sible men had said that it was under the 
     <lb/>
     control and direction of the Prime Minister.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Is the Hamilton ' Spec<lb break="no"/>tator ' not controlled by responsible men ?

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I will come to the<lb/>

     than that, when the control of 'Le Soleil' 
     <lb/>
     passed from the hon. Minister of Justice, it 
     <lb/>
     passed to the very gentleman who descended 
     <lb/>
     from the bench of the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     in order that he might become the organizer 
     <lb/>
     of the Liberal party in that province in the 
     <lb/>
     last election. That is why I attached some 
     <lb/>
     responsibility to the right hon. gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     connection with its utterances ; and I would 
     <lb/>
     like to know whether or not the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs thinks that in so doing under these 
     <lb/>
     circumstances I took anything like the 
     <lb/>
     position which he did with regard to myself 
     <lb/>
     and the Hamilton ' Spectator.' Has the 
     <lb/>
     Hamilton "Spectator" ever pretended to be 
     <lb/>
     my organ? Have I any control over it ? 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman knows, and he knew it 
     <lb/>
     when he made that quotation to-night, but 
     <lb/>
     he suppressed the fact, that the Hamilton 
     <lb/>
     ' Spectator' has most severely criticised me 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the very Bill which is 
     <lb/>
     before the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I did not know that.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman ought to have known it before he

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Why should I have

     known it ? Am I to be expected to read the

     <lb/>
     not know that it had criticised the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman adversely in connection with this

     friend permit me to ask him a question? 
     <lb/>
     Will he deny that within a comparatively 
     <lb/>
     recent period the Hamilton 'Spectator' has 
     <lb/>
     declared that it is perfectly satisfied with 
     <lb/>
     the manner in which the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Carleton is at present leading the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     whether it has done so or not; but I have 
     <lb/>
     been informed that the Hamilton Specta<lb break="no"/>tor' some two or three weeks ago severely 
     <lb/>
     criticised me in connection with this very 
     <lb/>
     Bill; and yet the Minister of Customs seeks 
     <lb/>
     to place upon me the responsibility of utter<lb break="no"/>ances of the Hamilton 'Spectator,' and ac<lb break="no"/>cuse me of inciting race prejudice and re<lb break="no"/>ligious discord in this country. That is 
     <lb/>
     what I understood to be the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's charge; am I correct ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     assumes that my remarks were all addressed 
     <lb/>
     to him, the remarks that had reference to 
     <lb/>
     many gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, he is assuming a good- deal. My 
     <lb/>
     words will show for themselves what I 
     <lb/>
     said. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman will not answer a straightforward

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4040</fw>
        

     question which I put to him. Very good, I 
     <lb/>
     will pass from that. If he has not the 
     <lb/>
     courage to answer yes or no, I will leave 
     <lb/>
     him to the judgment of the House and of the 
     <lb/>
     country. But I want to know this from 
     <lb/>
     him, and from those who have said so much 
     <lb/>
     about exciting race prejudice and religious 
     <lb/>
     discord, whether they make that charge also 
     <lb/>
     against the Laurier Club of Toronto, which 
     <lb/>
     has uttered some protests on this subject. 
     <lb/>
     whether they charge that against the In<lb break="no"/>dian Head Liberal Club in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     which has addressed a similar protest, and 
     <lb/>
     whether they charge that against the 
     <lb/>
     hundreds of Liberals who attended a 
     <lb/>
     large meeting in the city of Toronto at 
     <lb/>
     which resolutions were passed with regard 
     <lb/>
     to this Bill. My hon. friend the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs is very inquisitive, might I ad<lb break="no"/>dress the question to him and ask whether 
     <lb/>
     he is charging these gentlemen with exciting 
     <lb/>
     religious discord and race prejudice ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. No, I am not. A great 
     <lb/>
     many of my remarks were intended for men 
     <lb/>
     whom they will fit. I did not allude very 
     <lb/>
     much to the leader of the opposition in the 
     <lb/>
     remarks I made, his remarks in this House 
     <lb/>
     have not been of the inflammatory nature 
     <lb/>
     of some others. But if he wishes to assume 
     <lb/>
     responsibility for all that has been said on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House, then of course 
     <lb/>
     I am not to blame. Individually, I did not 
     <lb/>
     attribute it to him. My remarks, if I must 
     <lb/>
     say it here, were based more especially on 
     <lb/>
     what has been said by the member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto (Mr. Foster), who is not in the 
     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Then I must say at 
     <lb/>
     once that I very much misunderstood the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. He was pointing his finger 
     <lb/>
     at me in a somewhat dramatic way, and on 
     <lb/>
     several occasions at least he alluded to me 
     <lb/>
     because he mentioned the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition. I do not think that gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     throughout this country, and many of them 
     <lb/>
     Liberals who have protested against cer<lb break="no"/>tain features of the Bill now under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion-I will not discuss it at all, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman spent about twenty minutes or 
     <lb/>
     half an hour in discussing the Bill, which 
     <lb/>
     he had no right to do—I do not think these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen can be accused of exciting re<lb break="no"/>ligious prejudice or race discord. Nor do 
     <lb/>
     I think that they should be characterized, 
     <lb/>
     as the member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) 
     <lb/>
     has characterized them, as renegade Lib<lb break="no"/>erals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I did not do anything 
     <lb/>
     of the sort.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Did not the member 
     <lb/>
     for Ottawa use that expression ?   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Yes, but not in the 
     <lb/>
     connection that the hon. gentleman states 
     <lb/>
     now.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. To whom did he

     apply it ?

     as to those that term applies to, because 
     <lb/>
     they get no information whatever on the

            </p>
   
            <p>

     the cap will fit.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It was applied to 
     <lb/>
     them, as I understood, somewhat compre<lb break="no"/>hensively. I did not notice that the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, in making his remarks, expressed 
     <lb/>
     any reservation, I understood his words had 
     <lb/>
     a general application.

            </p>
   
            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Then whoever dif<lb break="no"/>fers from the government is a renegade Lib<lb break="no"/>eral, according to the member for Ottawa, 
     <lb/>
     because this cap may fit him. Now 
     <lb/>
     something has been said about the interfer<lb break="no"/>ence of clergymen in the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario and elsewhere, and I myself have read 
     <lb/>
     protests passed in different portions of the 
     <lb/>
     maritime provinces by religious bodies and 
     <lb/>
     bodies composed of clergymen, in regard to 
     <lb/>
     this matter. They have been charged, as 
     <lb/>
     I understand also, with exciting religious 
     <lb/>
     prejudice and race discord, so I suppose 
     <lb/>
     the observations of the Minister of Customs 
     <lb/>
     will apply to these gentlemen as well. Does 
     <lb/>
     he charge them with exciting religious pre<lb break="no"/>judice and race discord ?

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, then, I want 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Customs to answer me this : 
     <lb/>
     Where has anything been said in this House 
     <lb/>
     in criticism of this measure that goes be<lb break="no"/>yond the protest to which he referred from 
     <lb/>
     his Liberal friends throughout the country, 
     <lb/>
     and from clergymen in the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario and in the maritime provinces ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. A great deal has been

            <p>

     heard it, my hon. friend has not quoted it. 
     <lb/>
     Now I have here the expression of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Ottawa to which I alluded, it

     is this :

     Is it not true, Mr. Speaker, that this agitation 
     <lb/>
     has been confined almost exclusively to the

     Conservative press and to gentlemen who be<lb break="no"/>long to the Conservative party ? With the ex<lb break="no"/>ception of a few misguided or misinformed or

     Anything further ? Well, I will leave it 
     <lb/>
     in that way, Mr. Speaker. Now some criti<lb break="no"/>cism has been made by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs and the Minister of Agriculture 
     <lb/>
     with regard to my having adverted in this 
     <lb/>
     House to a statement made by the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Robert Rogers. May I be permitted res<lb break="no"/>pectfully to observe that I made no refer<lb break="no"/>ence to that, except a very brief one yes<lb break="no"/>terday, after it had been introduced into 
     <lb/>
     this House by the right hon. the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister himself. My observations to-day were 
     <lb/>
     not based upon what Mr. Rogers said in 
     <lb/>
     the interview referred to ; my observations 
     <lb/>
     were confined almost exclusively to the state<lb break="no"/>ment which has been given out by His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency, the delegate of the Holy See. I 
     <lb/>
     did not base that article, although the 
     <lb/>
     article has been characterized as a hearsay 
     <lb/>
     article by the hon. member for Pictou (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald). He asked whether I did not 
     <lb/>
     know as a lawyer that hearsay evidence 
     <lb/>
     is of no value ? I ask him as a member of 
     <lb/>
     this House who sat here and heard me, 
     <lb/>
     where were his ears ? Does he not know, 
     <lb/>
     or did not he hear at all ? What is the use 
     <lb/>
     of his talking about hearsay evidence ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. Does my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     undertake to say that he does not pay any 
     <lb/>
     attention to this statement of Mr. Rogers, 
     <lb/>
     and does not put it forward as a ground for 
     <lb/>
     this discussion ?

<p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The hon gentleman's<lb/>use of the word ' impertinent ' I submit,<lb/>is out of order, and he should not persist in it.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>.  The word ' impertinent ' 
     <lb/>
    is one of those words classed as out of 
     <lb/>order in the authorities as I have read 
     <lb/>them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I may say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that a former Speaker of this 
     <lb/>
     House ruled that the word ' impertinent ' 
     <lb/>
     is allowed, if used in a proper sense. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I will not take 
     <lb/>
     up time with regard to that. I will sim<lb break="no"/>ply say that the hon. gentleman's question 
     <lb/>
     is not pertinent—which is what I under<lb break="no"/>stand the word ' impertinent ' to mean. I 
     <lb/>
     assure my hon. friend from Pictou (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald) that I did not use the word in 
     <lb/>
     an offensive way. I thought he was rather 
     <lb/>
     quibbling when he put the question and so 
     <lb/>
     answered in the way I did. His point was 
     <lb/>
     that I had used hearsay evidence ; mine 
     <lb/>
     was that I had used the statement of the 
     <lb/>
     delegate himself. He asked me if I con<lb break="no"/>sidered the statement of Mr. Rogers of any 
     <lb/>
     value. That was not pertinent to the mat<lb break="no"/>ter with which I was then dealing. I was 
     <lb/>
     pointing out that he was absolutely mis<lb break="no"/>taken, and could not understand why he 
     <lb/>
     should be mistaken, when he suggested 
     <lb/>
     to me that I was using hearsay evidence 
     <lb/>
     and that as a lawyer I ought to know that 
     <lb/>
     it was of no value. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. The question is whe<lb break="no"/>ther he places any value on the hearsay 
     <lb/>evidence of Mr. Rogers. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. If my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     will pennit me to say so without offence, I 
     <lb/>
     place more reliance on the statement of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Rogers than I do on statements of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Oh, oh. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I am not saying that 
     <lb/>
     in any offensive sense. It would be natural 
     <lb/>
     as Mr. Rogers has been called a Tory friend 
     <lb/>
     of mine, that I should place more reliance 
     <lb/>
     on statements of that hon. gentleman than 
     <lb/>
     I would on the statements of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Pictou. Now, just a word more. 
     <lb/>
     So far as the subject I introduced to the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House this afternoon is 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I trust my right hon. friend (Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier) will not think that I was 
     <lb/>
     guilty of any intentional discourtesy in 
     <lb/>
     not sending him word about it. The rela<lb break="no"/>tions between the right hon. gentleman and 
     <lb/>
     myself in that regard have been very good, 
     <lb/>
     and I think he will do me the justice of 
     <lb/>
     saying that I have taken pains, sometimes 
     <lb/>even when I thought they were unnecessary,<lb/>to give him notice of matters that I intended<lb/>to bring up in the House. There was a<lb/>statement made by the right hon. gentleman<lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4044</fw>
         

     yesterday and he was perfectly in order in 
     <lb/>
     making it without giving me notice, though 
     <lb/>
     I might have supposed that, if he in<lb break="no"/>tended to make the extended remarks he 
     <lb/>
     did, it would have been proper that I should 
     <lb/>
     have had a word of intimation. But, as the 
     <lb/>
     subject was taken up and as it was followed 
     <lb/>
     by the statement of His Excellency the 
     <lb/>
     delegate himself, I did not suppose for a 
     <lb/>
     moment that he would expect further notice 
     <lb/>
     from me. And I trust that he will accept 
     <lb/>
     the further assurance that if I had dreamed 
     <lb/>
     that he would expect notice of my bringing 
     <lb/>
     it up to-day, I would have given it and so 
     <lb/>
     fulfilled the courtesy that was due to the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman, and which has always 
     <lb/>
     been extended from him to myself in all 
     <lb/>
     matters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So far as the question at issue is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, the debate has wandered consider<lb break="no"/>ably from the point at which it started. 
     <lb/>
     I do not know that I could usefully add 
     <lb/>
     anything to what I said this afternoon. I 
     <lb/>
     endeavoured to express the views that I 
     <lb/>
     hold in a temperate and moderate man<lb break="no"/>ner ; and, without any idea of fomenting re<lb break="no"/>ligious discord or race prejudice, I brought 
     <lb/>
     the subject to the attention of the House and 
     <lb/>
     drew certain inferences which, in my judg<lb break="no"/>ment were well founded, but which, are 
     <lb/>
     matters of judgment and opinion. These 
     <lb/>
     were very strongly controverted by my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend in the remarks he addressed to 
     <lb/>
     the House. I have no fault to find with the 
     <lb/>
     tone of his remarks or with the challenge 
     <lb/>
     he threw out. It may be that the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's prophesy will prove cor<lb break="no"/>rect : If this question ever does come as 
     <lb/>
     a direct issue before the people, the course 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman has taken may be 
     <lb/>
     found, in the judgment of the people, to have 
     <lb/>
     been a wise, prudent, and constitutional 
     <lb/>
     course. I greatly doubt it. So far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, if that verdict is given, I shall 
     <lb/>
     be perfectly willing to accept it. For the 
     <lb/>
     present, the only thing that remains for me 
     <lb/>
     to say is that whether the verdict of the 
     <lb/>
     people shall be as the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     prophesies or not, I shall have no word 
     <lb/>
     to withdraw from those which I have spoken 
     <lb/>
     on this subject to-day.

     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Hon. CHARLES FITZPATRICK</persName> (Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice). Mr. Speaker, the speech 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) has just made is such 
     <lb/>
     a speech as those of us who have known 
     <lb/>
     him for the last seven or eight years in  
     <lb/>
     this House would expect. He is quite 
     <lb/>
     evidently heartily ashamed of a great deal 
     <lb/>
    that has been said in this House and for 
     <lb/>which, perhaps, improperly, he has been 
     <lb/>held responsible, and he is even more 
     <lb/>ashamed of what has been said out<lb break="no"/>side of this House ; and in as far as<lb/>it was possible for him to do it, he 
     <lb/>has fully apologized and excused him<lb break="no"/>self for his connection direct or indirect 
     <lb/>

          <fw type="num">4045</fw>  <fw type="dateline">APRIL 6, 1905</fw> 
      

     with what has been said. Sir I was some<lb break="no"/>what at a loss to apprehend the meaning 
     <lb/>
     of this discussion, somewhat at a loss to 
     <lb/>
     understand the cause of it. I must admit 
     <lb/>
     that, I could scarcely see the reason for 
     <lb/>
     resurrecting a debate that had practically 
     <lb/>
     ended yesterday. But when a distinguished 
     <lb/>
     politician from the province of Quebec, one 
     <lb/>
     who is prominent in the local legislature, 
     <lb/>
     appeared on the floor of this House this 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, and when I witnessed the en<lb break="no"/>thusiasm of the hon. member for Beauhar<lb break="no"/>nois (Mr. Bergeron), when my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition was speaking, 
     <lb/>
     I realized what it all meant. And what 
     <lb/>
     does it all mean ? It means neither more 
     <lb/>
     nor less than an attack upon the Papal dele<lb break="no"/>gate, not for anything he has done in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the particular question now in 
     <lb/>
     issue before this House, but because of 
     <lb/>
     the political conditions which have existed 
     <lb/>
     in Quebec since his coming here. Now, 
     <lb/>
     the events of 1896 are fresh in the minds of 
     <lb/>
     all of us. I have no desire to go over the 
     <lb/>
     old story of our troubles and misfortunes 
     <lb/>
     at that time. Every one here knows what 
     <lb/>
     took place in the province of Quebec, and 
     <lb/>
     knows the circumstances under which it 
     <lb/>
     was necessary for a certain number of 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic gentlemen in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec to appeal to the Pope; and 
     <lb/>
     every one knows who has followed the cur<lb break="no"/>rent of political events that the result of 
     <lb/>
     that appeal was the coming to this country 
     <lb/>
     of the delegate. And since his coming in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec we have had peace, 
     <lb/>
     and since his coming political liberty has 
     <lb/>
     reigned in the province of Quebec. And 
     <lb/>
     that peace and that political liberty are 
     <lb/>
     what our friends on the other side from the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec do not want, and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen are now endeavouring to 
     <lb/>
     obtain the recall of this gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     become a burden to them, because that peace 
     <lb/>
     of which I have spoken a moment ago has 
     <lb/>
     become irksome to these gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have fed and thrived on discord during their 
     <lb/>
     years of power. The leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition (Mr. R. L. Borden) has in the per<lb break="no"/>formance of what he believed to be his duty 
     <lb/>
     to his party brought this matter up in a 
     <lb/>
     half-hearted way. He has brought it up be<lb break="no"/>cause he has thought it necesary to do it 
     <lb/>
     and I cannot say that with any word he 
     <lb/>
     littered I can find fault. I do not find fault 
     <lb/>
     with the leader of the opposition ; those 
     <lb/>
     with whom I find fault are the gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who are hiding behind all this agitation and 
     <lb/>
     who are not courageous enough to come 
     <lb/>
     out and say : We want to take up this 
     <lb/>
     fight with the delegate and to get rid of 
     <lb/>
     him. It has been made a matter of reproach 
     <lb/>
     to us that the delegate was brought to this 
     <lb/>
     country and it is now said that he has 
     <lb/>
     been interfering with this political question 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories. Why, is the 
     <lb/>
     memory of our friends so short that they 
     <lb/>
     cannot go back to 1870 when the leader of 
     <lb/>

     the Conservative party of that day dis<lb break="no"/>patched a message to Rome for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of calling to his aid Archbishop Taché, and 
     <lb/>
     sent him up to settle a difficulty in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba? Were they so indifferent then to 
     <lb/>
     the influence of the hierarchy ? Were they 
     <lb/>
     then such superior persons as they profess 
     <lb/>
     to be now and so anxious to separate church 
     <lb/>
     and state, so desirous of having nothing 
     <lb/>
     whatever to do with the Catholic clergy ? 
     <lb/>
     Why did they send at that time for Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop Taché ? Why did they bring him' 
     <lb/>
     out and utilize his services at that time ? 
     <lb/>
     Where is the difference ? The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) is pleased 
     <lb/>
     to laugh. Perhaps instead of laughing he 
     <lb/>
     will explain ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Reference has been 
     <lb/>
     made to the fact that the delegate in some 
     <lb/>
     way or other is supposed to be connected 
     <lb/>
     with this Bill, that he has been consulted 
     <lb/>
     in connection with it and that he repre<lb break="no"/>sented the minority in the negotiations for 
     <lb/>
     a settlement of this difficult question. Am 
     <lb/>
     I rightly informed that in 1896 a Reme<lb break="no"/>dial Bill was introduced into this House ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, who is there here who will 
     <lb/>
     
    tell me who drafted the Remedial 
     <lb/>introduced in 1896? Who will tell me 
     <lb/>What connection Mr. Ewart, of Winni<lb break="no"/>peg, had with that Bill and whether Mr. 
     <lb/>Ewart was the intermediary between the 
     <lb/>government of that day and the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the Roman Catholic minority ? Who 
     <lb/>will deny it? Where is the difference?

     true that the delegate was consulted, where 
     <lb/>
     is the difference in principle between the 
     <lb/>
     case of our friends in 1896 and the present 
     <lb/>
     occasion. I do not think it is necessary to 
     <lb/>
     take up the time of the House very long 
     <lb/>
     with these quotations from newspapers. 
     <lb/>
     The leader of the opposition (Mr. R. 
     <lb/>
     L. Borden) was somewhat indignant at 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Customs quoting from 
     <lb/>
     the Hamilton 'Spectator' and he im<lb break="no"/>puted motives to my hon. friend be<lb break="no"/>cause of that quotation. What about the 
     <lb/>
     motives of the man who wrote the para<lb break="no"/>graph quoted ? What about the men who 
     <lb/>
     sat silently by and derived benefit from it? 
     <lb/>
     What about these motives ? Where is the 
     <lb/>
     difference between the action of the man 
     <lb/>
     who wrote that article for some sinister 
     <lb/>
     motive and the action of the gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who brought the attention of the House 
     <lb/>
     to it ? Does the hon. gentleman expect 
     <lb/>
     that we are to allow these things to

     by my hon. friend with the surrounding

     does not bear the construction based upon 
     <lb/>
     it. You must begin with the article some<lb break="no"/>what further up than the quotation is made 
     <lb/>
     and you will find that among other things 
     <lb/>
     after having discussed the question of the

     <lb/>
     say :

     Then they are giving us the school legisla<lb break="no"/>tion of a little province which is not of a nature

that mean anything like what has been sug<lb break="no"/>gested ? If you extract one or two phrases 
     <lb/>from it you can make it mean anything you 
     <lb/>like. But, take the article in its entirety. 
     <lb/>My hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>quoted from the 'Northwest Review' and 
     <lb/>sought to make the government responsible 
     <lb/>for its utterances.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. No, I expressly said 
     <lb/>
     that it had no connection with the govern<lb break="no"/>ment as far as I understand. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. My hon. friend says 
     <lb/>
     it has no connection. Then, I will go a step 
     <lb/>
     further. I am sorry to say it has con<lb break="no"/>siderable connection in the way of criticism. 
     <lb/>
     I think it has been the most violent oppon<lb break="no"/>ent that the government has had. I would 
     <lb/>
     refer my hon. friend to the articles published 
     <lb/>
     in 1896 by the ' Northwest Review ' in which 
     <lb/>
     they criticised my right hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government more severely than 
     <lb/>
     any other paper in the country. They even 
     <lb/>
     went to the length of comparing him in effect 
     <lb/>
     with Judas Iscariot among the other vagar<lb break="no"/>ies which they indulged in. This is an organ 
     <lb/>
     for which this government cannot be held 
     <lb/>
     responsible. I do not think it is necessary 
     <lb/>
     for me to go very much further. But, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to draw the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House to the fact that the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto (Mr. Foster) this afternoon 
     <lb/>
     said, in speaking of this interview that took 
     <lb/>
     place down at the delegate's house, that 
     <lb/>
     both parties to the interview agreed to take 
     <lb/>
     the public into their confidence. Nothing 
     <lb/>
     could be further from what I conceive to be 
     <lb/>
     the fact. The parties to the confer<lb break="no"/>ence, as far as I can judge of what 
     <lb/>
     occurred, both respected the obligation that 
     <lb/>
     is binding upon gentlemen. The delegate is 
     <lb/>
     a gentleman and I presume that this applies 
     <lb/>
     with equal truth to Mr. Campbell. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure that he is a gentleman but the man 
     <lb/>
     who violated the confidence of these gentle<lb break="no"/>men is Mr. Rogers. This is the man 
     <lb/>
     who takes it upon himself to tell us what 
     <lb/>
     took place out of his presence and without 
     <lb/>
     his personal knowledge. How is it that Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Campbell has not corroborated this inter<lb break="no"/>view ? The delegate has made the state<lb break="no"/>ment only because this document has been 
     <lb/>
     published, only because his confidence has 
     <lb/>
     been violated. That is the only reason. 
     <lb/>
     The delegate has not taken anybody into 
     <lb/>
     his confidence. I appeal to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition to tell me 
     <lb/>
     whether or not he thinks that this confer<lb break="no"/>ence having taken place under these cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances. Mr. Rogers was justified in 
     <lb/>
     violating it. That is what strikes me at the 
     <lb/>
     outset. How is it Mr. Rogers makes this 
     <lb/>
     declaration ? Why did Mr. Campbell not 
     <lb/>
     make it if he had any declaration to make ? 
     <lb/>
     If it were necessary for somebody outside 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Campbell to make this statement 
     <lb/>
     why did Mr. Roblin not make it ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Roblin, the head of the government, 
     <lb/>
     not issue this manifesto ? Does his silence 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4050</fw>
       

     suggest anything ? Perhaps before this 
     <lb/>
     controversy ends we will hear from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Roblin and we will understand why it is 
     <lb/>
     that he has not made this statement, that 
     <lb/>
     he has not issued this manifesto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I will not detain the House any 
     <lb/>
     longer. But, perhaps I might draw the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House to the interview with 
     <lb/>
     the delegate. I might say that in so far 
     <lb/>
     as I am concerned, and I am speaking en<lb break="no"/>tirely for myself, I have no desire to see 
     <lb/>
     the delegate leave this country. He never 
     <lb/>
     will leave it in so far as I am concerned if 
     <lb/>
     I can prevent it. There shall be, there can be 
     <lb/>
     no misunderstanding about my position. He 
     <lb/>
     has brought about peace in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, that peace has been maintained 
     <lb/>
     since 1896 and I trust that he shall con<lb break="no"/>tinue to be with us so that peace may con<lb break="no"/>tinue to remain with us. What is it that 
     <lb/>
     he has done in this matter? What is he 
     <lb/>
     to be criticised for ? Some hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have told us that he was in Manitoba last 
     <lb/>
    year. He there met Mr. Campbell. He 
     <lb/>does not say what occurred between 
     <lb/>them. He is a gentleman. Then he 
     <lb/>tells us that hearing that Mr. Camp<lb break="no"/>bell was here on the 23rd February, a 
     <lb/>few days after this Autonomy Bill was 
     <lb/>introduced into this House, he asked him 
     <lb/>to come down and meet him and there he 
     <lb/>discussed with him this question of the con<lb break="no"/>dition of the Catholics of Manitoba. I want 
     <lb/>to say here and now that in so far as I am 
     <lb/>concerned the delegate was perfectly within 
     <lb/>his rights when he discussed this matter, 
     <lb/>that the delegate was perfectly within his 
     <lb/>rights when he endeavoured to obtain from 
     <lb/>this gentleman the redress of this grievance 
     <lb/>that has continued for a long time. When Mr. 
     <lb/>Campbell got down there what occurred 
     <lb/>between them ? The delegate pointed out 
     <lb/>again to him the condition of the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholics in Manitoba and said to him : 
     <lb/>Cannot you alleviate in some way the griev<lb break="no"/>ance under which these people labour ? Can- 
     <lb/> you not in effect extend to the larger towns, 
     <lb/>such as Brandon and Winnipeg, the 
     <lb/>same privileges that you have extend<lb break="no"/>ed to the Roman Catholic population 
     <lb/>in the country districts ; that is simply 
     <lb/>extending the law in operation in Manitoba 
     <lb/>in such a way as to enable it to be 
     <lb/>availed of in cities and towns. Mr. Camp<lb break="no"/>bell does not appear to have repudiated the 
     <lb/>suggestion. He accepted it. Then, the 
     <lb/>delegate said : You are endeavouring to have 
     <lb/>your boundaries extended. This was a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of common notoriety, it was a matter 
     <lb/>of common notriety that the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>the district which would be affected were 
     <lb/>opposed to any extension of the boundaries 
     <lb/>of Manitoba and he said that the first step 
     <lb/>to be adopted in the direction of obtaining 
     <lb/>what was desired was to conciliate the in<lb break="no"/>terest of the people in the Territories to be 
     <lb/>affected.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. It was settled be<lb break="no"/>fore this interview. That is exactly 
     <lb/>
     what we contend for. The delegate evid<lb break="no"/>ently did not know anything about what 
     <lb/>
     had taken place. It was settled two days 
     <lb/>
     before that conference. He said that if you 
     <lb/>
     want your boundaries extended the best 
     <lb/>
     thing you can do is to conciliate the inhab<lb break="no"/>itants of the country to be affected because 
     <lb/>
     the government cannot agree and will not 
     <lb/>
     agree in all probability to extend the boun<lb break="no"/>daries of Manitoba against the wishes of the 
     <lb/>
     people whose political interests depend upon 
     <lb/>
     the change and whose political interests 
     <lb/>
     would be affected by the change. And he 
     <lb/>
     said to him : Here, these people, the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics, are in the enjoyment of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, whereas if they come into the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba they will be under a 
     <lb/>
     different constitution and they will object 
     <lb/>
     to any extension of the boundaries of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba which will prejudicially affect their 
     <lb/>
     interests in so far as the school question is 
     <lb/>
     concerned. Is there anything improper in 
     <lb/>
     that ? Is there anything wrong ? Is there 
     <lb/>
     anything that the delegate should apologize 
     <lb/>
     for ? Incidentally let me observe that we 
     <lb/>
     have heard a great deal about the nefarious 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard a great deal about the 
     <lb/>
     shackles that we are going to put on the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the people there, it has been said 
     <lb/>
     that we are going to submit the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories to an indignity by imposing 
     <lb/>
     upon them a separate school system and yet 
     <lb/>
     here we find that these people, instead of 
     <lb/>
     desiring to throw off the shackles, unani<lb break="no"/>mously protest against any change. This 
     <lb/>
     is simply an incidental remark that I want 
     <lb/>
     to make at the present moment. But, I 
     <lb/>
     shall not transgress the rules of the House. 
     <lb/>
     Unfortunately, some time before we reach 
     <lb/>
     the third reading of the Bill, I shall be ob<lb break="no"/>liged to inflict a speech upon the House. 
     <lb/>
     But, is there anything improper in 
     <lb/>
     what has taken place which makes it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to speak of the delegate in 
     <lb/>
     the ill disguised terms of contempt 
     <lb/>
     which have been applied to him by 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House ? Why should he be called a police<lb break="no"/>man, or likened to a cabman ? Is there any 
     <lb/>
     necessity for that ? Is there anything in 
     <lb/>
     what has occurred to justify these epithets 
     <lb/>
     that were applied to him ? Now, the dele<lb break="no"/>gate goes on, and see what he says about 
     <lb/>
     his conversations so far as the government 
     <lb/>
     is concerned. He says :

     What was there wrong about that : what 
     <lb/>
     was there improper about that ? What is 
     <lb/>
     there in that of which the government need 
     <lb/>
     be ashamed ; what is there in that for 
     <lb/>
     which the government can be held respon<lb break="no"/>sible ? The delegate says he had a private 
     <lb/>
     conversation with this gentleman, that his 
     <lb/>
     object was simply to improve the condition 
     <lb/>
     of the Catholics, and he says the govern<lb break="no"/>ment had no knowledge of it. Why should 
     <lb/>
     we be held responsible for that. If I were 
     <lb/>
     not a member of the government and had 
     <lb/>
     not certain responsibility as such, I would 
     <lb/>
     say immediately right now, that I would be

     prepared to take all responsibility for 
     <lb/>
     everything the delegate said. I see nothing

     of and I speak now, not as a Catho<lb break="no"/>lic, but as a citizen of this country. I have

     made a longer speech than I intended and 
     <lb/>
     I apologize to the House for so doing, but I

     fit to consult His Excellency on a question 
     <lb/>
     which he knew would interest His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency, or if the Minister of Justice has done 
     <lb/>
     so, I would like to know when that consulta<lb break="no"/>tion took place. Did they consult him be<lb break="no"/>fore they introduced clause 16 of the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal Bill. I believe they must have done 
     <lb/>
     so. That was the clause I was ready to ac<lb break="no"/>cept myself. If they consulted him then 
     <lb/>
     did they consult him afterwards when the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior forced the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to withdraw clause 16 and present the 
     <lb/>
     amended clause now before us.

     <lb/>
     for myself and according to my own judg<lb break="no"/>ment, pronounced in a very modest way, I 
     <lb/>
     will say that I think there is a great deal

     of difference between the two.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I think there is a great

     deal of diflerence, but I am not allowed to

     discuss the merits of the Bill now, although 
     <lb/>
     I may have the opportunity to do so later 
     <lb/>
     on, because I imagine there will be some 
     <lb/>
     more amendments. I have sympathy with 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice because in 1896 he 
     <lb/>
     took to heart the conduct of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party at that time. I hope the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice was sincere in what he said and in 
     <lb/>
     what he wrote in 1896, and which in my 
     <lb/>
     View explains the position he now takes in 
     <lb/>
     regard to this measure. In 1896 the Min<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4054</fw>

ister of Justice was a candidate in the coun<lb break="no"/>ty of Quebec, and like a great many of the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Liberal members he made a great 
     <lb/>
     many pledges. On the 6th of June, 1896, he 
     <lb/>
     wrote a letter addressed to the administra<lb break="no"/>tor of the archdiocese of Quebec, that letter 
     <lb/>
     I have here in French and translate it as 
     <lb/>
     follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Being sincerely disposed to put aside all

     <lb/>
     triumph of the cause of the Catholics in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, I the undersigned, pledge myself if I am

     elected to conform to the mandement of the

     better settle that with his bishop. This

     brings us to the question at issue; this 
     <lb/>
     is why there is a delegate here, so that 
     <lb/>
     the bishop cannot condemn the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, and I understand now why he 
     <lb/>
     is so anxious that the delegate should stay 
     <lb/>
     here. He would rather be in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     that delegate—for whom I have the deep<lb break="no"/>est respect—than in the hands of his bishop 
     <lb/>
     in Quebec, who would remind him of the 
     <lb/>
     letter written in 1896. We might as well 
     <lb/>
     admit at once that the action of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party in 1896 was the initiation of the 
     <lb/>
     question which we are discussing in this 
     <lb/>
     House to-day. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, this is a heritage of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party that we are having to-day. 
     <lb/>
     We have heard my hon. friend from Pictou 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Macdonald), and my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Customs, with his beautiful 
     <lb/>
     voice, speaking of having peace in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     says that religiously we have peace in Can<lb break="no"/>ada. These hon. gentlemen have a most 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary way of bringing peace to the 
     <lb/>
     country ; peace with the bishops and 
     <lb/>
     clergy, by having here a delegate from 
     <lb/>
     Rome, who says to them, Gentlemen, not 
     <lb/>
     another word; peace for the minority of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba by not giving them what they 
     <lb/>
     wanted, and leaving them still under the 
     <lb/>
     foot of the majority of that province. That 
     <lb/>
     is the kind of peace the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man gave to them after promising in Que<lb break="no"/>bec that he would do more for them than 
     <lb/>
     the remedial Bill would do. Would we 
     <lb/>
     have in Canada to-day His Excellency, of 
     <lb/>
     whom so much has been said, if the minor<lb break="no"/>

     ity in Manitoba had been granted their 
     <lb/>
     due in 1896 ? If my right hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     sitting on this side of the House, had not 
     <lb/>
     proposed the six months' hoist to the re<lb break="no"/>medial Bill, and done everything in his 
     <lb/>
     power to prevent it passing, would His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency have been in Manitoba consulting 
     <lb/>
     with Archbishop Langevin and the minor<lb break="no"/>ity there, to obtain for them that justice 
     <lb/>
     which they have been claiming since 1896? 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Justice was to resign if 
     <lb/>
     that justice were not obtained, but he has 
     <lb/>
     not resigned ; but by the Bill at present 
     <lb/>
     before the House he hopes to redeem the 
     <lb/>
     peace of his conscience. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     says there is no harm in having a Papal 
     <lb/>
     delegate here. I will not say there is any 
     <lb/>
     harm, but there was no necessity for a 
     <lb/>
     delegate here, if my right hon. friend and 
     <lb/>
     his party had not created such a turmoil 
     <lb/>among the people in 1896, and afterwards.<lb/>My hon. friend the Minister of Justice tries<lb/>to show an analogy between the trip of<lb/>Archibishop Taché in 1870 and the resi<lb break="no"/>dence in Canada of His Excellency. There<lb/>is a great difference. In 1870 there was an<lb/>uprising in the province of Manitoba; we<lb/>were threatened with revolution: we were<lb/>threatened with the loss of all the provinces<lb/>in the Northwest; and we could not do any<lb break="no"/>thing. We had not the soldiers or muskets<lb/>or cannon with which to put a stop to that<lb/>uprising. There was only one way of set<lb break="no"/>tling the trouble; that was by the persua<lb break="no"/>sion of Archbishop Taché, then the Bishop<lb/>of St. Boniface, whose wisdom was held in <lb/>immense respect by the people of that part<lb/>of the country. Sir John Macdonald, as a<lb/>great politician and statesman, knew that<lb/>it was the only way to settle that difficulty,<lb/>and he was not ashamed to adopt it, al<lb break="no"/>though he was the Premier of Canada and <lb/>a Protestant, because he was working for<lb/>the best interests of the country. He there<lb break="no"/>fore turned his eyes towards Rome, where<lb/>Archbishop Taché was at the time, and in<lb break="no"/>vited him to come here, not in the interest<lb/>of one religion or another, but in the in<lb break="no"/>terest of Canada.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Who made the <lb/>promises ?<lb/>

     administration. Archbishop Taché is dead, 
     <lb/>
     but the people living there are the succes<lb break="no"/>sors of those to whom the promises were 
     <lb/>
     made. Suppose they were made by a Con<lb break="no"/>servative administration; was it the duty 
     <lb/>
     of the Liberal party later on, and princi<lb break="no"/>pally in 1896, to do everything in their 
     <lb/>
     power to prevent the Conservative admin<lb break="no"/>istration from fulfilling its promises to 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop Taché ? Some of those pro<lb break="no"/>mises were that the minority would be al<lb break="no"/>lowed to have separate schools, that they 
     <lb/>
     would have the use of the French langu<lb break="no"/>age, that they never would be troubled, 
     <lb/>
     that if they would allow the legislative 
     <lb/>
     council to be abolished, they would never 
     <lb/>
     have anything to fear from the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Manitoba.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. Might I ask my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend a question ? He asserts that promises 
     <lb/>were made at that time by his Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive friends. Why does he not ask his Con<lb break="no"/>servative friend, Mr. Rogers, in Manitoba,<lb/>to redeem them to-day ?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I will give the answer.<lb/>The remedial Bill, which was read the sec<lb break="no"/>ond time in this House, is still hanging.<lb/>The question has never been decided; it <lb/>is in the Privy Council; and if the right<lb/>hon. Prime Minister and the hon. Minister<lb/>of Justice wanted to do what they pro<lb break="no"/>mised in the province of Quebec, they <lb/>would bring back the remedial Bill in favour<lb/>of the minority in Manitoba. That is why<lb/>Mr. Roblin cannot do it. It is impossible<lb/>for him to do anything of the kind to-day.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Why ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Because the remedial 
     <lb/>
     Bill is standing at the second reading. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Therefore he can<lb break="no"/>not interfere ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. My hon. friend speaks 
     <lb/>
     of the analogy between the visit of Arch<lb break="no"/>bishop Taché and the residence in Canada 
     <lb/>
     of the ablegate. Now, why have we a dele<lb break="no"/>gate here ? I said a moment ago that it 
     <lb/>
     was a heritage of the Liberal party.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. Do I understand 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend to be against Canada hav<lb break="no"/>ing a delegate? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. It does not make any 
     <lb/>
     difference to me personally. It only makes 
     <lb/>
     a difference to those who have some mat<lb break="no"/>ters of conscience to settle with their 
     <lb/>
     bishops; I have not. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Pictou, when speaking this evening, had in 
     <lb/>
     his hand a book which I presume was a re<lb break="no"/>port of the Supreme Court. It had been 
     <lb/>
     given to him after six o'clock. and I ima<lb break="no"/>gine I know the gentleman who gave it to 
     <lb/>
     him.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACD4">Mr. MACDONALD</persName>. Let me say that no

     hon. gentleman gave me that book. I 
     <lb/>
     have read that case long ago. I am suffi<lb break="no"/>

     ciently acquainted with my profession to

     <lb/>place in the county of Charlevoix in 1877.

     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Every law student 
     <lb/>
     knows the case of Brassard vs. Langevin 
     <lb/>
     by heart.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Is that so ? Well, that 
     <lb/>
     is something new. Who will say that we 
     <lb/>
     have not to deal with a very religious party? 
     <lb/>
     They are au courant with all matters in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. The Charlevoix 
     <lb/>
     election took place in 1875 or 1876. Before 
     <lb/>
     that we did not hear of any trouble. We 
     <lb/>
     had bishops and priests—good bishops and 
     <lb/>
     good priests ; at least, everybody thought 
     <lb/>
     so and said so. Although I was young then, 
     <lb/>
     I do not remember hearing any fault found 
     <lb/>
     with the clergy of our province. In that elec<lb break="no"/>tion in Charlevoix it seems there were some 
     <lb/>
     indiscretions committed by the clergy. They 
     <lb/>
     were called undue influence. The Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party at that time, indeed the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     or this Country has never been an orthodox 
     <lb/>
     party, and my right hon. friend knows it. 
     <lb/>
     The Canadian Club of that time, in the 60's 
     <lb/>
     and the Club St. Jean Baptiste of Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, knew something about it. They 
     <lb/>
     belonged to the old Liberal school of 
     <lb/>
     France, they were far from being religious, 
     <lb/>
     and they have preached their ideas in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, and that is why the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party were distrusted by the people 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. They had clubs like the Insti<lb break="no"/>tute Canadien and other institutions of that 
     <lb/>
     kind, where they were not at all bashful in 
     <lb/>
     expressing their opinion about the clergy 
     <lb/>
     from the bishops down. No wonder then 
     <lb/>
     that the population of Quebec, being a reli<lb break="no"/>gious population, distrusted them and were 
     <lb/>
     unwillingto confide their interests in their 
     <lb/>
     hands. That explains why they were in 
     <lb/>
     opposition for so many years. But during 
     <lb/>
     that election they took hold of this question 
     <lb/>
     of undue influence and brought it before 
     <lb/>
     the courts and succeeded. It is true it was 
     <lb/>
     proved rthat some curés had gone out 
     <lb/>
     of their way, had been over zealous. But, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, we read every Monday morning in the 
     <lb/>
     newspapers of Protestant ministers who 
     <lb/>
     have been over zealous in their remarks. I 
     <lb/>
     do not blame the Anglicans for that, I do 
     <lb/>
     not blame the Presbyterians, nor the Bap<lb break="no"/>tists, nor the Methodists, as a body. I do 
     <lb/>
     not hold them responsible because one or 
     <lb/>
     two ministers are too enthusiastic. So 
     <lb/>
     probably some of the Quebec curés were in<lb break="no"/>discreet. The election was voided, and an<lb break="no"/>other election took place, and again a Con<lb break="no"/>servative was elected.

            <p>
     Well, Mr. Speaker, that was the begin<lb break="no"/>ning of our having Papal delegates here. 
     <lb/>
     The Liberal party at that time, or some of 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>

     their representatives, made a demand upon 
     <lb/>
     the Holy See for a delegate. It was most 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary for people who did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve much in bishops or priests to make 
     <lb/>
     a demand upon the Holy See for a delegate 
     <lb/>
     to come over here and find out whether 
     <lb/>
     they were as good as the Conservatives. 
     <lb/>
     Bishop Conroy came here as a dele<lb break="no"/>gate to supervise the bishops in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, and to investigate the disputes. 
     <lb/>
     Bishop Conroy was well received, received 
     <lb/>
     with open arms, the Catholic population of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec treated him very well, in fact he 
     <lb/>
     was so well treated, he found everything so 
     <lb/>
     good and so nice that he made a report 
     <lb/>
     that the Liberals were very good people, 
     <lb/>
     were very religious people, indeed they were 
     <lb/>
     as good as the Conservatives, and there was 
     <lb/>
     no reason why they should not be entrusted 
     <lb/>
     with the affairs of the country as well as 
     <lb/>
     the Conservatives. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. And he died after he 
     <lb/>
     made that report, and was not replaced. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">Some hon. MEMBERS</persName>. Surely he has 
     <lb/>
     gone to heaven. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Well, I hope he has, 
     <lb/>
     because if he had to carry the sins of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party with him, he needed to go to 
     <lb/>
     some place where he could lay them down. 
     <lb/>
     We did not hear much more about these 
     <lb/>
     things until the Manitoba affair. We all 
     <lb/>
     know that when our friends were in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition the country was filled with fads. We 
     <lb/>
     don't hear about them now. We do not 
     <lb/>
     hear about Patrons of Industry, we do not 
     <lb/>
     hear about prohibition any more, nor any 
     <lb/>
     other of these side issues. Because they 
     <lb/>
     were not able to fight their opponent with 
     <lb/>
     a serious policy, they had recourse to things 
     <lb/>
     of that sort. When the Manitoba school 
     <lb/>
     difficulty came up, what a God-send it was 
     <lb/>
     to them. And how did it come about ? Our 
     <lb/>
     friend, the late Dalton McCarthy, had gone 
     <lb/>
     to Manitoba and spoken there very elo<lb break="no"/>quently. He told these people what they 
     <lb/>
     should do, and his propaganda took well. 
     <lb/>
     The Manitoba government took hold of it, 
     <lb/>
     and I have no doubt in my own mind that 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend had nothing at all to 
     <lb/>
     do with it, or any of his friends. The Man<lb break="no"/>itoba government was over ears engaged 
     <lb/>
     in some railway deals, and they had to di<lb break="no"/>vert public opinion if possible. They saw 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. McCarthy had had great success 
     <lb/>
     in preaching against separate schools and 
     <lb/>
     against the official use of the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage, and they took hold of his teachings 
     <lb/>
     themselves. In 1890 they abolished the sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools and the French language. They 
     <lb/>
     did more than that. As I said the other day, 
     <lb/>
     they kept $14,000 worth of the property of 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics, they have got it yet, they 
     <lb/>
     have never given it back to the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of Manitoba. From 1890 
     <lb/>
     to 1896 what did we see ? What a spectacle 
     <lb/>
     there was in this country ! The Minister of 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="4059" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_4059.jpg"/>

     Customs said that their party was above 
     <lb/>
     these things, that their party would not go 
     <lb/>
     so low as to seek to raise national or reli<lb break="no"/>gious prejudices. Why, Sir, that has been 
     <lb/>
     their stock in trade, they never had any 
     <lb/>
     other policy than that. What policy have 
     <lb/>
     they to-day, what fiscal policy have they? 
     <lb/>
     Is it not the same policy that they opposed 
     <lb/>
     for 18 years in opposition, the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party which they have changed 
     <lb/>
     a little, but the principle is the same ? What 
     <lb/>
     policy have they upon provincial autonomy, 
     <lb/>
     or any other question? So they went to 
     <lb/>
     the country. In the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     they used to say that it was impossible for 
     <lb/>
     the minority in Manitoba to obtain a redress 
     <lb/>
     of their grievances because, forsooth, the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, Sir Mackenzie Bowell, was 
     <lb/>
     an Orangeman ; while in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario they said that the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     was bound hand and foot to the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Quebec. This was the 
     <lb/>
     way they treated that question throughout 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, during all that time the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party were endeavouring to do justice with 
     <lb/>
     a sincere desire to end this question in a 
     <lb/>
     way to render justice to the minority in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. They brought the question be<lb break="no"/>fore the courts, it went to the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court and then to the Privy Council, where 
     <lb/>
     it was decided that the law was intra vires 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Manitoba, as they had 
     <lb/>
     passed the law themselves and had changed 
     <lb/>
     that law, but it was declared later on by the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council that the minority had a griev<lb break="no"/>ance, and that the Dominion government, 
     <lb/>
     according to the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     must come to the relief of the minority. 
     <lb/>
     Then when the Remedial Bill was presented 
     <lb/>
     to parliament, what did we see? We saw 
     <lb/>
     the friends of those gentlemen opposite— 
     <lb/>
     many of them have now disappeared from 
     <lb/>
     the House-opposing that Bill with all their 
     <lb/>
     might, speaking against time, knowing that 
     <lb/>
     parliament must dissolve on the 24th of 
     <lb/>
     April. They followed the lead of my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend who had proposed the six months 
     <lb/>
     hoist, knowing that he was defeating the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, knowing that that law was good, but 
     <lb/>
     knowing also that he was helping his party 
     <lb/>
     to obtain power. That was the way that he 
     <lb/>
     obtained his great name among the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants, which he has held for so many years, 
     <lb/>
     the name of being a tolerant man, of being 
     <lb/>
     above prejudice, the name of being so lib<lb break="no"/>eral minded that he had put his foot upon 
     <lb/>
     the hierarchy in the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     But that, was not the language used in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. In Quebec, his French name and 
     <lb/>
     his eloquence were enough to help him and 
     <lb/>
     his friends into power, and in that way he 
     <lb/>
     succeeded in overthrowing the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     government. Well, after he came into power 
     <lb/>
     what did we see? On the opening of the 
     <lb/>
     new parliament in the month of August, 
     <lb/>
     1896, in the debate on the address, he 
     <lb/>
     talked about the traditions of the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral Conservative party. Nobody has ever 
     <lb/>
     talked about the traditions of the Liberal 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4060</fw>
         

     party, they had none to boast of. Sir Charles 
     <lb/>
     Tupper, who was then in opposition, de<lb break="no"/>clared that he had gone down to defeat be<lb break="no"/>cause he thought that he was right in stand<lb break="no"/>ing by the constitution of Canada in attempt<lb break="no"/>ing to render justice to the minority of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. What did Sir Charles Tupper say? 
     <lb/>
     He said: My hon. friend is now in power : 
     <lb/>
     he has a big majority ; let him bring down 
     <lb/>
     a Bill to render justice to the minority in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and I pledge myself and my 
     <lb/>
     friends behind me to help him. There are 
     <lb/>
     the traditions of the party. This was not 
     <lb/>
     because Sir Charles Tupper believed in sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools or because the majority of 
     <lb/>
     those behind him believed in them, but be<lb break="no"/>cause it was the law of the land ; it was 
     <lb/>
     because it would render justice, and be 
     <lb/>
     cause, as has been said before, it would be 
     <lb/>
     an act of cowardice on the part of any maj<lb break="no"/>ority not to render justice to a minority, 
     <lb/>
     whatever that minority might be.

     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I was in the House

     in 1896 and followed the debate to some

     <lb/>
     find in 'Hansard' the statement of Sir

     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I have been here twenty-

     like that. I am speaking for myself and

            </p>
   
            <p>

     <lb/>
     I may say that I have sent for the volume

     of 'Hansard' containing the remarks con<lb break="no"/>cerning which the Minister of Justice asked

     and I will be able to quote them to him

     When my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid

     morning of the 24th of June, mainly by the 
     <lb/>
     majority from the province of Quebec, the 
     <lb/>
     question naturally arose with him: How 
     <lb/>
     can I do justice to the minority in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba ? I have taken a position and I can<lb break="no"/>not abandon it; I have a great name as a 
     <lb/>
     tolerant man because I sacrificed my com<lb break="no"/>patriots. How, then, can I do it ? And 
     <lb/>
     somebody whispered to him : Don't be at all 
     <lb/>
      alarmed there is a way of settling it. And 
     <lb/>
     a little while afterwards a gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     sent to Manitoba to settle that question. 
     <lb/>
     Talk about settlement. What happens when 
     <lb/>
     a question between two men is to be set<lb break="no"/>tled by the intervention of a third ? The 
     <lb/>
     mediator must meet and talk to both. But, 
     <lb/>
     what happened in the Manitoba school ques<lb break="no"/>tion ? The gentleman who went from Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa to Manitoba went to the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of  Manitoba, Mr. Greenway occupy<lb break="no"/>ing the position at that time. A settle<lb break="no"/>ment was agreed upon between them. And  
     <lb/>
     what was that settlement ? That the pupils  
     <lb/>
     should  be given the opportunity of a half 
     <lb/>
     hour's religious instruction after half past  
     <lb/>
     three in the afternoon. That is a great 
     <lb/>
     way of settling the question of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. Did the delegate who went to 
     <lb/>
      Manitoba consult the Archbishop of St. 
     <lb/>
     Boniface on that question ? Was the min<lb break="no"/>ority of Manitoba consulted in order to reach 
     <lb/>
     a settlement between them and the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government ? Not a word. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) told us 
     <lb/>
     about it the other day when he said : We 
     <lb/>
     consulted our friends. And who were their 
     <lb/>
    friends ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MORI2">Mr. MORIN</persName>.  Joe Martin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. No, not Joe Martin. 
     <lb/>The man whom the Prime Minister sent to 
     <lb/>do more for the minority than a Remedial 
     <lb/>Bill could do—according to what was stat<lb break="no"/>ed on the hustings of  Quebec—went to Mr. 
     <lb/>Greenway and Mr. Sifton. And these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen showed the settlement to whom ? 
     <lb/>Did he show it to the archbishop or to any 
     <lb/>Catholic of Manitoba ? No, it was shown 
     <lb/>to Mr. Dalton McCarthy—Mr. Dalton Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy, the great friend of the French Can<lb break="no"/>adians and Roman Catholics in the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of Canada—it was to him that the set<lb break="no"/>tlement was shown before it was signed by 
     <lb/>my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
     <lb/>for the Dominion of Canada and by the 
     <lb/>member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) for the 
     <lb/>province of Manitoba. And this was the 
     <lb/>settlement of the Manitoba school question. 
     <lb/>And the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) 
     <lb/>who, I believe, sincerely knows that it has 
     <lb/>never been settled satisfactorily—it is not 
     <lb/>surprising to me to see the pains he has 
     <lb/>taken to at least give justice, according to 
     <lb/>his view and mine, to the minority in the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories. Then what was to 
     <lb/>be done ? A promise had been made to the 
     <lb/>bishops of Quebec. Talk about the hier<lb break="no"/>archy. This was a question that interested 
     <lb/>the hierarchy and the promises had been<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4062</fw>
        

     made to them. I have read just now the 
     <lb/>
     promise of one important man in the House, 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Justice. I could read— 
     <lb/>
     they are in 'Hansard'—letters from thirty 
     <lb/>
     or forty candidates in Quebec who promised 
     <lb/>
     the bishops and priests that they would 
     <lb/>
     see to it that the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) should render justice 
     <lb/>
     as soon as he attained power. Some<lb break="no"/>thing has to be done, said they, or we shall 
     <lb/>
     be chastised for having deceived the bis<lb break="no"/>hops. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have now the volume for which I sent. 
     <lb/>
     I am sorry to detain the House with a quo<lb break="no"/>tation, but the Minister of Justice has ask<lb break="no"/>ed for it. This is the first volume of 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard' for the second session of 1896. I

     to deceive the bishop of Quebec who was

     nearer. Rome was far away and I declare 
     <lb/>
     here that the Holy See was deceived in the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba settlement. I have once shown

     that the Cardinal Prefect of that congregation,

     to the Eternal city, since the general elections 
     <lb/>
     of June 23, up to my arrival on October 12. I 
     <lb/>
     had the honour to be received in audience by

     the Cardinal Prefect, eight or ten times, but 
     <lb/>
     the Red Pope—as the powerful president of 
     <lb/>

     Rome—had accepted with such implicit faith 
     <lb/>
     the representations made by the bishops of the 
     <lb/>
     ecclesiastical province of Quebec and Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     that I was not a little surprised to hear at my

     What is the English of this ? Chevalier

     Drolet says that when he arrived in Rome 
     <lb/>
     he found that a great deal of work had 
     <lb/>
     been done by five bishops of Quebec who 
     <lb/>
     had already been there between the 23rd 
     <lb/>
     of June, the day of the elections and the 
     <lb/>
     12th of October, the day he arrived there. 
     <lb/>
     These had already conferred with Cardinal 
     <lb/>
     Ledochowski, the head of the congregation 
     <lb/>
     and Cardinal Ledochowski asked why it 
     <lb/>
     was that Mr. Laurier whom they repre<lb break="no"/>sented to him as such a good Catholic re<lb break="no"/>fused to obey the command of the Queen 
     <lb/>
     which command meant the immediate re<lb break="no"/>establishment of separate schools in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba when a Protestant like Mr. Tupper

     declared himself ready to give justice to 
     <lb/>
     the minority if he was still in power or if 
     <lb/>
     he was put in power. Mr. Drolet goes on 
     <lb/>
     to say that Cardinal Ledochowski was a 
     <lb/>
     very old man which explained why the

     <lb/>
     after he had been many times to see Cardi<lb break="no"/>nal Ledochowski he was told to go to Car<lb break="no"/>dinal Rampolla. It is no use going over

     all these things at this late hour to show

     the work which was done by the emissaries

     of the government or their friends, by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Drolet and later on by the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice and by Mr. Russell and all the work

     that was done to find a way of preventing 
     <lb/>
     the bishops in Canada from telling the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman that he had deceived them. 
     <lb/>
     Then Monseigneur Merry del Val was sent 
     <lb/>
     here ; he came here as a delegate and went 
     <lb/>
     throughout the country and my impression 
     <lb/>
     is that he was sadly deceived and that he 
     <lb/>
     made a report along that line. He had been 
     <lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. My hon. friend will 
     <lb/>
     surely not place himself in any disagreeable 
     <lb/>
     position. He knows that His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     has the respect, esteem and affection 
     <lb/>
     of all the bishops in this Dominion, and if 
     <lb/>
     that were not the case they would not long 
     <lb/>
     remain in their sees, because he is the repre<lb break="no"/>sentative of His Holiness ; but between 
     <lb/>
     having a respect for his personality and 
     <lb/>
     yielding obedience to him, and being happy 
     <lb/>
     and glad to see him here, there is a differ<lb break="no"/>ence. The hon. member for Pictou (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald) spoke this evening about coer<lb break="no"/>cing Manitoba. If my hon. friend had been 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec in 1896, he would 
     <lb/>
     not have heard such language as that used 
     <lb/>
     by his friends. They never spoke about 
     <lb/>
     coercion in Quebec. I would ask my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) if it is 
     <lb/>
     a matter of rendering justice where justice 
     <lb/>
     is due, he would refrain from what some 
     <lb/>
     people call coercion, but what my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     and myself would call an act of justice. It 
     <lb/>
     is an operation. It is sometimes painful to 
     <lb/>
     perform an operation, but you have to do 
     <lb/>
     it so as to save the body. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Is the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     asking me a question ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. I will give him my 
     <lb/>
     reply. The position I took in 1896 in my 
     <lb/>
     election was this, and I am just as much a 
     <lb/>
     friend of the minority in Manitoba as I was 
     <lb/>
     then. I am just as convinced as my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is that the minority in Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     does not enjoy that to which it is entitled, 
     <lb/>
     but what I said in 1896, and what I still say, 
     <lb/>
     is that the manner in which the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party had played with the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     school question for ten years had made it 
     <lb/>
     perfectly impossible to expect anything 
     <lb/>
     from the application of the Remedial Bill 
     <lb/>
     passed by this parliament, and that, as did 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend the Prime Minister, I 
     <lb/>
     expected more from the policy of concilia<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="4067" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_4067.jpg"/>
       
 <fw type="num">4067</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
           

        

     tion than from the policy of coercion. That 
     <lb/>
     is the position that I took in my county in 
     <lb/>
     the presence of the parish priests, and it 
     <lb/>
     was supported by the people as well as the 
     <lb/>
     clergy of my county. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I suppose my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend is very sincere in what he says. Will 
     <lb/>
     he allow me to say that I think he is en<lb break="no"/>tirely mistaken ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. I am simply saying 
     <lb/>
     that is my opinion. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I am saying to my 
     <lb/>hon. friend that he is sincere, but that he is 
     <lb/>entirely mistaken. He will admit that the 
     <lb/>minority of Manitoba have not the rights to 
     <lb/>which they are entitled ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Certainly ; there is no 
     <lb/>
     doubt about that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Pictou (Mr. Macdonald) was very unhappy 
     <lb/>
     in his remarks. He made a fine speech. 
     <lb/>
     I heard a number of my hon. friends say 
     <lb/>
     that he made a beautiful speech, but when 
     <lb/>
     he spoke of the bishops of Quebec as being 
     <lb/>
     Tory machines he made an awful mistake. 
     <lb/>
     Let me say again, because we cannot say 
     <lb/>
     it too often, that although there may have 
     <lb/>
     been abuses in some places, for instance, in 
     <lb/>
     the county of Charlevoix, which has been 
     <lb/>
     referred to, there are the most damnable 
     <lb/>
     things in this book which have been sent to 
     <lb/>
     Rome and which are not true. But, on the 
     <lb/>
     whole, our bishops in Quebec are men of a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of prudence. They are learned 
     <lb/>
     men. They are chosen with a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of care. They are wise, and they are men 
     <lb/>
     of delicate sensibilities. There is a bishop 
     <lb/>
     in the county I have the honour to represent, 
     <lb/>
     and he has never dropped me a letter or ex<lb break="no"/>pressed a desire to see me as to the vote I 
     <lb/>
     may give or as to the position which I in<lb break="no"/>tend to take upon this question. Some 
     <lb/>
     people may think that I am getting hot 
     <lb/>
     upon this question of the Manitoba schools. 
     <lb/>
     I have been the victim of it. In 1900 the 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who presented himself against 
     <lb/>
     me in the county of Beauharnois was an 
     <lb/>
     English Protestant. You know this gentle 
     <lb/>
     man ; you have seen him here. He was a 
     <lb/>
     thorough Conservative until 1896 ; but he 
     <lb/>
     went against the Conservative party in 
     <lb/>
     1896, because the Conservative party want<lb break="no"/>ed to render justice to the Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba. There are many English 
     <lb/>
     votes in that county, and they were cast for 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman when he was a candidate 
     <lb/>
     in 1900. I believe that these people voted 
     <lb/>
     for him sincerely and honestly, and natural<lb break="no"/>ly they elected him, because our people do 
     <lb/>
     not separate upon national lines. There 
     <lb/>
     are many priests in my county, and I say 
     <lb/>
     here, upon my honour as a member of par<lb break="no"/>liament, that never has a bishop or priest 
     <lb/>
     in the county of Beauharnois gone to a 
     <lb/>
     man and told him that he should vote for 
     <lb/>
     me because I was a French Canadian and 
     <lb/>
     a Roman Catholic. The result was that 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4068</fw>
    

     many gave their votes for Mr. Loy, an 
     <lb/>
     English Protestant. Is this not a conspicu<lb break="no"/>ous indication of tolerance and broad- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     mindedness ? When the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Pictou spoke of the bishops of Quebec as 
     <lb/>
     if they were Tory machines, he made a 
     <lb/>
     great mistake.
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Is it not a fact that 
     <lb/>
     the bishop in whose diocese the county 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friend represents is situated 
     <lb/>
     did not sign the mandement which was 
     <lb/>
     issued by the bishops in 1896 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I do not know any<lb break="no"/>thing about that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Well, I know. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I will take the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's word. I do not know if he 
     <lb/>
     signed it or not ; and if he did not, I do not 
     <lb/>
     know why he did not sign it. I will take 
     <lb/>
     the testimony of my hon. friend. The bishop 
     <lb/>
     might have said : Why do you not vote for 
     <lb/>
     your own compatriot ? But it was never 
     <lb/>
     done. My opponent addressed large meet<lb break="no"/>ings of my compatriots, although he could 
     <lb/>
     not speak their own language very well. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. He spoke well.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. He may have spoken 
     <lb/>
     well on the hustings, but he was not a 
     <lb/>
     Demosthenes or a Cicero. I never took ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of this fact. Our people would 
     <lb/>
     listen to him most politely, and never did 
     <lb/>
     I ask one man directly or indirectly that 
     <lb/>
     he should give me his support on account 
     <lb/>
     of my nationality. I was sorry to hear my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Pictou—I hope it was a 
     <lb/>
     slip of the tongue—call the bishops of Que<lb break="no"/>bec Tory machines. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BURE1">Mr. BUREAU</persName>. Why did not you correct 
     <lb/>
     your friend from South York (Mr. W. F. 
     <lb/>
     Maclean) when he called the Papal ablegate 
     <lb/>
     a policeman. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. If my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bureau) will allow me I will take care of 
     <lb/>
     my own conscience. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Three Rivers is not afraid of anything or 
     <lb/>
     any body, and he can deal directly with the 
     <lb/>
     member for South York. I do not approve 
     <lb/>
     of everything the member for South York 
     <lb/>
     says or does, but he is not responsible to me.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ROSS2">Mr. DUNCAN ROSS</persName>. Before the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman goes further—the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Pictou is not here, and if I remember 
     <lb/>
     aright he did not call the bishops of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, Tory machines. but, he quoted from the 
     <lb/>
    law reports a statement in which those 
     <lb/>words were used. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. That may be and 
     <lb/>'Hansard' may show it, but I heard the 
     <lb/>statement that the bishops of Quebec were 
     <lb/>Tory machines, and I took a note of it. 
     <lb/>The Minister of Customs spoke about pros<lb break="no"/>perity and the great things that have been 
     <lb/>done since 1896. That is all very good but

     table to see what is going on in the country 
     <lb/>
     to-day. There is no question but that this 
     <lb/>
     country to-day stands upon a volcano ; a 
     <lb/>
     most dangerous question is agitating the 
     <lb/>
     people. Hon. gentlemen opposite may say 
     <lb/>
     that it is the fault of gentlemen on this side 
     <lb/>
     of the House, and I may say that it is the 
     <lb/>
     fault of gentlemen on the other side, but 
     <lb/>
     there is blame on both sides, if not in the 
     <lb/>
     House in the country. I say it is a most 
     <lb/>
     unfortunate state of things, and I am sorry 
     <lb/>
     to have to lay it at the door of my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. It is all due to the policy which he 
     <lb/>
     followed in 1896. He let it be spread broad<lb break="no"/>cast throughout the Dominion that he was 
     <lb/>
     opposed to the hierarchy and to any cleri<lb break="no"/>cal influence. He said, or he let it be said 
     <lb/>
     that the Liberal party in Quebec had been 
     <lb/>
     fighting the clergy ever since that party ex<lb break="no"/>isted, and that at least they had conquered 
     <lb/>
     the hierarchy. The right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     obtained a great name for himself in the 
     <lb/>
     English provinces because of this and that 
     <lb/>
     is why they thought when they saw clause 
     <lb/>
     16 of the original Bill that the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister had fallen from a very high place. It 
     <lb/>
     is that which has created the trouble we 
     <lb/>
     now hear of in the country.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. How did the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister fall down ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Because in the English 
     <lb/>
     provinces in 1896 the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was put on a very high pedestal in view of 
     <lb/>
     the stand he took, and when he fell he fell 
     <lb/>
     from a higher position in their opinion, than 
     <lb/>
     in 1896, if he remained with the rest of us 
     <lb/>
     who desired to give justice to the minority 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELA1">Mr. BELAND</persName>. What do you consider to 
     <lb/>
     be his fault ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. The newspapers which 
     <lb/>
     were full of compliments to the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman two or three years ago, now pub<lb break="no"/>lish the most extraordinary statements 
     <lb/>
     about him, and say, he is not the man they 
     <lb/>
     expected him to be. That is what I call 
     <lb/>
     falling, in my estimation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELA1">Mr. BELAND</persName>. In your estimation.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I am not speaking of 
     <lb/>
     myself ; I am stating the reason why there 
     <lb/>
     is so much turmoil in the country to-day. I 
     <lb/>
     tell my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     for his own justification, that when clause 
     <lb/>
     16 was put in the Bill, whether with or 
     <lb/>
     without consultation with any one, and, I 
     <lb/>
     would not blame him if he had consultation, 
     <lb/>
     when it was put in the Bill he should not 
     <lb/>
     have dropped it. My hon. friends from Que<lb break="no"/>bec who stand behind the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     were ready to accept clause 16 and now are 
     <lb/>
     ready to accept the amended clause which 
     <lb/>
     is almost the reverse of what was provided 
     <lb/>
     for in clause 16. My hon. friends from Que<lb break="no"/>bec know very well that the amended clause 
     <lb/>
     which we are now discussing cannot be a 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4070</fw>
        

     very good clause for the minority when the 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) accepts it. 
     <lb/>
     The member for Brandon resigned because 
     <lb/>
     clause 16 was in the original Bill and now 
     <lb/>
     that he accepts the substituted clause it is 
     <lb/>
     quite plain that the new clause cannot be 
     <lb/>
     in favour of the Catholics of the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     I tell the Minister of Justice that it would 
     <lb/>
     have been a great deal better for the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and it would not be any worse for the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the Northwest Teritories, if 
     <lb/>
     there had been nothing at all mentioned 
     <lb/>
     about schools in the Bill, than that the 
     <lb/>
     original clause should have been withdrawn 
     <lb/>
     and this one substituted. My impression is, 
     <lb/>
     and there are some good lawyers who say 
     <lb/>
     so, that the Northwest Territories would 
     <lb/>
     have come in confederation with the schools, 
     <lb/>
     not the schools they have to-day, but with 
     <lb/>
     the schools provided for in the Act of 1875' 
     <lb/>
     and which was never repealed, although 
     <lb/>
     some ordinances had been placed upon the 
     <lb/>
     regulations by the Northwest legislature. 
     <lb/>
     If my hon friend had omitted the school 
     <lb/>
     clause and allowed the Act of 1875 to come 
     <lb/>
     into operation, the country would not have 
     <lb/>
     been in the condition it is in to-day ; a con<lb break="no"/>dition which is very dangerous. For weeks 
     <lb/>
     and weeks we have been talking what ?— 
     <lb/>
     talking nationality, talking religion when 
     <lb/>
     we have been living together for over 150 
     <lb/>
     years. I hope in the interest of the country 
     <lb/>
     this will be the last occasion on which such 
     <lb/>
     a discussion will take place. I think this 
     <lb/>
     is the last question of the kind that will 
     <lb/>
     arise. Surely we are not going to buy 
     <lb/>
     another province ? These two are the last 
     <lb/>
     that we can organize and I hope this is the 
     <lb/>
     last occasion on which we will have such 
     <lb/>
     a discussion and that henceforth we shall 
     <lb/>
     work like patriotic Canadians, working 
     <lb/>
     separately, on diflerent sides of the House, 
     <lb/>
     but working sincerely in the united effort 
     <lb/>
     to do what we believe to be best in the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country.

     <persName ref="pers:TALB1">Mr. O. E. TALBOT</persName> (Bellechasse). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, at this late hour of the night I 
     <lb/>
     do not intend to impose upon the House a 
     <lb/>
     very long speech, because it is with a very 
     <lb/>
     strong sense of shame and with a feeling 
     <lb/>
     of reluctance that I now rise in answer to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman (Mr. Bergeron) who 
     <lb/>
     has just taken his seat. After what has 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the province of Quebec since 
     <lb/>
    1896 and when we know what the political 
     <lb/>record of that hon. gentleman is and when 
     <lb/>this hon. gentleman has the audacity to 
     <lb/>stand up in this House as the defender 
     <lb/>of the episcopate and the clergy of Quebec, 
     <lb/>I say that I rise to answer him now with 
     <lb/>a great sense of shame and reluctance. 
     <lb/>Every one in this House knows and sees 
     <lb/>through the hon. gentleman's motive at 
     <lb/>this moment—he wants to apologize to his 
     <lb/>leader because he is going to vote against 
     <lb/>his amendment ; and it is a shameful apo<lb break="no"/>logy that he has given to the House during 
     <lb/>the last hour. The hon. gentleman thinks
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="4071" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-04-06_Page_4071.jpg"/>
        
<fw type="num">4071</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
       

     he can swallow himself and cover his tracks 
     <lb/>
     from the public eye. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     now stands up as the defender of the 
     <lb/>
     episcopate of the province of Quebec ; but 
     <lb/>
     what did we see this afternoon ? We saw 
     <lb/>
     him applauding the abuse that fell from 
     <lb/>
     the lips of the hon. member for South York 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. W. F. Maclean). Thank God, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, the clergy and the episcopate of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec have not fallen so low 
     <lb/>
     as to require the defence of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. The clergy of Quebec stand to—day, 
     <lb/>
     as they have always stood, highly respected 
     <lb/>
     and loved by every French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     and even by every Protestant of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec and other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     What was the use of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man going so far back into ancient history 
     <lb/>
     as to talk about the elections of 1896 ? Is 
     <lb/>
     that the question before the House to-day ? 
     <lb/>
     He wanted to know what was the reason 
     <lb/>
     the Papal ablegate was sent to Canada ? 
     <lb/>
     No man knows the reason better than the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman. He spoke of a certain 
     <lb/>
     document to which the name of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice was attached. He knows 
     <lb/>
     where that document was prepared. He 
     <lb/>
     knows that it was prepared in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec by two leading Tories, Mr. Chapais 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. L. P. Pelletier, who imposed that 
     <lb/>
     document on the episcopate. I remember 
     <lb/>
     very well, in the election of 1896, when the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of this House was in the parish 
     <lb/>
     of St. Raphael in my county, when Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Landry, Mr. Pelletier and Mr. Chapais 
     <lb/>
     came with that document before a couple 
     <lb/>
     of thousand of my electors, and asked 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman to sign it. What 
     <lb/>
     was his answer ? He said : Go with that 
     <lb/>
     document to your leaders and get their 
     <lb/>
     signatures to it, and come to me afterwards, 
     <lb/>
     and I will then tell you what I will do. What 
     <lb/>
     was done to get some gentlemen to sign 
     <lb/>
     that document? I remember when Dr. 
     <lb/>
     Vaillancourt was fighting the battles of 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party in the county of Dorchester 
     <lb/>
     adjoining mine, Mr. Pelletier, the great 
     <lb/>
     friend of the hon. member for Beauharnois 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Bergeron), went to Dr. Vallaincourt 
     <lb/>
     and said to him, 'if you sign this docu<lb break="no"/>ment, we will allow you to be elected by 
     <lb/>
     acclamation.' Dr. Vallaincourt signed it, 
     <lb/>
     and the next day or the day after he had 
     <lb/>
     an opponent. What was the use of Liberals 
     <lb/>
     signing a document ? Did we make any- 
     <lb/>
     thing as a party by doing so ? Was not 
     <lb/>
     the clergy against us from beginning to 
     <lb/>
     end in 1896 ? Did we gain any votes in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec by signing that 
     <lb/>
     document ? On the contrary. What was 
     <lb/>
     the reason the people of Quebec as well 
     <lb/>
     as the people of every other province rose 
     <lb/>
     in their might on that occasion and carried 
     <lb/>
     the Liberals into power ? It was because 
     <lb/>
     homes were deserted and windows and 
     <lb/>
     doors barred up, and where there had been 
     <lb/>
     happiness before there was nothing but 
     <lb/>
     wilderness and desolation. It was because 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">4072</fw>
    

     of the strong feeling that the people had 
     <lb/>
     that a change had to come. There was dis<lb break="no"/>tress for the farmers everywhere, and the 
     <lb/>
     people could see no prospect under Con<lb break="no"/>servative rule except what had happened 
     <lb/>
     for eighteen or twenty years before—our 
     <lb/>
     people leaving Canada and going to the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the line for the bread which 
     <lb/>
     they were unable to earn on their own soil. 
     <lb/>
     That was the principal reason. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Beauharnois wants to involve 
     <lb/>
     the clergy of the province of Quebec again 
     <lb/>
     in political conflicts when we are leaving 
     <lb/>
     them alone. When he says there is no anal<lb break="no"/>ogy between the fact that Archbishop Taché 
     <lb/>
     was brought from Rome to Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     fact that of the Papal ablegate being 
     <lb/>
     brought from Rome to Canada, we all know 
     <lb/>
     that there is an analogy in one respect. 
     <lb/>
     Archbishop Taché, before he died, left a 
     <lb/>
     letter, which is a portion of his will, in 
     <lb/>
     which he said that he had come to Canada 
     <lb/>
     at the request of the leader of the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party ; and he said : 'Promises 
     <lb/>
     were made to me, and the cause of my pre<lb break="no"/>mature death at this moment is that those 
     <lb/>
     promises have never been fulfilled, and I 
     <lb/>
     have been deceived by the leaders of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party.' That is where the 
     <lb/>
     difference is, and that is where there is no 
     <lb/>
     analogy between the two cases. The Pope 
     <lb/>
     was not deceived at the time we remon<lb break="no"/>strated against the straight, direct inter<lb break="no"/>vention of the clergy in political contests 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec. Though we 
     <lb/>
     were Liberals, we were just as good Ca<lb break="no"/>tholics as my hon. friend, and why were 
     <lb/>
     we damned from some pulpits because we 
     <lb/>
     voted as Liberals ? Why was it that in 
     <lb/>
     some of the pulpits some men went so far 
     <lb/>
     as to say : 'Hell is red, and heaven is 
     <lb/>
     blue ; vote for the blue, and you are all 
     <lb/>
     right, but if you vote for the rouge, you 
     <lb/>
     are damned, and damned for ever.' Was it 
     <lb/>
     not time that the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     should have some protection from this 
     <lb/>
     kind of thing, so that we might vote as free 
     <lb/>
     men for the party in whom we had con<lb break="no"/>fidence. I am sorry to have to refer to 
     <lb/>
     these matters, and I would not have done 
     <lb/>
     so if the hon. member for Beauharnois had 
     <lb/>
     not dragged them on to the floor of this 
     <lb/>
     House. The hon. gentleman says he has 
     <lb/>
     been here for twenty-four years ; but he 
     <lb/>
     forgot what happened between the twen<lb break="no"/>tieth and the twenty-fourth years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. It would have been 
     <lb/>
     twenty-eight years then.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TALB2">Mr. TALBOT</persName>. He had time to reflect. 
     <lb/>
     One of the strong arguments that elected 
     <lb/>
     him in the last election in the county of 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois was that his opponent was a 
     <lb/>
     Protestant and an Englishman. I do not 
     <lb/>
     say that the hon. gentleman used that 
     <lb/>
     argument, but his heelers used it. We saw 
     <lb/>
     it and read it in the papers at the time. 
     <lb/>

     agreement made between Mr. Landry, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chapais and Mr. Pelletier, and that even 
     <lb/>
     they would not live up to the agreement. 
     <lb/>
     To be sure, the agreement was made, but 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Pelletier, Mr. Chapais and Mr. Landry 
     <lb/>
     had nothing to do with it after it was 
     <lb/>
     signed. The people of Dorchester were 
     <lb/>
     very angry at that, and they said : It is 
     <lb/>
     not Pelletier, it is not Landry, it is not 
     <lb/>
     Chapais, who will choose the candidate for 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TALB1">Mr. O. E. TALBOT</persName>. There is one thing 
     <lb/>
     more I wish to say. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) has now gone 
     <lb/>
     out of the House. I wished to remind him 
     <lb/>
     of a certain speech that he made in the elec<lb break="no"/>tions of 1900, to show him why the people 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec gave the verdict they then gave. 
     <lb/>
     In the county of Kamouraska, at St. Pas<lb break="no"/>cal, six or seven of these gentlemen came 
     <lb/>
     one day, and among them the member for 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois. When speaking he went so 
     <lb/>
     far as to treat the Liberals like animals 
     <lb/>
     being in a trough, and so deep in the trough 
     <lb/>
     that their horns got caught and they could 
     <lb/>
     not get out. That is the way he treated 
     <lb/>
     the Liberals of Quebec in county after 
     <lb/>
     county. Is it any wonder to you, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that the Liberals rebelled against 
     <lb/>
     such treatment, and they returned the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman to power with such a large 
     <lb/>
     majority ? Sir, I hope this is the last time 
     <lb/>
     we shall hear the episcopacy and priest<lb break="no"/>hood of Quebec dragged into discussions of 
     <lb/>
     this kind. After all, we were only fighting 
     <lb/>
     for our political freedom. Since the Papal 
     <lb/>
     ablegate came to this country, and even 
     <lb/>
     since Rome has been directly represented 
     <lb/>
     in Canada, we have had peace in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, and perfect liberty. to 
     <lb/>
     vote just as we pleased, and we have had 
     <lb/>
     no more trouble.

     The leader of the opposition is supposed 
     <lb/>
     by some hon. gentlemen to have made an 
     <lb/>
     apology here this evening. I want to say 
     <lb/>
     that I did not so understand him ; because 
     <lb/>
     if there is one thing in the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition of which I am proud, it is that he 
     <lb/>
     is always so guarded in anything he says 
     <lb/>
     that it is unnecessary for him to offer any 
     <lb/>
     apology to the House afterwards. Now it 
     <lb/>
     has been said to-night that, owing to the 
     <lb/>
     presence of the Papal ablegate in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, the citizens of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince are enjoying political liberty. I want 
     <lb/>
     to say as representing an Ontario constitu<lb break="no"/>ency that I am very glad to know that the 
     <lb/>
     Papal ablegate is having such a good in<lb break="no"/>fluence in the province of Quebec. I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to charge the people of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     with being bigots because they cannot agree 
     <lb/>
     among themselves, and because they require 
     <lb/>
     the presence of a Papal ablegate in order 
     <lb/>
     that they may enjoy political liberty. I hope 
     <lb/>
     they may long continue to enjoy that liberty. 
     <lb/>
     But I wish to say that I entertain different 
     <lb/>
     views from the majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, though I am glad 
     <lb/>
     to say that my father was born in 
     <lb/>
     the city of Quebec, and I have a 
     <lb/>
     friendly feeling for that province. But 
     <lb/>
     I differ from a large number of my 
     <lb/>
     friends from that province. I am a 
     <lb/>
     Protestant, and I have no hesitation 
     <lb/>
     in saying it ; and when I say that I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that I am incurring the contempt of 
     <lb/>
     any hon. gentleman from Quebec. Now 
     <lb/>
     the belief of Protestants, and of the great 
     <lb/>
     majority of the electors I represent, is this 
     <lb/>
     We say that in the administration of state 
     <lb/>
     affairs in this country the government has 
     <lb/>
     no right to act as I hold the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     has done in this particular instance. Will 
     <lb/>
     any man say that I am a bigot because I 
     <lb/>
     make this declaration ? That is my right, 
     <lb/>
     that is my privilege. I want to say in mak<lb break="no"/>ing that statement that I can place my fin<lb break="no"/>ger on dozens of supporters of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment who entertain the same views, and so 
     <lb/>
     does the large bulk of the constituents who 
     <lb/>
     elected them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I want to point out to the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman that at the last Dominion election 
     <lb/>
     the gentlemen who form his cabinet were 
     <lb/>
     elected on the principle of representative 
     <lb/>
     government. Now as a Protestant my faith 
     <lb/>
     teaches me to find fault with the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman for refusing, or at all events for 
     <lb/>
     neglecting, to consult with the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people who were in his cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     the ministers of the Crown, on this impor<lb break="no"/>tant and vital question, namely, the edu<lb break="no"/>cational clauses of this Bill. The leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition and other members on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House, have asked a straight 
     <lb/>
     and practical question, that is of vital mo<lb break="no"/>ment to me as a Protestant, and of vital 
     <lb/>
     moment to the people I represent, who are 
     <lb/>
     largely Protestants ; the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has been asked the question calmly 
     <lb/>
     and squarely. whether or not he had con<lb break="no"/>

     <lb/>
     to the educational clauses of this Bill, and 
     <lb/>
     he has refused to answer that question. In 
     <lb/>
     view of that fact I am justified, on behalf 
     <lb/>
     of the people I represent, in saying to the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman that they do not 
     <lb/>
     approve of his course because it is 
     <lb/>
     against their religious faith, and we do not 
     <lb/>
     believe in that system of administering the 
     <lb/>
     government of this country. That is my 
     <lb/>
     position, and in making that statement I do 
     <lb/>
     not think my Quebec friends can take 
     <lb/>
     offence. Possibly, they believe that the 
     <lb/>
     first Minister has done quite right in con<lb break="no"/>sulting the Papal ablegate, I have no fault 
     <lb/>
     to find with them for that, they have a per<lb break="no"/>fect right to their opinions and a right to 
     <lb/>
     express them, as I have a perfect right to 
     <lb/>
     express conrtrary opinions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, much has been said about Bishop 
     <lb/>
     Taché and Mr. Ewart. I was in Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     when Bishop Taché was there, and I know 
     <lb/>
     something of the arrangement that was 
     <lb/>
    entered into with the minority in the 
     <lb/>province of Manitoba. When the Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie government were in power, de<lb break="no"/>legates came from Manitoba to Ottawa 
     <lb/>for the purpose of securing more money 
     <lb/>to conduct their government. The ans<lb break="no"/>wer Mr. Mackenzie gave was this: Go 
     <lb/>back to your own province and see if, by 
     <lb/>wiser economy, you cannot administer your 
     <lb/>affairs more economically, then I may be 
     <lb/>in a position to grant you more financial 
     <lb/>assistance. The chief fault Mr. Mackenzie 
     <lb/>found with them was that they had two 
     <lb/>chambers, they had a legislative council 
     <lb/>and he thought a new province like that 
     <lb/>ought to abolish the legislative council, 
     <lb/>and he promised if they would exercise 
     <lb/>economy in that matter, he would be will<lb break="no"/>ing possibly to assist them financially. I 
     <lb/>was a government employee there at the 
     <lb/>time, and I remember the promise made 
     <lb/>squarely to the minority of the province, as 
     <lb/>represented in the legislative council that 
     <lb/>if they would vote themselves out of exist<lb break="no"/>ence they would continue to exercise all the 
     <lb/>rights they had had up to that moment. 
     <lb/>Mr. Davis, who was prime minister, ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Attorney General Clarke, who had been de<lb break="no"/>feated during the session and others, pledg<lb break="no"/>ed themselves that the minority should con<lb break="no"/>tinue to exercise their rights for all time to 
     <lb/>come. But when the Manitoba school 
     <lb/>question came up in this House, I was 
     <lb/>here, and representing a strong Protestant 
     <lb/>constituency. I voted in favour of reme<lb break="no"/>dial legislation. And I want to tell my hon. 
     <lb/>friends from Quebec, that, while many of 
     <lb/>my constituents found fault with me for 
     <lb/>voting in favour of the legislation, I told 
     <lb/>them straightforwardly that if they elected 
     <lb/>me again and Sir Charles Tupper's govern<lb break="no"/>ment was sustained and reintroduced reme<lb break="no"/>dial legislation for Manitoba, I would vote 
     <lb/>for it as I had done before, to protect the 
     <lb/>rights of the minority. When hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite accuse the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>

     position and his supporters of being un<lb break="no"/>willing to give the minority in Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     their rights, I want to tell them that one 
     <lb/>
     stands here who is ready to vote to secure 
     <lb/>
     the rights of any minority in this country, 
     <lb/>
     Catholic or Protestant. I was astonished 
     <lb/>
     to hear the ex-Minister of the Interior the 
     <lb/>
     other night utter these words, which I find 
     <lb/>
     reported on page 3253 of this year's ' Han<lb break="no"/>sard ' :

     Therefore, in 1896 when this settlement was

     <lb/>
     it was a settlement which led my right hon.

            <p>
     There has never been a session since 1896 
     <lb/>
     when reference has not been made to the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba school question. How the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior could have made 
     <lb/>
     such a statement I cannot conceive. I can 
     <lb/>
     only assume it as conclusive evidence that 
     <lb/>
     he is not well posted on what takes place 
     <lb/>
     in this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is true that reference was had, as 
     <lb/>
     has been said, to Archbishop Taché and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ewart. We, as Protestants, do not 
     <lb/>
     object to that, for both Archbishop Taché 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Ewart were citizens of this country. 
     <lb/>
     If the Conservative Prime Minister chose 
     <lb/>
     to consult them he had a perfect right to 
     <lb/>
     do so. The present Prime Minister would 
     <lb/>
     have the right to do the same. But we 
     <lb/>
     draw a distinction here—the papal delegate 
     <lb/>
     is not a citizen of this country. There are 
     <lb/>
     Catholic bishops who have the welfare of 
     <lb/>
     the church at heart as well as the Papal 
     <lb/>
     delegate, and if the Prime Minister, after 
     <lb/>
     consulting his cabinet, wishes to consult 
     <lb/>
     any of them, we have no fault to find. But 
     <lb/>
     when he goes outside, we believe, as Pro<lb break="no"/>testants, that he has gone beyond the pro<lb break="no"/>per line. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I would like to say to hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite who differ with me in the 
     <lb/>
     matter of religion that it is not well to be 
     <lb/>
     too sensitive as to the way members ex<lb break="no"/>press their views on this question. The 
     <lb/>
     question comes before us, as we believe, 
     <lb/>
     not in proper course. Had this Autonomy 
     <lb/>
     Bill been brought in minus the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses, the people of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would have continued to enjoy the 
     <lb/>
     same privileges in education that they now 
     <lb/>
     have, unless those privileges were curtailed 
     <lb/>
     by the legislature we might create. But, 
     <lb/>
     if the legislature made such changes we be<lb break="no"/>lieve they would be within their rights. 
     <lb/>
     And I am prepared to vote against any in<lb break="no"/>terference with their freedom in educa<lb break="no"/>tional matters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Just a word or two with regard to the<lb/>accusation that hon. gentlemen on this<lb/>side are backward in expressing their views<lb/>on this question. There are gentlemen on<lb/>this side who do not agree with me on<lb/>

     the questions involved in this Bill. They 
     <lb/>
     hold their views honestly, and have a right 
     <lb/>
    to hold and to express them. And they 
     <lb/>have expressed their views frankly. My 
     <lb/>hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. 
     <lb/>Monk) made one of the best speeches of 
     <lb/>the session in explaining his views on this 
     <lb/>question, though those views were not the 
     <lb/>same that I hold. Is he to be found fault 
     <lb/>with because he has honestly stated his 
     <lb/>position ? Certainly not. And the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who offered 
     <lb/>this criticism, it seems to me, has not shown 
     <lb/>much courage in speaking out on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. When the Bill was introduced with 
     <lb/>section 16, as it originally was, he made the 
     <lb/>statement : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I have not spoken 
     <lb/>
     on the Bill yet.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Then, why should he find 
     <lb/>
     fault because some on this side have not 
     <lb/>
    spoken and say they lack courage ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I do not understand 
     <lb/>
     what my hon. friend (Mr. Ingram) is talk<lb break="no"/>ing about.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. If the hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     read ' Hansard ' to-morrow, he will find that 
     <lb/>
     he spoke of men on this side of the House 
     <lb/>
     as not having courage to speak out. He 
     <lb/>
     told them to come from behind the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition and express themselves.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I think I did say 
     <lb/>
     something like that.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I think the country would 
     <lb/>
     have been better satisfied if the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice himself had spoken on the measure. 
     <lb/>
     He has a great deal to do with this Bill :— 
     <lb/>
     And I am bound to say that hitherto the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has always handled legis<lb break="no"/>lation he had in charge in a manner to re<lb break="no"/>flect credit upon himself and upon the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. But I think, he has been a little 
     <lb/>
     careless, perhaps, in not making a speech a 
     <lb/>
     little earlier that might have-<lb/>
            </p>


            <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Is there any chance 
     <lb/>
     of converting my hon. friend (Mr. Ingram) ? 
     <lb/>
     If so, I will speak at the very next sitting 
     <lb/>
     of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I am bound to say that 
     <lb/>
     there is not the slightest chance. Let me 
     <lb/>
     point out to the Minister of Justice the fact 
     <lb/>
     that clever lawyers on his own side have 
     <lb/>
     spoken on the Bill, but these clever lawyers

     do not agree. If the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     himself had stated first what these clauses 
     <lb/>
     did contain, we might have been saved 
     <lb/>
     some of the exhibitions we have had in this 
     <lb/>
     House in connection with the Bill, and per<lb break="no"/>haps we should not have had the slurring
