<fw type="running">[COMMONS.]</fw> <head>THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORY.</head> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName> moved for <lb/>
leave to introduce a Bill respecting the <lb/>
North-West Territory, and to create a <lb/>
separate territory out of part thereof. <lb/>
He said - We find that there is likely <lb/>
to be a good deal of inconvenience <lb/>
from the North-West Territories, in<lb break="no"/>cluding all that portion of our country <lb/>
    
<cb/>
    
    east of Manitoba and west of the bound<lb break="no"/>ary of Ontario. The Province of <lb/>
Manitoba wishes to increase its bound<lb break="no"/>aries northward, westward, and east<lb break="no"/>ward; but until the question is decided <lb/>
as to where the limits of Ontario may <lb/>
ultimately be fixed,it is impossible to <lb/>
take any steps towards enlarging the <lb/>
boundaries of that Province without <lb/>
the risk of having it reconsidered, pro<lb break="no"/>bably at the very next Session. I have <lb/>
thought it advisable on the whole, to <lb/>
detach a portion of country imme<lb break="no"/>diately north and east of Manitoba, <lb/>
from the North West Territories pro<lb break="no"/>per, and to have its affairs administered <lb/>
by the Government of Manitoba without <lb/>
the risk of having it reconsidered, pro<lb break="no"/>bably at the very next Session. I have <lb/>
thought it advisable on the whole, to <lb/>
detach a portion of country imme<lb break="no"/>diately north and east of Manitoba, <lb/>
from the North West Territories pro<lb break="no"/>per, and to have its affairs administered <lb/>
by the Governor of Manitoba without <lb/>
the intervention of any council, and <lb/>
without incurring any expense what<lb break="no"/>ever. The boundary proposed in the <lb/>
Bill is to commence where the western <lb/>
coast of Lake Manitoba intersects the <lb/>
northern boundary of that Province, <lb/>
proceeding northward along the west<lb break="no"/>ern coast of that Lake to the portage<lb/>
between its waters and Lake Winne<lb break="no"/>pegoosis, thence proceeding on the <lb/>
eastern shore of Lake Winnepegoosis <lb/>
to Mossy Portage, a small neck of <lb/>
land between the Saskatchewan <lb/>
River and this Lake, and thence <lb/>
due northward from that point. The <lb/>
Bill recapitulates certain provisions <lb/>
of the North-West Territories Act of <lb/>
last Session, which will be made appli<lb break="no"/>cable to that Territory. As soon as <lb/>
the boundary between the Dominion <lb/>
and Ontario is settled in that quarter, <lb/>
the probability is, Manitoba will have <lb/>    
its limits enlarged. The Government <lb/>
of that Province have sought to have <lb/>
its boundaries enlarged at the present <lb/>
time, but we felt it would be inconveni<lb break="no"/>ent to have this done in the east at <lb/>
the present time without knowing the <lb/>
precise place to where we would go.<lb/>    
If the conclusions of the hon. member <lb/>    
for Bothwell be correct, Manitoba and <lb/>
most of the North-West Territory will <lb/>
belong to Ontario. As I judge it, a <lb/>
more reasonable conclusion may pro<lb break="no"/>bably be safely predicted, that will <lb/>
send it a considerable distance east of <lb/>
the present boundary. This is simply <lb/>
a provisional arrangement, which will <lb/>
come to an end as soon as we have that <lb/>
boundary settled. My first thought <lb/>
was to make Lake Winnipeg the limit, <lb/>
but it seemed more convenient to have <lb/>

that portion of territory—where there is <lb/>
a considerable settlement already, <lb/>
and where the telegraph line has <lb/>
been built and the railway located east <lb/>
of the other two lakes (Manitoba and <lb/>
Winnepegoosis)—attached to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Manitoba than to a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment situated several hundred miles <lb/>
west of that Province. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName> suggested some spe<lb break="no"/>cial provision should be made for the <lb/>
government of the country lying <lb/>
north of British Columbia, in which <lb/>
valuable diggings had been discovered, <lb/>
and to which there would be a large <lb/>
emigration next spring. He had a <lb/>
petition from the miners of Cassiar re<lb break="no"/>garding the matter, and he thought it <lb/>
might be convenient for the Premier <lb/>
to include a clause in this Bill respect<lb break="no"/>ing it. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—I will <lb/>
consider any representation the hon. <lb/>
gentleman may make before the <lb/>
second reading of the Bill, although I <lb/>
fear it would hardly do to insert such a <lb/>
provision. <lb/></p> 

<p>
<persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>—The <lb/>
territory referred to belongs to the <lb/>
Government of Fort Pelly, and my <lb/>
hon. friend suggests that a provision <lb/>
should be inserted in the Act confer<lb break="no"/>ring upon the Government of British <lb/>
Columbia the power of administering <lb/>
the affairs of that place, analogous to <lb/>
that conferred on the Government of <lb/>
Manitoba for the eastern section. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—I shall be <lb/>
happy to consider the question before <lb/>
the second reading. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Bill was read the first time. <lb/></p>
