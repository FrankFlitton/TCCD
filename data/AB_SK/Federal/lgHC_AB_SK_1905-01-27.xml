            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:CLEM1">Mr. CLEMENTS</persName>. While I think a port is <lb/> necessary in that
               district, I think it is in <lb/> the wrong place. I think the town of Wheat<lb
                  break="no"/>ley, about five miles from there, is the <lb/> proper place. I would
               ask the hon. minister <lb/> to take that into consideration. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I shall be very glad <lb/> to inquire as to that.
               I judge, from the <lb/> small amount of revenue returned that it <lb/> must be
               largely a preventive station. Does <lb/> the hon. gentleman say that Wheatley <lb/>
               would be a better point to prevent smug<lb break="no"/>gling than where the office is
               now ? <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:CLEM1">Mr. CLEMENTS</persName>. Yes. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:CLAR1">Mr. CLARE</persName>. What increases of salaries <lb/> were made at the
               Galt customs house ? <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. The salary of Mr. Denis, <lb/> the preventive
               officer, was advanced from <lb/> $600 to $650. The collector has asked for <lb/> an
               increase, but it was not given last year. <lb/> It is under consideration. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:WRIG4">Mr. WM. WRIGHT</persName>. I represent a large <lb/> district, the district
               of Muskoka, in which <lb/> there is no custom house at all, and we <lb/> find it very
               inconvenient in getting goods <lb/> in. I am sure that the revenue of that dis<lb
                  break="no"/>trict is much larger than that of many others   <lb/>which have custom
               houses. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:PATE1">r. PATERSON</persName>. We have had strong <lb/> representations from
               portions of Muskoka <lb/> on that subject, among others from Brace<lb break="no"
               />bridge, a large and thriving place. During <lb/> the summer months, when there is a
               good <lb/> deal of traffic, we have an office at Graven<lb break="no"/>hurst. We have
               had applications for new <lb/> offices from thirty or forty places, but it is <lb/>
               difficult to accommodate them all. The open<lb break="no"/>ing of every new port
               means an additional <lb/> expenditure. Then, while we are very <lb/> anxious to
               oblige the business community as <lb/> far as we can, we are not able to secure the
               <lb/> same judgment with reference to values and <lb/> as to whether invoices are
               correct, at many <lb/> of these points that we can at larger points, <lb/> where we
               can afford to pay larger salaries <lb/> and have men especially delegated for the
               <lb/> work. In the United States there are only a <lb/> few very large ports. I
               believe it is a fact that <lb/> for their 80,000,000 people, they have not <lb/> as
               many ports as we have in Canada—not <lb/> relatively, but absolutely. But the people
               <lb/> of Canada have been accustomed to having <lb/> conveniences nearer home. I can
               well under<lb break="no"/>stand what the hon. gentleman says as to <lb/> the strong
               claims of the district he repre<lb break="no"/>sents; but the department feel that
               the few<lb break="no"/>er ports we can have, with due convenience <lb/> to the
               people, the greater uniformity in <lb/> values we can secure. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p> <persName ref="pers:WRIG4">Mr. WM. WRIGHT</persName>. Have you any sys<lb break="no"/>tem for opening
               new offices. with reference <lb/>to size or population ? <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. When we get applica<lb break="no"/>tions of that
               kind, one of the inspectors <lb/> makes inquiry personally, then the depart<lb
                  break="no"/><cb/>ment gets a statement from the office at <lb/> which it is
               probable the entries were made. <lb/> For instance, we would get from the collec<lb
                  break="no"/>tor at Orillia a statement of the goods en<lb break="no"/>tered for
               consumption in the town of Brace<lb break="no"/>bridge, and in that way arrive at the
               amount <lb/> of revenue that might be expected. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:BARK1">Mr. BARKER</persName>. Does the hon. gentleman <lb/> propose to make any
               increases in the staff <lb/> at Hamilton ? <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I do not think there is <lb/> any pressing demand
               for increases there. I <lb/> think we are pretty well manned there. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:BARK1">Mr. BARKER</persName>. I think so. too ; but there <lb/> will be a great
               deal of disappointment if <lb/> some appointments are not made. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Would it be <lb/> a disappointment to the
               sitting members ? <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:BARK1">Mr. BARKER</persName>. No. but to some very <lb/> strong supporters of the
               right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who expect offices. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. In the United States, <lb/> where there is a small
               number of ports com<lb break="no"/>paratively, taking into account its popula<lb
                  break="no"/>tion, how do they overcome what seem to <lb/> be great difficulties to
               us ?   <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I suppose the business <lb/> is done through
               brokers, with power of at<lb break="no"/>torney. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. That system is also in <lb/> vogue here. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Yes. in the larger cities. <lb/> but we are under
               no responsibility to the <lb/> brokers. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I see there are very large <lb/> increases in Nova
               Scotia compared with <lb/> New Brunswick. How does my hon. friend <lb/> account for
               that? <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. In New Brunswick the <lb/> officers were better
               paid, and in raising the <lb/> pay in Nova Seotia we are bringing the <lb/> offiers
               there on a footing more nearly equal <lb/> to those of New Brunswick. <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Some resolutions reported.

     DOMINION ELECTIONS ACT AMEND- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     MENT. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p>Mr. HUGH GUTHRIE (South Welling<lb break="no"/>ton) moved for leave to introduce Bill (No. 
     <lb/>9) to amend the Dominion Elections Act, 
     <lb/>1900. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Explain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, the object 
     <lb/>
     of the proposed Bill is to broaden the appli<lb break="no"/>cation of section 112 of the Election Act. 
     <lb/>
     That is the section which defines undue 
     <lb/>
     influence for the purposes of an election. 
     <lb/>
     It applies to acts by way of force, violence, 
     <lb/>
     restraint, or threats of the same, for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of intimidating electors or of in<lb break="no"/>fluencing their votes for any candidate. The 
     <lb/>
     proposed amendment goes a little farther 
     <lb/>
     than the present section, and provides 
     <lb/>
     against the canvassing or soliciting of votes 
     <lb/>
     by employers from their own workmen, 
     <lb/>
     leaving it open to any employer to canvass 
     <lb/>
     the rest of the world if he so chooses, but 
     <lb/>
     restricting him in the case of his own work<lb break="no"/>men. It is general in its application, includ<lb break="no"/>ing all persons who employ labour—mercan<lb break="no"/>tile men, professional men, manufacturers 
     <lb/>
     or large corporations—all kinds of corpora<lb break="no"/>tions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. MACLEAN. What about the farmer 
     <lb/>
     and hired man? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. GUTHRIE. The farmer and hired 
     <lb/>
     man will be included also. I think the gen<lb break="no"/>eral section 112 does not go quite far enough 
     <lb/>
     to meet this case. The mere fact that an 
     <lb/>
     employer canvasses his men involves some 
     <lb/>intimidation, if not direct, at all events, in<lb break="no"/>direct.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BRODER. Does it include the civil 
     <lb/>
     service ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. GUTHRIE. I have not made it apply 
     <lb/>
     to the civil service, but I fancy it might be 
     <lb/>
     made to apply to them, too. Anything in 
     <lb/>
     that direction, I think, would improve the 
     <lb/>
     condition of affairs which exists to-day. 
     <lb/>
     That, in brief, is the object of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     Bill. 
     <lb/>

            <p>RETIREMENT OF J. B. SHAW<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. LAKE asked : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1. On what date did Mr. J. B. Shaw first enter 
     <lb/>
     the government service in the Customs Depart<lb break="no"/>ment at Regina, and at what salary ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. On what date did he retire from the ser<lb break="no"/>vice, and what salary was he receiving when he 
     <lb/>
     did retire ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. During what period in 1904, if any, was he 
     <lb/>
     not employed in the service of the government? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. On what date did he re-enter the service 
     <lb/>
     of the government in the Customs Department 
     <lb/>
