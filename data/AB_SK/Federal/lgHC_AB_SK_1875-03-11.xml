            <p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName> introduced a<lb/>Bill to amend and consolidate the laws<lb/>respecting the North-West Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. As he intimated on a former<lb/>occasion the Government decided some<lb/>time ago to establish an entirely<lb/>independent Government in those<lb/>territories. To a certain extent it would<lb/>have been advisable, before such an Act<lb/>was passed, if it could be done, to have<lb/>the boundary of Manitoba rectified, but<lb/>that was a matter which it was difficult to<lb/>deal with at the present moment. He<lb/>thought it would be advisable as soon as<lb/>the boundary between the Province of<lb/>Ontario and the North-West Territories<lb/>was established, that that boundary should<lb/>become the boundary of the Province of<lb/>Manitoba. At present the 96th degree off<lb/>longitude was the eastern boundary of<lb/>that Province, and the contention of the<lb/>Ontario Government was that they owned<lb/>the territory to the centre of the Lake of<lb/>the Woods, and to a line running directly<lb/>north from Lake Itaska, in Minnesota, to<lb/>the head waters of the Mississippi. It was <lb/>known from the returns laid before Par<lb break="no"/>liament that the Government of the<lb/>Dominion, and the Ontario Government,<lb/>had decided upon an arbitration to define<lb/>this boundary ; and the Dominion Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had nominated ex-Lieutenant<lb/>Governor WILMOT, of New Brunswick,<lb/>while the Ontario Government had nomi<lb break="no"/>nated Chief Justice RICHARDS. These<lb/>gentlemen were to choose a third arbi<lb break="no"/>trator, and both parties to the arrange<lb break="no"/>ment were to abide by the decision arrived<lb/>at. The hon. member for Kingston, when<lb/>leader of the Government, made<lb/>a proposal to the Ontario Government<lb/>two years ago, to have this matter referred<lb/>to the Privy Council for settlement. While<lb/>there was no particular objection to that<lb/>course, it was thought advisable by the<lb/>present Government that it should be set<lb break="no"/>tled in the way he had explained. Until<lb/>that settlement had been reached, which <lb/>he hoped it would be in a short time, as<lb/>each side had prepared its case, and the<lb/>two arbitrators would shortly have a meet<lb break="no"/>ing, it was difficult to define the bound.<lb/>
