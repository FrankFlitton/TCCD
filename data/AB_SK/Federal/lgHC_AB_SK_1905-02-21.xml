               <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName> (Prime <lb/> Minister) moved for
                  leave to introduce Bill <lb/> (No. 69) to establish and provide for the <lb/>
                  government of the province of Alberta. He <lb/> said: Mr. Speaker, the Bill which
                  I have <lb/> now the honour to present is for the ad<lb break="no"/>mission of
                  another member into the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian family of provinces. As the
                  House, <lb/> no doubt, has noticed, this Bill is to be fol<lb break="no"/>lowed
                  immediately byranother for the same <lb/> purpose, in relation to the province of
                     Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan. These two Bills are intimately <lb/> connected;
                  they form part of the same <lb/> subject; and, by your leave, Sir, the ex<lb break="no"/>planations which I shall have the honour to <lb/> give to the
                  House, will apply to both. They <lb/> will apply likewise to the resolutions which
                  <lb/> will be introduced as the basis for the finan<lb break="no"/>cial clauses of
                  these Bills. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>It has been observed on the floor of this <lb/> House, as well as outside of. this
                  House, <lb/> that as the nineteenth century had been the <lb/> century of the
                  United States, so the twen<lb break="no"/>tieth century would be the century of
                  Can<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1422</fw>ada. This opinion has not been deemed ex<lb break="no"/>travagant. On this continent and across the <lb/> waters, it has been accepted
                  as the state<lb break="no"/>ment of a trurh, beyond controversy. The <lb/>
                  wonderful development of the United States <lb/> during the space of scarcely more
                  than one <lb/> hundred years may well be an incitement <lb/> to our efiorts and our
                  ambition. Yet to the <lb/> emulation of such an example there may well <lb/> be
                  some exception taken; for if it be true <lb/> that settlement of the western
                  portion <lb/> of the American union has been marked <lb/> by almost phenomenal
                  rapidity, it is <lb/> also true that every other consider<lb break="no"/>ation
                  seems to have been sacrificed to this <lb/> one consideration of rapid growth.
                  Little <lb/> attention was given, up to the last few <lb/> years, to the materials
                  which were intro<lb break="no"/>duced into the republic; little regard was paid
                  <lb/> among the new settlers to the observance of <lb/> the law; and it is not a
                  slander upon our <lb/> neighbours—for, indeed, the fact is ad<lb break="no"/>mitted in their current literature—that <lb/> frontier civilization was with
                  them a by<lb break="no"/>word for lawlessness. We have proceeded <lb/> upon
                  different methods. We have been <lb/> satisfied with slower progress. Our
                  institu<lb break="no"/>tions in our own Northwest have been <lb/> developed by
                  gradual stages, so as to ensure <lb/> at all times among these new communities
                  <lb/> law and order, and the restraints and safe<lb break="no"/>guards of the
                  highest civilization. <lb/> </p>
               <p>The time has arrived when we are all <lb/> agreed, I believe, nay, I feel sure,
                  upon both <lb/> sides of the House, that another step, and <lb/> the last, can now
                  be taken to complete the <lb/> passage of the Northwest Territories from <lb/>
                  what was once necessary tutelage, into the <lb/> fulness of the rights which,
                  under our con<lb break="no"/>stitution, appertain to provinces. <lb/> </p>
               <p>I may remind the House, though the fact <lb/> is well known to every body, that
                  when <lb/> confederation was established in the year <lb/> 1867, the Canada of
                  that day was not at all <lb/> what is the Canada of the present day. The <lb/>
                  Canada of that day did not extend beyond <lb/> the western limits of the province
                  of Onta<lb break="no"/>rio. On the other side of the continent, on <lb/> the
                  shores of the Pacific ocean, there was a <lb/> British colony, British Columbia.
                  absolutely <lb/> isolated; and between British Columbia on <lb/> one side and
                  Ontario on the other side there <lb/> was a vast extent of territory, the fairest
                  <lb/> portion perhaps of the continent, which was <lb/> under British sovereignty,
                  but in which <lb/> British sovereignty had always been dor<lb break="no"/>mant.
                  That vast extent of the continent, <lb/> the fairest, as I said, and the most
                  fertile, <lb/> was administered, loosely administered by <lb/> the Hudson Bay
                  Company, under a charter <lb/> which the company claimed, gave her almost <lb/>
                  sovereign sway, and which she used to <lb/> keep this vast extent of country as a
                  <lb/> close preserve for her immense opera<lb break="no"/>tions in the fur trade.
                  I need not tell <lb/> </p>
               <p>you, Sir, the fact is well known and pre<lb break="no"/>sent to the memory of
                  all, that it was the <lb/> intention of the fathers of confederation not <lb/> to
                  limit it to the comparatively narrow <lb/>
                  <pb n="1423" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1423.jpg"/>

                  bounds in which it was included in 1867, but <lb/> to
                  extend it eastward and westward between <lb/> the two oceans. I need hardly tell
                  you, Sir, <lb/> the fact is known to all and well remember<lb break="no"/>ed by
                  every one, that provision was made in <lb/> the instrument of confederation
                  itself, for <lb/> the admission into confederation of British <lb/> Columbia,
                  Prince Edward Island, and even <lb/> Newfoundland, and especially for these ter<lb break="no"/>ritories which at last have come in to-day as <lb/> part of the
                  Canadian family. In the very <lb/> first year of confederation, the very first
                  <lb/> session of the first parliament, resolutions <lb/> were introduced into this
                  House and adopted <lb/> unanimously for the acquisition of Rupert's <lb/> Land and
                  the Northwest Territories. and <lb/> the extinguishment therein of the title of
                  the <lb/> Hudson Bay Company. This was accom<lb break="no"/>plished in a very
                  short time, and as soon as <lb/> accomplished, the government of that day, <lb/>
                  the government of Sir John Macdonald, pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to carve the new
                  province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba out of the wilderness. and without any <lb/>
                  preliminary stage endowed it at once with <lb/> all the rights and privileges of a
                  province. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>If we go back to the history of those days, <lb/> perhaps the opinion will not be
                  unwarranted <lb/> that it would have been a wiser course, if <lb/> instead of
                  bringing Manitoba at once into <lb/> the confederation full fledged and fully <lb/>
                  equipped as a province, that maturity had <lb/> been reached by gradual stages
                  extended <lb/> over a few years. If that course had been <lb/> adopted, perhaps
                  some mistakes would have <lb/> been avoided from the effects of which we <lb/>
                  have not yet completely recovered. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Very different was the course and policy <lb/> of Mr. Mackenzie when he came into
                  office <lb/> with regard to the Northwest Territory. <lb/> Up to the year 1875 the
                  Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories had been administered under no spe<lb break="no"/>cial form of government. But in 1875 <lb/> Mr. Mackenzie, being then
                  Prime Minister <lb/> of Canada, introduced into this House and <lb/> carried
                  unanimously a measure, a very <lb/> important measure, the object of which, <lb/>
                  as he said himself, was to give to the <lb/> Northwest Territories an 'entirely
                  inde<lb break="no"/>pendent government.' This measure has <lb/> been the charter
                  under which the Northwest <lb/> Territories have come to their present state <lb/>
                  of manhood. It has never been repealed. <lb/> Additions have been made to it from
                  time <lb/> to time, but it has remained and is to this <lb/> day the rock upon
                  which has been reared the <lb/> structure, which we are about to crown with <lb/>
                  complete and absolute autonomy. By this <lb/> measure it was provided that a
                  Lieutenant <lb/> Governor should be appointed for the North<lb break="no"/>west
                  Territories. The Lieutenant Governor <lb/> was to be vested with executive power,
                  and <lb/> he was to administer that power with the <lb/> assistance of a council
                  to be composed of <lb/> five members, the Lieutenant Governor and <lb/> his
                  advisers to be appointed by the Governor <lb/> in Council. Apart from these
                  adminis<lb break="no"/>trative powers the Lieutenant Governor was <lb/> also
                  invested with large legislative authority. <lb/> He could make laws for taxation,
                  for local <lb/> and municipal purposes, property and civil <lb/>
                  <!--<p>Sir WILFRID LAURIER.

     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1424</fw> rights,
                  the administration of justice, public <lb/> health, police, roads, highways and
                  bridges-<lb/> generally all matters of a purely local and <lb/> private nature.
                  There was also an enact<lb break="no"/>ment in that measure to the effect that
                  when <lb/> any district, not exceeding 1,000 square <lb/> miles, contained a
                  population of not less <lb/> than 1,000 people of adult age, exclusive of <lb/>
                  aliens and unenfranchised Indians, it could <lb/> be erected into an electoral
                  district which <lb/> should thenceforward be entitled to elect <lb/> a member to
                  the council. There was <lb/> also an important enactment with regard to <lb/>
                  education, introducing into that country <lb/> the system of separate schools in
                  force in <lb/> the province of Ontario. But I shall say <lb/> nothing at the
                  present time of this important <lb/> part of the law of 1875, as I propose to come
                  <lb/> again to it at a later stage of the obser<lb break="no"/>vations which I
                  desire to offer to the House. <lb/> This Act remained in force without any im<lb break="no"/>portant modifications up to the year 1886, <lb/> when the Territories
                  were given representa<lb break="no"/>tion in this parliament. Two years later
                  <lb/> an important step in advance was also taken <lb/> in their development, that
                  is to say, in 1888. <lb/> The executive council was abolished, so far, <lb/> at
                  all events, as its powers of legislation <lb/> were concerned, and a legislative
                  assembly <lb/> was created, to be composed of twenty-five <lb/> members, twenty-two
                  of which were to be <lb/> elected by the people and three to be <lb/> known as
                  legal experts, to be appointed <lb/> by the Governor in Council; and a new <lb/>
                  executive council was to be appointed under <lb/> the name of advisory council to
                  advise <lb/> the Lieutenant Governor upon all matters <lb/> of finance. In 1891
                  another step forward <lb/> was taken, and a very important one. The <lb/>
                  legislative assembly of the Territories was <lb/> given additional powers; and if
                  you take <lb/> section 92 of the British North America Act <lb/> and compare it
                  with the powers which were <lb/> then given to the legislature, you will find <lb/>
                  that that legislature was invested with <lb/> powers almost as complete as those
                  which <lb/> are vested in the provinces under the <lb/> British North America Act.
                  In fact, <lb/> with the exception of borrowing money <lb/> most of the essential
                  powers which are <lb/> now given to the provinces were given <lb/> to the
                  legislative assembly of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. In 1894 another
                  depart<lb break="no"/>ure, another change, was made—I call it a <lb/> departure.
                  The change which was then <lb/> made was not, in my estimation, quite in <lb/>
                  accordance with the spirit of our consti<lb break="no"/>tution. It was that the
                  legislative assem<lb break="no"/>bly could select four members of its own <lb/>
                  body to be called an executive committee <lb/> to advise the Lieutenant Governor.
                  This is <lb/> not, as I say, in accordance with the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of
                  the British constitution. It is <lb/> not in accordance with the principles of
                  <lb/> British constitution that parliament itself <lb/> should elect the members
                  who are to ad<lb break="no"/>vise the Crown. The principle of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish constitution is that the Crown, or the <lb/> representative of the
                  Crown selects, him<lb break="no"/><pb n="1425" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1425.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1425</fw> <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 21. 1905</fw> self, his own advisers ; and under our own <lb/> well known practice in
                  these modern days, <lb/> the only restriction put upon the executive, <lb/> the
                  Crown, or the sovereign, is that he must <lb/> select advisers who have the
                  support of a <lb/> majority of the elected body. This new de<lb break="no"/>parture introduced in the statute of 1894 <lb/> did not last long, and at this I
                  am not sur<lb break="no"/>prised. In 1897 another and a final change <lb/> took
                  placeffn 1897 an Act was passed in this <lb/> House whereby it was provided that
                  there <lb/> should be an executive council to be chosen <lb/> by the Lieutenant
                  Governor from the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the House, and practically having
                  <lb/> the support of a majority of the elected <lb/> members of the legislature.
                  This was in <lb/> fact the last and final concession and it <lb/> was the
                  application of the principle of min<lb break="no"/>isterial responsibility. This
                  has been the <lb/> law ever since; it is the law to-day. So <lb/> that, Sir, it is
                  manifest that at this moment <lb/> the people of the Northwest Territories are
                  <lb/> in the enjoyment and have been for several <lb/> years, not only of full
                  ministerial respon<lb break="no"/>sibility, not only of full constitutional gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. but also of a large measure of <lb/> local autonomy. A great
                  deal has been <lb/> done, in fact, more has been done than we <lb/> have to do
                  to-day. We have to take the <lb/> last step but it is easy and comparatively <lb/>
                  unimportant in view of and in comparison <lb/> with what has already been
                  accomplished. <lb/> The metal has been in the crucible and all <lb/> we have to do
                  now, is to put the stamp of <lb/> Canadian nationality upon it. <lb/> </p>
               <p>The House is aware that some two years <lb/> ago or thereabouts there came to us
                  a very <lb/> general desire from the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories for
                  immediate admission into the <lb/> confederation as provinces. I did not be<lb break="no"/>lieve at the time for my part, that this re<lb break="no"/>quest,
                  respectable as it was, proceeded so <lb/> much from an actual need as from a
                  senti<lb break="no"/>ment. It was to me the expression of a <lb/> sentiment, a
                  sentiment most honourable, a <lb/> sentiment most worthy because it was an <lb/>
                  expression of the self-reliance of young <lb/> and ambitious communities. The
                  House is <lb/> also aware of the answer which we gave <lb/> to the Territories at
                  that time. We re<lb break="no"/>presented to them that in our judgment, the <lb/>
                  time was inopportune for taking this ques<lb break="no"/>tion into parliament,
                  that as we were on <lb/> the eve of a general election, the time and <lb/>
                  occasion would be more propitious and <lb/> more fitting after that event when
                  <lb/> the Territories would have the benefit on <lb/> this floor of a larger
                  representation. These <lb/> views were generally accepted. The elec<lb break="no"/>tions have taken place and immediately af<lb break="no"/>ter the elections, or
                  as soon as was practic<lb break="no"/>able thereafter, we invited the executive
                  <lb/> of the Northwest Territories to send del<lb break="no"/>egates here to
                  confer with us upon the mea<lb break="no"/>sure which was to be introduced so as
                  to <lb/> admit them into the confederation. We <lb/> have had the benefit of the
                  presence of Mr. <lb/> Haultain, the Premier of the Northwest <lb/> Territories and
                  of Mr. Bulyea, one of his <lb/> <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1426</fw> colleagues, and we have had the advantage
                  <lb/> of several conferences with them. We <lb/> have had the advantage also of
                  the pres<lb break="no"/>ence and advice of several of the members <lb/> from the
                  Territories, and now, Sir, it is my <lb/> privilege and my honour—I deem it indeed
                  <lb/> a privilege and an honour—to offer this Bill <lb/> to the House. <lb/> </p>
               <p>When we came to consider the problem <lb/> before us it became very soon apparent
                  <lb/> to me, at all events, that there were <lb/> four subjects which dominated
                  all the <lb/> others; that the others were of compar<lb break="no"/>atively minor
                  importance, but that there <lb/> were four which I was sure the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada and the Canadian peo<lb break="no"/>ple at large
                  might be expected to take <lb/> a deep interest in. The first was: How <lb/> many
                  provinces should be admitted into <lb/> the confederation coming from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories—one, or two or more? <lb/> The next question was:
                  in whom should <lb/> be vested the ownership of the public lands? <lb/> The third
                  question was: What should be <lb/> the financial terms to be granted to these
                  <lb/> new provinces? And the fourth and not <lb/> the least important by any means
                  was the <lb/> question of the school system which would <lb/> be introduced—not
                  introduced because it was <lb/> introduced long ago, but should be con<lb break="no"/>tinued in the Territories. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Sir, I will proceed to examine <lb/> one after the other, all these
                  questions. <lb/> The first, as I have just said is: <lb/> How many provinces should
                  be admit<lb break="no"/>ted into the confederation ? There is con<lb break="no"/>siderable variety, as everybody knows, in <lb/> the area of the different
                  provinces of the <lb/> confederation. Prince Edward Island has <lb/> an area of
                  2,184 miles, Nova Scotia 21,428 <lb/> miles, New Brunswick 27,985 miles, Quebec
                  <lb/> 351,873, Ontario 260,862, Manitoba 73,732, <lb/> and British Columbia
                  372,630, or a total <lb/> area for the seven provinces of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion of 1,110,694 miles. Now, the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries which are to-day
                  under the control and <lb/> jurisdiction of the local legislature have <lb/>
                  exactly the same area as that of the seven <lb/> provinces of the Dominion. The
                  total area <lb/> of the seven provinces, as I said a moment <lb/> ago is 1,110,694
                  miles and the area of the <lb/> different territories is as follows: <lb/> </p>

              <p>Or, an area a little greater than the total <lb/> area of the seven provinces of
                  the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. Now, as I have said there is a <lb/> great variety
                  in the sizes of our pro<lb break="no"/>vinces; in fact, it is very much with the
                  <lb/> Canadian Confederation as with the Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Union. There are
                  in the Canadian <lb/> Confederation provinces of; unequal sizes as <lb/> <pb n="1427" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1427.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1427</fw>   there
                  are in the American Union states of <lb/> unequal sizes. It is not a fatal fault
                  as has <lb/> been proved by the history of the American <lb/> Union, but I believe
                  that when provinces <lb/> are not the result of historic tradition, when <lb/>
                  they have not come to us formed and when <lb/> we have the control of events, it
                  is prefer<lb break="no"/>able that the provinces should be as near <lb/> as
                  possible about the same size. Therefore, <lb/> it is impossible to suppose that
                  this im<lb break="no"/>mense territory of 1,112,527 miles should <lb/> be formed
                  into one single province. There <lb/> is another objection. The territories are
                  <lb/> naturally divided into two portions from <lb/> the point of view of
                  agriculture, climate, <lb/> and productions generally, the northern <lb/> portion
                  and the southern portion, and I <lb/> would place the boundary of these two <lb/>
                  sections a little south of the boundary <lb/> which now divides the provisional
                  district <lb/> of Mackenzie from the provisional district <lb/> of Athabaska. This
                  northern portion of <lb/> the continent has not yet been fully ex<lb break="no"/>plored, but still we know enough of it, <lb/> there has been enough exploration
                  or it <lb/> and it has been travelled over sufliclently, <lb/> to make us sure that
                  it is absolutely unfit <lb/> for agriculture. The climate is too cold <lb/> and the
                  soil is too poor. There are, how<lb break="no"/>ever, very excellent and very
                  promising in<lb break="no"/>dications of mineral wealth in that dis<lb break="no"/>trict. There are indications to-day of pe<lb break="no"/>troleum, coal, gold,
                  copper and other min<lb break="no"/>erals, and perhaps some day we may have <lb/>
                  in What is to-day a barren section, an<lb break="no"/>other Yukon. But we know by
                  the expe<lb break="no"/>rience of the past that mineral wealth, <lb/> when not
                  coupled with agriculture, is but <lb/> a precarious ground on which to found the
                  <lb/> hope of thick and permanent settlement. <lb/> Therefore, we put aside this
                  northern sec<lb break="no"/>tion; but the southern section is of an ab<lb break="no"/>solutely different character. <lb/></p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. What does the right <lb/> hon. gentleman
                  (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) refer <lb/> to exactly ? <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I would divide <lb/> the two sections at
                  about the line which <lb/> now divides the provisional district of Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie and the provisional district of Atha<lb break="no"/>baska,
                  about the 60th parallel of north lati<lb break="yes"/>tude. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>The southern section is of a difierent <lb/> character. it is absolutely an
                  agricul<lb break="no"/>tural country, and I need not say that <lb/> it is one of
                  the finest in the world to<lb break="no"/>day. It is traversed by large rivers
                  flow<lb break="no"/>ing from the Rocky mountains to Hudson's <lb/> bay, and the
                  valley of the Saskatchewan <lb/> is, as every one knows. equal in fertility to
                  <lb/> the valley of the Red river. Everybody <lb/> knows also that the valley of
                  the Red river <lb/> and the valley of the Saskatchewan are to<lb break="no"/>day
                  the most fertile wheat fields under the <lb/> sun. We propose to give autonomy, not
                  to <lb/> the whole of the Territories, but to that <lb/> section which extends
                  from the American <lb/>
                  <!-- <p>Sir WILFRID LAURIER. 
     <lb/>
            </p>--> boundary up to
                  the boundary line between <lb/> the provisional district of Mackenzie and <lb/>
                  the provisional district of Athabaska, that <lb/> is the 60th parallel of north
                  latitude. <lb/> </p>
               <p>When we were first approached on this <lb/> subject, it was proposed to us that we
                  should <lb/> make a province extending from the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can boundary
                  up to the 57th parallel, that <lb/> is to say, somewhat to the south of the <lb/>
                  provisional boundary between the provis<lb break="no"/>ional districts of
                  Mackenzie and Athabaska, <lb/> but we thought it preferable to take in the <lb/>
                  whole district of Athabaska. The reason <lb/> for this is, that although Athabaska
                  is not <lb/> considered to be a fertile country, and the <lb/> eastern portion of
                  it is barren, the western <lb/> portion, the valley of the Peace river, is <lb/>
                  equal to the valley of the Saskatchewan and <lb/> settlement there is already
                  proceeding rapid<lb break="no"/>ly. There are to~day on the Peace river two <lb/>
                  grist mills, provided absolutely from wheat <lb/> grown in the Peace river valley,
                  and there<lb break="no"/>fore we have decided to include within the <lb/> new
                  provinces the provisional district of <lb/> Athabaska. The area of these two
                  pro<lb break="no"/>vinces together will be about 550,345 square <lb/> miles. This
                  is, in our estimation, altogether <lb/> too large an area to be made into one
                  single <lb/> province according to the size of the other <lb/> provinces, the
                  largest of which is British <lb/> Columbia, and the next largest Quebec, <lb/>
                  British Columbia with an area of 372,000 <lb/> square miles and Quebec with an
                  area of <lb/> 351,000 square miles. By dividing it into <lb/> two you have two
                  provinces of 275,000 <lb/> square miles in round numbers, each about <lb/> the
                  size of the province of Ontario. If any <lb/> of the members of the House will
                  care to <lb/> look at the map, they will see that We have <lb/> put the
                  provisional boundary on the fourth <lb/> meridian and according to our present
                  in<lb break="no"/>formation, this will give about the same <lb/> area and also the
                  same population to the two <lb/> provinces. It is estimated that the popula<lb break="no"/>tion to-day in these two provinces is about <lb/> 500,000 souls. We
                  have no accurate data, <lb/> but we can proceed pretty confidently upon <lb/> this
                  information. The census in 1901 gave <lb/> to these Northwest Territories a
                  population <lb/> of a little over 160,000 souls. Since that <lb/> time, during the
                  seasons of 1901, 1902, 1903 <lb/> and 1904, the population, by immigration <lb/>
                  alone, has increased by over 100,000 a year, <lb/> so that to-day we feel we are
                  on pretty safe <lb/> ground when we say that there is in those <lb/> two provinces
                  a total population of 500,000 <lb/> souls, and we calculate that this population
                  <lb/> is about equally divided between the two <lb/> prefiinces, giving a
                  population of 250,000 to <lb/> each. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Since I am upon the question of boundaries <lb/> I shall also come to another
                  question, con<lb break="no"/>nected therewith, that is to say, the demand <lb/>
                  which has been made upon us by the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba for an
                  extension of its <lb/> boundaries, westward, northward and east<lb break="no"/>ward. Yesterday a morning paper in this <lb/> city published an interview given
                  by the <lb/> Hon. Mr. Rogers, a member of the govern<lb break="no"/><pb n="1429" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1429.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1429</fw> <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 21. 1905</fw> ment
                  of Manitoba, upon this subject. I <lb/> shall take the liberty of referring to
                  that <lb/> interview of Mr. Rogers, so that the House <lb/> will better understand
                  the point to which <lb/> I am about to direct its attention. Mr. <lb/> Rogers said
                  in this interview: <lb/> </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> It is not a matter of agreement. We are sim<lb break="no"/>ply presenting the unanimous request of the <lb/> people of our
                  province for the extension or our <lb/> boundaries at least as far west as Regina
                  and <lb/> north as far as the northern boundary of Atha<lb break="no"/>baska,
                  which would include Fort Churchill, the <lb/> Nelson river and the territory
                  tributary there<lb break="no"/>to. This is no new request on behalf of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. In 1901 a resolution was introduced in the <lb/> legislature by
                  Mr. T. A. Burrows, then a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the legislature and now a
                  member of the <lb/> Dominion parliament. This resolution was sup<lb break="no"/>ported by Mr. Greenway, who was then leader <lb/> of the opposition, now a
                  member of the House <lb/> of Commons. This was accepted and supported <lb/> by the
                  government of the day and voted for by <lb/> every member of the House. A similar
                  resolu<lb break="no"/>tion was introduced by Mr. Roblin, leader of <lb/> the
                  government, and unanimously carried in <lb/> 1902. A further resolution was
                  introduced at <lb/> the recent session and voted for by every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the legislature, in which action they re<lb break="no"/>flected the
                  unanimous desire of all Manitobans. <lb/> Mr. Campbell and myself have been
                  appointed <lb/> to come here to plead for what is considered <lb/> by Manitoba to
                  be her just claims, before the <lb/> government who are the tribunal in the case
                  <lb/> and whose decision must be final. <lb/> </quote>
               <p>I may observe that Mr. Rogers might <lb/> have gone back much further than 1901
                  for <lb/> records of the presentation of the claims of <lb/> Manitoba for an
                  extension of territory. In<lb break="no"/>deed as far back as 1884 a similar
                  request <lb/> was presented to the government of Sir <lb/> John Macdonald. At that
                  time the Privy <lb/> Council dealt with this question in these <lb/> words : <lb/> </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
                  <p>The boundaries of Manitoba were originally <lb/> fixed at the instance of the
                     delegates from that <lb/> province who came to Ottawa in 1870 to adjust <lb/>
                     with the government of Canada the terms upon <lb/> which Manitoba was to enter
                     the confederation <lb/> of Her Majesty's North American provinces. <lb/> </p>
                  <p>The limits then agreed to embrace an area <lb/> of about 9,500,000 acres. In
                     the year 1881 these <lb/> limits were enlarged and territory added to the <lb/>
                     west and north. making the total area of the <lb/> province 96,000,000 acres or
                     150,000 square miles. <lb/> </p>
                  <p>The further enlargement now asked for by <lb/> Manitoba would add about
                     180,000 square miles <lb/> to the already large area of the province, and <lb/>
                     would be viewed with disfavour as well by the <lb/> old provinces as by the new
                     districts of Assini<lb break="no"/>boia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Athabaska,
                     <lb/> which have been created in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, and
                     which will ultimately become pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of the Dominion. It
                     would largely add <lb/> to the expense at the government, without in<lb break="no"/>creasing the resources of Manitoba, already <lb/> pronounced by the
                     government of the province <lb/> to be insufficient to meet its normal and
                     neces<lb break="no"/>sary expense. <lb/> </p>
                  <p>The committee, under these circumstances. <lb/> humbly submit to Your
                     Excellency, that it is <lb/> inexpedient to alter the boundaries of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince as prayed for. <lb/> </p>
               </quote>
               <p>This answer to the request of Manitoba <lb/> was a categorical refusal. I may say
                  that <lb/> there is an error in this Order in Council. <lb/> </p>
               <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1430</fw>
               <p>It states that the area of the province of <lb/> Manitoba at that time was
                  150,000 square <lb/> miles, whereas it was only 73,000. That, <lb/> however, is
                  not very material. But I want <lb/> to point out that the request of Manitoba
                  <lb/> now is one which could not be granted <lb/> except with great difficulty. It
                  would have <lb/> been far more easy for the government of <lb/> that day, twenty
                  years ago, to have ex<lb break="no"/>tended the limits of Manitoba than it would
                  <lb/> be to-day. At that time the Territories were <lb/> still in their infancy ;
                  but to-day they have <lb/> grown to manhood, and how can it be ex<lb break="no"/>pected that we shall take from them a por<lb break="no"/>tion of their territory
                  to give it to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba ? If this could not be done in 1884, I
                  <lb/> submit that there is still less reason for<lb/> doing it in 1905. <lb/> </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Might I ask the right <lb/> hon. gentleman if in
                  that calculation was <lb/> not included the disputed territory between <lb/>
                  Manitoba and Lake Superior? <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. No, I think <lb/> not. It was in
                  dispute at that very moment. <lb/> But even if it had been included, what <lb/>
                  would it have mattered ? We want to deal <lb/> as fairly as we can with Manitoba
                  and to <lb/> give it all the consideration which is due tom <lb/> her. But is
                  there a member of this House <lb/> who would advise us that we should carve <lb/>
                  out of the Territories which for thirty years <lb/> have been under the
                  jurisdiction of their <lb/> own legislature, which are to-day repre<lb break="no"/>sented by ten members in this House, any <lb/> portion of what belongs to them
                  and hand <lb/> it over to the province of Manitoba against <lb/> the consent of
                  the people of thos terri<lb break="no"/>tories? If they agreed to it, well and
                  good; <lb/> I would have nothing to say. But the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of
                  the Territories has more than once <lb/> declared that they would not under any
                  <lb/> circumstances consent to any portion of <lb/> their territory westward of
                  the province of <lb/> Manitoba being taken from them. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>There is another consideration. For my <lb/> part, I am prepared to give a full
                  hear<lb break="no"/>ing to the province of Manitoba. When <lb/> that province asks
                  to have her limits ex<lb break="no"/>tended westward, I am bound to say that <lb/>
                  We cannot entertain that prayer, for this <lb/> simple reason, that the
                  Territories, through <lb/> their legislature, have passed upon it and <lb/> have
                  pronounced against it. But I under<lb break="no"/>stand that as to a certain
                  portion of terri<lb break="no"/>tory north of Lake Winnipegosis and Lake <lb/>
                  Manitoba, the Northwest legislature has de<lb break="no"/>clared that it has no
                  pronounced views, and I <lb/> that that might be given to the province of <lb/>
                  Manitoba. But even this I am not prepared <lb/> for my part to grant at this
                  moment; be<lb break="no"/>cause members representing that section <lb/> to-day sit
                  on the floor of this House, and <lb/> they and their people have the right to be
                  <lb/> heard on that question; and if they do not <lb/> agree to it, I do not think
                  the parliament <lb/> of Canada should make the grant against <lb/> their wishes.

                  I think is en<lb break="no"/>titled to fair consideration. Manitoba has <lb/>
                  asked to have her territory extended to the <lb/> shores of Hudson's bay; and this
                  is a <lb/> prayer which seems to me to be entitled <lb/> to a fair hearing. The
                  province of Manitoba <lb/> is not, however, the only one whose terri<lb break="no"/>tory could be extended towards Hudson's <lb/> bay. The province of Ontario would
                  have <lb/> the same right; the province of Quebec <lb/> would also have that
                  right; and the new <lb/> province of Saskatchewan also. Therefore, <lb/> in the
                  project which we have to present to <lb/> the House to-day, instead of including
                  in <lb/> the province of Saskatchewan that portion <lb/> of territory lying north
                  of Lake Winnipeg <lb/> osis and Lake Manitoba, we propose to leave <lb/> that
                  outside, to be included neither in Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan nor in Manitoba,
                  but to be dealt <lb/> with at a future day. And I may say at <lb/> once, and I
                  have the authority of my col<lb break="no"/>leagues to make the announcement, that
                  we <lb/> propose to invite the province of Ontario, <lb/> the province of Quebec,
                  the province of <lb/> Manitoba and the province of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan to
                  meet us here to decide whether or <lb/> not it is advisable that the limits of any
                  <lb/> of these provinces should be extended to <lb/> the shores of Hudson's Bay,
                  and if so, in <lb/> What manner it should be done. We have <lb/> not considered
                  the matter yet, but perhaps <lb/> it may not be unadvisable even to consult <lb/>
                  the other provinces. I venture to think that <lb/> the proposal which I now make
                  to the <lb/> House with reference to the province of <lb/> Manitoba is a fair one,
                  which will commend <lb/> itself to the approval of all those who have <lb/> given
                  the matter fair and impartial con<lb break="no"/>sideration. <lb/> </p>
               <p>The new provinces shall, as a matter of <lb/> course, be represented on the floor
                  of this <lb/> House, and, until another election takes <lb/> place, they shall
                  continue to be represented <lb/> as they are today. There will be in each <lb/>
                  province a legislative assembly, of which <lb/> it is proposed that the number of
                  members <lb/> shall be twenty-five. <lb/> </p>
               <p>A question which has given some diffi<lb break="no"/>culty to the members of the
                  committee who <lb/> had the preparation of this Bill, has been <lb/> the selection
                  of the capitals of the respec<lb break="no"/>tive provinces. As to the capital of
                  the <lb/> province of Saskatchewan, the difficulty is <lb/> easily solved, it will
                  be, as it is at pre<lb break="no"/>sent, Regina. But as to the capital of <lb/>
                  Alberta. the selection was not so easy. <lb/> There were three claimants for
                  it—Calgary, <lb/> Red Deer and Edmonton, each of which <lb/> had a good claim. We
                  have decided that <lb/> we would not make any final selection, <lb/> leaving the
                  final selection to the province <lb/> itself. In the meantime, if you look at <lb/>
                  the map, you will see that Edmonton seems <lb/> to be the most central point, and
                  therefore <lb/> we propose to make Edmonton the capital <lb/> for the present.
                  <lb/> </p>
               <p>Beyond this, I have only to say that it is <lb/> the intention to have this Bill
                  come into <lb/> force on July 1 next. <lb/> </p>

               <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1432</fw>
               <p>The point being settled as to the number <lb/> of provinces to be admitted into
                  confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, the next question is that regarding <lb/> the
                  public lands. In whom should the own<lb break="no"/>ership of the lands be vested
                  ? Should they <lb/> belong to the provinces or to the Dominion? <lb/> A strong
                  plea was presented to us on behalf <lb/> provinces. It was represented that <lb/>
                  as a matter of law and of equity, the public <lb/> lands in these two provinces
                  should belong <lb/> to their governments. This plea was no <lb/> doubt suggested
                  by the fact that at the <lb/> time of confederation, all the parties to the <lb/>
                  original contract, that is to say, the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Nova Scotia,
                  New Brunswick, <lb/> Ontario and Quebec, each retained her own <lb/> lands ; and
                  when at a later day the province <lb/> of British Columbia was admitted to the
                  <lb/> Dominion, she also retained her lands. But, <lb/> Sir, the cases are not at
                  all parallel. When <lb/> the provinces which I have named came <lb/> into
                  confederation, they were already sov<lb break="no"/>ereignties. I use that term,
                  because bar<lb break="no"/>ring their dependence as colonies they were <lb/>
                  sovereignties in the sense of having the <lb/> management of their own affairs.
                  Each <lb/> had a department of government called the <lb/> Crown Lands Department,
                  which was en<lb break="no"/>trusted with the power of dealing with <lb/> those
                  lands, either for revenue or for settle<lb break="no"/>ment. But the case of these
                  new provin<lb break="no"/>ces is not at all similar. They never had <lb/> the
                  ownership of the lands. Those lands <lb/> were bought by the Dominion government,
                  <lb/> and they have remained ever since the pro<lb break="no"/>perty of the
                  Dominion government, and <lb/> have been administered by the Dominion <lb/>
                  government. Therefore I say the two cases <lb/> are not in any way parallel; they
                  are indeed <lb/> absolutely different. When the provinces <lb/> which I have named
                  came into confedera<lb break="no"/>tion they retained the ownership of their <lb/>
                  lands; but when the two new provinces <lb/> come into the Dominion, it cannot be
                  said <lb/> that they can retain the ownership of their <lb/> lands, as they never
                  had the ownership. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Therefore, the proposition that in equity <lb/> and justice these lands belong to
                  the prov<lb break="no"/>inces is not tenable. But for my part I <lb/> would not
                  care, in a question of this import<lb break="no"/>ance, to rest the case on a mere
                  abstract pro<lb break="no"/>position. We must view it from the <lb/> grounds of
                  policy; and from the highest <lb/> grounds of policy, I think it is advisable
                  <lb/> that the ownership of these lands should <lb/> continue to be vested in the
                  Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. We have precedents for this. This <lb/> is a
                  case in which we can go to the United <lb/> States for precedents. They are
                  situated <lb/> very much as we are regarding the owner<lb break="no"/>ship of
                  lands and the establishment of new <lb/> states. Whenever a new state has been
                  <lb/> created in the American Union, the Federal <lb/> government has always
                  retained the owner<lb break="no"/>ship and management of the public lands. <lb/>
                  And when we take the records of our own <lb/> country, we know that when Manitoba
                  was <lb/> brought into the Dominion, that province <lb/> was not given the
                  ownership of her lands, <lb/> <pb n="1433" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1433.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1433</fw> <fw type="dateline"> FEBRUARY 21. 1905</fw> 
                  but it remained in the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment. True it is that
                  Manitoba made <lb/> several efforts to acquire the ownership of <lb/> the lands
                  within her boundaries. She ap<lb break="no"/>plied more than once to the
                  successive gov<lb break="no"/>ernments of the Dominion, but her applica<lb break="no"/>tion was always met in the same way. It <lb/> was always met by the
                  statement that it <lb/> was impossible to grant her request. The <lb/> matter was
                  finally closed in 1884 when the <lb/> government of Sir John Macdonald, which
                  <lb/> had been approached on the subject, gave <lb/> very forcibly and clearly the
                  reasons why <lb/> the prayer of that province could not be <lb/> entertained. I
                  may be allowed to quote to <lb/> the House the language used by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Sir John Macdonald on the <lb/> occasion. It will be found
                  in an Order in <lb/> Council of the 30th May, 1884 :-<lb/> </p>

                  <p>The success of the undertakings by the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government in

                     lands. Combined with a great expenditure in <lb/> organizing and maintaining an
                     immigration ser<lb break="no"/>vice abroad and at home, parliament pledged
                     <lb/> its faith to the world that a large portion of <lb/> those lands should
                     be set apart for free home<lb break="no"/>steads to all coming settlers, and

                     from the province <lb/> the most ample securities that this pledged <lb/>
                     policy shall be maintained ; hence in so far as <lb/> the free lands extend

                  <p>The great attraction which the Canadian gov<lb break="no"/>ernment now offers,
                     the impressive fact to the <lb/> mind of the men contemplating immigration is
                     <lb/> that a well known and recognized government <lb/> holds unfettered in its
                     own hand the lands <lb/> which it offers free, and that that government <lb/>
                     has its agencies and organizations for directing. <lb/> receiving, transporting
                     and placing the immi<lb break="no"/>grant upon the homestead which he may

                     and to be of advantage <lb/> to Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, your

                     Territory, all the lands within their <lb/> boundaries, then they would advise
                     that the <lb/> provinces holding the lands should conduct their<lb/> own

               <p>These reasons, strong and forcible as they <lb/> were in 1884, are even stronger
                  and more <lb/> forcible in 1905, because the current of im<lb break="no"/>migration is now flowing, into these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories in an
                  unprecedented volume, on <lb/> we are therefore compelled to say to the <lb/> new
                  provinces that we must continue the <lb/> policy of retaining the ownership and
                  con<lb break="no"/>trol of the lands in our own hands. It is <lb/> <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1434</fw>
                  conceivable that if these lands were given to <lb/> the new previnces, the policy
                  of either one <lb/> of them might differ from ours and clash <lb/> with our
                  efforts to increase immigration. It <lb/> might possibly render these efforts
                  nuga<lb break="no"/>tory. For instance, if either of the new <lb/> provinces,
                  under the strain of financial dif<lb break="no"/>ficulty, were to abolish the free
                  homesteads, <lb/> which have proved so beneficial and so great <lb/> an inducement
                  to immigration, one can <lb/> readily understand what a great blow that <lb/>
                  would be to our immigration policy. Or if <lb/> the price of government lands for
                  sale were <lb/> to be increased over the present very moder<lb break="no"/>ate
                  rate, that would also be another blow <lb/> to that policy. But I frankly admit,
                  and <lb/> we must all recognize, that the provinces in <lb/> the west, in being
                  deprived of the public <lb/> lands. are deprived of a valuable source of <lb/>
                  income. And in that way they complain <lb/> that they are put on a footing of
                  inequality <lb/> as compared with the older provinces of the <lb/> Dominion.
                  Realizing that fact, it is the <lb/> duty of parliament to make ample, even gen<lb break="no"/>erous, provision which will compensate the <lb/> provinces for the
                  retention of the lands <lb/> by the Federal government, and I believe <lb/> that
                  in makng this provision we shall have <lb/> the full support of hon. members
                  whether <lb/> on one side or on the other. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Now I come to the financial terms which <lb/> should be given to the new
                  provinces. Our <lb/> constitution, which is to be found in the <lb/> British North
                  America Act, contains a very <lb/> remarkable provision. It contains the pro<lb break="no"/>vision that out of the Federal treasury <lb/> there shall be paid to
                  the provinces <lb/> a large amount of money in the shape <lb/> of subsidies to
                  assist them in carrying on <lb/> their business. This, I say, is a very extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary provision. It is, I believe. unique. <lb/> At all events, so
                  far as my information goes, <lb/> I do not know that any similar provision is
                  <lb/> to be found in the constitution of any other <lb/> federal government. It is
                  a sound principle <lb/> of finance, and a still sounder principle of <lb/>
                  government, that those who have the duty <lb/> of expending the revenue of a
                  country <lb/> should also be saddled with the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility of
                  levying and providing it. That <lb/> principle has been departed from in our <lb/>
                  case, and no doubt was departed from with <lb/> some object. What can have been
                  the rea<lb break="no"/>sons which induced the fathers of confed<lb break="no"/>eration in 1867 to depart from so obvious a <lb/> principle of finance and
                  government. The <lb/> reasons are simply these. Confederation <lb/> was the result
                  of several compromises. It <lb/> would have been impossible to establish it <lb/>
                  if there had not been a policy of give and <lb/> take adopted among all the
                  constituent <lb/> bodies. And I am quite sure, I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing
                  absolute historical truth when I say <lb/> that neither Nova Scotia, New
                  Brunswick, <lb/> Ontario nor Quebec would ever have con<lb break="no"/>sented to
                  part with their revenues, to give <lb/> up their powers of taxation in customs and
                  <lb/> excise. if they had not been promised that <lb/> out of the federal revenues
                  they would be <lb/> <pb n="1435" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1435.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1435</fw>   allowed a certain
                  sum every year to defray <lb/> the expenses of their own local govern<lb break="no"/>ments and administrations. This is the <lb/> reason why this provision
                  is to be found <lb/> in the British North America Act. It is <lb/> there. I do not
                  think it is sound, but <lb/> though in my judgment unsound, it is the <lb/> duty
                  of everybody in this House and in this <lb/> country to take confederation as we
                  find <lb/> it, with its good points and its blemishes, <lb/> and carry it to the
                  end on the principle <lb/> upon which it was established. Therefore <lb/> upon
                  this point I believe it is the duty of <lb/> the Canadian parliament to continue
                  that <lb/> policy in this instance and make a liberal <lb/> provision for these
                  two new provinces <lb/> which we are about to admit into the Can<lb break="no"/>adian family. <lb/> </p>
               <p>But before I come to the revenue to be <lb/> given these provinces, it will
                  perhaps be <lb/> preferable that I should give an idea of <lb/> their present
                  requirements. Last year there <lb/> was expended out of appropriations by this
                  <lb/> parliament for the use of the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature and by the
                  local legislature itself. <lb/> </p>

               <p>Now, the House has observed that in <lb/> clause 118 of the British North America
                  Act, <lb/> which I have just read. the capitation allow<lb break="no"/>ance of the
                  provinces of Nova Scotia and <lb/> New Brunswick was fixed at a maximum <lb/> <pb n="1437" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1437.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1437</fw> <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 21. 1905</fw>  of 400,000 population. This rule was applied <lb/> also to Manitoba and
                  British Columbia. The <lb/> reason why the maximum was fixed at 400,<lb break="no"/>000 population is not very apparent, but I <lb/> imagine that it was supposed at
                  that time <lb/> that the population of these provlnces was <lb/> not likely to
                  reach a very much higher figure <lb/> than 400,000. And this calculation has pro<lb break="no"/>ven true. It took years for Nova Scotia to <lb/> reach that maximum;
                  New Brunswick has <lb/> not reached it yet, nor has Manitoba nor <lb/> British
                  Columbia. But it would be mani<lb break="no"/>festly unfair to these new provinces
                  to limit <lb/> their maximum to 400,000. Already the <lb/> population is about
                  250,000. Therefore, in<lb break="no"/>stead of fixing the maximum at 400,000 <lb/>
                  population. we have fixed it at 800,000. <lb/> </p>
               <p>A more important allowance is the allow<lb break="no"/>ance for debt. And this is
                  what we propose: <lb/> </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Inasmuch as the province is not in debt, the
                  <lb/> said province should be entitled to be paid <lb/> and to receive from the
                  government of Canada <lb/> by half-yearly instalments, interest at the rate <lb/>
                  of 5 per cent on the sum of $8,107,500. <lb/> </quote>
               <p>The reason of this is familiar to every<lb break="no"/>body, but perhaps, it is
                  not unimportant <lb/> that I should review it here, and present it <lb/> again to
                  the House. In 1867, when con<lb break="no"/>federation was established the debts
                  of the <lb/> provinces were assumed by the Dominion<lb break="no"/>the debts of
                  Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia <lb/> and New Brunswick. Now, the debt at that <lb/>
                  time of Old Canada, that is the provinces of <lb/> Ontario and Quebec. amounted to
                  $67,000,<lb break="no"/>000 in round numbers. The debt of New <lb/> Brunswick was
                  about $7,000.000 and that of <lb/> Nova Scotia about $8,000,000. It so hap<lb break="no"/>pened that the debt of New Brunswick rep<lb break="no"/>resented an
                  average of about $25 per head of <lb/> the population. and the debt of Nova Scotia
                  <lb/> of about $8.000,000 was nearly the same per <lb/> head of her population.
                  The debt of Old <lb/> Canada was a little greater per head. There<lb break="no"/>fore, when allowance was made for the <lb/> debts of the provinces, the debt of
                  Ontario <lb/> and Quebec was taken not at $67,000,000, <lb/> but at $02,000.00.
                  That is, Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec were each relieved of about
                  $31,000,000, <lb/> Nova Scotia of $8,000,000. and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick of
                  $7,000,000. The provinces of Nova <lb/> Scotia and New Brunswick entered con<lb break="no"/>federation without debt, while Ontario and <lb/> Quebec had between
                  them a debt of about <lb/> $5,000,000. Later on. new arrangements <lb/> were made.
                  new debts of the provinces were <lb/> assumed by the Dominion, and the provinces
                  <lb/> were freed from such liabilities. By this <lb/> means the capitation
                  allowance for debt was <lb/> increased from $25 to $32.43 per head. This <lb/> is
                  the last allowance that was made for <lb/> debt, and, if I remember well this was
                  made <lb/> by statute passed in 1884 or 1885. There<lb break="no"/>fore, we make
                  this allowance of $34.43 per <lb/> head to these new provinces. They have a <lb/>
                  population of 250.000 souls each. This <lb/> makes a total of $8,107,500. <lb/> </p>

               <p>Now, this Act is not to come into force <lb/> until the 1st of July, and we
                  estimate that <lb/> by the 1st of July the population will have <lb/> increased to
                  500,000 souls. This is the basis <lb/> of our calculation. Now, I said a moment
                  <lb/> ago, and the House seemed to agree with <lb/> me, that as we retain the
                  lands in our own <lb/> hands, it is natural and to he expected that <lb/>
                  government and parliament would be liberal <lb/> in their allowance to the new
                  provinces for <lb/> compensation in that respect. Manitoba. <lb/> which has an
                  area of 73.000 square miles, <lb/> received as compensation for her lands some
                  <lb/> fifteen or twenty years ago an annual grant <lb/> of $100,000. Apart from
                  that, Manitoba has <lb/> <pb n="1439" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1439.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1439</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>  received the
                  swamp lands. The swamp <lb/> lands are perhaps the most valuable lands <lb/> in
                  the province of Manitoba. They require <lb/> some preliminary work for drainage,
                  but <lb/> when drained there are no better lands in <lb/> the Whole province. When
                  the late govern<lb break="no"/>ment gave to the province of Manitoba the <lb/>
                  swamp lands, they made her a valuable <lb/> gift, and it has proved to her a most
                  im<lb break="no"/>portant asset. But the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories
                  have no swamp lands, we could not <lb/> do for them what the government did for
                  <lb/> the province of Manitoba. We have, there<lb break="no"/>fore, made the
                  following arrangement, <lb/> which we commend to the favourable con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the House: <lb/> </p>

                  <p>As the public lands in the said provinces are <lb/> to remain the property of

                     estimated value of such lands, <lb/> (namely, $37,500,000) : the same being
                     assumed <lb/> to be of an area of 25,000,000 acres and to be of <lb/> the value
                     of $1.50 per acre, and upon the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the said
                     provinces as from time to <lb/> time ascertained by the quinquennial census
                     <lb/> thereof, such sum to he arrived at as follows:— <lb/> </p>
                  <p>The population of the said provinces being <lb/> assumed to be at present
                     250,000, the sum pay<lb break="no"/>able until such population reaches 400,000
                     is to <lb/> be one per cent on such estimated value, or <lb/> $375,000. <lb/> </p>
                  <p>Thereafter until such population reaches 800,<lb break="no"/>000, the sum
                     payable is to be one and one—half <lb/> per cent on such estimated value, or
                     $562,500. <lb/> </p>
                  <p>Thereafter until such population reaches <lb/> 1,200,000, the sum payable is

                  <p>And thereafter such payment is to be three <lb/> per cent on such estimated

                  <p>In additional compensation for such lands, <lb/> there shall be paid by Canada

               <p>Let me now recapitulate to see the mini<lb break="no"/>mum each province is to
                  receive. At pre<lb break="no"/>sent, this year, the province is to receive <lb/>
                  for civil government $50,000; for capita<lb break="no"/>tion allowance, $200,000,
                  which is going to <lb/> increase until the population has reached <lb/> 800,000
                  souls. It will receive for debt al<lb break="no"/>lowance $405,375, and this year
                  it will re<lb break="no"/>ceive also for land compensation $375,000; <lb/> total,
                  $1,030,375, to which sum must be <lb/> added, for five years, $62,500, in order to
                  <lb/> allow the province to provide for her build<lb break="no"/>ings and public
                  works generally. <lb/> </p>
               <p>This is the minimum which will be paidI <lb/> to the province. The only thing new
                  <lb/> in these arrangements is in respect to the <lb/> lands. The maximum which
                  will be paid <lb/> to the province at any time when the popu<lb break="no"/>lation
                  shall have reached 1,200,000 souls is <lb/> $1,125,000; that is to say, we pay to
                  each <lb/> of these provinces the maximum sum of <lb/> 51.125.000 as compensation
                  for the lands <lb/> which We retain in our possession. I sub<lb break="no"/>mit to
                  the House that this is a very fair, a <lb/> very moderate and very equitable
                  adjust<lb break="no"/>ment indeed; at all events, I so present it <lb/>

                  reaches the number of 1,200,000. The total <lb/> annual payments of all kinds
                  reach their <lb/> maximum when the population reaches the <lb/> number of
                  1,200,000, that is, including both <lb/> the per capita allowance and the

               <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. The per capita <lb/> allowance will be

               <p>Now, Sir, it is my duty to advert to a <lb/> special feature of this Bill, a
                  feature which <lb/> I wish we could have averted, and which <lb/> we introduced
                  with great respect. The <lb/> special clause which I now call the attention <lb/>
                  of the House to is as follows :-<lb/> </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">The territory comprised in the said province <lb/>

               <p>It is within the memory of the House, I <lb/> have no doubt, that the contract
                  which was <lb/> made with the Canadian Pacific Railway <lb/> contained a most
                  extraordinary provision. <lb/> It was the 16th section: <lb/> </p>
               <quote> The Canadian Pacific Railway and all stations <lb/> and station grounds,

                  <lb/> </quote>
               <p>Thus it happens that in 1881 the then par<lb break="no"/>liament deliberately
                  gave to the Canadian <lb/> Pacific Railway Company, which it was in<lb break="no"/>corporating, an absolute exemption from <lb/> federal, provincial and municipal
                  taxation. <lb/> It was an extraordinary contract, but the <lb/> fact stares us in
                  the face, and it is in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with British precedent and
                  British <lb/> policy that contracts have to be executed <lb/> whether they are
                  good or bad, whether they <lb/> are advantageous or disadvantageous. In <lb/> 1884
                  or 1885, when the limits of the province <lb/> of Manitoba were extended westward,
                  a <lb/> similar provision was introduced into the <lb/> Act of that time to exempt
                  the company <lb/> from taxation by that province in the terri<lb break="no"/>tory
                  thus added to her limits. We have to do <lb/> the same thing to-day. It is a most
                  lament<lb break="no"/>able condition of things, but all I have to say <lb/> to the
                  provinces, is that they have to abide <lb/> <pb n="1441" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1441.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1441</fw> <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 21. 1905</fw>  by
                  the conditions which exist. In this re<lb break="no"/>spect, however, they are in
                  no worse position <lb/> than the Dominion government itself. We <lb/> stand
                  to-day, to use a common phrase in the <lb/> same box. If the Minister of Finance
                  were <lb/> to introduce a budget wherein he thought it <lb/> advantageous for the
                  Dominion of Canada <lb/> to impose taxation upon big corporations, <lb/> upon the
                  Grand Trunk Railway Company, <lb/> upon the Bank of Montreal, upon all the <lb/>
                  other banks and corporations we could do <lb/> so, but we could not lay a farthing
                  of taxa<lb break="no"/>tion on the Canadian Pacific Railway Com<lb break="no"/>pany. That is the result of the condition <lb/> of things which was enacted by
                  this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment twenty-four years ago. At that time <lb/> the
                  opposition led by Mr. Blake protested <lb/> vigorously against that provision. Mr.
                  Charl<lb break="no"/>ton moved the following amendment :-<lb/> </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">That the contract respecting the Canadian <lb/>
                  Pacific Railway exempts perpetually the railway <lb/> and all stations and station
                  grounds, workshops, <lb/> buildings, yards and other property, rolling <lb/> stock

                  substance a gift from the public; <lb/> and its exemption from taxation is unjust,
                  cre<lb break="no"/>ates an unfair incidence of taxation, and gives <lb/> an undue
                  advantage to the company over other <lb/> railway companies, calculated to prevent
                  the <lb/> construction of competing lines, and the con<lb break="no"/>tract is, in
                  this respect, objectionable. <lb/> </quote>
               <p>Unfortunately this amendment was de<lb break="no"/>feated and that clause of the
                  contract was <lb/> carried into effect. We have to deal with <lb/> it to-day as we
                  find it and the provinces as <lb/> well as the Dominion have to abide by it. <lb/>
                  All I can say at this moment is that if our <lb/> eflorts and their efforts could
                  rid the new <lb/> provinces of this incubus, we would be only <lb/> 100 glad to
                  give them all the help and assist<lb break="no"/>ance in our power, but it is not
                  possible to <lb/> do so, except by some method that I am not <lb/> able at the
                  present time to find out. It <lb/> might be by the way of legislation, it might
                  <lb/> be through a mutual agreement, or by expro<lb break="no"/>priation. There
                  are some of these methods <lb/> perhaps open to us, but I have only to say <lb/>
                  at this moment, that, regrettable as it is, <lb/> the Dominion and the provinces
                  the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and the Dominion must abide by it <lb/> loyally
                  until such time as it may be possible <lb/> to find a remedy. That is all I have to
                  say <lb/> upon the financial clauses of the contract. <lb/> </p>
               <p>I now come to the question of education, <lb/> and this question is perhaps under
                     exist<lb break="no"/>ing circumstances the most important of all <lb/> that we
                  have to deal with There are evi<lb break="no"/>dences not a few coming to us from
                  all dir<lb break="no"/>ections, that the old passions which such a <lb/> subject
                  has always aroused are not, unfor<lb break="no"/>tunately, buried ; indeed,
                  already, before <lb/> the policy of the government has been <lb/> known, before
                  the subject is fairly before <lb/> the people the government has been warned <lb/>
                  as to its duty in this matter, and not only <lb/>
                  <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1442</fw> warned but threatened as well. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment has been
                  warned, threatened from both <lb/> sides of this question, from those who believe
                  <lb/> in separate schools and from those who op<lb break="no"/>pose separate
                  schools. These violent appeals <lb/> are not a surprise to me, at all events, nor
                  <lb/>do I believe they are a surprise to anybody. <lb/> We have known by the
                  experience of the <lb/> past, Within the short life of this confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, that public opinion is always inflam<lb break="no"/>mable
                  whenever questions arise which <lb/> ever so remotely touch upon the religious
                  <lb/> convictions of the people. It behooves <lb/> us therefore all the more at
                  this solemn <lb/> moment to approach this subject with care, <lb/> with calmness
                  and deliberation and with the <lb/> firm purpose of dealing with it not only in
                  <lb/> accordance with the inherent principles of <lb/> abstract justice, but in
                  accordance with the <lb/> spirit—the Canadian spirit of tolerance and <lb/>
                  charity, this Canadian spirit of tolerance <lb/> and charity of which
                  confederation is the <lb/> essence and of which in practice it ought to <lb/> be
                  the expression and embodiment. Before I <lb/> proceed further, before I pass the
                  threshold <lb/> of this question. I put at once this inquiry to <lb/> the House:
                  What are separate schools ? <lb/> What is the meaning of the term ? Whence <lb/>
                  does it come, what was its origin and what <lb/> was its object? Perhaps somebody
                  will <lb/> say: What is the use of discussing such <lb/> a question ? The term
                  separate schools ought <lb/> to be familiar to every one. Sir, if any one <lb/>
                  were to make such an observation and to <lb/> interpose such an objection, I would
                  tell <lb/> him that never was objection taken with <lb/> less ground. Mankind is
                  ever the same. <lb/> New problems and new complications will <lb/> always arise,
                  but new problems and com<lb break="no"/>plications, when they do arise, always
                     re<lb break="no"/>volve within the same well beaten circle of <lb/> man's
                  passions, man's prejudices and man's <lb/> selfishness. History therefore should
                  be a <lb/> safe guide, and it is generally by appealing <lb/> to the pastm by
                  investigating the problems <lb/> with which our fathers had to deal, that <lb/> we
                  may find the solutions of the complica<lb break="no"/>tions that face us. If we
                  look back to the<lb/> history of our own country, if we find what <lb/> is the
                  origin of the separate schools, perhaps <lb/> history may be the pillar of cloud
                  by day <lb/> and the pillar of fire by night to show us <lb/> the way and give us
                  the light. <lb/></p>
               <p>Separate schools, Sir, go back to the old <lb/> days of the legislature of Lower
                  Canada. <lb/> In these old days the system of schools in <lb/> my province, in my
                  native province, was <lb/> rudimentary; there was practically no sys<lb break="no"/>tem, but from year to year allowances were <lb/> made by the legislature for the
                  support <lb/> and maintenance of schools. I need not <lb/> say that the population
                  within the limits of <lb/> the province of Lower Canada at that time <lb/> was, as
                  it is to-day, divided in origin and <lb/> in creed; it was largely Roman Catholic
                  <lb/> with a small Protestant minority. I am <lb/> glad to say, and perhaps it
                  would be per<lb break="no"/>mitted if, in this matter, being myself a <lb/> son of
                  the province of Quebec I indulged in <lb/> <pb n="1443" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1443.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1443</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>  what may be
                  not altogether unpardonable <lb/> pride when I say, that I am not aware that <lb/>
                  the Protestant minority ever had any cause <lb/> of complaint of the treatment
                  they had re<lb break="no"/>ceived at the hands of the majority. One <lb/> of the

                  <lb/> Macdonald at the time of confederation, <lb/> Sir John Rose, bore ample
                  testimony to <lb/> what I have now stated. This is what he <lb/> said speaking in

               <p>In 1863 a law was passed upon this same <lb/> subject and that was the last
                  passed on the <lb/> subject by the old legislature of Canada <lb/> before
                  confederation, not to enact a new <lb/> principle but simply to confirm the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of separate schools. I remember very <lb/> well—I was a young
                  man in those days, a <lb/> law student in Montreal—that the discussion <lb/> of
                  that law created a great deal of passion, <lb/> but it was passed by an
                  overwhelming ma<lb break="no"/>jority in the parliament of Canada. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Before I proceed, let me make a few ob<lb break="no"/>servations to show the
                  origin and object of <lb/> all this legislation concerning separate <lb/> schools.
                  You find in this legislation the <lb/> terms constantly recurring of Protestant
                  <lb/> or Catholic. I need not say that the Chris<lb break="no"/>tian religion is
                  not only a religion <lb/> founded on moral laws, prescribing moral <lb/> duties.
                  but it is also a religion of dogmas. <lb/> Dogmas from the earliest times have
                  occu<lb break="no"/>pied just as strong and commanding a posi<lb break="no"/>tion
                  in the faith of all Christians as morals <lb/> themselves. The reformation created
                  a <lb/> cleavage between Christians. The old <lb/> section remained Roman
                  Catholics ; the new <lb/> called themselves Protestants. Between the <lb/> Roman
                  Catholics and Protestants there is a <lb/> deep divergence in dogmas. Between the
                  <lb/> various Protestant denominations there are <lb/> but small differences in
                  dogmas : the differ<lb break="no"/>ences are more matters of discipline than of
                  <lb/> dogma. Therefore the old legislature of <lb/> Canada, finding a population of
                  Catholics <lb/> and different denominations of Protestants <lb/> all mixed
                  together. finding only one cause of <lb/> cleavage between them in Christian faith.
                  <lb/> that is dogmas, allowed religious teaching <lb/> to be had in all the
                  schools of our country. <lb/> so that every man could give to his own <lb/> child
                  the religious tenets which he held <lb/> sometimes dearer than life. That is the
                  <lb/> whole meaning of separate schools. <lb/> </p>
               <p>I have just stated that in 1863 a law was <lb/> passed on this subject. At that
                  time, in 1863, <lb/> there were two men in Canada who each <lb/> within his own
                  circle and his own party, <lb/> maintained a sovereign sway. One was Mr. <lb/>
                  Macdonald, now known to history as Sir <lb/> John Macdonald, and the other was Mr.
                  <lb/> George Brown. Mr. Macdonald was a sup<lb break="no"/>porter of separate
                  schools. He gave to <lb/> the law of 1863 his vote and his influence. <lb/> Mr.
                  George BroWn, on the contrary, was <lb/> a most determined opponent of separate
                  <lb/> schools. He attacked the system relentless<lb break="no"/><pb n="1445" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1445.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1445</fw> <fw type="dateline">FEBRUARY 21, 1905</fw> ly ;
                  he attacked it in his paper, on the floor <lb/> of the House of Commons and upon
                  the <lb/> hustings. He attacked it with all the ve<lb break="no"/>hemence of his
                  strongly impassioned <lb/> nature. The arguments we hear today <lb/> against
                  separate schools are not new ; they <lb/> were heard 50 years ago. The arguments
                  <lb/> we hear to-day are but the attenuated echo <lb/> of the strong denunciations
                  of Mr. Brown, <lb/> which were heard by our fathers two gen<lb break="no"/>erations ago. But the views of Mr. Brown <lb/> did not prevail, and
                  notwithstanding his <lb/> efforts, he was not in the House when <lb/> the law of
                  1863 passed, which confirmed to <lb/> the Roman Catholic minority of Upper Cana<lb break="no"/>ada the privilege of separate schools. In <lb/> View of the agitation then
                  maintained by <lb/> Mr. Brown in favour of representation by <lb/> population, it
                  is perhaps not inopportune to <lb/> analyse that vote. The Bill of 1863 in <lb/>
                  favour of separate schools was carried by <lb/> a vote of 80 against a minority of
                  22. Of <lb/> this minority of 22, 21 belonged to the <lb/> province of Upper
                  Canada, and of the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 80. 33 belonged to that province,
                  <lb/> so that, leaving the vote of Lower Canada <lb/> aside, taking only the vote
                  of Upper Canada, <lb/> we find that the law of 1863 was carried by <lb/> a majority
                  of the representatives of Upper <lb/> Canada at that time. This is significant.
                  <lb/> Mr. Brown at that time was carrying on the <lb/> strong agitation which he
                  had maintained <lb/> for years, and which he continued to main<lb break="no"/>tain
                  in favour, within the constitution of <lb/> that day, of representation by
                  population. <lb/></p>
               <p>Sir, if we review the events of that period <lb/> of our history, we must all
                  admit that the <lb/> constitution of 1841, which united Upper <lb/> Canada and
                  Lower Canada, was radically <lb/> faulty. It was so constructed that it, never
                  <lb/> gave satisfaction to either province. Lower <lb/> Canada from the first
                  looked upon it as an <lb/> instrument of oppression, designed to de <lb/> piive
                  her of some of those institutions whim <lb/> she held dearer than life. Yet she it
                  was <lb/> who in after years held to that constitution, <lb/> and defended it
                  against reforms which she <lb/> regarded as fraught with still greater dan<lb break="no"/>gers to herself. Upper Canada accepted <lb/> that constitution, not
                  with any enthusiasm. <lb/> but because it relieved her for the time <lb/> from
                  serious financial embarrassments. But <lb/> Upper Canada, before many years had
                  <lb/> elapsed commenced also to find herself op<lb break="no"/>pressed by the
                  clumsy clauses which it con<lb break="no"/>tained, and sought relief in the
                  agita<lb break="no"/>tion of Mr. Brown in favour of represen<lb break="no"/>tation
                  by population. The radical fault of <lb/> the constitution of 1841 was that it
                  <lb/> was neither federative nor legislative. It <lb/> united two provinces, but
                  kept them as sep<lb break="no"/>arate entities, gave them the same number <lb/> of
                  members, provided against an increase <lb/> of representation, and allowed only a
                  <lb/> single executive. This equality in repre<lb break="no"/>sentation coupled
                  with a single executive <lb/> was a defect which no expedients thereafter <lb/>
                  could altogether overcome. As soon as Mr. <lb/> <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1446</fw> Papineau had returned from
                  exile, he <lb/> attacked that feature of the constitution. <lb/> and demanded its
                  repeal. He was op. <lb/> posed by Mr. Lafontaine, not on principle. <lb/> but
                  simply from expediency. Mr. Lafon<lb break="no"/>taine represented to him that
                  Upper Canada <lb/> would grow in population faster than Lower <lb/> Canada,
                  because as Upper Canada was get<lb break="no"/>ting an immigration which Lower
                  Canada <lb/> did not, Upper Canada would soon be the <lb/> stronger province and
                  therefore all the ar<lb break="no"/>guments which Mr. Papineau advanced for <lb/>
                  the repeal of that portion of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion on behalf of Lower
                  Canada, would react <lb/> against her. The predictions of Mr. Lafon<lb break="no"/>taine as to the movement of popula<lb break="no"/>tion were soon fulfilled.
                  Upper Canada be<lb break="no"/>came the more populous province. Then Mr. <lb/>
                  Brown took up the agitation where Mr. Pa<lb break="no"/>pineau had left it, and
                  carried it on for <lb/> years, with never abating vigour. He opened <lb/> a
                  current in the public opinion of Upper <lb/> Canada, which yearly increased in
                  volume <lb/> until it became well nigh irresistible ; <lb/> successive and
                  short-lived administra<lb break="no"/>tions succeeded one another, and the <lb/>
                  day came in 1864 when there were two <lb/> hostile majorities. one from Lower
                  Canada <lb/> and one from Upper Canada, facing each <lb/> other and unyielding.
                  There was a dead<lb break="no"/>lock, and the government of the Queen <lb/> was
                  almost impossible if not actually im<lb break="no"/>possible in the province of
                  Canada. That <lb/> was Mr. Brown's opportunity, and he seized <lb/> it. it must be
                  said, with alertness and cour<lb break="no"/>age; and whoever has to speak of
                  those <lb/> events must admit that on that occasion Mr. <lb/> Brown rose to the
                  highest stature of states<lb break="no"/>manship. He was not satisfied to take
                  <lb/> advantage of the occasion simply to obtain <lb/> the realization of the
                  principle which he had <lb/> at heart, but he made it the basis for a union <lb/>
                  of all the British provinces on the conti<lb break="no"/>nent of America. That is
                  his glory, and <lb/> that is his chief title to fame—every Can<lb break="no"/>adian acknowledges it. But, Sir, the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties of the task
                  were simply enormous, <lb/> greater in my judgment. at all events, than <lb/> the
                  difficulties which arose in connection <lb/> with the creation of the American
                  union. <lb/> History has recorded how jealously, how <lb/> tenacionsiy. the
                  thirteen colonies, after <lb/> their joint efforts had wrought their inde<lb break="no"/>pendence, each clung to its own individual <lb/> life. History has
                  recorded how reluctantly <lb/> each of the thirteen colonies at last consent<lb break="no"/>ed to part with those powers, the concession <lb/> of which wal
                  necessary to form a strong <lb/> central government. The incentive which <lb/>
                  proved effective, and which forced a final <lb/> consent, was the memory of dangers
                  <lb/> which they had recently shared together, and <lb/> the necessity of guarding
                  against a possible <lb/> recurrence of such dangers. No such sen<lb break="no"/>timent abode in the Canadian colonies. <lb/> The various Canadian colonies were
                  iso<lb break="no"/>lated from one another—isolated by dis<lb break="no"/>tances
                  and by racial distinctions. The two <lb/> groups which were ethnically connected,
                  <lb/> <pb n="1447" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1447.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1447</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
                  Ontario and maritime provinces, were sep<lb break="no"/>arated by long distances.
                  The two groups <lb/> which were geographically united, Ontario <lb/> and Quebec,
                  were separated by the deeper <lb/> cleavage of difference of origin. In all <lb/>
                  there was a strong sense of local <lb/> pride, in all there was a strong assertion
                  <lb/> of self interest, and in all there were <lb/> peculiar institutions as to
                  the security of <lb/> which all dreaded to be launched into the <lb/> unknown.
                  This was particularly true of ed<lb break="no"/>ucation in Lower Canada and in
                  Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada. In Lower Canada the Protestant min<lb break="no"/>ority had long enjoyed their own system of <lb/> separate schools. In Upper
                  Canada the Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic minority had just secured a <lb/>
                  similar system. These two minorities feared <lb/> that in the new constitution,
                  under the sepa<lb break="no"/>ration of legislative powers which must <lb/> ensue,
                  the rights of each might be put in <lb/> jeopardy by a hostile majority. The
                  min<lb break="no"/>ority of Lower Canada felt perfectly secure <lb/> under the
                  then existing condition of things <lb/> because those of their own creed and race
                  <lb/> were in the majority in United Canada. <lb/> The Roman Catholic minority in
                  Upper <lb/> Canada feared also the constitution because <lb/> it would be deprived
                  of the powerful alli<lb break="no"/>ance of those of their own origin in another
                  <lb/> province. Under such circumstances, what <lb/> was to be done? How could a
                  scheme of <lb/> confederation be devised so as to ensure <lb/> the support of all
                  parties and sections of <lb/> the community ? It is useless to speculate <lb/> as
                  to what might have been done. It is <lb/> sufficient to say that means were found
                  to <lb/> insure to the minority in each province, the <lb/> free exercise of its
                  rights, and that means <lb/> was to declare that in the provinces of <lb/> Upper
                  and Lower Canada. the rights of the <lb/> minority. which were to be entrusted to
                  <lb/> the respective legislatures of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. were to be
                  above the control of the <lb/> majority. Let me recall to the House the <lb/>
                  Quebec resolutions which were adopted and <lb/> which were the basis and the
                  charter under <lb/> which the Canadian parliament now lives <lb/> and the Canadian
                  nation has been formed. <lb/> Section 93 of the Quebec resolutions states <lb/> as

                  But when we come to the provinces <lb/> of Ontario and Quebec, we find that the
                  <lb/> powers of these two provinces are limited <lb/> as regards education.
                  Neither the legislature <lb/> of Ontario nor that of Quebec was given <lb/> power
                  to pass any law which might preju<lb break="no"/>dicially affect the rights of the
                  minority in <lb/> either province. So long as this constitution <lb/> endures the
                  schools of the minority in Quebec <lb/> and Ontario must likewise endure. Yet,
                  re<lb break="no"/>markable as is this enactment. it is per<lb break="no"/>haps
                  still more remarkable, if we remember <lb/> that one of the men who assented to
                  this <lb/> limitation to the power of the province of <lb/> Ontario was Mr. George
                  Brown himself-<lb/> Mr. George Brown who said again and <lb/> again that he was
                  opposed to separate <lb/> schools. who had carried on a crusade of <lb/> years
                  against separate schools in his pro<lb break="no"/>vince. If you look only at the
                  surface of <lb/> things. without trying to find the inspiration, <lb/> it is indeed
                  remarkable that Mr. Brown. <lb/> who, with Sir John Macdonald was the <lb/>
                  central figure. agreed that the powers of the <lb/> legislature of his own
                  province should be <lb/> limited in that respect. We need not marvel <lb/> if Mr.
                  Brown was attacked and assailed for <lb/> the action he then took. He was assailed
                  <lb/> perhaps by some of his own disciples whom <lb/> he had taught to object to
                  separate schools <lb/> as strongly as he did himself. Mr. Brown <lb/> defended his
                  course in the confederation de<lb break="no"/>bate. or rather he explained his
                  policy, be<lb break="no"/>cause he was under no necessity to defend <lb/> his
                  course: and I beg on this occasion to <lb/> commend his language to those who
                  to-day <lb/> have forgotten confederation, when he came <lb/> to discuss the 43rd

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
                  <p>I need hardly remind the House that I have <lb/> always opposed and continue to
                     oppose the sys<lb break="no"/>tem of sectarian education, so far as the public
                     <lb/> chest is concerned. I have never had any <lb/> hesitation on that point,
                     I have never been able <lb/> to see why all the people in the province, to
                     <lb/> whatever sect they may belong, should not send <lb/> their children to
                     the same schools to receive <lb/> the ordinary branches of instruction. I
                     regard <lb/> the parent and the pastor as the best religious <lb/>
                     instructors—and so long as the religious faith <lb/> of the children is not
                     interfered With. and <lb/> . ample opportunity afforded to the clergy to give
                     <lb/> religious instruction to the children of their <lb/> flocks, I cannot see
                     any sound objection to mixed <lb/> schools. But while in the conference and
                     else<lb break="no"/>where I have always maintained this view, and <lb/> always
                     given my vote against sectarian public <lb/> schools, I am bound to admit, as I
                     have always <lb/> admitted, that the sectarian system carried to <lb/> the
                     limited extent it has yet been in Upper <lb/> Canada, and confined as it chiefly
                     is to cities <lb/> and towns. has not been a very great practical <lb/> injury.
                     The real cause of a line was that the <lb/> admission of the sectarian
                     principle was there, <lb/> and that at any moment it might be extended <lb/> to
                     such a degree as to split up our school sys<lb break="no"/>tem altogether.
                     There are about a hundred <lb/> separate schools in Upper Canada, out of some
                     <lb/> 4,000, and all Roman Catholic. But if the Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics
                     are entitled to separate schools <lb/> and to go on extending their operations,
                     so are <lb/> the members of the Church of England, the <lb/> Presbyterians, the
                     Methodists, and all other <lb/> sects. No candid Roman Catholic will deny <lb/>
                     this for a moment; and there lays the great <lb/> danger to our educational
                     fabric, lest the sepa<lb break="no"/>rate system might gradually extend itself
                     until <lb/> the whole country was studded with nurseries <lb/> of
                     sectarianism,' most hurtful to the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the
                     province and entailing an enor<lb break="no"/>mous expense to sustain the host
                     of teachers <lb/> that so prodigal a system of public instruction <lb/> must
                     inevitably entail. Now, it is known to <lb/> every hon. member of this House
                     that an Act <lb/> was passed in 1863 as a. final settlement of this <lb/>
                     sectarian controversy. I was not. in Quebec at the <lb/> time, but if I had
                     been here, I would have voted <lb/> against that Bill because it extended the
                     facili<lb break="no"/>ties for establishing separate schools. It had, <lb/>
                     however, this good feature, that it was accept<lb break="no"/>ed by the Roman
                     Catholic authorities and car<lb break="no"/>ried to parliament as a final
                     compromise of the <lb/> question in Upper Canada. When, therefore, it <lb/> was
                     proposed that a provision should be insert<lb break="no"/>ed in the
                     confederation scheme to bind that <lb/> contract of 1863 and declare it a final
                     settle<lb break="no"/>ment, so that we should not be compelled, as, <lb/> we
                     have been since 1849, to stand constantly to <lb/> our arms, awaiting fresh
                     attacks upon our com<lb break="no"/>mon school system, the proposition seemed
                     to <lb/> me one that was not rashly to be rejected. <lb/> (Hear, hear.) I
                     admit: that, from my point at <lb/> view, this is a blot on the scheme before
                     the <lb/> House ; it is confessedly, one of the concessions <lb/> from our side
                     that had to be made to secure <lb/> this great measure of reform. But
                     assuredly, <lb/> I, for one have not the slightest hesitation in <lb/>
                     accepting it as a necessary condition of the <lb/> scheme of union, and doubly
                     acceptable must it <lb/> be in the eyes of hon. gentlemen opposite, who <lb/>
                     were the authors of the Bill of 1863. (Cheers) <lb/> But it was urged that
                     though this arrangement <lb/> might perhaps be fair as regards Upper Canada,
                     <lb/> it was not so as regards Lower Canada, for <lb/> there were matters of
                     which the British popula<lb break="no"/>tion have long complained, and some
                     amend<lb break="no"/> <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1450</fw> ments to the existing School Act were required
                     <lb/> to secure them equal justice. Well, when this <lb/> point was raised,
                     gentlemen of all parties in <lb/> Lower Canada at once expressed themselves
                     <lb/> prepared to treat it in a frank and conciliatory <lb/> manner, with a
                     view to removing any injustice <lb/> that might be shown to exist; and on this
                     <lb/> understanding the educational clause was adopt<lb break="no"/>ed by the

                  <p><persName ref="pers:BROW5">Hon. Mr. BROWN</persName>. I would like to know how <lb/> much power
                     the hon. gentleman has now to <lb/> legislate upon it ? Let him introduce a

                     the sectarian School Acts of Upper Canada. and <lb/> how many votes would he
                     get for it? Would <lb/> twenty members vote for it out of the 130 who <lb/>
                     compose this House ? It the hon. gentleman <lb/> had been struggling for
                     fifteen years, as I have <lb/> been, to save the school system of Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada from further extension of the sectarian <lb/> element, he
                     would have precious little diminu<lb break="no"/>tion of power over it in this
                     very moderate <lb/> compromise. And what says the hon. gentleman <lb/> to
                     leaving the British population of Lower Can<lb break="no"/>ada in the
                     unrestricted powers of the local <lb/> legislature? The common schools of Lower
                     <lb/> Canada are not as in Upper Canada—they are <lb/> almost entirely
                     non-sectarian, Roman Catholic <lb/> schools. Does the hon. gentleman, then,
                     desire <lb/> to compel the Protestants of Lower Canada to <lb/> avail
                     themselves of Roman Catholic institutions <lb/> or leave their children without

               <p>Let us pause a moment to consider this <lb/> language. Mr. Brown did not believe
                  in <lb/> separate schools. He had struggled all <lb/> his life against that
                  system. But a great <lb/> object had to be achieved, a noble concep<lb break="no"/>tion had to be realized, an inspiring idea <lb/> had to be made a fact. and in
                  order to <lb/> reach that supreme goal, differences of <lb/> opinion had to be
                  reconciled, fears and ap<lb break="no"/>prehensions had to he removed, misgivings
                  <lb/> had to be alleviated, and above all the <lb/> rights of conscience, the
                  tender rights of <lb/> conscience, had to be placed in as firm a <lb/> position of
                  security as they previously en<lb break="no"/>joyed, so that no one could object.
                  and all. <lb/> without regard to origin or creed, could <lb/> give a cheerful and
                  enthusiastic support to <lb/> the new constitution. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Sir, Mr. Brown told his friends that he <lb/> did not believe in separate
                  schools; but <lb/> there were fellow-citizens of his in On<lb break="no"/>tario
                  and in Quebec who believed in separate <lb/> schools, and, in order to remove
                  their ob<lb break="no"/>jections and win their cooperation in the <lb/> scheme
                  which was the great work of his <lb/> life, he agreed to make the sacrifice of his
                  <lb/> own convictions. In order to achieve the <lb/> great object he had at heart,
                  he agreed to <lb/> fasten upon his own province in system in <lb/> which he did
                  not believe, but in which <lb/> others did believe. Sir, for more than twenty
                  <lb/> years Mr. Brown has been in his grave; <lb/> but his memory is not dead. And
                  if his <lb/> teachings and his spirit be still alive. It is <lb/> surely in the
                  hearts of that staunch yeo<lb break="no"/>manry of Ontario who gave him such
                  con<lb break="no"/>stant support during the years of his poli<lb break="no"/>tical
                  struggles. They followed him devot<lb break="no"/><pb n="1451" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1451.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1451</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> edly in his
                  crusade against separate schools. <lb/> They followed him even more devotediy,
                  <lb/> when he asked them to accept separate <lb/> schools, to sacrifice their own
                  opinions, and <lb/> his own, upon the altar of the new country <lb/> which it was
                  his ambition to establish on <lb/> this portion of the North American contin<lb break="no"/>ent. If it were my privilege that my poor <lb/> words might reach that
                  staunch yeomanry <lb/> of Ontario, I would remind them that the <lb/> work of
                  confederation is not yet finished; <lb/> I would tell them that we are now engaged
                  <lb/> in advancing it; and I would ask them <lb/> whether we are now to reverse
                  our course, <lb/> or whether we are not to continue to work <lb/> it out to
                  completion on the lines laid down <lb/> by the great leader himself. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Now, Sir, such was the condition of things <lb/> at the time of confederation.
                  But I shall <lb/> be told that this exception applies to On<lb break="no"/>tario
                  and Quebec alone, and not to the <lb/> other provinces. Sir, that is true. Amongst
                  <lb/> the four provinces then united. Ontario and <lb/> Quebec alone had a system
                  of separate <lb/> schools. But I reminded the House a mo<lb break="no"/>ment ago
                  that it was not the intention of <lb/> the fathers of confederation, it was not
                  the <lb/> intention of Sir John Macdonald or Mr. <lb/> Brown to limit
                  confederation to the narrow <lb/> bounds it had in 1867. They had made pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the very instrument of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, to
                  extend it over the northern part of <lb/> the continent; they had made provision
                  to <lb/> take in British Columbia, Newfoundland <lb/> and Prince Edward Island;
                  they had made<lb/> provision to take in also the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, which were then uninhabited, but<lb/> which now have a teeming
                  population<lb/> and are at our doors asking admission.<lb/> Is it reasonable to
                  suppose, if the Con<lb break="no"/>federation Act recognizes that other prov<lb break="no"/>inces were to come into confederation simi<lb break="no"/>larly
                  situated to Ontario and Quebec, that<lb/> the same privileges should not be given
                  to<lb/> the minority as were given to the minority<lb/> in Ontario and Quebec?
                  What would have<lb/> been the value of the invitation to enter<lb/> confederation,
                  if the provinces invited to<lb/> enter, had been told that the security to
                  the<lb/> minority given to Ontario and Quebec was<lb/> a privilege which they need
                  not expect from<lb/> us? Section 43 of the Quebec resolutions<lb/> has become
                  section 93 of the British North America Act, and is no longer confined to<lb/>
                  Quebec and Ontario. Here it is:<lb/></p>

               <p>So, Sir, now whenever a province comes<lb/> here knocking at this door, asking to
                  be admitted into confederation, if in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince there exists a
                  system of seperate<lb/> schools, the British North America Act has<lb/> provided
                  that the sam guarantee we give<lb/>
                  <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1452</fw> to the minority in Quebec and Ontario shall <lb/> also be given to the
                  minority in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Shortly after confederation had been
                  <lb/> established, that is, in the year 1870, the <lb/> parliament of Canada had
                  an opportunity <lb/> of applying the doctrine contained in the <lb/> British North
                  America Act in the creation <lb/> of the province of Manitoba. Until its ad <lb/>
                  mission into the Dominion, Manitoba had <lb/> no regular government. It had been
                  loosely <lb/> administered by the Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany. There had
                  been some schools in it, <lb/> maintained by such authority as there was. <lb/>
                  There had been separate schools maintained <lb/> by Roman Catholic missionaries.
                  It was <lb/> the intention of parliament to give the <lb/> minority the system
                  that they had before <lb/> confederation; and, so marked was their <lb/>
                  intention, that instead of accepting without <lb/> qualification the words of
                  section 93 of the <lb/> British North America Act, 'right or privi<lb break="no"/>lege with respect to denominational schools <lb/> which any class of persons
                  have by law in <lb/> the province at the union,' they made it <lb/> read 'by law
                  or practice in the province at <lb/> the union.' It turned out, as determined by
                  <lb/> judicial authority, that the province of <lb/> Manitoba, when it entered
                  confederation, <lb/> had no system of schools either by law or <lb/> practice. It
                  followed, as a consequence, that <lb/> the power of the province of Manitoba with
                  <lb/> regard to the subject of education was as <lb/> complete as that of the
                  province of Nova <lb/> Scotia or the province of New Brunswick. <lb/> This is a
                  principle which was not understood <lb/> at the time by hon. gentlemen opposite
                  <lb/> when they were on this side of the House. <lb/> There was the fact, the
                  positive fact-the <lb/> power of the province of Manitoba with <lb/> regard to
                  education was as unshackled as <lb/> that of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. <lb/>
                  In 1875, as I stated a moment ago, Mr. <lb/> Mackenzie introduced an Act for the
                     govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Northwest Territories, and in <lb/> this Act
                  the parliament of Canada, which, <lb/> at that time, had among its members some
                  <lb/> of the ablest men who ever sat in a Cana<lb break="no"/>dian parliament-Sir
                  John Macdonald, Mr. Mackenzie Mr. Blake, Sir Charles Tupper<lb/> and a score of
                  others-unanimously, deliber<lb break="no"/>ately and with their eyes open,
                  introduced<lb/> into the Northwest Territories the system of<lb/> seperate
                  schools. And not only thatm but<lb/> the parliament of Canada, four times suc<lb break="no"/>cessively-in 1880, in 1885, in 1886 and in<lb/> 1898-deliberately
                  and with their eyes open,<lb/> ratified the system of separate schools in<lb/> the

                  posed the principle of authorizing separate <lb/> schools
                  in the Territories, voted against it <lb/> and gave his reasons ? <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I am delight<lb break="no"/>ed that my
                  hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) has <lb/> asked me that question. In 1875, when the
                  <lb/> Bill to which I have referred went through <lb/> parliament, Mr. Brown who
                  was a member <lb/> of one branch of this parliament, opposed <lb/> the
                  introduction of the new clause in that <lb/> Bill providing for separate schools.
                  He <lb/> opposed it with all his might. He told <lb/> the House that he had not
                  changed his <lb/> mind upon the subject, but he told the <lb/> House also that it
                  the principle of separate <lb/> schools was introduced. then. according to <lb/>
                  the terms of the constitution. it was intro<lb break="no"/>duced for all time to
                  come. I am delighted <lb/> that my hon. friend brought my attention <lb/> to this.
                  because really the whole subject <lb/> is contained in the question of my hon.
                  <lb/> friend. We have to decide this problem <lb/> upon the very terms of the
                  legislation which <lb/> was introduced in 1875. Let me give to my <lb/> hon.
                  friend all the information to which he <lb/> is entitled, and which I fain would
                  hope <lb/> will fall upon favourable ground; I will <lb/> give him the whole
                  history of that matter. <lb/> Mr. Mackenzie himself introduced the Bill <lb/> in
                  1875. The Bill as first introduced made <lb/> no mention of separate schools: but
                  after <lb/> he had sat down and when Sir John A. <lb/> Macdonald had spoken on the
                  subject, Mr. <lb/> Blake rose and brought this very subject <lb/> of separate
                  schools to the attention of the <lb/> House. and he did it with a height and <lb/>
                  breadth of thought which I hope will com<lb break="no"/>mand the admiration of my
                  hon. friend. <lb/> This is what Mr. Blake said : <lb/>

                  <p>The task which the ministry had set for itself <lb/> was the most important it

                     we hope to see hundreds of thousands, <lb/> and the more sanguine among us

                     right hon. gentleman that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ought to repeal his
                     errors. The right <lb/> hon. gentleman had tried the institutions for <lb/> the

                     what was best for the future. He (Mr. Blake) <lb/> believed that it was
                     essential to our obtaining <lb/> a large immigration to the Northwest that
                     <lb/> we should tell the people beforehand what <lb/> those rights were to be
                     in the country in <lb/> which we invited them to settle. It was in<lb break="no"/>teresting to the people to know that at the <lb/> very earliest

     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1454</fw> aggregate of population within a.

                     self-government of the territories, and <lb/> he believed the Dominion
                     government was wise. <lb/> (although the measure might be brought down <lb/>
                     very late this session and it might be found <lb/> impossible to give it due
                     consideration) in de<lb break="no"/>termining in advance of settlement what the
                     <lb/> character of the institutions of the country <lb/> should be in which we
                     invite people to settle. <lb/> </p>
                  <p>He regarded it as essential under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances of the
                     country, and in view of the deli<lb break="no"/>beration during the last few
                     days that a <lb/> general principle should he laid down in the <lb/> Bill with
                     respect to public instruction. He did <lb/> believe that we ought not to
                     introduce into <lb/> that territory the heart burnings and difficul<lb break="no"/>ties with which certain other portions of this <lb/> Dominion and
                     other countries had been afflicted. <lb/> It seemed to him, having regard to the
                     fact <lb/> that, as far as we could expect at present, the <lb/> general
                     character of that population would be <lb/> somewhat analogous to the
                     population of On<lb break="no"/>tario. that there should be some provision in
                     <lb/> the constitution by which they should have <lb/> conferred upon them the

                     those possessed by the people of the province <lb/> of Ontario. The principles

               </quote>
               <p>Now let me call renewed attention to <lb/> these words of Mr. Blake: 'I regard it

                  the deliberation of <lb/> the last few days.' What were the deliber<lb break="no"/>ations of those last few days in the House of <lb/> Commons to which Mr. Blake
                  alluded ? <lb/> Why, Sir. it was a resolution on that very <lb/> subject of
                  separate schools, separate <lb/> schools in the province of New Brunswick, <lb/>
                  where at that time. and by the constitution, <lb/> </p>
               <p>the principle of separate schools was not <lb/> adopted; the minority was asking
                  for <lb/> separate schools. and came to this House <lb/> for relief, but the House
                  would not grant <lb/> the relief because they would not invade <lb/> the
                  constitution. Mr. Blake said that in<lb break="no"/>stead of having such a state
                  of things in the <lb/> Northwest Territories it would be better to <lb/> give to
                  the people the religious instruction <lb/> that all classes might want. Now what

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> As to the subject of public instruction, it.

                  other branch of <lb/> the legislature, said that his opinions in re<lb break="no"/>gard to separate schools had not changed. <lb/> He said practically this to the

                  did not want this clause<lb/> providing for separate schools to be intro<lb break="no"/>duced in the Act. He stated that it would<lb/> be a mistake to

                  schools, but he said that if at the time<lb/> separate schools were introduced the
                  came<lb/> under the Act of Union and they were there<lb/> for all time. I do not
                  want to be offensive,<lb/> but if my hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) is not<lb/> blind
                  he will understand the reasoning of<lb/> Mr. Brown. That is the position that we
                  have<lb/> before us to-day. I am not here to advocate<lb/> separate schools as an
                  abstract proposition<lb/> but we have introduced into this Bill the two<lb/>
                  propositions, that the minority shall have the<lb/> power to establish their own
                  schools<lb/> and that they shall have the right<lb/> to share in the public
                  moneys. It is<lb/> the law to-day. It is in accord with the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, with the British North America<lb/> Act, and I commend it even to the
                  biasedjudgement of my hon. friend: If<lb/> we were in the year 1867 and not in the
                  year<lb/> 1905, and, if we had to introduce into this<lb/> dominion the provinces

     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1458</fw>katchewan, would my hon. friend tell
                  me<lb/> that these provinces would not have the<lb/> same rights and privileges in
                  regard to se<lb break="no"/>parate schools as were granted to Ontario<lb/> and
                  Quebec? Would he tell me that when<lb/> you say to Ontario and Quebec: You
                  shall<lb/> have your separate schools, Alberta and<lb/> Saskatchewan should be
                  denied that privi<lb break="no"/>lege? The thing is preposterous. Let us<lb/> rise
                  above such considerations. In every<lb break="no"/>thing that I have said I have
                  refrained<lb/> from saying a single word upon the ab<lb break="no"/>stract
                  principle of separate schools. I ap<lb break="no"/>proach the question upon
                  another and a<lb/> broader ground, I approach the question not<lb/> from the view
                  of separate schools, but I<lb/> approach it on the higher ground of Can<lb break="no"/>adian duty and Canadian patriotism. Hav<lb break="no"/>ing obtained
                  the consent of the minority to<lb/> this form of government , having obtained<lb/>
                  their consent to the giving up of their valu<lb break="no"/>ed privileges, and
                  their position of strength<lb/> are we to tell them, now that confederation<lb/>
                  is established, that the principle upon which<lb/> they consented to this
                  arrangement is to be<lb/> laid aside and that we are to ride rough<lb break="no"/>shod over them? I do no thing that is a<lb/> proposition which will be
                  maintained in this<lb/> House, nor do I believe it is the intention of<lb/> the
                  House. I offer at this moment no opin<lb break="no"/>ion at all upon separate
                  schools as an ab<lb break="no"/>stract proposition, but I have no hesitation<lb/>
                  in saying that if I were to speak my mind<lb/> upon separate schools, I would say
                  that I<lb/> never could understand what objection there<lb/> could be to a system
                  of schools wherein,<lb/> after secular matters have been attended<lb/> to, the
                  tenets of the religion of Christ, even<lb/> with the divisions which exist among
                  His<lb/> followers, are allowed to be taught. We live<lb/> in a country wherein
                  the seven provinces<lb/> that constitute our nation, either by the will<lb/> or by
                  the tolerance of the people, in every<lb/> school, Christian morals and Christian
                     dog<lb break="no"/>mas are taught to the youth of the country.<lb/> We live by
                  the side of a nation, a great<lb/> nation, a nation for which I have the great<lb break="no"/>est admiration, but whose example I would<lb/> not take in
                  everything, in whose schools<lb/> for fear that Christian dogmas in which<lb/> all
                  do not believe might be taught, Chris<lb break="no"/>tian morals are not taught.
                  When I com<lb break="no"/>pare these two countries, when I compare<lb/> Canada
                  with the United States, when I <lb/> compare the status of the two nations,<lb/>
                  when I think upon their future, when I ob<lb break="no"/>serve the social
                  condition of civil society in<lb/> each of them and when I observe in this<lb/>
                  country of ours, a total absence of lynch<lb break="no"/>ings and an almost total
                  absence of divor<lb break="no"/>ces and murders, for my part, I thank<lb/> heaven
                  that we are living in a country<lb/> where the young children of the land are<lb/>

                  sufficiently early date to have enabled me <lb/> to have made some remarks on it

                  Mr. <lb/> Fitzpatrick) had the intention to give me a <lb/> copy of that Bill last

                  Let me <lb/> say that I hold under my hand the 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard' of

                  pressed upon the attention of <lb/> the House many reasons. in his opinion <lb/>
                  very conclusive, why the granting of a <lb/> provincial status to the Northwest

                  bound to say that every one of <lb/> those reasons which at that time presented
                  <lb/> themselves to the right hon. gentleman as <lb/> insuperable difficulties in
                  the way of imme<lb break="no"/>diately granting provincial autonomy, exist <lb/>
                  to-day just as strongly as they did then. <lb/> The view which I am presenting to
                  the <lb/> House at this moment was suggested by my <lb/> hon. friend from
                  Marquette (Mr. Roche) in <lb/> these words : <lb/>
               </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> But the Prime Minister adduced arguments <lb/>

               <p>What was the right hon. gentleman's res<lb break="no"/>ponse to that? Did he deny

                  arguments, and perhaps as <lb/> strong an argument as any that was pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the House on that occasion. was <lb/> the absence of the

                  the Northwest Territories of Canada to in<lb break="no"/>troduce or to attempt to
                  pass through this <lb/> House a measure of so great importance as <lb/> that which
                  has been introduced this after<lb break="no"/>noon unless the government and the

                  of the <lb/> Minister of the Interior (Hon. Mr. Sifton). <lb/> It has
                  unfortunately happened very often <lb/> that he has been absent from sessions of
                  this <lb/> parliament, and we have endeavoured to <lb/> facilitate the passage of
                  his estimates <lb/> through the House in his absence as much <lb/> as possible. We
                  all regret his indisposition <lb/> I am sure. and we trust that in the early <lb/>
                  future and before any considerable progress <lb/> is made with this Bill. we shall

                  to appreciate the importance of this <lb/> question. Letters were addressed to him
                  <lb/> and to members of his government, over <lb/> and over again, by the Prime
                  Minister of <lb/> the Northwest Territories of Canada. To <lb/> these letters an
                  answer was sometimes <lb/> deigned and sometimes no answer was given <lb/> for
                  months. Letters were written by the <lb/> Prime Minister of the Northwest
                  Territories, <lb/> to the right hon. gentleman who leads the <lb/> government (Sir
                  Wilfrid Laurier), on May <lb/> 19, 1904, and on June 1, 1904. This matter <lb/>
                  which has been presented to the House this <lb/> afternoon as a matter of
                  transcendent im<lb break="no"/>portance. not only to the Northwest of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, but to the people of this country from <lb/> one end of it to the
                  other, was so little re<lb break="no"/>garded by the right hon. gentleman and
                  <lb/> his colleagues at that time, that the whole <lb/> summer passed away without
                  any answer <lb/> having been vouchsafed to the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of
                  the Northwest Territories. It was <lb/> only in the stress of an election campaign
                  <lb/> that the right hon. gentleman awoke to the <lb/> fact that he had not
                  answered those com<lb break="no"/>munications. They were written on May 19 <lb/>
                  and June 1; and it was on September 30, <lb/> after parliament had been dissolved,
                  and <lb/> when a campaign was actually in progress, <lb/> that the right hon.
                  gentleman was good <lb/> enough to remember that he had not given <lb/> any answer
                  to the Prime Minister of the <lb/> Northwest Territories. Then the matter <lb/>
                  seemed to him to possess a little more im<lb break="no"/>portance than he had
                  previously considered. <lb/> I will not deal with his answer now; there <lb/> will
                  be a better opportunity later on for <lb/> dealing with the subjects with which it
                  is <lb/> concerned. But he did say this <lb/> </p>

     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1462</fw> what he himself had
                  forgotten, there is <lb/> evident in his remarks to-day a marked <lb/> change from
                  the opinion he expressed in <lb/> this House on the occasion to which I have <lb/>
                  referred, when he voted against the pro<lb break="no"/>posal that the request, the

                  immediate consideration. <lb/> Now, I do not propose to discuss the pro<lb break="no"/>isions of this Bill in detail to-day. Let me <lb/> say, however, that
                  I regret very much that <lb/> the government have not seen fit to give to <lb/> the
                  people of the new provinces that con<lb break="no"/>trol over the lands of the
                  Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories which is enjoyed by all the other <lb/>
                  provinces of Canada. That is a subject <lb/> which will bear fuller discussion
                  later on, <lb/> and I do not propose to weary the House <lb/> with any extended
                  remarks respecting it <lb/> this afternoon. The only thing which could <lb/> he
                  called an argument made by the right <lb/> hon. gentleman against that proposition
                  <lb/> was this: he said it might interfere with <lb/> the operation of the policy
                  of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment with respect to immigration. So far <lb/> as the
                  rest of his argument is concerned, it <lb/> would have justified the retention by
                  the <lb/> Imperial government up to the present time <lb/> of every acre of Crown
                  lands in Canada; <lb/> and I was somewhat astonished to hear <lb/> from the right
                  hon. gentleman, the advo<lb break="no"/>cate, in the past at least, of responsible
                  <lb/> government, the defender of the liberties of <lb/> the people on some
                  occasions, according to <lb/> his own view at least, I was astonished to <lb/>
                  hear from him the views he put forth <lb/> this afternoon as to the rights of: the
                  peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories in respect <lb/> of those
                  lands. He knows something of <lb/> the history of this question. We remember <lb/>
                  that there were statesmen in Great Britain <lb/> not many years ago who thought
                  that the <lb/> public lands not only of Canada but of all <lb/> the dependencies
                  of the empire should be <lb/> retained under the control of the home gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and administered not so much for <lb/> the benefit of the
                  dependency in which they <lb/> were situate as for the benefit of the whole <lb/>
                  empire at large. But it was soon found, <lb/> when it was attempted to put that
                  view in <lb/> practice, that it was absolutely impractic<lb break="no"/>able—that
                  to the people living in and de<lb break="no"/>veloping any dependency must be
                  entrusted, <lb/> and might be safely entrusted, the entire <lb/> control of the
                  public lands within the de<lb break="no"/>pendency. The right hon. gentleman spoke
                  <lb/> of immigration. Does he not know that <lb/> there is a new Quebec and a new
                  Ontario ? <lb/> Does he not know that a tide of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion may be
                  expected to flow, and indeed, <lb/> I suppose it is now flowing into these por<lb break="no"/>tions of eastern Canada ? Will he venture <lb/> to say that there has
                  been any obstacle <lb/> placed against the immigration policy of <lb/> the
                  government by the governments which <lb/> administer those provinces? Is that the
                  <lb/> ground the right hon. gentleman takes? <lb/> Does he speak from experience,
                  or does he <lb/> <pb n="1463" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-21_Page_1463.jpg"/> <fw type="num">1463</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>  speak from
                  mere surmise? I venture to <lb/> think that he spoke only from surmise this <lb/>
                  afternoon, and that if he had looked at this <lb/> question in the light of
                  experience, in the <lb/> light of what is happening to-day in Que<lb break="no"/>bec and Ontario, he might very well have <lb/> modified the provisions of this
                  Bill, and <lb/> might very well have entrusted to the <lb/> people of the
                  Northwest Territories exact<lb break="no"/>ly the same control over their lands as
                  is <lb/> enjoyed by the people of the other pro« <lb/> vinces. I venture to say
                  further that if <lb/> he was not willing to trust the people, as <lb/> I would be
                  willing to trust the people, in <lb/> this regard—if he regarded them as pos<lb break="no"/>sibly improvident, as was suggested by the <lb/> Minister of the
                  Interior last session or the <lb/> session before—if he feared the result, he
                  <lb/> might at least have given them the control <lb/> of the public lands within
                  their respective <lb/> provinces, subject to some such restriction <lb/> as that
                  which he has proposed in regard to <lb/> education. If the principle is good in
                  the <lb/> one case, I do not see why it should not <lb/> work out fairly well in
                  the other case. <lb/> There are other features of the Bill which <lb/> will
                  undoubtedly invite discussion. The <lb/> subject which the right hon. gentleman
                  <lb/> mentioned last, on which he spoke with <lb/> great eloquence, and in a
                  spirit of forbear<lb break="no"/>ance and moderation. will undoubtedly in<lb break="no"/>vite discussion. I do not propose to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss it this
                  afternoon. There is just one. <lb/> thing, however, that I would like to say <lb/>
                  about it, and that is that I understand that <lb/> up to the present time there
                  has been really <lb/> no school question, to use the common ex<lb break="no"/>pression, in the Northwest Territories of <lb/> Canada; and I sincerely trust
                  that on both <lb/> sides of the House we will not seek to <lb/> make this a
                  political question in any sense. <lb/> </p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Hear, hear. <lb/> </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. But at the same <lb/> time let us beware
                  lest any action of ours <lb/> may create in the Northwest of Canada <lb/> for all
                  time to come that question which <lb/> happily has been entirely absent there in
                  <lb/> the past. I am speaking in all sincerity in <lb/> regard to this to my right
                  hon. friend. He <lb/> has quoted the debates which took place in <lb/> parliament
                  on this subject. He has laid <lb/> special stress upon the opinion of Mr. <lb/>
                  Brown. I will not go over his remarks <lb/> except to say that of course when Mr.
                  <lb/> Brown regarded this matter as having been <lb/> settled for all time to
                  come, he did not <lb/> speak in an absolutely legal sense. I do <lb/> not
                  understand my right hon. friend to con<lb break="no"/>tend that he did. Does he
                  take the position <lb/> that that is correct in the legal sense ? <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I take the <lb/> position that the

                  better than the present to <lb/> learn exactly his views on that point. Of <lb/>
                  course the constitutional view of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion—without touching
                  for the moment the <lb/> wisdom or propriety of what the right hon. <lb/>
                  gentleman suggests—the constitutional View <lb/> of the question is perfectly
                  plain. The <lb/> parliament of Canada, so far as the North<lb break="no"/>west
                  Territories are concerned, can abso<lb break="no"/>lutely repeal or deal with in
                  any way any <lb/> provisions it makes. <lb/>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Of course it would <lb/> be dealing there
                  with vested rights, and my <lb/> right hon. friend is very conservative in that
                  <lb/> respect. I am not discussing anything <lb/> except the constitutional
                  aspect, and vested <lb/> rights are not touched in the matter I am <lb/>
                  presenting to the House at this moment. <lb/> The right hon. gentleman knows that

               <p>Just one word more. This Bill of <lb/> course will have to be printed and we
                  shall <lb/> require some time to consider it and perhaps <lb/> some further
                  information will require to be <lb/> brought down. I have made a note of <lb/>
                  what I think should be brought down for the <lb/> information of the House before
                  this Bill <lb/> is further discussed. I would like to direct <lb/> the attention
                  of my right hon. friend to <lb/> certain returns moved for on page 119 of the
                  <lb/> Votes and Proceedings, of which some <lb/> have not been brought down. I am
                  <lb/> alluding of course only to those relating <lb/> to the Northwest
                  Territories. I would like <lb/> also to have from the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
                  full information as to the centres of popu<lb break="no"/>lation in the new
                  provinces and the course <lb/> and tendency of immigration since the cen<lb break="no"/>sus of 1901. This is of importance in con<lb break="no"/>nection with
                  the establishment of electoral <lb/> divisions and also with regard to the boun<lb break="no"/>daries of the two provinces. In the next <lb/> place, I would like to
                  know if possible the <lb/> quantity of lands which have been patented <lb/> in the
                  two provinces for homestead purposes, <lb/> the quantity granted to railway
                  companies <lb/> or which railway companies. under the <lb/> terms of their
                  charter, are entitled to select <lb/> at present. Also what lands have been <lb/>
                  granted to railway companies, but which <lb/> have not been earned or patented.
                  And <lb/> I would like a statement. if it is not <lb/> already contained in the
                  Bill or the speech <lb/> of my right hon. friend, of what lands yet <lb/> remain
                  vested in the Crown. I would like <lb/> also to know as to these lands, and
                  espe<lb break="no"/>cially in connection with the proposed boun<lb break="no"/>daries of the two provinces, what propor<lb break="no"/>tion is more suitable
                  for the growing of <lb/> grain, and where it is situated, what pro<lb break="no"/>portion is more suitable for ranching or other <lb/> description of farming and
                  where it is sit<lb break="no"/>uated. and what proportion is supposed to <lb/>
                  require irrigation and Where situated. All <lb/> this information will be of value
                  to us in <lb/> discussing the question of boundaries bet<lb break="no"/>ween the
                  proposed provinces. It would be <lb/> desirable also that on the second reading
                  <lb/> of the Bill some definite information <lb/> should be given to us as to what
                  <lb/> is the practical condition of education in <lb/> the Territories at present.
                  I fully expected <lb/> <cb/>
     <fw rendition="simple:right" type="num">1466</fw> to have received that information this <lb/>
                  afternoon but was disappointed. Also in<lb break="no"/>formation as to the systems
                  of public schools <lb/> which have been established there and under <lb/> what
                  ordinances, management and inspec<lb break="no"/>tion they are carried on. What
                  number of <lb/> schools, public schools in the ordinary sense, <lb/> are to be
                  found there and what number of <lb/> separate schools ? I think that all this
                  in<lb break="no"/>formation and other information of a kind<lb break="no"/>red
                  character should he placed before the <lb/> House. and I am sure that upon this
                  ques<lb break="no"/>tion, to which the right hon. gentleman <lb/> has alluded with
                  so much feeling, we <lb/> shall all endeavour to meet him in <lb/> the same
                  spirit. I will not go over <lb/> the past. I will not allude to the fact <lb/>
                  that possibly a somewhat different spirit <lb/> was manifested some eight or nine
                  years ago <lb/> when a similar question arose. It has been <lb/> asserted by
                  some—with what truth I know <lb/> not—that that question was deliberately <lb/>
                  brought into the political arena for the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage it might give
                  to hon. gentlemen on <lb/> the other side. I will not do more than <lb/> allude to
                  that and express once more the <lb/> hope that whatever may have been done in
                  <lb/> the past by hon. gentlemen opposite. which, <lb/> is not consistent with the
                  lofty ideals my <lb/> hon. friend has expressed this afternoon, we <lb/> on this
                  side at least shall not emulate that <lb/> example, but shall deal with this
                  question in <lb/> a spirit of Christian charity and forbear<lb break="no"/>ance,
                  realizing that on all such questions <lb/> there are two sides and endeavouring
                  each <lb/> one of us too realize that we must consider <lb/> the question
                  presented to us not only from <lb/> our own standpoint but also from the <lb/>
                  standpoint of those who differ from <lb/> us in opinion. It is above all things
                  desi<lb break="no"/>rable that these questions and considera<lb break="no"/>tions.
                  touching sometimes upon differences <lb/> of races and dealing with matters of
                  dogma <lb/> and creed, should not be introduced into the <lb/> political arena
                  more than is absolutely ne<lb break="no"/>cessary. I know that the House will
                  <lb/> deal with this question in that spirit. <lb/> and I trust and believe that
                  we may find <lb/> some solution of what has been presented <lb/> to us this
                  afternoon by the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man which will commend itself
                  generally <lb/> to the people of Canada from the Atlantic <lb/> to the Pacific.

                  merely to ask a couple of <lb/> questions. Before doing so, however, I must <lb/>
                  congratulate the right hon. gentleman as <lb/> the accoucher who has assisted in
                  bringing <lb/> into the family of the Dominion this healthy <lb/> pair of
                  provincial twins. They have cer<lb break="no"/>tainly given evidence of life and
                  activity, and <lb/> I should hope he will not shackle their limbs <lb/> in such a
                  way as to prevent their develop<lb break="no"/>ment. This is an important Bill,
                  and I only <lb/> rise to ask thatalarge number of copies be <lb/> printed as there
                  are many applications for it. <lb/> I would suggest that the second reading <lb/>

            <p>House in committee on Bill (No. 5) re<lb break="no"/>specting the census and statistics—Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fisher. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>On section 30—every person employed in 
     <lb/>
     the execution of this Act to take an oath of 
     <lb/>
     otlice<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>lion. SYDNEY FISHER (Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Agriculture). When that section was pre<lb break="no"/>viously before the committee. the suggestion 
     <lb/>
     was made that the getting.r of any informa— 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     tion by an ottirer in addition to what was 
     <lb/>
     authorized in the schedules given him should 
     <lb/>
     be made an indictable offence. I promised 
     <lb/>
     to look into that and get the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     law otlicers. I have done so. and am quite 
     <lb/>
     willing that this should be made an indict<lb break="no"/>able offence, and I propose to introduce a 
     <lb/>
     new section, section 30 (a) next after this 
     <lb/>
     clause, to attain the object desired. I take 
     <lb/>
     it that the object of having the section 
     <lb/>
     stand has thus been met. and that the 
     <lb/>
     section may pass. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. LENNOX. I desire to call the minis— 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ter's attention to another point that was 
     <lb/>
     raised during the discussion of this section. 
     <lb/>
     I asked the minister to consider what offi- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     cers would be included in the words of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 30—' every officer, census commissioner, 
     <lb/>
     ennnier:.1to', agent and other person employ<lb break="no"/>ed in the execution of this Act,' and to say 
     <lb/>
     how his section would work in conjunction 
     <lb/>
     with section 17. I understood the minister 
     <lb/>
     then to say that probably the descriptive 
     <lb/>
     words in section 31) would include all the 
     <lb/>
     public olticcrs described in section 17. I did? 
     <lb/>
     not understand the minister to be positive 
     <lb/>
     on that point. It is a matter of some im-i 
     <lb/>
     portance, and perhaps the minister will ex-t 
     <lb/>
     plain what conclusion he came to concern-l 
     <lb/>
     ing it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. FISHER. I did not think it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary that officers employed by other; 
     <lb/>
     authority, who furnish us information under , 
     <lb/>
     this Act. should be called upon to take an 
     <lb/>
     oath under this Act. We would require 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Mr SPEOULE. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>them to say that the information furnished 
     <lb/>
     us was what they had collected. But I do 
     <lb/>
     not think we could do more than that. 
     <lb/>
     They are not acting as oflicers of the de<lb break="no"/>partment in any way, except as they supply 
     <lb/>
     information to us. But I think when they 
     <lb/>
     supply information it should be under some 
     <lb/>
     form saying that this was the information 
     <lb/>
     they had collected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. LENNOX. I think the minister and 
     <lb/>
     the committee should carefully consider the 
     <lb/>
     effect of this legislation. As the minister 
     <lb/>
     says, some of the information that would 
     <lb/>
     be given by these officials would be given 
     <lb/>
     merely as information received from other 
     <lb/>
     sources, and they would not be able to 
     <lb/>
     pledge themselves to the accuracy of it as 
     <lb/>
     coming from original sources. But they will 
     <lb/>
     be bound, under this section, to swear to 
     <lb/>
     the faithful and exact discharge of the 
     <lb/>
     duties that are expected of them and to 
     <lb/>
     the secrecy of the statistics collected. And 
     <lb/>
     under section 31, it is provided that these 
     <lb/>
     officials, in case they make a false declara<lb break="no"/>tion, will be guilty of an indictable ofience. 
     <lb/>
     I call the minister's attention again to the 
     <lb/>
     position we are taking in connection with 
     <lb/>
     sections 17 and 30 taken together. We have 
     <lb/>
     certain officials appointed by municipalities 
     <lb/>
     or by the provincial government and bound 
     <lb/>
     to carry out the instructions of the authori<lb break="no"/>ty that appointed them. Almost inevitably. 
     <lb/>
     1 fear, at some time. the duties prescribed 
     <lb/>
     by the federal government under this Act 
     <lb/>
     will conflict with the duties as defined by 
     <lb/>
     the local authorities. And it is a pretty 
     <lb/>
     drastic measure to provide that a neglect 
     <lb/>
     of duty required by this government on the 
     <lb/>
     part of an oliiccr appointed by the local 
     <lb/>
     government will subject the officer not mere<lb break="no"/>ly to a fine, but to being declared guilty of 
     <lb/>
     an indictable ofifence. I think we come 
     <lb/>
     dangerously near usurping the powers of 
     <lb/>
     the local governments ; and, in that view. I 
     <lb/>
     think this is not a wise provision. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. FISHER. Section 31 provides that 
     <lb/>
     every person employed in the execution of 
     <lb/>
     this Act 'who makes wilful default in any 
     <lb/>
     matter required of him by this Act. or wil<lb break="no"/>fully makes any false declaration touching 
     <lb/>
     any such matter,' is guilty of an indictable 
     <lb/>
     offence. Of course, if he makes a return 
     <lb/>
     saying that it is information he has collect~ 
     <lb/>
     ed in his capacity as an otiicer of the local 
     <lb/>
     authority, and wilfully falsifies that return, 
     <lb/>
     I think he should be held guilty of an in<lb break="no"/>dictable ollTencc. But if he transmits the 
     <lb/>
     information he collects. he would carry out 
     <lb/>
     thr- i'ull spirit of the law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. LENNOX. I do not wish to put 
     <lb/>
     more ditiiculties in the way of the Bill than 
     <lb/>
     necessarily meet it. Of course, if one makes 
     <lb/>
     a false declaration, he is not much to be 
     <lb/>
     connniserated in any punishment. But there 
     <lb/>
     is another feature. Section 31 says "who 
     <lb/>
     makes wilful default in any matter required 
     <lb/>
     of him by this Act.' There may be a bona 
     <lb/>
