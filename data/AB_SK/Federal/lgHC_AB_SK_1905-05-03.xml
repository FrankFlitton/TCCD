     parliament; but let them remember that

     the people are not with them ; they are not 
     <lb/>
     consulted. No Act of parliament can bind 
     <lb/>
     an unwilling people. From a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     standpoint this Bill is beset with doubts 
     <lb/>
     and difficulties. If carried, it will lead to 
     <lb/>
     trouble. Let us start fair; let us give 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the Territories what is just 
     <lb/>
     and right; let us give the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     full control of their educational affairs and 
     <lb/>
     of their lands—' A bad start makes a worse 
     <lb/>
     ending.' We possess a great and glorious 
     <lb/>
     heritage, populated by people of different 
     <lb/>
     races and different creeds. We should by 
     <lb/>
     mutual concession, tolerance and forbear<lb break="no"/>ance, so harmonize our relations, that our 
     <lb/>
     people Will live in peace and goodwill, and 
     <lb/>
     that our undivided aim and object may

            <p>
     1. It is not the intention to reduce the 
     <lb/>
     cadres of officers of the militia, but it is the 
     <lb/>
     intention to separate into two lists officers 
     <lb/>
     and non-commissioned oflicers actively em<lb break="no"/>ployed and those whom it is proposed should, 
     <lb/>
     in the event of field operations, be detailed 
     <lb/>
     for work at the base or in raising reserve 
     <lb/>
     units. 
     <lb/>

 <cb/>
   
            <p>
     2. The change is being made in the best 
     <lb/>
     interests of the service, and will take im<lb break="no"/>mediate effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. They will constitute the corps of re<lb break="no"/>serves, and will be borne upon a separate 
     <lb/>
     list to those actively employed. It is hoped 
     <lb/>
     that when the central camp of instruction 
     <lb/>
     has been established facilities will be given 
     <lb/>
     for the instruction of all officers and non<lb break="no"/>commissioned oflicers in this list in their 
     <lb/>
     military duties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     4 and 5. Yes. The regulations are now

     under consideration.

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName> (Prime

     Speaker, that I have just received a tele<lb break="no"/>gram informing me of the death of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sutherland, Minister of Public Works. I 
     <lb/>
     have to say to the House that personally in 
     <lb/>
     losing Mr. Sutherland I lose one of the truest 
     <lb/>
     friends I ever had, and I know that the 
     <lb/>
     House loses one of its most valued mem<lb break="no"/>bers. I will meet, I am sure, the feelings

     of the House if I endeavour to say that the 
     <lb/>
     House should express its sympathy in its 
     <lb/>
     bereavement in some suitable manner, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not know that that can be done in any 
     <lb/>
     other way than by the House adjourning to 
     <lb/>
     attend his funeral. Therefore, I will move 
     <lb/>
     that when this House adjourns to-morrow 
     <lb/>
     it stands adjourned until Monday next, so 
     <lb/>
     as to permit members to attend the funeral 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Sutherland.

<p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I rise, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of supporting the motion 
     <lb/>
     which my right hon. friend the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister has made. The emotion which the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman has displayed has in<lb break="no"/>dicated to the House more eloquently than 
     <lb/>
     even his eloquent words could have done 
     <lb/>
     the very great loss which he feels he has 
     <lb/>
     sustained on this occasion. Let me say 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of this side of the House 
     <lb/>
     that all of us join most sincerely in 
     <lb/>
     the deep sympathy which I know every 
     <lb/>
     gentleman on the other side feels for 
     <lb/>
     the family of Mr. Sutherland in their 
     <lb/>
     bereavement, and especially for the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of this country, whose true and 
     <lb/>
     valued friend Mr. Sutherland has been so 
     <lb/>
     many years. I had the privilege of know<lb break="no"/>ing that gentleman when I first came into 
     <lb/>
     panliament in 1896. He was then an old 
     <lb/>
     member of parliament and I a young and 
     <lb/>
     inexperienced member. I always met at his 
     <lb/>
     hands the greatest kindness and cordiality. 
     <lb/>
     Afterwards, in my later acquaintance with 
     <lb/>
     public life, I met him on many trying and 
     <lb/>
     difficult occasions, particularly the occa<lb break="no"/>sion when he and I were members of a 
     <lb/>
     committee two years ago, to which was en<lb break="no"/>trusted the duty of making a redistribution 
     <lb/>
     of the seats in the province of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     And although there was a certain feeling 
     <lb/>
     at that time which might have led to some 
     <lb/>
     display of temper on the one hand or the 
     <lb/>
     other, I can say, with grateful recollection, 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Sutherland and I, at the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     of a very difficult and trying investigation. 
     <lb/>
     parted just as good friends as we were when 
     <lb/>
     that began. I repeat that on this side we ex<lb break="no"/>tend our most cordial and heartfelt sym<lb break="no"/>pathy to the bereaved family of our late 
     <lb/>
     friend and to hon. gentlemen opposite, who, 
     <lb/>
     by his death, have sustained so great a 
     <lb/>
     loss. We on this side realize fully the loss 
     <lb/>
     which the House and the country have sus<lb break="no"/>tained. In. the death of Mr. Sutherland 
     <lb/>
     Canada has lost a public man. not only of 
     <lb/>
     great experience. but, as I have always 
     <lb/>
     believed, of very great executive ability 
     <lb/>
     indeed. I feel that I have the hearty 
     <lb/>
     sympathy and support of every gentleman 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House in the words I 
     <lb/>
     have uttered and in my support of the mo<lb break="no"/>tion of the right hon. gentleman.

     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Hon. CHARLES FITZPATRICK</persName> (Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice). Mr. Speaker, much has 
     <lb/>
     been said and much more written since this 
     <lb/>
     Bill was first introduced which. in the inter<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>


     est of peace and harmony, aye, which, in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of truth and justice, might better 
     <lb/>
     have been left unsaid and unwritten. I 
     <lb/>
     hasten to add that, having followed closely 
     <lb/>
     the debate in this House and heard or read 
     <lb/>
     all the speeches, I must admit at once that, 
     <lb/>
     due allowance being made for the heat and 
     <lb/>
     exagerated language which appear to be in<lb break="no"/>separable from our political debates, with 
     <lb/>
     perhaps two or three exceptions, no speech 
     <lb/>
     has been made here which could offend the 
     <lb/>
     ears of even the most sensitive among us. 
     <lb/>
     I must of necessity, Mr. Speaker, take up 
     <lb/>
     at some length the attention of the House 
     <lb/>
     to discuss those things which. in my judg<lb break="no"/>ment, are material and important. I will 
     <lb/>
     therefore not waste any of your time or of 
     <lb/>
     mine in answering the idle vapourings of 
     <lb/>
     those who, for reasons which I have never 
     <lb/>
     been able to understand, invariably seize 
     <lb/>
     with avidity on every opportunity that offers 
     <lb/>
     to sow the seed and fan the flame of racial 
     <lb/>
     and religious discord in this country. Faith<lb break="no"/>ful to the best traditions of their party, 
     <lb/>
     some of the Conservative newspapers have 
     <lb/>
     been fair and just in their criticism of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill. Others, unmindful of their obligations 
     <lb/>
     to the public, and substituting personal 
     <lb/>
     abuse for argument, deliberately misrepre<lb break="no"/>senting the purposes and object of this legis<lb break="no"/>lation. have not hesitated to appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     lowest and the vilest passions of our de<lb break="no"/>praved human nature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall not attempt to follow them in the 
     <lb/>
     path on which they have chosen to enter. 
     <lb/>
     Those of them who are worthy of consider<lb break="no"/>ation I will leave to the punishment which 
     <lb/>
     must inevitably come in the hours of calm 
     <lb/>
     reflection and sober second thought. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I will only say that the record of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic Church and of its clergy is writ 
     <lb/>
     large on every page of the history of the 
     <lb/>
     world, and ot' the history of this country 
     <lb/>
     in particular. and so long as the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     loyalty to our institutions, and so long as 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion ot 
     <lb/>
     duty are held in esteem among us, so long 
     <lb/>
     will the names of Catholic priests and 
     <lb/>
     prelates hold foremost places on the 
     <lb/>
     honour roll of Canada. It is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary to go over nhe ground already 
     <lb/>
     covered by my eloquent friend from Labelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Bourassa). but let me mention the 
     <lb/>
     names of Jogues, Lallemant and Brebeuf, 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian Catholic martyrs who, in 
     <lb/>
     the early days of our history gave to the 
     <lb/>
     world examples of the noblest courage that 
     <lb/>
     ever steeled the heart of man, that of giving 
     <lb/>
     testimony unto death for the convictions of 
     <lb/>
     the soul. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I listened a few days ago to the ad<lb break="no"/>mirable speech of my friend for East Middle<lb break="no"/>sex (Mr. Elson). when he told us that he was 
     <lb/>
     a native-born Canadian. that there was 110 
     <lb/>
     portion of the earth in which he felt so much 
     <lb/>
     interest asin that which is bounded by the 
     <lb/>
     outer boundaries of Canada, that there were 
     <lb/>
     no people who lived and moved and had 
     <lb/>
     their being upon the face of the globe in 
     <lb/>


            <pb n="5319" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5319.jpg"/>

     whom he felt so much interest as in those 
     <lb/>
     persons who are Canadians and who at least 
     <lb/>
     live on Canadian soil, the thought occurred 
     <lb/>
     to me. how much more truly does the senti<lb break="no"/>ment he so eloquently expressed apply to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians of French origin who have never 
     <lb/>
     known any other country, whose traditions, 
     <lb/>
     associations and every hope for the future 
     <lb/>
     are connected exclusively with Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Those who wish really to understand the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of patriotism, should listen to the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians singing their national 
     <lb/>
     anthem, the opening words of which are: 
     <lb/>
     'O Canada, mon pays, mes amours.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have heard it assigned as a reason to 
     <lb/>
     justify the active interest Ontario is taking 
     <lb/>
     in this question, that the present population 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest is made up, in large part, 
     <lb/>
     of the overflow of the cradles of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. That is true, but if we must be 
     <lb/>
     mindful of the present needs and of the 
     <lb/>
     future prosperity of those who have en<lb break="no"/>tered into the possession of that great heri<lb break="no"/>tage, where it is said that men may mea<lb break="no"/>sure their plough furrows by the mile and 
     <lb/>
     then at the end look out over a sea of 
     <lb/>
     golden grain reaching out to the horizon, 
     <lb/>
     should be altogether unmindful of the 
     <lb/>
     religious convictions, the wishes and de<lb break="no"/>sires, aye, even the prejudices, of those men 
     <lb/>
     the heroism and enterprise of whose ances<lb break="no"/>tors made the present possession of those 
     <lb/>
     lands by Canada possible. I am reminded 
     <lb/>
     here of what George Brown said during the 
     <lb/>
     federation debates when this question of the 
     <lb/>
     acquisition of the Northwest was being con<lb break="no"/>sidered: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     It has always appeared to me that the open<lb break="no"/>ing up of the Northwest ought to be one of the 
     <lb/>
     most cherished projects of my honourable 
     <lb/>
     friends from Lower Canada. During the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion on the question for some years back I 
     <lb/>
     had occasion to dip deep in Northwest lore— 
     <lb/>
     into those singularly interesting narratives of 
     <lb/>
     life and travels in the Northwest in the olden 
     <lb/>
     time, and into the history of the struggles for 
     <lb/>
     commercial dominancy in the great fur-bearing 
     <lb/>
     regions. And it has always struck me that the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian people have cause to look 
     <lb/>
     back with pride to the bold and successful part 
     <lb/>
     they played in the adventures of those days. 
     <lb/>
     Nothing perhaps has tended more to create 
     <lb/>
     their present national character than the vig<lb break="no"/>orous habits, the power of endurance, the ap<lb break="no"/>titude for outdoor life, acquired in their pro<lb break="no"/>secution of the Northwest fur trade. (Hear,

     best and at its noblest blood to cement the 
     <lb/>
     nationhood of Canada. Providence has 
     <lb/>
     placed the two nations here, side by side, 
     <lb/>
     we must of necessity live together, and 
     <lb/>
     let us live in peace and work in harmony 
     <lb/>
     for the best interest of our common country.

            </p>

            <p>
     A retrospective glance at the history pre<lb break="no"/>vious to 1870, of that portion of Rupert's 
     <lb/>
     Land and of the Northwestern Territories 
     <lb/>
     for which we are now legislating may pos<lb break="no"/>sibly enable us better to understand the 
     <lb/>
     position they now occupy and the nature 
     <lb/>
     and extent of our obligations towards the 
     <lb/>
     people of those lands. On May 22nd, 1670, 
     <lb/>
     a charter was granted incorporating 'The 
     <lb/>
     Governor and Company of Adventurers of 
     <lb/>
     England, trading with Hudson bay.' By 
     <lb/>
     this charter the company secured the sole 
     <lb/>
     trade and commerce of all those 'seas, 
     <lb/>
     straits. bays, rivers, lakes, creeks, and 
     <lb/>
     sounds in whatsover latitude they might 
     <lb/>
     be that lay within the straits now 
     <lb/>
     called Hudson straits together with all 
     <lb/>
     the lands and territories upon the coun<lb break="no"/>tries. coasts and confines of such seas, buys. 
     <lb/>
     &amp;c., that were not then actually possessed 
     <lb/>
     by or granted to any of His Majesty's sub<lb break="no"/>jects or possessed by the subjects of any 
     <lb/>
     Christian prince or state.' The area covered 
     <lb/>
     by this grant has been frequently discus<lb break="no"/>sed, but it is not to my knowledge that 
     <lb/>
     the confines of the grant have ever been 
     <lb/>
     accurately defined. In addition to the grants 
     <lb/>
     to exclusive trade and to the soil, the en<lb break="no"/>tire legislative, judicial and executive power 
     <lb/>
     was vested in the company. And let me 
     <lb/>
     here observe that two French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen, Messrs. Radisson and De Gros<lb break="no"/>eil, first discovered the overland communi<lb break="no"/>cation between Canada and Hudson bay, 
     <lb/>
     and with these gentlemen originated the 
     <lb/>
     idea of the Hudson Bay Company. In 
     <lb/>
     1749, an unsuccessful attempt was made 
     <lb/>
     in the imperial parliament to deprive the 
     <lb/>
     company of its character for non-user. The 
     <lb/>
     company had at that time four or five forts 
     <lb/>
     on the coast of Hudson bay, and in its ser<lb break="no"/>vice about 120 men. After the cession of 
     <lb/>
     Canada in 1763, numerous fur traders spread 
     <lb/>
     over the same country, and finally these in<lb break="no"/>dividual speculators combined into the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Fur Company of Montreal. I 
     <lb/>
     need not refer to the settlement effected in 
     <lb/>
     that country under the auspices of Lord 
     <lb/>
     Selkirk, but I would like to refer to the 
     <lb/>
     license granted in 1821 to the Hudson Bay 
     <lb/>
     Company and the Northwest Company, 
     <lb/>
     which two companics were then amalgamat<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="5321" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5321.jpg"/>

            <fw type="num">5322</fw>

     
     ed. That license, which was for 21 years, 
     <lb/>
     gave to these two companies the monépoly 
     <lb/>
     of the trade in regions lying to the west 
     <lb/>
     and northwest of the Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany's grant. That is the origin of this 
     <lb/>
     intrusion by the Hudson Bay Company upon 
     <lb/>
     the country that was then known as the 
     <lb/>
     Indian country, and that has become known 
     <lb/>
     as the Northwest Territories. In 1830, the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Company acquired an those 
     <lb/>
     trading rights for itself by arranging with 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Company, and obtained a 
     <lb/>
     new license for 21 years. Those who are 
     <lb/>
     interested in pursuing this inquiry further, 
     <lb/>
     I would refer to the report made in 1857 by 
     <lb/>
     Chief Justice Draper, to a committee of the 
     <lb/>
     British House of Commons then charged 
     <lb/>
     with the duty of investigating this question 
     <lb/>
     of the title of the Hudson Bay Company, 
     <lb/>
     and to the more detailed report prepared by 
     <lb/>
     the Commissioner of Crown Lands of that 
     <lb/>
     time, Hon. Jos. Cauchon. In Mr. Cauchon's 
     <lb/>
     report we find the first evidence of a desire 
     <lb/>
     on the part of Canada to acquire these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. In that report we find it stated :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is, with the old province of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     For ten years thereafter a continuous cor<lb break="no"/>respondence was maintained between the 
     <lb/>
     Colonial Office and the Canadian parlia<lb break="no"/>ment upon the subject of the opening up of 
     <lb/>
     the western country, and providing by legis<lb break="no"/>lation for its welfare and good government. 
     <lb/>
     Then we find that in the confederation 
     <lb/>
     debates, the subject was pursued further, 
     <lb/>
     and Hon. George Brown stated that:

     During the confederation debates it was

     Intercolonial Railway and the opening up 
     <lb/>
     of the west with an improved canal sys<lb break="no"/>tem had been decided upon by the confer<lb break="no"/>ence as being works devolving upon the

     confederation at an early date, and these

     propositions met with general approval in 
     <lb/>
     the legislature. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Then in the order of time, the next pro<lb break="no"/>vision we find with reference to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, is contained in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, section 146 of which 
     <lb/>
     provides for the admission of Rupert's Land 
     <lb/>
     and the Northwestern Territories into the 
     <lb/>
     union upon such terms and conditions as 
   

            <cb/>
         

     are expressed in petitions to be presented 
     <lb/>
     by the Houses of parliament of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     And here, Mr Speaker, I will ask the close 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House. It is to be observed 
     <lb/>
     that the terms on which the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island and British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     entered the union require the assent of such 
     <lb/>
     provinces to be embodied in addresses from 
     <lb/>
     their respective legislatures, as well as 
     <lb/>
     the assent of the Dominion to be expressed 
     <lb/>
     in an address from the Dominion parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. But the terms and conditions on 
     <lb/>
     which Rupert's Land and the Territories 
     <lb/>
     entered the union, as well as their con<lb break="no"/>stitution, depend solely on the terms and 
     <lb/>
     conditions to be set forth in the address 
     <lb/>
     from the Houses of parliament of Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1867, on the 17th of December, in pur<lb break="no"/>suance of the terms of this section 146, an 
     <lb/>
     address of the Senate and House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons of Canada was prepared based on a 
     <lb/>
     resolution that had been passed the day 
     <lb/>
     previous, from which address I venture to 
     <lb/>
     make a few extracts. This address set out 
     <lb/>
     in the first place that it would-

     Then further on in the same address I

     find this paragraph:

     <lb/>
     Land what was in contemplation by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of the provisions of section 146 of the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act, and I would like 
     <lb/>
     to point out here immediately that Manitoba

     did not come into confederation, as has

     been generally supposed by virtue of the

     provisions of section 146, but that it came 
     <lb/>
     in by virtue of the provisions of the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Rupert's Land Act, 1868. There are 
     <lb/>
     two sections of that Act of 1868 which are 
     <lb/>
     deserving of consideration. The first is 
     <lb/>
     section 2 which provides that:

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     That is to say, the governor and company

     what the company was supposed to be en<lb break="no"/>titled to under and by virtue of the

     defined here as meaning all that land which

     they held or pretended to hold; hence the 
     <lb/>
     necessity for my referring, as I did a mo<lb break="no"/>ment ago, to the license of 1821. Section 5 
     <lb/>
     of the same Act (Rupert's Land Act, 1868)

     <lb/>
     Territories and Rupert's Land came in— 
     <lb/>
     that Rupert's Land was dealt with under 
     <lb/>
     the terms of the second address of May, 
     <lb/>
     1869, and that the Northwestern Territories 
     <lb/>
     were brought in under the terms of the first 
     <lb/>
     address of December, 1869. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In anticipation of the passage of this 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council of June, 1870, 32-33 Vic<lb break="no"/>toria, chapter 3 was passed in 1869; that 
     <lb/>
     is the Act which makes provision for the 
     <lb/>
     administration and government of Rupert's 
     <lb/>
     Land and the Northwest, and in 1870 on the 
     <lb/>
     12th of May. 33 Victoria, chapter 3 was as<lb break="no"/>sented to. and that is the Manitoba Act. 
     <lb/>
     Doubts having been expressed as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther or not certain provisions of that Act 
     <lb/>
     were within the sphere of the authority of 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada it was decided to 
     <lb/>
     submit the Act for approval to the imperial 
     <lb/>
     authorities, and I desire to examine some 
     <lb/>
     of the provisions of that Act and also to see 
     <lb/>
     what were the doubts expressed at that 
     <lb/>
     time. Let me, in the first place, draw spe<lb break="no"/>cial attention to sections 2, 22 and 30 of 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Section 2 applies the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act to Manitoba, ex<lb break="no"/>cept so far as these provisions may be 
     <lb/>
     varied by that Act. Section 22 is what is 
     <lb/>

     called the educational clause and contains 
     <lb/>
     provisions in some respects wider in their 
     <lb/>
     scope than section 93 of the British North- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     America Act. Section 30 has reference to 
     <lb/>
     the ungranted land which remained vested 
     <lb/>
     in the Crown. Now, Mr. Speaker, I have 
     <lb/>
     drawn the attention of this House especially 
     <lb/>
     to these three sections of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     Act, and I have drawn the attention of 
     <lb/>
     this House to those three sections because 
     <lb/>
     these section contain almost in terms those 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the Act now under consider<lb break="no"/>ation, which are especially attacked, and in 
     <lb/>
     connection with which the doubt has been 
     <lb/>
     expressed as to our power to constitutionally 
     <lb/>
     deal with this Bill. Let us look at 
     <lb/>
     the origin and history of these sec<lb break="no"/>tions. Bear first in mind, that the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act which contains the provisions I 
     <lb/>
     have just mentioned was drafted by Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald the father of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, then Attorney General of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     and it was introduced by him into this 
     <lb/>
     House and subsequently passed through 
     <lb/>
     the Senate at a time when the men 
     <lb/>
     who were most familiar with the scope of 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, when the men who had discussed that 
     <lb/>
     Act section by section, line by line, word 
     <lb/>
     by word, were all either in this House or 
     <lb/>
     in the Senate. I have searched the de<lb break="no"/>bates of that day in vain for one word 
     <lb/>
     said in criticism of any of these three sec<lb break="no"/>tions. There is not one word to sug<lb break="no"/>gest even that this parfliament was 
     <lb/>not competent to pass such legislation. 
     <lb/>To set that question at rest, because it is 
     <lb/>of some importance, I have made an analy<lb break="no"/>sis of the debates which will be found in 
     <lb/>'Hansard' of 1870, pages 1287 and follow<lb break="no"/>ing. If those who are interested in this 
     <lb/>question consult 'Hansard' they will find 
     <lb/>that Sir John Macdonald introduced the 
     <lb/>Act, and he said among other things: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The proposition of the government is that the

     the senate by two members until the province 
     <lb/>
     shall have a population at the decennial census 
     <lb/>

     Then Mr. Mackenzie spoke at page 
     <lb/>
     1296, and he was followed by Cartier; 
     <lb/>
     then Mr. Macdougall intervened, then Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ferguson, then the Hon. Joseph Howe, then 
     <lb/>
     again Sir John Macdonald, then Mr. Wood, 
     <lb/>
     then Mr. Harrison, then Mr. Mills, then 
     <lb/>
     again Mr. Macdougall and then again Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald; and it will be found that 
     <lb/>
     not one of these gentlemen ever referred 
     <lb/>
     to the question as to whether or not it 
     <lb/>
     was competent for this parliament to pass 
     <lb/>
     these sections. There was not a single 
     <lb/>
     voice in this House raised in protest against 
     <lb/>
     the action of the government at that time 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the Manitoba schools. I 
     <lb/>
     know it is said, that we cannot derive any 
     <lb/>
     advantage from an examination of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act because that Act was not in 
     <lb/>
     reality passed by this parliament. It is 
  

            <cb/>
         

     said that, while it is admittedly true that 
     <lb/>
     such legislation was put through this House 
     <lb/>
     because of a doubt that had arisent it was 
     <lb/>
     found necessary to refer the Act to the im<lb break="no"/>perial parliament, and it is said that conse<lb break="no"/>quently we have to examine it absolutely in 
     <lb/>
     the same way as if it had been an Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Act. Let us see what occurred in that 
     <lb/>
     connection. After the Act was passed here 
     <lb/>
     it was thought necessary to refer it, I ad<lb break="no"/>mit. When it was referred, was any 
     <lb/>
     doubt suggested with respect to the right 
     <lb/>
     of this parliament to pass the three clauses 
     <lb/>
     in question? Those who are interested in 
     <lb/>
     this aspect of the case can see Sir John 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald's report—he was then Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice—printed at page 9 of Hodgins' 
     <lb/>
     collections. It will be there found that Sir

     Second, empowering the Dominion parliament

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, it has been said that 
     <lb/>
     no argument can be drawn from the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act because the Manitoba Act was 
     <lb/>
     passed subject to a doubt which was 
     <lb/>
     expressed with respect to its validity, and 
     <lb/>
     that it was necessary to get a confirming 
     <lb/>
     Act from the imperial parliament. Let us 
     <lb/>
     see how far the doubts then expressed 


            <pb n="5327" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5327.jpg"/>

     well founded. When this Act 
     <lb/>
     went to the imperial authorities it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to introduce legislation; it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to introduce the Act of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     known as the doubt removing Act. 
     <lb/>
     And, when this Act of 1871—the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Amendment Act—was in<lb break="no"/>troduced it was necessary to explain its 
     <lb/>
     provisions, and it was necessary especially 
     <lb/>
     to explain why the imperial parliament 
     <lb/>
     was interfering. Earl Kimberley made 
     <lb/>
     that explanation on the second reading of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill—I quote from imperial ' Hansard' 
     <lb/>
     of 1871, page 1171. He explained that the 
     <lb/>
     Act he was introducing: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Was intended to remove doubts which had 
     <lb/>
     been cast upon the validity of certain Acts of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian parliament. The Act of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the North American provinces 
     <lb/>
     gives power to the parliament of Canada to 
     <lb/>
     establish provinces and territories admithed or

     <lb/>
     Canada, but an Order in Council was necessary.

            <p>
     Here is the point I want to make. The 
     <lb/>
     law oificers of the Crown in England were 
     <lb/>
     naturally consulted about the Act, and 
     <lb/>
     what did they say ? The law oflicers of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown were of the opinion: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That these Acts (the Manitoba Acts) were

     Canadian parliament has addressed the Crown 
     <lb/>
     for an Act of the imperial parliament con<lb break="no"/>firming their validity. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     There is the opinion of the law oflicers 
     <lb/>
     of the Crown in 1871, expressed at a time 
     <lb/>
     when the ink was scarcely dry on the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1867, which had been passed by the same 
     <lb/>
     parliament. And who were these law offi<lb break="no"/>cers? They were Sir Robert Collier and 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Coleridge; these were the men 
     <lb/>
     who in 1871 expressed the opinion that the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada, even without the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871, had the power to pass sections 
     <lb/>
     2, 22 and 30 of the Manitoba Act. I think 
     <lb/>
     that I am fortified by that opinion and may 
     <lb/>
     fairly claim the right to set it up against 
     <lb/>
     some of the opinions that have been quoted 
     <lb/>
     against me in this House, and more espe<lb break="no"/>cially by the editors of some newspapers 
     <lb/>
     who apparently profess to be so well versed 
     <lb/>
     in constitutional law. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me draw your attention to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that when section 22 of this Manitoba Act 
     <lb/>
     was enacted for the special protection 
     <lb/>
     of the minority in Manitoba, there 
     <lb/>
     was no word of criticism in this House 
     <lb/>
     or in the great newspapers of those days— 
     <lb/>
     then the 'Globe' was edited by George 
     <lb/>
     Brown, no word raised against the action 
     <lb/>
     of the government which at that time was 
     <lb/>
     seeking to give to the minority of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba the very guarantee with respect to 
     <lb/>
     education which we' are now trying 
     <lb/>
     to give to the minority of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. Surely it will not be argued 
     <lb/>
     that there was no word of protest raised 
     <lb/>
     at that time because it was then thought 
     <lb/>
     that Manitoba was to be a French preserve. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   


            <cb/>
            <p>
     How are we to explain the difference be<lb break="no"/>tween the spirit shown in those days and 
     <lb/>
     the spirit shown in these ? Was there any 
     <lb/>
     question then among the great men of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, the men who had made confederation, 
     <lb/>
     of manacles, of shackles, of invasion of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights? Father Richot had been con<lb break="no"/>sulted; Archbishop Taché had been sum<lb break="no"/>moned from Rome. Was there at that time 
     <lb/>
     any denunciation or any suggestion of im<lb break="no"/>proper interference by the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy ? Why the contrast between those 
     <lb/>
     days and these? Surely it will not be sug<lb break="no"/>gested, in this country of broad and tolerant 
     <lb/>
     men, in this age of enlightenment, in this 
     <lb/>
     twentieth century, when we hear on all sides 
     <lb/>
     advanced the doctrine of the universal 
     <lb/>
     brotherhood of man, that there are things 
     <lb/>
     which Sir John Macdonald might do in 1870 
     <lb/>
     and which are not permitted to Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier in 1905. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, without the Act of 1871 what posi<lb break="no"/>tion would we be in to-day ? Under the 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council of 1870 we were authorized 
     <lb/>
     to legislate for the future welfare and the 
     <lb/>
     good government of the territory. Could we 
     <lb/>
     to-day have given to that territory provincial 
     <lb/>
     status ? I say that it is not only doubtful, 
     <lb/>
     but it is almost certain that we could not. 
     <lb/>
     We have no authority to deal with the North<lb break="no"/>west. Territories as we dealt with Ma<lb break="no"/>nitoba under the Act of 1868. That 
     <lb/>
     Act was limited exclusively in its ap<lb break="no"/>plication to Rupert's Land. Could the 
     <lb/>
     King to-day, pass an Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil under the provisions of section 146 ? 
     <lb/>
     Undoubtedly not. A delegated power once 
     <lb/>
     exercised is exhausted; every lawyer knows 
     <lb/>
     that; and the right to legislate by Order in 
     <lb/>
     Council under the provisions of section 146 
     <lb/>
     was a right delegated by the imperial par<lb break="no"/>liament to Her Majesty, and once exercised 
     <lb/>
     that power was exhausted. Could we do it 
     <lb/>
     under the Order in Council of 1870 ? Un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly not, because there is another prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of law which is equally certain with 
     <lb/>
     the one to which I have just referred: dele<lb break="no"/>gatus delegare non potest. Therefore, it is 
     <lb/>
     necesary for us to find authority for our 
     <lb/>
     action in the present instance within the 
     <lb/>
     four corners of the Act of 1871. That Act 
     <lb/>
     in section 4 provides:

     The first point is that the Act itself under 
     <lb/>
     which the petitioner was tried was ultra vires 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament to enact. That parlia<lb break="no"/>ment derived its authority for the passing of 
     <lb/>
     that statute from the imperial statutes, 34 and 
     <lb/>
     35 Vic., c. 28, which enacted that the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada may from time to time make 
     <lb/>
     provision for the administration, peace, order 
     <lb/>
     and good government of any territory not for 
     <lb/>
     the time being included in any province. It 
     <lb/>
     is not denied that the place in question was 
     <lb/>
     one in respect of which the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada was authorized to make such provision, 
     <lb/>
     but it appears to be suggested.that any pro<lb break="no"/>vision differing from the provisions which in 
     <lb/>
     this country have been made for administra<lb break="no"/>tion, peace, order and good government can<lb break="no"/>not, as a matter of law, be provision for peace, 
     <lb/>
     order, and good government in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     to which the statute relates, and further, that 
     <lb/>
     if a court of law should come to the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion that a particular enactment was not cal<lb break="no"/>culated as a matter of fact and policy to secure 
     <lb/>
     peace, order, and good government. that they 
     <lb/>
     would be entitled to regard any statute directed 
     <lb/>
     to those objects, but which a court should think 
     <lb/>
     likely to fail of that effect, as ultra vires and 
     <lb/>
     beyond the competency of the Dominion par<lb break="no"/>liament to enact.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Their lordships are of opinion that there is 
     <lb/>
     not the least colour for such a contention. The 
     <lb/>
     words of the statute are apt to authorize the 
     <lb/>
     utmost discretion of enactments for the at<lb break="no"/>tainment of the objects pointed to. They are 
     <lb/>
     words under which the widest departure from 
     <lb/>
     criminal procedure as it is known and prac<lb break="no"/>tised in this country have been authorized in 
     <lb/>
     Her Majesty's Indian empire. Forms of pro<lb break="no"/>cedure unknown to the English common law 
     <lb/>
     have there been established and acted upon, 
     <lb/>
     and to throw the least doubt upon the validity 
     <lb/>
     of powers conveyed by those words would be of 
     <lb/>
     widely mischievous consequence.

     Now, sir, we are not legislating at the

     under the provisions of section 2 of the same

     here that the construction of a statute is

    no great secret. A statute is intended

     <lb/>plain English words in grammatical form, 
     <lb/>and the words in a statute are to be con<lb break="no"/>strued in the same sense as they would be 
     <lb/>in ordinary conversation. That is the in<lb break="no"/>tent of the law. Let us read the section

     Can words be clearer? What is there 
     <lb/>
     ambiguous about these words ? I hold that 
     <lb/>
     section 2 expressly gives power to the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada to establish new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in any of the Territories forming 
     <lb/>
     part of the Dominion, but not included in 
     <lb/>
     any province thereof, and for the passing 
     <lb/>
     of laws for the peace, order and good gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of any such province, and its rep<lb break="no"/>resentation in parliament. Bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     that this Act was passed at the request of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian government, and remember 
     <lb/>
     what I read a moment ago from the report 
     <lb/>
     of the late Sir John Macdonald, in which 
     <lb/>
     he asked that the Act be passed and said 
     <lb/>
     that it was the desire of the Canadian par<lb break="no"/>liament to be empowered from time to time 
     <lb/>
     to establish other provinces in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, with such local govern<lb break="no"/>ment, legislatures and constitutions as it 
     <lb/>
     might deem fit to give them. That was the 
     <lb/>
     request made by the Canadian parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and section 2 is one of the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     law which was passed in answer to that 
     <lb/>
     request.

            </p>

     It seems to me that there is another ar<lb break="no"/>gument to be drawn from this. The Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1871 not only contains the provision 
     <lb/>
     which I have just read—and bear in mind 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances under which it was pass<lb break="no"/>ed—but it also contains a provision to con<lb break="no"/>firm the Manitoba Act, that is to say to con<lb break="no"/>firm an Act which contains these clauses of 
     <lb/>
     which I spoke a moment ago, among which 
     <lb/>
     are the educational clause and the clause 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the ownership of public lands. 
     <lb/>
     The imperial authorities, having had notice 
     <lb/>
     from the Canadian parliament that it con<lb break="no"/>strued its powers to mean that it had the 
     <lb/>
     right to deal with these two questions in the 
     <lb/>
     way in which it had dealt with them, con<lb break="no"/>firm what the Canadian parliament did and 
     <lb/>
     give it power to go on legislating on similar 
     <lb/>
     lines in the future. It seems to me im<lb break="no"/>possible to find a case in which the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of the imperial parliament to give this 
     <lb/>
     parliament the power to do in a case like 
     <lb/>
     the present which is in all fours with the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba case what was done by the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Act could be more dearly expressed.

            <p>
     This Act, the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1871, marks a long step in advance of 
     <lb/>
     the powers which the Dominion parliament 
     <lb/>

     at that time enjoyed. The Act of 1867 pro<lb break="no"/>vided only for the establishment of four 
     <lb/>
     provinces and their union into one under 
     <lb/>
     the name of the Dominion, and for the ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the Dominion by admission into 
     <lb/>
     it of other parts of British North America. 
     <lb/>
     But by the Act of 1871 new powers 
     <lb/>
     are either granted or confirmed to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament: First, to administer the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories as such without giv<lb break="no"/>ing them the rights or the status of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces; second from time to time to esta<lb break="no"/>blish new provinces and at the time of such 
     <lb/>
     establishment to make provision for the 
     <lb/>
     constitution and administration of such 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Now, observe that the words 
     <lb/>
     of section 146 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1867 'Subject to the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     this Act' do not appear in section 2 of the

     Act of 1871. The words 'may make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for the constitution and administra<lb break="no"/>tion of any such province' are not restrict<lb break="no"/>ed or qualified by any thing in this section 
     <lb/>
     contained, and are as broad and compre<lb break="no"/>hensive as words can be for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     enabling this parliament to frame a consti<lb break="no"/>tution for any province it may deem expe<lb break="no"/>dient to establish. I am not unmindful that 
     <lb/>
     in the last paragraph of the Act of 1886 it 
     <lb/>
     is said :

     These words in section 146 'subject to the

     <lb/>
     and their place in that section. What oc<lb break="no"/>curred with respect to that section ? The 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament passed the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act of 1867, not merely, 
     <lb/>
     as an Act is passed under ordinary cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, to give effect to the intention 
     <lb/>
     of the legislature, but to give effect like<lb break="no"/>wise to a solemn compact entered into be<lb break="no"/>tween three distinct and separate political 
     <lb/>
     entities; and when that Act was passed, 
     <lb/>
     provision was made that by exceptional 
     <lb/>
     legislation—that is to say by Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil—Her Majesty was empowered to bring 
     <lb/>
     other provinces into confederation and to 
     <lb/>
     allow other provinces to be carved out of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories. Therefore it was of prime 
     <lb/>
     importance that in that provision authoriz<lb break="no"/>ing Her Majesty to exercise these excep<lb break="no"/>tional powers, under these exceptional cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, a restriction should be put 
     <lb/>
     upon the exercise of those powers, and 
     <lb/>
     that Her Majesty should be told: You can 
     <lb/>
     bring in new provinces, you can carve out 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in. these Territories, but you 
     <lb/>
     shall do it subject to the Act we have

            <cb/>
          

     passed. There are reasons for these words 
     <lb/>
     in these circumstances; but when the im<lb break="no"/>perial parliament in 1871 delegates these 
     <lb/>
     powers to the Dominion parliament, to be 
     <lb/>
     exercised by that, parliament absolutely and 
     <lb/>
     for all time, just as they would be by the

     short may be briefly stated as follows:

            <p>
     1. Limitation of the power to amend the

     with the public domain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. For the absence of authority to estab<lb break="no"/>lish such public institutions as hospitals, 
     <lb/>
     asylums, &amp;c. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     on by joint stock company.

     Now, Mr. Speaker, we are called upon 
     <lb/>
     to add the little that is necessary in order 
     <lb/>
     to give full autonomy to these Territories. 
     <lb/>
     The first question to be considered is : Has 
     <lb/>
     parliament the power to legislate for these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in the manner proposed? 
     <lb/>
     And the second question is: Are the pro<lb break="no"/>visions tor the establishment of these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces fair and reasonable in view of 
     <lb/>
     the conditions now existing in those Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories ? I will not repeat what I have 
     <lb/>
     just said about the Act of 1871. But it has 
     <lb/>
     been suggested that the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act apply automati<lb break="no"/>cally to the new provinces. What that means, 
     <lb/>
     I must confess, I am somewhat at a loss to 
     <lb/>
     understand. I think I heard it suggest<lb break="no"/>ed by some that our authority in this par<lb break="no"/>liament is limited to the making of a de<lb break="no"/>claration that the territory affected is a 
     <lb/>
     province, and then the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act would be ap<lb break="no"/>plicable. Is that what is meant by say<lb break="no"/>ing that these provisions apply automatic<lb break="no"/>ally ? This might be possible with respect 
     <lb/>
     to those provisions that apply to all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. But what of the others ? There 
     <lb/>
     are provisions that apply to Quebec, there 
     <lb/>
     are provisions that apply to Ontario, there 
     <lb/>
     are provisions that apply to Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, there are provisions that apply to 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, there are provisions that 
     <lb/>
     apply to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; 
     <lb/>
     and there are some provisions that apply to 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces. Which of these would 
     <lb/>
     apply here ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me here again lawyer-like appeal to 
     <lb/>
     precedent. Those who drafted the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act and who may be sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have best understood its provisions, 
     <lb/>
     were called upon, very shortly after they 
     <lb/>
     had drafted the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     to draft the Manitoba Act. How did they 
     <lb/>
     proceed? Section 2 of the Manitoba Act 
     <lb/>
     is practically section 2 of this Bill. That 
     <lb/>
     is to say, in the Manitoba Act you find a 
     <lb/>
     section declaring provisions of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act applicable to Mani<lb break="no"/>
       
            <cb/>
       
toba. If these provisions apply automatically 
     <lb/>
     where is the necessity for this section? The 
     <lb/>
     same thing applies to Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     and to British Columbia. When British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia came into confederation, in 1871, 
     <lb/>
     those who are curious enough to look into 
     <lb/>
     the details of this matter will find, in the 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council provision is made which is 
     <lb/>
     practically in terms identical with the sec<lb break="no"/>tion of this Bill. And the same thing 
     <lb/>
     applies to Prince Edward Island. In all 
     <lb/>
     these cases the terms of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act were applied to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, except so far as they may be varied 
     <lb/>
     or amended by the statute or the Order in 
     <lb/>
     Council. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then it has been argued that the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the British North America Act may 
     <lb/>
     be made applicable, but we have not the 
     <lb/>
     power to alter or vary the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. Here again I 
     <lb/>
     appeal to precedent. If we have no power 
     <lb/>
     to vary the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     why did they insert in the Manitoba Act, 
     <lb/>
     in the Prince Edward Island Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, and the British Columbia Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, a provision that the sections of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act would be appli<lb break="no"/>cable to these provinces except in so far as 
     <lb/>
     they may be varied or altered by the Act 
     <lb/>
     or by the Order in Council ? If we are in 
     <lb/>
     error, it seems to me, we have ample pre<lb break="no"/>cedent for our error. On that branch of 
     <lb/>
     my argument, the conclusion I come to is, 
     <lb/>
     that we have the power to give to these 
     <lb/>
     provinces such a constitution or adminis<lb break="no"/>tration as this parliament deems it exped<lb break="no"/>ient to give. But the most that can be 
     <lb/>
     said in favour of those who take the con<lb break="no"/>trary view—and it has not been said so far 
     <lb/>
     as I am aware—is that inasmuch as the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, 1871, provides 
     <lb/>
     that the parliament of Canada may from 
     <lb/>
     time to time establish ' provinces,' the word 
     <lb/>
     'provinces' as so used must be interpreted 
     <lb/>
     having regard to the meaning of that word 
     <lb/>
     in the British North America Act, 1867, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore the province so established must 
     <lb/>
     be an institution corresponding generally 
     <lb/>
     with the provinces whose constitution is 
     <lb/>
     fixed in the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     Admitting, for the sake of argument, that 
     <lb/>
     that is so, it can only require that the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces shall be constituted, as to cor<lb break="no"/>respond in powers with the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     so far as, with regard to any subject or 
     <lb/>
     class of subjects the power: of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces are the same. I might labour the 
     <lb/>
     point indefinitely and not get much further 
     <lb/>
     on. In addition to the quotations from Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson made by the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, I would refer to a further state<lb break="no"/>ment by that gentleman which will be found 
     <lb/>
     in ' Hansard ' of July 16th, 1894, page 6130. 
     <lb/>
     It will there be found that Sir John Thomp<lb break="no"/>son, one of the greatest constitutional law<lb break="no"/>yers among the many eminent men who have 
     <lb/>
     filled the position that I now occupy, held 
     <lb/>
     clearly and distinctly that the constitution

     of the provinces which are now being creat<lb break="no"/>ed is to be settled by this parliament ex<lb break="no"/>clusively. That there may be no doubt 
     <lb/>on that subject, perhaps I had better read 
     <lb/>an extract from the 'Debates.' Sir John Thompson 
     <lb/>  said, in answer to Mr. McCarthy:

     —were allowed to stand until provinces are 
     <lb/>
     created, we should, by force of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act be unable to withdraw that 
     <lb/>
     system, and that it would be riveted on the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. As has been shown by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Bothwell, the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act relate only to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces which were entering into the union 
     <lb/>
     at. that time, and to the provinces which were 
     <lb/>
     named in the last section of the Act as entitled 
     <lb/>
     to be admitted into the union, and have no re<lb break="no"/>lation whatever to the provinces which are to 
     <lb/>
     be created out of the territorial district of the 
     <lb/>
     country. That is clearly seen when we come 
     <lb/>
     to the British statute of 1871, which, for the 
     <lb/>
     first time, conferred the power on this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to create provinces out of our territories, 
     <lb/>
     and. as the hon. Minister of the Interior has 
     <lb/>
     said, enables this parliament to decide what 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of those provinces shall be. 
     <lb/>
     We claim, therefore, that the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     system which was established with regard to 
     <lb/>
     schools and with regard to language in 1876, 
     <lb/>
     ought to be maintained for the same rea<lb break="no"/>sons as those which dictated its creation, 
     <lb/>
     and that this condition of affairs should last, 
     <lb/>
     at least. while the affairs of the territories are 
     <lb/>
     under the control or this parliament. What the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the future provinces shall be, in 
     <lb/>
     view of the pledges which have been referred 
     <lb/>
     to, or in view of any other set of circumstances, 
     <lb/>
     will be for parliament to decide when it de<lb break="no"/>cides to create those provinces.

            <p>
     Now it seems to me that some consider<lb break="no"/>ation should be given to this opinion ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by so eminent a man, absolutely 
     <lb/>
     in line with the opinion on which the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment are now acting. Now, as against 
     <lb/>
     the views I have expressed, the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     another very eminent man has been quoted, 
     <lb/>
     that of Mr. Christopher Robinson. I make 
     <lb/>
     bold to say that there is no man in this 
     <lb/>
     country who occupies a higher position. 
     <lb/>
     not only as a lawyer but as a man. 
     <lb/>
     than Mr. Christopher Robinson. The 
     <lb/>
     worthy son of a distinguished sire, he 
     <lb/>
     embodies in his person all the best tra<lb break="no"/>ditions of the noble profession to which 
     <lb/>
     so many of us belong. I have given evi<lb break="no"/>dence of my respect for Mr. Christopher 
     <lb/>
     Robinson, on many occasions, the most im<lb break="no"/>portant being when I recommended him as 
     <lb/>
     chief counsel for Canada in the Alaska 
     <lb/>
     boundary case. Now what does Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Christopher Robinson say—rather, not what 
     <lb/>
     does he say, but what is he reported 
     <lb/>
     to have said?—because we have not yet 
     <lb/>
     got what he said, we have not been favour<lb break="no"/>ed even with the questions that were sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to him.

     I do not really think it is worth while 
     <lb/>
     for certain newspapers in this country to 
     <lb/>
     quote the opinion of Mr. Christopher Robin<lb break="no"/>son, and say that his opinion is that, on 
     <lb/>
     this important constitutional question, there 
     <lb/>
     can be no doubt the government is wrong. 
     <lb/>
     I am not aware that this government con<lb break="no"/>siders that it is bound constitutionally to 
     <lb/>
     impose any restrictions; but I am aware 
     <lb/>
     that this government believes that in equity 
     <lb/>
     and in good conscience it ought to enact 
     <lb/>
     section 16 of the Bill.

     Now for the present I will follow the

     example of the leader of the opposition, 
     <lb/>
     and deal exclusively with two features of

     and second, the educational provisions. Let

     to be handed over, but if we are to concede 
     <lb/>
     the principle that the government do not in<lb break="no"/>tend to hand them over, then in that case 
     <lb/>
    the best thing to do was that which I sug<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>
 

     gested. I did not intend at the time to 
     <lb/>
     deal with the question of legislative power. 
     <lb/>
     I may say besides to the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice that I think the question of the lands 
     <lb/>
     stands so far as legislative power is con<lb break="no"/>cerned on a somewhat different basis from 
     <lb/>
     that of the educational clauses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. In dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     lands I refer to section 109 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act which is made applica<lb break="no"/>ble exclusively to the original provinces by 
     <lb/>
     name, and applicable to each of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces in which the lands were vested at 
     <lb/>
     the time of confederation. At the time of 
     <lb/>
     confederation the lands referred to in sec<lb break="no"/>tion 109 were the property of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     that were coming into confederation. In 
     <lb/>
     the present instance the lands are vested in 
     <lb/>
     the Sovereign in the right of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion and we would require a divesting Act to 
     <lb/>
     part with them. If this Act were simply 
     <lb/>
     silent the public domain would remain in the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, where it now is. Here again we have 
     <lb/>
     the authority of precedent. In the Manito<lb break="no"/>ba case the same principle was applied and 
     <lb/>
     as has been explained by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance (Hon. Mr. Fielding) and other 
     <lb/>
     speakers, that principle was never departed 
     <lb/>
     from, notwithstanding the repeated and ur<lb break="no"/>gent requests of Manitoba. I shall not weary 
     <lb/>
     the House with a repetition of the answers
     <lb/>
     given by former governments to the re<lb break="no"/>quests of Manitoba for the control of their 
     <lb/>
     lands. Incidentally I may say, however, 
     <lb/>
     that this question was under consideration 
     <lb/>
     in the Swamp Lands Case in the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council in 1904. Honourable members will 
     <lb/>
     remember that under a Dominion statute it 
     <lb/>
     is provided that all Crown lands in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba which are shown to the satisfaction of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government to be swamp 
     <lb/>
     lands shall be transferred to the province 
     <lb/>
     and inure wholly to its benefit and use. 
     <lb/>
     The government of Manitoba claimed that
     <lb/>
     they were entitled from the date of the 
     <lb/>
     statute to the profits on each parcel of lands 
     <lb/>
     which had eventually and after a process of 
     <lb/>
     selection been transferred. The Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil held that the lands did not inure to the 
     <lb/>
     benefit and the use of Manitoba until they 
     <lb/>
     were transferred.

     That is to say, while Canada was admin<lb break="no"/>istering the public domain in Manitoba and

     the Territories in such a way that the profits 
     <lb/>
     arising therefrom inured to the benefit of the

     Dominion. Something might be said in 
     <lb/>
     favour of the principle that these lands 
     <lb/>
     should be administered in such a way that 
     <lb/>
     the profits arising therefrom would inure 
     <lb/>
     to the province or territory in which the 
     <lb/>
     lands are situated, but in the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     the question arose incidentally and there 
     <lb/>
     it was not even suggested that the Dominion

     had no title to these lands or that they 
     <lb/>
     should have been origimally transferred to 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. Constitutionally it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that our right to deal with these lands in 
     <lb/>
     the way we are dealing with them cannot 
     <lb/>
     be seriously questioned.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It must not in addition be overlooked that 
     <lb/>
     when the Territories became part of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion they had no revenue, and in ad<lb break="no"/>dition to the payment of £300,000 sterling 
     <lb/>
     to extinguish the Hudson Bay Company's 
     <lb/>
     rights, Canada had immediately to assume 
     <lb/>
     the whole burden of government without 
     <lb/>
     any compensation in the way of revenue 
     <lb/>
     except such as it derived from the sale of 
     <lb/>
     public lands. I would not wish to repeat 
     <lb/>
     what has already been said. as the subject 
     <lb/>
     will require to be more fuily considered in 
     <lb/>
     committee but it seems to me that not only 
     <lb/>
     under the provisions of the constitution, not 
     <lb/>
     only for the reasons urged by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) with respect to 
     <lb/>
     immigration, not only for the reasons set 
     <lb/>
     forth in the different Orders in Council pre<lb break="no"/>pared by preceding governments, but be<lb break="no"/>cause the people of Canada . have been 
     <lb/>
     obliged to incur all these liabilities with res<lb break="no"/>pect to these Territories, that we have not 
     <lb/>
     only the right but we have the duty to 
     <lb/>
     retain the possession of these lands. Per<lb break="no"/>haps incidentally I might mention that in 
     <lb/>
     the debates on confederation the question 
     <lb/>
     was considered, and it is gratifying to see 
     <lb/>
     that the Hon. George Brown, discussing the 
     <lb/>
     question of immigration, pointed out the in<lb break="no"/>convenience that would result from a <choice><sic>sepa<lb break="no"/>ate</sic><corr>separate</corr></choice> administration and a different policy as 
     <lb/>
     between the government of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     and the provincial governments, and he prac<lb break="no"/>tically went upon the lines that are being 
     <lb/>
     urged here in support of the government's 
     <lb/>
     position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I come to the crucial point, the 
     <lb/>
     education provisions, section 16. And here, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I have to stand humbly before 
     <lb/>
     the House, perhaps in a penitent mood, and 
     <lb/>
     to make the admission that I drew that 
     <lb/>
     clause. Apparently there are few in this 
     <lb/>
     House who do that clause honour. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. You look pretty 
     <lb/>
     guilty. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I look pretty guilty 
     <lb/>
     but I do not look nearly so guilty as I feel. 
     <lb/>
     I drew it with my own hand, clause by 
     <lb/>
     clause, line by line, word for word. It is 
     <lb/>
     one of the two clauses of the whole Act for 
     <lb/>
     which I am personally responsible. The 
     <lb/>
     other is the clause that has reference to the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway contract. I will 
     <lb/>
     not now say any thing, as I fear I have de<lb break="no"/>tained the House long enough. on the am<lb break="no"/>ended clause. That I shall be prepared to 
     <lb/>
     deal with and to justify when it is moved in 
     <lb/>
     Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now. if I have succeeded in establishing 
     <lb/>
     my first point. namely, that this parliament 
     <lb/>
     has the power to insert in this Bill the pro<lb break="no"/>visions contained in section 16 with respect 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
         

     to education, the next question to be con<lb break="no"/>sidered will be. are these provisions under 
     <lb/>
     all the circumstances fair and reasonable, 
     <lb/>
     and in view of the pledges given and of the 
     <lb/>
     legislation passed by this parliament is there 
     <lb/>
     a moral obligation to enact this clause ? My 
     <lb/>
     principle, if I have a principle in politics, 
     <lb/>
     is to hold sacred my covenants. There is 
     <lb/>
     to use the words of the Privy Council in the 
     <lb/>
     second Manitoba case, a 'parliamentary com<lb break="no"/>pact' made with the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west and I want, so far as it is possible to 
     <lb/>
     do it, to hold sacred my covenants and to see 
     <lb/>
     that compact observed. We are told that 
     <lb/>
     the provinces were not consulted about this 
     <lb/>
     Bill and especially about this provision of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill. Let me say that as far back as 
     <lb/>
     1900 the territorial government drew Bill 
     <lb/>
     and submitted it for the consideration of 
     <lb/>
     the government, to which they expected 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary sanction would be given. I 
     <lb/>
     have here in my possession a Bill drawn in 
     <lb/>
     1902 which they submitted to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and in which I presume they caused to 
     <lb/>
     be inserted all the provisions which they 
     <lb/>
     desired to have in their new constitution. 
     <lb/>
     What is there in that Bill? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

     <lb/>
     Bill?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. The Haultain Bill, 
     <lb/>
     yes, the Bill of 1902. This Bill will be 
     <lb/>
     found in a return which was brought down 
     <lb/>
     last year or the year before and annexed to 
     <lb/>
     it there is a memorandum explaining each 
     <lb/>
     one of the provisions. What does that Bill 
     <lb/>
     say in section 2? And bear in mind that 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of that Bill is almost in terms 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the Bill now under consideration 
     <lb/>
     of this House. Section 2 of the Bill pre<lb break="no"/>sented to us by the people of the Northwest

            <p>
     Can there be any doubt now as to whether 
     <lb/>
     or not the provinces have the right to deal 
     <lb/>
     exclusively with education. If it was in<lb break="no"/>tended that the province should have exclun 
     <lb/>
     sive legislative jurisdiction with respect to 
     <lb/>
     education, why not have included that sub<lb break="no"/>ject among the classes of subjects enumer<lb break="no"/>ated in section 92, and assigned exclusively 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces ; or, why not have eliminat<lb break="no"/>ed all reference to the subject of education, 
     <lb/>
     which, in that case might have been included 
     <lb/>
     under the heading ' property and civil rights 
     <lb/>
     in the province' under section 92; again 
     <lb/>
     under ' matters of a merely local or private 
     <lb/>
     nature in the province.' Either of these two 
     <lb/>
     enumerations would include education. The 
     <lb/>
     answer is, that parliament intended to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this difficult question so as to make 
     <lb/>
     exceptional provisions differing according to 
     <lb/>
     each province ; and my argument is that by 
     <lb/>
     section 93 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     1867, the power of each province to make 
     <lb/>
     laws in respect to education is expressly 
     <lb/>
     limited: First, the right to denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools which any class of persons has by 
     <lb/>
     law in each province at the union must be 
     <lb/>
     preserved. That is quite clear. Second: 
     <lb/>
     where in any province a system of separate 
     <lb/>
     or dissentient schools exists by law at the 
     <lb/>
     union, or is thereafter established an appeal 
     <lb/>
     shall lie to the Governor General in Council 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
        

     from any act or decision of any provincial 
     <lb/>
     authority affecting any right or privilege of 
     <lb/>
     the minority. And third: The powers, 
     <lb/>
     privileges and duties conferred in Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada upon separate schools and school 
     <lb/>
     trustees of the Roman Catholics, are ex<lb break="no"/>tended to the dissentient schools of Protes<lb break="no"/>tants and Roman Catholics in Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     
   </p>

            <p>These limitations not only provide ex<lb break="no"/>pressly exceptional provisions for different 
     <lb/>provinces, but also in effect, so far as there 
     <lb/>were denominational schools at the union, 
     <lb/>established as many different systems as 
     <lb/>there are provinces. By the Manitoba Act 
     <lb/>there are different provisions, and the limi<lb break="no"/>tations so far as denominational schools are 
     <lb/>concerned is expressed in even broader terms 
     <lb/>than in section 93 of the British North Am- ' 
     <lb/>erica Act. Nobody doubts that Ontario, that 
     <lb/>Quebec, that Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick are provinces, notwithstanding this di<lb break="no"/>versity in matters of education. It has 
     <lb/>never been suggested that Manitoba is not 
     <lb/>a province, although further exceptions as 
     <lb/>to education have been introduced in her 
     <lb/>case. It cannot reasonably be argued that 
     <lb/>in creating a new province the Dominion is 
     <lb/>bound to make its powers with regard to 
     <lb/>education corresponding to those of any 
     <lb/>particular one of the older provinces. And, 
     <lb/>if we are obliged to make them correspond 
     <lb/>to any particular one of the older provinces, 
     <lb/>to which shall we make them correspond ? 
     <lb/>All the provinces are treated alike, mark 
     <lb/>you, Mr. Speaker, with the single exception 
     <lb/>of Quebec, with respect to which province 
     <lb/>there is an express limitation placed upon 
     <lb/>its powers in the interest of the Protestant 
     <lb/>minority. 
     <lb/>

            <p>It is a complete error to imagine that the 
     <lb/>right to separate schools in Ontario is 
     <lb/>created by the British North America Act; 
     <lb/>that right is merely preserved by that Act, 
     <lb/>and there is no exceptional provision for 
     <lb/>Ontario. The conditions applicable to On<lb break="no"/>tario are those applicable to New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>to Nova Scotia, to Prince Edward Island and 
     <lb/>to British Columbia; the difference being 
     <lb/>that at the time of confederation the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics of Ontario had rights and privileges with 
     <lb/>respect to their schools by law in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and they did not have these rights in 
     <lb/>some of the other provinces. Again I repeat: 
     <lb/>there is not in the whole Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada to-day a single province that enjoys an 
     <lb/>exclusive right to legislate with respect to 
     <lb/>education. Then, why in the name of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights can we justly be called upon 
     <lb/>to give to these new provinces a power 
     <lb/>which no other province possesses ? Let me 
     <lb/>quote on this point the opinion of their 
     <lb/>Lordships of the Privy Council in the se<lb break="no"/>cond Manitoba School Case. Here is what 
     <lb/>their Lords'hips say, page 279 of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba School Case, 1894, edited by the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian government :

     There we have it, on the authority of the

     <lb/>
     the British North America Act vested in 
     <lb/>
     any province to deal exclusively with mat<lb break="no"/>ters of education. I am quite aware that 
     <lb/>
     the terms of section 22 of the Manitoba Act 
     <lb/>
     differ somewhat from the terms of section 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act, and 
     <lb/>
     the differences are pointed out in the report 
     <lb/>
     of the same case. at page 270 ; but the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple is the same. As was stated by their 
     <lb/>
     Lordships of the Privy Council. the argu<lb break="no"/>ment that power is conferred on the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of any province to exclusively make 
     <lb/>
     laws in relation to education is a fallacious 
     <lb/>
     one. The power conferred is not absolute, 
     <lb/>
     but limited. It is exercisable only—to use 
     <lb/>
     the words of section 93—' subject to the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing provisions.' I repeat that it is 
     <lb/>
     neither absolute nor exclusive.

            <p>
     In this view of the law, let us examine 
     <lb/>
     section 16. Dealing with the Territories as 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces had been dealt with 
     <lb/>
     my intention was to declare section 93 ap<lb break="no"/>plicable, and I beg those who do me the 
     <lb/>
     honour of listening to me to take note that 
     <lb/>
     a special provision would not have been 
     <lb/>
     necessary, that section 2 of the Bill would 
     <lb/>
     have been sufficient were it not that diffi<lb break="no"/>

     culty might have arisen from the use of 
     <lb/>
     the word 'province' in section 93, and be<lb break="no"/>cause of a doubt which was suggested as 
     <lb/>
     to the meaning of the words ' at the union.' 
     <lb/>
     Section 93. which would be applicable under 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of our Bill, reads:

     My difficulty was with respect to the 
     <lb/>
     words 'province' and 'at the union.' My 
     <lb/>
     view was that it was possible that these 
     <lb/>
     might be construed as applicable exclusively 
     <lb/>
     to a province, and could not be made ap<lb break="no"/>plicable to these Territories as brought in. 
     <lb/>
     and my firm determination was that there 
     <lb/>
     should be nothing left to uncertainty, so 
     <lb/>
     far as my responsibility went. My object 
     <lb/>
     was to make section 93 applicable, and my 
     <lb/>
     object was also to avoid a repetition of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba difficulty. I wanted to perpetuate 
     <lb/>
     the existing conditions, with which every<lb break="no"/>body in the Territories professes to be satis<lb break="no"/>fied. Now, if you take section 16 and read 
     <lb/>
     it in the light of that declaration. how would 
     <lb/>
     the law be with respect to these Territories? 
     <lb/>
     It would read as follows:

     intention of the government in 1870 to give 
     <lb/>
     to the minority in Manitoba the right to 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     that time, and I also knew that the Act, 
     <lb/>
     drafted under these circumstances, was 
     <lb/>
     submitted for consideration to their Lord<lb break="no"/>ships of the Privy Council; and they felt 
     <lb/>
     it to be their duty to declare that the man 
     <lb/>
     who drew that Act, the draughtsman of 
     <lb/>
     that day, had failed to carry out the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of the legislature. I made up my mind

     that the draughtsman of to-day, so far as 
     <lb/>
     his limited light allowed him to go, would 
     <lb/>

     It was not doubted that the object of the 1st 
     <lb/>
     subsection of section 22 was to afford protec<lb break="no"/>tion to denominational schools, or that it was 
     <lb/>
     proper to have regard to the intent of the 
     <lb/>
     legislature and the surrrounding circumstances 
     <lb/>
     in interpreting the enactment. But the ques<lb break="no"/>tion which had to be determined was the true

     construction of the language used. The func<lb break="no"/>tion of a tribunal is limited to construing the

     to the Dominion of Canada to fix the terms

     asked for. The imperial authorities of that

     <lb/>
     the traditions of the imperial parliament, 
     <lb/>
     the mother of parliaments, the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of that people who have always held sacred 
     <lb/>
     their covenants, acting through their repre<lb break="no"/>sentative, Lord Granville, sent to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor General of Canada a cablegram on 
     <lb/>
     the 5th of March, 1870, which reads as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

     Dealing now with section 16, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to say that the second paragraph in that' 
     <lb/>
     section was added—although in my judg<lb break="no"/>ment absolutey unnecessary—because it was 
     <lb/>
     thought advisable to re-enact the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of section 11 of the Act of 1875. This was 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of making it quite clear 
     <lb/>
     that this parliament was merely carrying 
     <lb/>
     out a solemn promise already made. That 
     <lb/>
     very paragraph was intended to give legis<lb break="no"/>lative sanction to the conditions now exist<lb break="no"/>ing with respect to grants in aid of educa<lb break="no"/>tion. At the present time these grants are 
     <lb/>
     dependent upon an annual vote of the legis<lb break="no"/>lature, and it was not clear to me that the 
     <lb/>
     annual grant made by the legislature gave 
     <lb/>
     to those who benefit by it a right or pri<lb break="no"/>vilege within the meaning of section 93. 
     <lb/>
     And I thought that if separate schools are 
     <lb/>
     to exist, they should be made effective for 
     <lb/>
     the purposes for which they were intended 
     <lb/>
     and should be placed, to use the words of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Balfour, in a position in which they 
     <lb/>
     can effectively play their necessary and 
     <lb/>
     inevitable part in the scheme of national 
     <lb/>
     education. I have given you now, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, the whole secret of section 16. 
     <lb/>
     Where now are the shackles, the manacles, 
     <lb/>
     the invasion of provincial rights? What 
     <lb/>
     are we doing? I say that in the future 
     <lb/>
     it would be a serious reflection upon the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Dominion if the solemn pro<lb break="no"/>mises made in 1875, repeated in 1880, and 
     <lb/>
     oft repeated since were not carried out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is unnecessary for me to go over what 
     <lb/>
     occurred in 1875. That will be found in 
     <lb/>
     the debates of the Senate and the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons when the Bill was introduced. 
     <lb/>
     All that has been gone over repeatedly, but 
     <lb/>
     let me draw attention to a fact not yet men<lb break="no"/>tioned, namely, that a year later, in 1876, 
     <lb/>
     the Keewatin Bill was introduced by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie. and from the Bill clause 11 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1875 was omitted. On being

     rightly proposed, a system which gave rudi<lb break="no"/>mentary representative institutions <choice><sic>coincident<lb break="no"/>ly</sic><corr>coincidentally</corr></choice> with its going into effect. The Bill of this 
     <lb/>
     session takes off a very small portion of the

     enormous territories of the Northwest for the

     particular purpose which my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     premier clearly explained. . . If this ter<lb break="no"/>ritory is annexed to Manitoba the laws of that 
     <lb/>
     province relating to schools will apply to it. 
     <lb/>
     If reannexed to the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     clause 11 of the Act of last session will apply. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Mousseau said this clause seemed to em<lb break="no"/>power the government of the new province to 
     <lb/>
     repeal clause 11 of the Act of last session 
     <lb/>
     securing separate schools to the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territory. He wished to know if this was 
     <lb/>
     the case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. Blake said that the 11th clause of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territory Act was not yet in 
     <lb/>
     force, and would not apply to any of these 
     <lb/>
     Territories until the Act was proclaimed. It 
     <lb/>
     was a. clause which could only come into force 
     <lb/>
     practically in connection with a system of tax<lb break="no"/>ation, no provision for which was made in this 
     <lb/>
     portion of the Territories so long as it re<lb break="no"/>mained under this form of government. The 
     <lb/>
     future of these Territories would be either one 
     <lb/>
     of two things—they would be annexed to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba or they would be detached from Keewatin 
     <lb/>
     and reannexed to the Northwest. In either 
     <lb/>
     case the rights of the minority would be pro<lb break="no"/>tected. There was no intention on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the government to depart from the general 
     <lb/>
     principle of the 11th clause. If the Territories 
     <lb/>
     were attached to Manitoba they would be sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the laws of that province; if to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest they would come under the 11th 
     <lb/>
     clause of the Act of last session.

     Sir JOHN MACDONALD. If I understand it, 
     <lb/>
     by simply proclaiming the Act of 1875 this 11th 
     <lb/>
     clause will come into force. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     In 1875 there was, my hon. friends will 
     <lb/>
     remember, the discussion of which I have 
     <lb/>
     just spoken on this clause 11. There was 
     <lb/>
     again a discussion in 1876 on the Keewatin 
     <lb/>
     Act, and it seems to me a sad commentary 
     <lb/>
     on our boasted progress in the direction of 
     <lb/>
     nation building to find that the clause 
     <lb/>
     introduced in 1875, which received the prac<lb break="no"/>tical approval of both political parties and 
     <lb/>
     of the press of both parties in the country 
     <lb/>
    cannot be re-enacted to-day. We do 
     <lb/>not seem to have gone very far on 
     <lb/>the road towards nation building, when 
     <lb/>we cannot do to-day, what we could 
     <lb/>do in 1875. I do not know that it is 
     <lb/>necessary for me to remind the House of 
     <lb/>that extract from the ' Mail ' of April, 1875, 
     <lb/>which was quoted by my hon. friend from

     That appears to have been the policy of

     the Conservative party, in those days, and 
     <lb/>
     certainly it was a policy worthy of the best 
     <lb/>
     traditions of that party. I have not said 
     <lb/>
     anything of the character of the schools 
     <lb/>
    in the Northwest nor of my personal 
     <lb/>preference with respect to a system 
     <lb/>of education. My duty was simply to 
     <lb/>give effect to a system which was intro<lb break="no"/>duced in 1875 in the Territories and which 
     <lb/>has been established and improved by the 
     <lb/>free will of the people of those Territories. 
     <lb/>It has been suggested that the Territories 
     <lb/>wish to rid themselves of this incubus of 
     <lb/>separate schools, and we have been referred 
     <lb/>to a resolution that was passed by the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial Assembly in October 1889, asking 
     <lb/>that a humble address be presented, pray<lb break="no"/>ing that an Act be passed to repeal sub<lb break="no"/>section 1 of section 14. True such a reso<lb break="no"/>lution was passed in 1889, but let me draw 
     <lb/>attention to a resolution which was passed 
     <lb/>in 1890, the following year. In that year 
     <lb/>the following resolution was passed : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Moved by Mr. Richardson, seconded by Mr.

     <lb/>
     this House passed the following resolution, viz: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Resolved, that an humble address be pre<lb break="no"/>sented to His Excellency the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral in Council, the Senate and the House of

     Commons praying that an Act be passed 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     word 'education' in the second line. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas such address was duly presented 
     <lb/>
     by way of memorial passed on the 6th Novem<lb break="no"/>ber, 1889, 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     With time and consideration came wis<lb break="no"/>dom. That resolution was put to the House 
     <lb/>
     and how did it result ? Six voted in favour 
     <lb/>
     of it, and 15 against it. And there this 
     <lb/>
     agitation with respect to the repeal of the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the Act having reference to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools ended, and we have heard 
     <lb/>
     nothing of it since. And of course, the 
     <lb/>
     present Prime Minister of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, Mr. Haultain, voted against the 
     <lb/>
     resolution and in favour of maintaining the 
     <lb/>
     present condition. But that is not all ; we 
     <lb/>
     have something even more recent. We have 
     <lb/>
     heard quite recently about the extension 
     <lb/>
     of the Manitoba boundaries and the desir<lb break="no"/>ability of extending those boundaries has 
     <lb/>
     been dwelt upon. And in that connection 
     <lb/>
     we have heard references more forcible than 
     <lb/>
     polite to a gentleman who is supposed to 
     <lb/>
     have been in some way connected with 
     <lb/>

     that matter, notwithstanding his formal 
     <lb/>
     denial. But what has that to do with the 
     <lb/>
     school question of the Northwest ? I shall 
     <lb/>
     be asked. Let the draw attention to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that as recently as 1901 a joint debate 
     <lb/>
     took place at .Indian Head, in eastern As<lb break="no"/>siniboia, between Mr. Roblin and Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain upon this very question of the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the Manitoba boundary. Mr. Roblin 
     <lb/>
     put forth the reason why the people of that 
     <lb/>
     little place should declare themselves to be 
     <lb/>
     in favour of the extension of the bound<lb break="no"/>aries of Manitoba, at the expense of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, Mr. Haultain, on the 
     <lb/>
     other hand, arguing against the proposi<lb break="no"/>tion and seeking to convince the people that 
     <lb/>
     it was to their interest to remain in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories and that the bound<lb break="no"/>aries of Manitoba should not extend west<lb break="no"/>ward. And what, Sir, were the reasons 
     <lb/>
     given by Mr. Haultain to induce them to 
     <lb/>
     resist the blandishments of Mr. Roblin 
     <lb/>
     and to oppose the extension of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     boundary ? The joint debate is report<lb break="no"/>ed in the Regina 'Leader' of January 20, 
     <lb/>
     1902, and Mr. Haultain's argument is 
     <lb/>
     summed up in these words: 'Good roads. 
     <lb/>
     Railways. Schools. Water.' Referring to 
     <lb/>
     the school question, he says :

     I said a moment ago that I expressed no 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the relative merits of public 
     <lb/>
     and separate schools. Not because I en<lb break="no"/>tertain any doubt myself as to the proper 
     <lb/>
     system of education, or as to the necessity 
     <lb/>
     for religious teaching in our schools; not 
     <lb/>
     because I do not believe in the voluntary 
     <lb/>
     school, for, undoubtedly I do believe in 
     <lb/>
     that school, because I think that school is 
     <lb/>
     the only school consistent with absolute 
     <lb/>
     freedom of conscience for which I have al<lb break="no"/>ways stood. As for the common school, 
     <lb/>
     bringing all the children together, so that 
     <lb/>
     there may be uniformity, I have very little 
     <lb/>
     to say. My view has been that the indi<lb break="no"/>vidual ought to be developed. I do not 
     <lb/>
     want uniformity any more than I want 
     <lb/>
     monotony—both stand practically in the 
     <lb/>
     same light, so far as I am concerned. I 
     <lb/>
     believe in the development of the individual 
     <lb/>
     as I believe in the doctrine of self-help. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps, later on, I may have occasion to 
     <lb/>
     say a few words more about that doctrine. 
     <lb/>
     I argue that what was said and done in 
     <lb/>
     1875, what was said and done in 1876, and 
     <lb/>
     in 1880, and 1885, and 1894, puts upon this 
     <lb/>
     parliament the imperative obligation to give 
     <lb/>
     effect to the promises and pledges then 
     <lb/>
     made. In 1875, Hon. George Brown, when 
     <lb/>
     section 11 of the Act of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories of that year was up for considera<lb break="no"/>tion said :

     It is true that Hon. George Brown was 
     <lb/>
     not a lawyer, but he had taken a promin<lb break="no"/>ent and important part, a part, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     second to that of no one else in the confed<lb break="no"/>eration debates, and he must be presumed 
     <lb/>
     to have understood the meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. He said that 
     <lb/>
     if the Act of 1875. which contained section 
     <lb/>
     11 guaranteeing separate schools to the mi<lb break="no"/>nority in the Territories, were allowed to 
     <lb/>
     continue until the Territories came into the 
     <lb/>
     union, then those schools became part of 
     <lb/>
     their constitution. Not only was that the 
     <lb/>
     view held by Hon. George Brown, but 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Dalton McCarthy, in 1894, speaking of 
     <lb/>
     the clause relating to separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     which he wished to have repealed, said:

     legislation be operative in any new province 
     <lb/>
     immediately upon its creation as a province.

            <p>
     3. Therefore, if there should be at the time 
     <lb/>
     when a new province is established which is, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, the meaning of the words 'at 
     <lb/>
     the union' in section 93, any right or- privilege 
     <lb/>
     in respect to denominational schools existing 
     <lb/>
     by law there, such right or privilege shall be 
     <lb/>
     protected by section 93.

     Now, Mr. Clement, without hesitation, de<lb break="no"/>clares in the same sense that Mr. Dalton 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy did, namely, that if there are 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in existence in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories at the time these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories come into the union—that is to-day 
     <lb/>
     these separate schools are entitled to the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional protection afforded by sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93. There is the opinion of Mr. Cle<lb break="no"/>ment. who was quoted against me the other 
     <lb/>
     day by the leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     May I now deal for a moment with the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of my hon. friend the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition? I have attempted to 
     <lb/>
     make the position of the government ab<lb break="no"/>solutely clear, would it not now proper 
     <lb/>
     for us to know exactly what the position 
     <lb/>
     of the leader of the opposition is? Is it 
     <lb/>
     the intention of the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     to ignore existing conditions. and public on 
     <lb/>
     gagements resulting from the legislation of 
     <lb/>
     the past in this House. and the speeches 
     <lb/>
     made in explanation and support of them ? 
     <lb/>
     Is it his intention to say to the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories that they should not have that pro<lb break="no"/>tection that other minorities in all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion now have ? I 
     <lb/>
     have read the amendment naturally with 
     <lb/>
     care, and I must confess that l have been 
     <lb/>
     at a loss to understand exactly his position 
     <lb/>
     on that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now I will deal with one or two of the 
     <lb/>
     minor criticisms that have been offered 
     <lb/>
     against this legislation. It has been made 
     <lb/>
     a matter of reproach to the government 
     <lb/>
     that we did not declare our policy on this 
     <lb/>
     school question before the last election. 
     <lb/>
     Our policy, the policy of the Liberal party, 
     <lb/>
     was absolutely clear. it was not necessary 
     <lb/>
     for us to make any declaration; our policy 
     <lb/>
     was to follow the law in the letter and in 
     <lb/>
     the spirit; our policy was to give eifect to 
     <lb/>
     the legislation introduced in 1875 by the 
     <lb/>
     great leader of the Liberal party, the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Alexander Mackenzie and supported by 
     <lb/>
     Edward Blake. to give effect to that 
     <lb/>
     policy by our legislation. What about the 
     <lb/>
     opposition? Did they declare their policy 
     <lb/>
     on this question when they went up and 
     <lb/>
     down the country discussing the question 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
           

     of autonomy for the Northwest Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     Did they declare what their policy was 
     <lb/>
     with respect to separate schools? I have 
     <lb/>
     yet to learn that they did. But I think 
     <lb/>
     it would have been somewhat embarrassing 
     <lb/>
     to them to do it. in view of the spectacle 
     <lb/>
     we have had in this House during the last 
     <lb/>
     few weeks. They would have had one 
     <lb/>
     policy for Ontario and another policy for 
     <lb/>
     Quebec; and as to the policy in the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, I leave it to the imagination of 
     <lb/>
     each one to conceive what it might have 
     <lb/>
     been. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now another criticism that has been made 
     <lb/>
     is that Mr. Sifton was not consulted about 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. Mr. Speaker, I have little to add 
     <lb/>
     to what I have already said incidentally on 
     <lb/>
     that subject. I can say now that Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton handed to me personally a draft Bill 
     <lb/>
     as prepared by those who represented the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, and that on that 
     <lb/>
     Bill were notes written in his own hand<lb break="no"/>writing with respect to this question of 
     <lb/>
     schools. which I understood is the only 
     <lb/>
     question that we differed about. I have 
     <lb/>
     the notes here, which I will read: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Make memo of present provisions in law re<lb break="no"/>lating to the Northwest Territories as to public 
     <lb/>
     schools and provisions in other constitutional 
     <lb/>
     Acts. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Beyond that, I never had a conference 
     <lb/>
     with Mr. Sifton, beyond that, he is in no 
     <lb/>
     respect responsible for section 16 of this 
     <lb/>
     Bill. Now I have endeavoured at all times 
     <lb/>
     to shut my eyes and to close my ears to 
     <lb/>
     the idle chatter which we hear in the 
     <lb/>
     streets; I have endeavoured at all times to 
     <lb/>
     ignore the professional maligner who goes 
     <lb/>
     about for the purpose of endeavouring to 
     <lb/>
     create disturbances between friends. So 
     <lb/>
     far as I am concerned—I speak out openly, 
     <lb/>
     I have nothing to hide. nothing to be afraid 
     <lb/>
     of, either here or outside—I say that the 
     <lb/>
     honest differences that have existed. if any 
     <lb/>
     have existed, between Mr. Sifton and my<lb break="no"/>self with respect to this Bill, are differences 
     <lb/>
     which any two self-willed and perhaps 
     <lb/>
     rather strong-minded men might have. 
     <lb/>
     But they have never extended beyond that. 
     <lb/>
     and any man who says they have, any man 
     <lb/>
     who, either in this House or out of it, says 
     <lb/>
     anything to the contrary, says what he 
     <lb/>
     knows to be untrue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now there is another point to which I 
     <lb/>
     wish to refer. A criticism has been offer<lb break="no"/>ed as to the composition of the subcom<lb break="no"/>mittee that was appointed by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to confer with the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories with respect to 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of this Bill. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     say that it is somewhat embarrassing to 
     <lb/>
     answer the charge that a man should not 
     <lb/>
     be Minister of Justice, or form part of 
     <lb/>
     that committee because he happens to be 
     <lb/>
     a Roman Catholic. The Prime Minister was 
     <lb/>
     a member of that committee. Was it im<lb break="no"/>proper thnt the Prime Minister should be 
     <lb/>
     a member of this important subcommittee? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <pb n="5353" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5353.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5353</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 3, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">5354</fw>
            
<p>
     Is it proper that the Secretary of State, the 
     <lb/>
     official channel of communication between 
     <lb/>
     thls government and the government of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. should be a member 
     <lb/>
     of that committee? Is it any crime in him 
     <lb/>
     that he should be a Roman Catholic? Was 
     <lb/>
     it proper that the Minister of Justice should 
     <lb/>
     be a member of that committee? I am 
     <lb/>
     technically responsible for the drafting of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. Was it not right that I should 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity to consider the repre<lb break="no"/>sentations of those who were the delegates 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     in order that I might know how to draft 
     <lb/>
     the Bill ? I won't say that it is not my fault 
     <lb/>
     that I am a Roman Catholic, because it is. 
     <lb/>
     That sort of criticism, it seems to me, may 
     <lb/>
     well be described as the small change of 
     <lb/>
     parish politics. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now a reference has been made to an 
     <lb/>
     opinion expressed by me long ago about 
     <lb/>
     the elementary schools in Quebec. I did 
     <lb/>
     criticise the elementary schools in Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     because I thought they were bad. I told 
     <lb/>
     the people who were interested, and upon 
     <lb/>
     whose votes I depended for my election, 
     <lb/>
     that I thought their schools were bad and 
     <lb/>
     they ought to improve them. They have 
     <lb/>
     set about improving them. But let me 
     <lb/>
     draw the attention of the House to this 
     <lb/>
     fact, that the elementary schools I criticised 
     <lb/>
     are not the clerical schools of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, they are the schools that are 
     <lb/>
     under control of school trustees, which 
     <lb/>
     trustees are elected by ratepayers—those 
     <lb/>
     are the schools that I criticised. The cleri<lb break="no"/>cal schools of the province of Quebec are the 
     <lb/>
     colleges of that province where the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     members from that province were in large 
     <lb/>
     part educated; and without saying any<lb break="no"/>thing in favour of the system of education 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec—you have heard 
     <lb/>
     some of our French colleagues from that 
     <lb/>
     province speak in this House, and may I 
     <lb/>
     not say of the school system that produces 
     <lb/>
     the men who represent that province, and 
     <lb/>
     the men who made these speeches: Justifi<lb break="no"/>cata est Saipientia e fillis suis. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, after having apologized 
     <lb/>
     for trespassing so far on the attention of 
     <lb/>
     this House, I want to say a word in praise 
     <lb/>
     of the calm and dignified attitude in the 
     <lb/>
     present circumstance of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec, that much maligned 
     <lb/>
     province which was said to be so deficient 
     <lb/>
     and backward in the cause of education. 
     <lb/>
     Take the facilities for higher education 
     <lb/>
     offered by Laval University, and you shall 
     <lb/>
     find that the blessings of a liberal education 
     <lb/>
     are brought within the reach of a poorer 
     <lb/>
     class of people in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     than is probably the case in any other coun<lb break="no"/>try in the world. There are no great en<lb break="no"/>dowments to make fees a matter of slight 
     <lb/>
     consequence. but the spirit of self-sacrifice 
     <lb/>
     is abiding tradition within its walls, and 
     <lb/>
     its doors are open to all-comers because its 
     <lb/>
     professors are content to work for a mere 
     <lb/>
     pittance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>


            <p>
     On the other hand, nowhere has private 
     <lb/>
     wealth recognized its public duties with 
     <lb/>
     greater generosity than in that province. 
     <lb/>
     It is not necessary to recall in the presence 
     <lb/>
     of the members of the Canadian House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons the names of the men whose bene<lb break="no"/>factions have endowed McGill University 
     <lb/>
     with the revenues of a principality. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We must all admit to-day that the hammer 
     <lb/>
     stroke that drove home the last rivet in the 
     <lb/>
     last rail in the line which now unites the 
     <lb/>
     west and the east with a band of iron did 
     <lb/>
     something more than complete one of the 
     <lb/>
     greatest engineering feats of the kind. It 
     <lb/>
     put an end to the old era in which Canada 
     <lb/>
     was a mere geographical expression for a 
     <lb/>
     number of sundered and mutinous and some<lb break="no"/>times squabbling provinces, and it gave to 
     <lb/>
     the conscious nation what it shall ever show 
     <lb/>
     in the face of trial—a backbone of steel. 
     <lb/>
     This scheme originated in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and was carried to a successful com<lb break="no"/>pletion by men from that province. I shall 
     <lb/>
     not attempt to forecast the future, or to 
     <lb/>
     say what fate Heaven holds in store for the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories—a peo<lb break="no"/>ple so blessed in the past, and so greatly 
     <lb/>
     expectant of the morrow, and so truly the 
     <lb/>
     heirs of the best that the old world had to 
     <lb/>
     give. The earth and the riches thereof is 
     <lb/>
     stretched out before them, inviting them to 
     <lb/>
     the work of developing to the utmost the 
     <lb/>
     resources of their great inheritance, and the 
     <lb/>
     task may well oecupy the noblest energies 
     <lb/>
     of their children and of their children's 
     <lb/>
     children. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But if they look back to the small begin<lb break="no"/>nings of Canadian history they shall see that 
     <lb/>
     fidelity and constancy have been the con<lb break="no"/>spicuous qualities in the characters of both 
     <lb/>
     the great stocks from which the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     people are mainly derived. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may, therefore, be inferred without rash<lb break="no"/>ness that they are not likely to run after 
     <lb/>
     strange fads, but rather to stand in the 
     <lb/>
     ancient ways, true to the principles of jus<lb break="no"/>tice and fair-play, and not likely to be driven 
     <lb/>
     by stripes or attracted by even the most 
     <lb/>
     brilliant stars as I have heard it sometimes 
     <lb/>
     suggested; but instead thereof, a free and 
     <lb/>
     contented people, to work out their destinies 
     <lb/>
     in these young provinces under the benign 
     <lb/>
     influence of the generous, equitable prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the Canadian constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     At six o'clock, House took recess.

     <persName ref="pers:BARK1">Mr. S. BARKER</persName> (Hamilton). Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, in the remarks I am about to make I 
     <lb/>
     hope I shall be able to avoid everything 
     <lb/>
     which may have the appearance of what 
     <lb/>
     some hon. gentlemen opposite call intole<lb break="no"/>rance. I may say that I have never yet 
     <lb/>
     heard one remark from a member on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House that deserved such an 
     <lb/>
    epithet. I am glad to be able to say that 
     <lb/>
     

            <pb n="5355" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5355.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">5356</fw>
         

     not very many hon. gentlemen opposite have 
     <lb/>
     taken that line in this debate, but there are 
     <lb/>
     some gentlemen who have seemed unable 
     <lb/>
     to make allowance for honest difference of 
     <lb/>
     opinion, or to understand that gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House may advocate 
     <lb/>
     national schools without inflammatory in<lb break="no"/>tention and without being firebrands. It 
     <lb/>
     has been some relief to us, that of those 
     <lb/>
     who have made such charges the majority 
     <lb/>
     are not from the province of Quebec as 
     <lb/>
     perhaps we might naturally have expected 
     <lb/>
     to find them. If we had heard some such 
     <lb/>
     remarks from hon. gentlemen from that 
     <lb/>
     province we might perhaps have made some 
     <lb/>
     excuse for them treating the matter 
     <lb/>
     somewhat hotly from their point of view. 
     <lb/>
     But these remarks have been rather from 
     <lb/>
     the members from other provinces, and I 
     <lb/>
     have noticed that they have come from some 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side of the House 
     <lb/>
     from whose records in the past few years 
     <lb/>
     we might have expected that they would 
     <lb/>
     have been inclined to be silent on such a 
     <lb/>
     subject. When I listened to some of these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen casting such epithets across the 
     <lb/>
     floor and charging hon. gentlemen on this 
     <lb/>
     side with being firebrands, I was reminded 
     <lb/>
     of the old Jacobite toast : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     'Down with the Pretender ; God save the 
     <lb/>
    King ; 
     <lb/>
But which is Pretender and which is 
     <lb/>King ? 
     <lb/>
     God save us all, that's a different thing.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not propose, Mr. Speaker, to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the question of religious education. If I 
     <lb/>
     did so I should be disposed to deal with it 
     <lb/>
     not as a question of creed or race. I do not 
     <lb/>
     see why it should be a question of creed. 
     <lb/>
     The feeling in favour of religious education 
     <lb/>
     in the schools is not confined to any one 
     <lb/>
     church. In the Church of England, espe<lb break="no"/>cially in the old land, there is a very strong 
     <lb/>
     feeling in favour of religious education ; I 
     <lb/>
     venture to say there is quite as earnest and 
     <lb/>
     strong a feeling on that subject among the 
     <lb/>
     clergy of the Church of England as there 
     <lb/>
     is on the part of the clergy of the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic Church. There is surely a great 
     <lb/>
     deal to he said in favour of it. Is there 
     <lb/>
     anybody who will deny that even in this 
     <lb/>
     prosperous land and in perhaps every pro<lb break="no"/>vince of it, there are thousands upon thou<lb break="no"/>sands of parents utterly incompetent and 
     <lb/>
     unfit to give to their children teaching in 
     <lb/>
     the most rudimentary elements of Christ<lb break="no"/>ianity ? There are many parents who 
     <lb/>
     are utterly indifferent to religion, and 
     <lb/>
     there are others whose unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     circumstances prevent them doing what 
     <lb/>
     otherwise they might be willing to 
     <lb/>
     do. Well, Sir, sometimes we hear 
     <lb/>
     as regards the children of these parents, 
     <lb/>
     the rather light remark : Why not send 
     <lb/>
     them to the Sunday schools. But the 
     <lb/>
     classes of people to whom I allude are just 
     <lb/>
     those who will not send their children to 
     <lb/>
     the Sunday schools so careless and indiffer<lb break="no"/>ent are they. Those children then cannot 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
         

     receive any religious education there, and 
     <lb/>
     is it to be wondered at that zealous men 
     <lb/>
     who believe it is their calling and duty to 
     <lb/>
     find the children where best they can to 
     <lb/>
     impart religious instruction to them, are 
     <lb/>
     glad to seek them in the only schools where 
     <lb/>
     such children can be compelled to attend. 
     <lb/>
     Under these circumstances it is neither 
     <lb/>
     just nor fair to scoff and sneer at those 
     <lb/>
     who feel so strongly upon this subject. But, 
     <lb/>
     at the same time there is a great deal to 
     <lb/>
     be said on the opposite side of the question 
     <lb/>
     and whether we are in favour of national 
     <lb/>
     schools or in favour of religious teaching 
     <lb/>
     in the schools, we surely ought be able to 
     <lb/>
     discuss our difference fairly and to avoid 
     <lb/>
     charging each other with intolerance or 
     <lb/>
     bigotry because we take one side or the 
     <lb/>
     other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In my opinion the question of religious 
     <lb/>
     education or separate schools is not at all 
     <lb/>
     for this parliament: the question lies, in my 
     <lb/>
     judgment, solely with the people of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces who are immediately concerned. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, I agree fully with the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for South Toronto, when he said that 
     <lb/>
     it is in the true and lasting interests of the 
     <lb/>
     minority that the matter should be left to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the new provinces. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that separate schools should exist by force 
     <lb/>
     of law only when that law emanates from 
     <lb/>
     the people among whom it is to be enforced. 
     <lb/>
     If the people themselves grant the right, 
     <lb/>
     let it be so and let the privilege be main<lb break="no"/>tained. But if this parliament should im<lb break="no"/>pose such schools on the provinces, it is 
     <lb/>
     in human nature to resist and obstruct. 
     <lb/>
     and you will find that that which a free 
     <lb/>
     man will give of his own accord he will 
     <lb/>
     never grant under compulsion. I might 
     <lb/>
     quote on this subject the great writer, Ma<lb break="no"/>cauley, who has said :

     have a system of separate schools far bet<lb break="no"/>ter—according to his description—than any

     the language used by his Minister of In<lb break="no"/>land Revenue, when that gentleman in 
     <lb/>speaking of the wisdom of trusting to the 
     <lb/>generosity and fair-play of the people, he 
     <lb/>applied that in answer to a supposed ar<lb break="no"/>gument that this law could not be enforced 
     <lb/>and he said : You may trust to the genero<lb break="no"/>sity, and it is wise to trust to the generosity 
     <lb/>and fair-play of the people. Well, if that 
     <lb/>be so, why not trust the people of the west. 
     <lb/>Does the Minister of Inland Revenue sup<lb break="no"/>pose that he is going to approach this peo<lb break="no"/>ple with any hope of success when he only 
     <lb/>half trusts them ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Is he likely to get a people to treat him 
     <lb/>
     with generosity when he goes to them with 
     <lb/>
     a clenched fist and in effect says to them, I 
     <lb/>
     ask you to do this, but if you do not do it, 
     <lb/>
     I will make you do it? That is the sort 
     <lb/>
     of trust the hon. gentleman seems to wish 
     <lb/>
     to indulge in. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I have said, I propose to confne my 
     <lb/>
     remarks to the educational feature of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, and I think it is well to consider at 
     <lb/>
     the very outset what is the real basis of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution as regards education. The 
     <lb/>
     subject of education is wholly dealt with in 
     <lb/>
     section 93, and its subsections, of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act of 1867. In my opinion 
     <lb/>
     that section was intended to be a fnal and 
     <lb/>
     conclusive settlement of all controversies on 
     <lb/>
     the subject of education in this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     It was intended to put an end once and 
     <lb/>
     for ever, if possible, to such wranglings and 
     <lb/>
     bickerings as had been so hurtful to the 
     <lb/>
     old Canadas and their peoples. The methods 
     <lb/>
     laid down to accomplish this may not have 
     <lb/>
     been in every respect and to the minds of 
     <lb/>
     some men the very acme of wisdom and 
     <lb/>
     statesmanship ; but they certainly were the 
     <lb/>
     result of the earnest and loyal efforts of 
     <lb/>
     the best minds of that day, and they are 
     <lb/>
     the law, and as such should cheerfully and 
     <lb/>
     in all loyalty be respected even though 
     <lb/>
     there are here and there some men who 
     <lb/>
     may see what they would like to have 
     <lb/>
     otherwise. I do not wish to be understood, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, as in the remotest degree 
     <lb/>
     questioning the wisdom of that Act of 1867, 
     <lb/>
     in any particular, nor as finding fault with 
     <lb/>
     any clause or word in section 93. That 
     <lb/>
     clause dealt with a dfficult subject in, as I 
     <lb/>
     believe, a most comprehensive manner, and 
     <lb/>
     it would be most presumptious in me or I 
     <lb/>
     think in any man of the present day to 
     <lb/>
     say that he could have suggested any better 
     <lb/>
     method of accomplishing what was accom<lb break="no"/>plished by that section. The men of that 
     <lb/>
     day were old and practical statesmen, full 
     <lb/>
     of experience, alive to every danger, to 
     <lb/>
     every difficulty, and to every obstacle in the 
     <lb/>
     path of the aspirations of a people who, 
     <lb/>
     whatever their differences of race or creed, 
     <lb/>
     had in clear view a great Canadian nation<lb break="no"/>ality, one, undivided and inseparable. They 
     <lb/>
     endeavoured to lay down a basis, a guid<lb break="no"/>ing principle, as to education generally, and 
     <lb/>
     as regards separate schools in the various 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>


     provinces. They endeavoured to do this. 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, not only for the four original 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the confederation, but for 
     <lb/>
     other provinces which should come in, and 
     <lb/>
     for new provinces which might be created 
     <lb/>
     out of Territories taken into the union. In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion, provision was made, and wisely 
     <lb/>
     made, for every province, no matter when 
     <lb/>
     or how it should become a province. Once 
     <lb/>
     it became a Province, however, the law 
     <lb/>
     as laid down in section 93 and its subsec<lb break="no"/>tions at once applied. We fnd running 
     <lb/>
     through section 93 and its subsections one 
     <lb/>
     clear principle, that education is a subject 
     <lb/>
     for provincial legislation—that in no way 
     <lb/>
     whatever is education under any circum<lb break="no"/>stances a subject for Dominion legislation 
     <lb/>
     except by way of appeal under the remedial 
     <lb/>
     clause. That is the principle throughout 
     <lb/>
     the whole clause and the subclauses. Read 
     <lb/>
     the main clause, and read every subclause, 
     <lb/>
     and you will see nothing but that from be<lb break="no"/>ginning to end. The provincial power in 
     <lb/>
     reference to education, it is true, contains 
     <lb/>
     certain restrictions and conditions, but 
     <lb/>
     these conditions always relate to provincial 
     <lb/>
     status; they relate to no other status 
     <lb/>
     whatever; and it is quite clear that if any 
     <lb/>
     one or more subclauses do not apply to a 
     <lb/>
     particular province, that does not confer 
     <lb/>
     any jurisdiction upon the Dominion parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. The only effect is that the province 
     <lb/>
     can exercise power without being hampered 
     <lb/>
     by such subclauses. I therefore contend 
     <lb/>
     as a necessary result that parliament can 
     <lb/>
     neither legislate as to education, except in 
     <lb/>
     case of. appeal, nor can it add to or detract 
     <lb/>
     from or vary in any way the conditions on 
     <lb/>
     which provinces have authority to legis<lb break="no"/>late. We have questions bandied back and 
     <lb/>
     forth across the House as to what some 
     <lb/>
     particular gentleman of the legal profession 
     <lb/>
     thinks about the application of a certain 
     <lb/>
     clause. But why ask such questions ? The 
     <lb/>
     answer may be right or it may Ibe wrong. 
     <lb/>
     We can neither make it right nor make 
     <lb/>
     it wrong. If a subclause does apply in a 
     <lb/>
     particular case, we cannot prevent it apply<lb break="no"/>ing. If a clause of its own strength does 
     <lb/>
     not apply, we cannot by any Act of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament make it apply. We have no 
     <lb/>
     authority to interpret. Therefore why 
     <lb/>
     should we do more than apply the law as it 
     <lb/>
     is? Apply the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     and you thus apply section 93 subject to 
     <lb/>
     its subclauses; and that would mean that 
     <lb/>
     wherever one or more subclauses did 
     <lb/>
    effect a particular province, it took its 
     <lb/>powers of legislation subject to such 
     <lb/>subclauses alone. The rule establish<lb break="no"/>ed was that a province should have, 
     <lb/>full power, subject only to this, that what 
     <lb/>in the exercise of its own representative 
     <lb/>functions it once gave, that it could not 
     <lb/>take away. As to Territories, I may point 
     <lb/>out that while the British North America 
     <lb/>Act. 1867. deals with both provmces 
     <lb/>and Territories, section 93 and its sub<lb break="no"/>
         

            <pb n="5359" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5359.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5359</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">5360</fw>
         
clauses are strictly confined to provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I ask, was this accidental ?  I say no. 
     <lb/>
     That Act was contested and scrutinized in 
     <lb/>
     every line. If I recollect aright the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Bill was printed fve times, 
     <lb/>
     and on every occasion it was thoroughly scru<lb break="no"/>tinized and contested. There were men on 
     <lb/>
     both sides of the question. Quebec was 
     <lb/>
     strongly represented by men who had the 
     <lb/>
     interest of separate schools at heart. I 
     <lb/>
     think it is not too much to say that those 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen would have given a very careful 
     <lb/>
     attention to everything that might possibly 
     <lb/>
     affect the rights of their friends in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories; and yet, with all that care 
     <lb/>
     and oversight, there is not one word put in 
     <lb/>
     section 93 or its subsections relating to Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories; and why? For the very reason, 
     <lb/>
     the principle, that runs through the whole 
     <lb/>
     of section 93 and its subclauses ; because a 
     <lb/>
     territory has no representative; it has no 
     <lb/>
     power; it could not bind itself. A province 
     <lb/>
     could pass laws and could repeal or alter the 
     <lb/>
     laws, but they wanted to lay down the rule 
     <lb/>
     that a province having once given privileges 
     <lb/>
     in the nature of separate schools or re<lb break="no"/>ligious education, should be debarred from 
     <lb/>
     ever withdrawing them, or, where they had 
     <lb/>
     the power of repeal, as in some cases they 
     <lb/>
     had, and to repeal, or amendment, the pri<lb break="no"/>vileges so granted should be affected, 
     <lb/>
     or if by any act of authority, they 
     <lb/>
     should be affected, then in such cases 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion should have the power 
     <lb/>
     to grant remedial laws. But no such 
     <lb/>
     application of the principle is made to a 
     <lb/>
     territory or to anything that occurs during 
     <lb/>
     the territorial period. There is no pretense 
     <lb/>
     from first to last that anything done on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of a territory by the Dominion shall 
     <lb/>
     bind it when it becomes a province. There 
     <lb/>
     is an absolute exclusion of everything re<lb break="no"/>lating to the territorial period from section 
     <lb/>
     93 and its subclauses. But it is quite 
     <lb/>
     clear to my mind that the moment any pro<lb break="no"/>vince is either united, or established, at 
     <lb/>
     once the law as to education comes into 
     <lb/>
     operation; and as to that province section 
     <lb/>
     93 and its subclauses apply, though it may 
     <lb/>
     be that under the conditions only one of the 
     <lb/>
     subclauses may apply to the particular pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and that only on the happening of 
     <lb/>
     future events. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think it may be useful, even after all the 
     <lb/>
     discussion we have had, if I should refer to 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances in which the several pro<lb break="no"/>vinces stood at the time of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and how this clause 93 and its subclauses 
     <lb/>
     affected them. The four original provinces 
     <lb/>
     in confederation were the two Canadas, 
     <lb/>
     and New Brunswick and Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia. Ontario and Quebec (the two Can<lb break="no"/>adas) were in a different position from 
     <lb/>
     any other. Both those provinces had, 
     <lb/>
     in the exercise of their legislative func<lb break="no"/>tions, by-laws of their own legislature es<lb break="no"/>tablished separate schools. It was therefore 
     <lb/>
     considered right and just that those who had 
     <lb/>
     acquired, by the free will of the people of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces, certain privileges with re<lb break="no"/>
         
            <cb/>
     

     gard to education. should not afterwards 
     <lb/>
     bedeprived of them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Section 93, the main clause. which confers 
     <lb/>
     the power on all provinces. is in these words:

            </p>

     Clearly, that section applied to both On<lb break="no"/>tario and Quebec because such rights or

     privileges existed in those two provinces at 
     <lb/>
     the union, and it has such effect that if any

     attempt were made by either Ontario or

     Quebec to repeal or impair those rights or 
     <lb/>
     privileges that attempt would be ultra vires

     friend the Minister of Justice is proposing 
     <lb/>
     with regard to these new provinces, because 
     <lb/>
     it is that section, altered for the occasion. 
     <lb/>
     which he uses and applies to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The second subsection of section 93 I 
     <lb/>
     need not read, because it applies in its very 
     <lb/>
     terms to the provinces of Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec alone. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The third subsection is as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     (3) Where in any province a system of separate 
     <lb/>
     or dissentient schools exists by law at the 
     <lb/>
     union or is thereafter established by the leg<lb break="no"/>islature of the province, an appeal shall lie to 
     <lb/>
     the Governor General in Council from any Act 
     <lb/>
     or decision of any provincial authority affect<lb break="no"/>ing any right or privilege of the Protestant or 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's sub<lb break="no"/>jects in relation to education. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That clause also applied to Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, and was intended to protect the 
     <lb/>
     minority in those provinces against any at<lb break="no"/>tempt to impair by any act or decision of 
     <lb/>
     authority, the privileges they had been
     <lb/>
     granted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The fourth subsection is simply a remedial 
     <lb/>
     clause, which enables this parliament, in 
     <lb/>
     the case of an appeal under subsection 3 to 
     <lb/>
     do justice in the premises.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So you see that, as regards Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act of 1867 and all its subsections 
     <lb/>
     apply, but the other two provinces of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick were in a differ<lb break="no"/>ent position. Neither of those had deno<lb break="no"/>minational schools at the time it entered 
     <lb/>
     confederation. Therefore, subsection 1 could 
     <lb/>
     not possible apply and never can apply 
     <lb/>
     to either of them. They have not estab<lb break="no"/>lished separate schools to this day, so that 
     <lb/>
     subclauses 3 and 4, in fact none of the sub<lb break="no"/>clauses have come into operation with re<lb break="no"/>gard to them ; but one part of subsection 3 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="5361" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5361.jpg"/>
           
<fw type="num">5361</fw> <fw type="dateline">MAY 3, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">5362</fw> 
  

          

will come into operation the moment either<lb/>of those procinces hereafter grant separate<lb/>schools and afterwards, by any means, at<lb break="no"/>tempt to interfere with the privileges so<lb/>given. Thus you find the full protection of<lb/>all the subclauses afforded those two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec. And the pro<lb break="no"/>tection of 3 and 4 is fiven to the other two <lb/>provinces.<lb/>
            </p>
            

<p>
     
    But the Act contemplated that three 
     <lb/>other provinces should be brought in, 
     <lb/>and these would be in; a different 
     <lb/>position from New Brunswick or Nova 
     <lb/>Scotia. These three provinces were 
     <lb/>British Columbia, Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>and Newfoundland. I need not deal 
     <lb/>with Newfoundland, as it has never come in 
     <lb/>yet, but Prince Edward Island and British 
     <lb/>Columbia were in this position. They were 
     <lb/>not, like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>coming at once into confederation. It might 
     <lb/>be that before they did come in they would 
     <lb/>pass separate school laws; and, in that 
     <lb/>case, they would be in the position of On<lb break="no"/>tario and Quebec, and come into the union 
     <lb/>with school laws already in existence. Then, 
     <lb/>in my judgment, the whole of the four 
     <lb/>clauses would apply to them just as they 
     <lb/>apply to Ontario and Quebec. But they 
     <lb/>might come in and afterwards pass such 
     <lb/>laws. and then the subsections 3 and 4 
     <lb/>would apply. So that, as to all these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the greatest care was provided for 
     <lb/>every possible interest and for every variety 
     <lb/>of condition as to the province, consistent 
     <lb/>with this principle, that no province was 
     <lb/>bound to anything with regard to education, 
     <lb/>there was no limitation of the general 
     <lb/>power under section 93, which was not the 
     <lb/>result of its own free action. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
    

            <p>
     In addition, it was contemplated that we 
     <lb/>
     should take in the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     but there is not a word in this section about 
     <lb/>
     the Territories. However, in my opinion, 
     <lb/>
     whenever a territory in the Dominion is 
     <lb/>
     erected into a province, the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act with regard to 
     <lb/>
     education, as affecting a province, will im<lb break="no"/>mediately apply according to the circum<lb break="no"/>stances. Thus if we establish Alberta as a 
     <lb/>
     province in July next, subsection (1) cannot 
     <lb/>
     apply, because the terms of that subsection 
     <lb/>
     are not applicable to the case, and we have 
     <lb/>
     no authority to change the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act to make it fit any special case. 
     <lb/>
     The territory was taken into the union in 
     <lb/>
     1870. We are establishing it as a province 
     <lb/>
     in 1905. The words of subsection (1) do not 
     <lb/>
     provide for such a case, and however reason<lb break="no"/>able it might be, we cannot make them ap<lb break="no"/>plicable. But if after attaining its provin<lb break="no"/>cial status, Alberta should pass laws creat<lb break="no"/>ing separate school privileges, it will be 
     <lb/>
     bound by the general rule, and having thus 
     <lb/>
     of its own will granted the privilege, any<lb break="no"/>thing it may do thereafter to affect it will 
     <lb/>
     subject the province to the remedial opera<lb break="no"/>tions of subclauses 3 and 4. There is 
     <lb/>
     nothing in the whole Act from beginning to 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
     

     end to show that there was any intention 
     <lb/>
     or thought in the mind of any person that 
     <lb/>
     anything that might be done in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, under the authority or dictation of 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion, should bind or affect them 
     <lb/>
     as regards section 93 after they became a 
     <lb/>
     province. So it seems to me that through<lb break="no"/>out that statute the most careful provision 
     <lb/>
     was made for every privilege conceded by 
     <lb/>
     a province through its own legislature. As 
     <lb/>
     to such privileges, and those only the minor<lb break="no"/>ity was protected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     A good many hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     have endeavoured to argue that the territory 
     <lb/>
     is in some way bound by what has taken 
     <lb/>
     place in the last 30 years, that rights 
     <lb/>
     granted by this Dominion should be regard<lb break="no"/>ed as if granted by the Territories in the 
     <lb/>
     free exercise of representative institutions 
     <lb/>
     and that when a province comes into being 
     <lb/>
     it should be restricted and bound by what 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion has done. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     I look upon it in this way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These Territories are in the union; they 
     <lb/>
     have been in the union since 1870. From 
     <lb/>
     the moment they entered the union they 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to the rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act, but they 
     <lb/>
     had no power to exercise those rights until 
     <lb/>
     they attained the provincial status. The 
     <lb/>
     moment they attained that status they would 
     <lb/>
     be able to act and to bind themselves; but 
     <lb/>
     until then they were not bound by anything 
     <lb/>
     that might take place. It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     the Territories were very much in the same 
     <lb/>
     position as a young man who is entitled to 
     <lb/>
     an estate with the right to enter into 
     <lb/>
     possession when he is twenty-one years 
     <lb/>
     of age—he is always possessed of his 
     <lb/>
     property, it is his and he is entitled 
     <lb/>
     to it, but he cannot exercise his rights 
     <lb/>
     with regard to it until he has attained 
     <lb/>
     manhood, he cannot even detract from his 
     <lb/>
     own rights, cannot encumber his property, 
     <lb/>
     but the moment he comes of age he attains 
     <lb/>
     all power to do with his property as he 
     <lb/>
     chooses. So it is with a territory. The 
     <lb/>
     territory until it arrives at maturity, cannot 
     <lb/>
     speak for itself or act for itself, and it is 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the very principle of the Act we 
     <lb/>
     are dealing with to hold it down to what has 
     <lb/>
     been done without its own consent. Now, 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite wish to treat these 
     <lb/>
     Territories as bound by subsection 1, that is 
     <lb/>
     to treat them as a province now entering 
     <lb/>
     the union, on the 131: of July, 1905, with 
     <lb/>
     laws as to education in force. Well, if sub<lb break="no"/>section 1 applies, why not say so ? Why not 
     <lb/>
     apply it and let us see how far they are 
     <lb/>
     bound by it ? But could there be any 
     <lb/>
     stronger evidence of the fact that it is not 
     <lb/>
     applicable than the care the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice has taken to alter the section to fit it 
     <lb/>
     to the facts ? If the hon. gentleman thought 
     <lb/>
     that the subsection 1 really did apply, he 
     <lb/>
     would only have to say: 'Subsection 1 ap<lb break="no"/>plies to the province.' This is a very small 
     <lb/>
     subsection, though a very powerful one. It 
     <lb/>
     has only thirty-one words. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>
     

            <pb n="5363" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5363.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">5363</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">5364</fw>
          
man takes out nine words, and for these he 
     <lb/>
     substitutes thirty-six words and says: There 
     <lb/>
     is subsection (1) of the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act. And it is done so gently. Why, he 
     <lb/>
     simply says that Nos. 29 and 30 of the or<lb break="no"/>dinances shall be the basis of that section, 
     <lb/>
     and that the union shall be assumed to have 
     <lb/>
     taken place on the 1st of July, 1905— a union 
     <lb/>
     that took place thirty-five years ago. He 
     <lb/>
     changes the date of union simply in order to 
     <lb/>
     enable him to say that there are separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in existence on the lst of July, 1905, 
     <lb/>
     while if he said that the union was on 1st 
     <lb/>
     of July, 1870, he would have had to admit 
     <lb/>
     there were then no separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is a feature of this change to which 
     <lb/>
     I desire to call special attention. When the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman succeeds in getting his new 
     <lb/>
     subsection 1 made the law as to Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, these two provinces will be 
     <lb/>
     in a different position from any other pro<lb break="no"/>vince in the Dominion that has entered since 
     <lb/>
     confederation, and also from New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia. I think the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice will not deny that. Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, the moment this law comes 
     <lb/>
     into operation, will not have the same free<lb break="no"/>dom as others; they will be more strictly 
     <lb/>
     bound than Prince Edward Island, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba or 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia. And I will explain why. 
     <lb/>
     If any one of these provinces should hereafter 
     <lb/>
     choose to pass a separate school law and 
     <lb/>
     later on find that law objectionable and de<lb break="no"/>sire to amend it in a way that would affect 
     <lb/>
     some privilege previously granted, what 
     <lb/>
     would be the remedy of' those aggrieved ? 
     <lb/>
     Such a province might be quite willing to 
     <lb/>
     enact a separate school law knowing that it 
     <lb/>
     had the right to repeal that law, and knowing 
     <lb/>
     that the risk it ran through that repeal is 
     <lb/>
     that there might be an appeal to this Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament for remedial legislation, 
     <lb/>
     and it might be willing to take that risk of 
     <lb/>
     what this Dominion would do. But what will 
     <lb/>
     be the case with Alberta and Saskatchewan? 
     <lb/>
     They are put in the position of being bound 
     <lb/>
     by subsection 1 to retain all the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of ordinances 29 and 30 which give any pri<lb break="no"/>vilege to the minority. Any Act they might 
     <lb/>
     pass to curtail one single privilege granted 
     <lb/>
     under ordinances 29 and 30 would be ultra 
     <lb/>
     vires. It would not be necessary to come 
     <lb/>
     here for a remedial law; but the cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     sitting in chambers, would disallow the 
     <lb/>
     amending Act and put an end to it. It is a 
     <lb/>
     much more skilful system of coercion than 
     <lb/>
     was ever attempted upon Manitoba. There 
     <lb/>
     is no question as to the effect of it. If I 
     <lb/>
     am wrong, I should be glad if the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice will correct me 
     <lb/>
     now. I doubt if there is an hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House who ever 
     <lb/>
     believed that in approving of the proposed 
     <lb/>
     amending clause he was changing the whole 
     <lb/>
     basis of the law and putting Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan in a worse position than any 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces to which I have referred. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
   
            <cb/>
         

     Laurier) is absent, but had he been here, I 
     <lb/>
     would have asked him how it happened that 
     <lb/>
     when he explained this Bill he did not point 
     <lb/>
     out to the House this very material change 
     <lb/>
     he proposes in the condition of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces from that of the other provinces I 
     <lb/>
     have mentioned. I am not aware that the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister said one word upon that sub<lb break="no"/>ject. I doubt whether any hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     on the other side understood that the law 
     <lb/>
     was being so changed that it would be ultra 
     <lb/>
     vires for Alberta or Saskatchewan to pass 
     <lb/>
     any law to alter any privilege under ordi<lb break="no"/>nances 29 and 30. Why, fancy the position 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces. Here, for example, is an 
     <lb/>
     ordinance providing for the formation of the 
     <lb/>
     Board of Education. That board must have 
     <lb/>
     exactly five members, of whom three must 
     <lb/>
     be Protestants and two Roman Catholics. 
     <lb/>
     The province cannot alter that, but it must 
     <lb/>
     have always three Protestants and always 
     <lb/>
     two Roman Catholic on this Board of Edu<lb break="no"/>cation, or one party or other may say that 
     <lb/>
     their rights are being invaded. You must, 
     <lb/>
     for all time, have neither more nor less. The 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice was just about right 
     <lb/>
     when he said that he intended to have no 
     <lb/>
     doubt about the position. I think there can 
     <lb/>
     be no doubt of it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the Minister of Justice went through 
     <lb/>
     the several addresses. I do not intend to 
     <lb/>
     follow him at any length, but in order that 
     <lb/>
     i may state clearly my point of view, it 
     <lb/>
     is necessary that I should follow him very 
     <lb/>
     shortly. Under section 146 of the Britsh 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, provision was made for 
     <lb/>
     taking in provinces and territories. There 
     <lb/>
     was this distinction between taking in a 
     <lb/>
     province and taking in a territory. A pro<lb break="no"/>vince was to be taken in upon an address 
     <lb/>
     of the legislative assembly of the province 
     <lb/>
     and of the two Houses of this parliament. 
     <lb/>
     But inasmuch as a territory had no legis<lb break="no"/>lature, it was provided that a territory 
     <lb/>
     should be taken in on an address of this 
     <lb/>
     parliament alone. Well, in 1867 the two 
     <lb/>
     House of Parliament did address Her 
     <lb/>
     Majesty and ask that the Territories should 
     <lb/>
     be taken into the union. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman went on to read an Act of 1868 
     <lb/>
     and other matters, at some length, but 
     <lb/>
     I do not see that they have any bearing 
     <lb/>
     whatever upon the question that we are 
     <lb/>
     discussing; probably his object was to give 
     <lb/>
     an historical narrative of what took place. 
     <lb/>
     The fact was that after the address of 
     <lb/>
     December, 1867, there was delay owing to 
     <lb/>
     the negotiations pending to buy out the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the Hudson Bay Company, That 
     <lb/>
     caused delay, but in course of time the 
     <lb/>
     purchase was made, and again in 1869 
     <lb/>
     our address was renewed. I will read 
     <lb/>
     a word or two from that address. It 
     <lb/>
     prayed : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <lb/>

            <p>
     On the 23rd of June, 1870, an imperial 
     <lb/>
     Order in Council was passed, and as was 
     <lb/>
     pointed out by the leader of the opposition, 
     <lb/>
     that Order in Council has all the effect or 
     <lb/>
     an imperial Act of parliament, by virtue of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act. Now that 
     <lb/>
     order recited the Act of 1867 which pro<lb break="no"/>vided for the admission of Rupert's Land 
     <lb/>
     and the Northwest Territories into the 
     <lb/>
     union on terms and conditions expressed in 
     <lb/>
     the address, subject to the Queen's approval 
     <lb/>
     and to the provlsions of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. The order enacts that from 
     <lb/>
     and after the 15th day of July, 1870, the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territoiries shall be admitted into 
     <lb/>
     and become part of the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada upon the terms and conditions set 
     <lb/>
     forth in the address. Now what could be 
     <lb/>
     more distinct than that Order in Council, 
     <lb/>
     which is virtually an Act of the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament ? On the 15th day of July, 1870, 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories became part of 
     <lb/>
     the union; and yet we are told that that 
     <lb/>
     union has not yet taken place. In order to 
     <lb/>
     effect the purpose of applying subsection 1 
     <lb/>
     to the new province the minister has, as I 
     <lb/>
     have already stated, been compelled to treat 
     <lb/>
     the day of union as of the lst day of July, 
     <lb/>
     1905. To show that not only in Orders in 
     <lb/>
     Council, but in our own statutes, the fact 
     <lb/>
     was recognized that these were in the union, 
     <lb/>
     let me refer to the Manitoba Act that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman cited, and 1 think these 
     <lb/>
     words will leave no doubt as to what was 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the Dominion parliament: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     So it seems to me that under no circum<lb break="no"/>stances can there be any question that the 
     <lb/>
     Territories were in the union on the 15th of 
     <lb/>
     July, 1870.

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, the next Act of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament of any importance in this 
     <lb/>
     matter is the imperial Act of 1871; and I 
     <lb/>
     propose to say a few words on that subject, 
     <lb/>
     because a great many hon. gentlemen oppo<lb break="no"/>site, and the Minister of Justice himself, rely 
     <lb/>
     upon that Act as their authority tor doing 
     <lb/>
     what perhaps under no other Act could he 
     <lb/>
     attempted. The contention is that under 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of this imperial Act of 1871 we can 
     <lb/>
     do just as we please, we can give these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces any constitution we see fit. If they 
     <lb/>
     are correct in their contention, we can upset 
     <lb/>
     the whole constitution of the Dominion ; we 
     <lb/>
     can, in the opinion at" some ministers, as was 
     <lb/>
     brought out in a question yesterday, take 
     <lb/>
     the Post Oifice Department and the Customs 
     <lb/>
     Department from the Dominion and hand 
     <lb/>
     them over to the province; we can take 
     <lb/>
     away the power over property and civil 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>


     rights in the province and hand that power 
     <lb/>
     to the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     First of all, I will call attention to what 
     <lb/>
     has been often so said, that the Act of 1886 
     <lb/>
     declares that the Acts of 1867, of 1871 and 
     <lb/>
     1886, shall be construed together. In other 
     <lb/>
     words, you are to read the three Acts as if 
     <lb/>
     they were all in the one statute. Well, put 
     <lb/>
     the clauses of the Act of 1871 into the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1867, and will any one say that they in 
     <lb/>
     the least affect or alter, the general provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the latter Act, or affect in any way 
     <lb/>
     the distribution of legislative powers be<lb break="no"/>tween the Dominion and the provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us see what the Act of 1871 says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     That is the preamble of the Act. Now, 
     <lb/>
     take clause 2, which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     thinks enables this parliament to override 
     <lb/>

     Now, Mr. Speaker, if any interpretation 
     <lb/>
     can be put upon that section short 
     <lb/>
     of one which empowers the upsetting 
     <lb/>
     of the whole fabric of the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, surely that limited interpre<lb break="no"/>tation should be given to it. What is the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of making 'provision for the con<lb break="no"/>stitution and administration' of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I suppose the hon. gentleman knows 
     <lb/>
     that in the Bill now before the House there 
     <lb/>
     are some eight clauses making provision 
     <lb/>
     for the constitution of this province, clauses 
     <lb/>
     7 to 14. The legislature of the province 
     <lb/>
     cannot be elected or convened until a con<lb break="no"/>stitution is provided. First of all it is es<lb break="no"/>sential that some authority should decide 
     <lb/>
     whether there is to be one house or two 
     <lb/>
     houses, an assembly only, or an assembly 
     <lb/>
     and a senate. Somebody must settle how 
     <lb/>
     many members there shall be in the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature and must provide those various 
     <lb/>
     details which are found in clauses 7 to 14 
     <lb/>
     of Bill 69 with which we are dealing. That 
     <lb/>
     is what is intended by providing for the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of a new province. Without 
     <lb/>
     such provision the provincial legislature 
     <lb/>
     could never get to work, there would be no 
     <lb/>
        
            <pb n="5367" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-03_Page_5367.jpg"/>

     legislature, there would be no means of 
     <lb/>
     creating or electing a legislature. The 
     <lb/>
     representation of the province in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment had to be settled. All these are con<lb break="no"/>stitutional details relating peculiarly to the 
     <lb/>
     particular province, and in no way affecting 
     <lb/>
     the relations of the provinces to the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. Such provisions were necessary to con<lb break="no"/>stitute a province, but does it follow be<lb break="no"/>cause you must make such provisions to 
     <lb/>
     enable a province to set up housekeeping, to 
     <lb/>
     get to work. that that necessarily involves 
     <lb/>
     a power to upset the whole basis and foun<lb break="no"/>dation of confederation as to relations be<lb break="no"/>tween the provinces and the Dominion? 
     <lb/>
     Surely not, and the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     surely knows that not only do we give 
     <lb/>
     them merely such a constitution as I 
     <lb/>
     have described, but that at the very first 
     <lb/>
     meeting of the new legislature they can 
     <lb/>
     themselves amend what we so give, and if 
     <lb/>
     they please can make a new constitution. 
     <lb/>
     This is not a matter of opinion, it is settled 
     <lb/>
     by statute. Let me read section 92 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North- America Act, 1867. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>

            <p>
     That shows clearly what in the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 is meant by provision for the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of a province. It means simply autho<lb break="no"/>rity to so constitute the province that it may 
     <lb/>
     elect a legislature and have a working and 
     <lb/>
     administrative organization. There is no 
     <lb/>
     foundation for the extravagant notion that 
     <lb/>
     this parliament, for the purpose of estab<lb break="no"/>lishing one or two provinces out of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest territory, was given power to 
     <lb/>
     overturn the whole scheme of confederation 
     <lb/>
     as regards legislative powers. You might 
     <lb/>
     as well say that under section 92, subsection 
     <lb/>
     1, the province could upset the distribution 
     <lb/>
     of legislative power under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America  Act as to say that this parliament 
     <lb/>
     can do so under the Act of 1871. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Minister of Justice went on to read 
     <lb/>
     the next part of clause 2 of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 :

     The hon. gentleman actually read this as 
     <lb/>
     if this parliament were to make such laws 
     <lb/>
     for the peace, order and good government. 
     <lb/>
     I have quoted the whole section, and it 
     <lb/>
     means only that we are to make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for a constitution and to make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for the passing of laws by the new 
     <lb/>
     legislature. I think the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     knew that as well as I do.

            <p>
     By the fourth section of the Act of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     provision is made for the temporary gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Territories by this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. That is a distinct clause and gives 
     <lb/>
     this parliament authority to make laws 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
     

     during the territorial period and until a 
     <lb/>
     province is established. In this case the 
     <lb/>
     territorial period has been 35 years; and 
     <lb/>
     of course it was essential to provide for ad<lb break="no"/>ministration for the time being. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Section 4 reads:

     the territory until such time as the pro<lb break="no"/>vince to be created shall have power to

            <p>
     The moment the Territories or any por<lb break="no"/>tion of the Territories is established as a 
     <lb/>
     province, our temporary authority ceases. 
     <lb/>
     We could only bind them for and during 
     <lb/>
     that interim period, a period in which they 
     <lb/>
     have been governed very much as a Crown 
     <lb/>
     colony is governed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We sitting here, by the voice of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and frequently only by the voice of 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet, told them what the laws was to 
     <lb/>
     be and they had to obey during the ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial period. To say that a people so 
     <lb/>
     governed, having no voice in the laws 
     <lb/>
     that apply to them, should be bound for 
     <lb/>
     all time by what we commanded them to do, 
     <lb/>
     seems to me to be absolutely absurd. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is a further matter in connection 
     <lb/>
     with the Act of 1871, that I call attention 
     <lb/>
     to. When that Act was passed enabling us 
     <lb/>
     to establish provinces in the territory, that 
     <lb/>
     territory was already part of the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     and was entitled to all rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     as provided in the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. Surely it cannot be contended that as 
     <lb/>
     to a Territory so entitled, this parliament, 
     <lb/>
     in the absence of most explicit words in 
     <lb/>
     that Act of 1871 can pretend to any author<lb break="no"/>ity to take away any right or impose any 
     <lb/>
     obligation. In every way you look at it 
     <lb/>
     the intendment of that second section was 
     <lb/>
     to enable us to simply organize new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, so that they might pass laws, and 
     <lb/>
     administer their affairs. In support of my 
     <lb/>
     contention that it was never contemplated 
     <lb/>
     that we should be given power to subvert 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, I quote from the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake, who speaking in 1869 said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The first step as regards education in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories was the Dominion Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875, section 11. and it was fol<lb break="no"/>lowed by Territorial ordinances passed 
     <lb/>
     in obedience to that Act. Neither the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875, nor any of the early 
     <lb/>
     ordinances—at all events those that it 
     <lb/>
     is claimed the minority rely upon—neither 
     <lb/>
     the Act nor the ordinances were the result 
     <lb/>
     of the will of the people of the Territor<lb break="no"/>ies. From first to last the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories had nothing to do with it ; they 
     <lb/>
     were never consulted. The Act of 1875, 
     <lb/>
     was passed by this parliament, and the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances were passed by the Lieutenant 
     <lb/>
     Governor and two or three gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     formed his executive, all appointees of this 
     <lb/>
     government. These gentlemen passed or<lb break="no"/>dinances that, it is contended by some, must 
     <lb/>
     apply for all time not only to the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, but also to the provinces when 
     <lb/>
     created. The Hon. Mr. Dewdney, sitting up 
     <lb/>
     there in 1884, with a couple of gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     his executive, wrote out 177 clauses of ordi<lb break="no"/>nances in obedience to the dictates of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa government, and forsooth, the people 
     <lb/>
     of these Territories are never to be able 
     <lb/>
     to improve or alter their school system. I 
     <lb/>
     have read section 4 of the Act of 1871, 
     <lb/>
     which enabled us to pass the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     The Act of 1875, did not give permis<lb break="no"/>sion even to the Lieutenant Governor in 
     <lb/>
     Council to pass laws as to education; it 
     <lb/>
     said  not you ' may ' create separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     but you 'shall' create separate schools. That 
     <lb/>
     was the beginning of it, and because the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion appointed officers up there—who 
     <lb/>
     probably would have been dismissed if they 
     <lb/>
     did not obey—because they passed these or<lb break="no"/>dinances we are now told that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories passed them. And today, 
     <lb/>
     when constituting two provinces it appears 
     <lb/>
     we must work such ordinances into their 
     <lb/>
     laws. and discreetly alter subclauses of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act of 1807 so that 
     <lb/>
     provincial Acts may be disallowed if they 
     <lb/>
     prejudice any privilege in ordinances 29 and 
     <lb/>30.

     Let me read clause 8 of the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     to show the kind of government that was 
     <lb/>
     exercised over this territory supposed to 
     <lb/>
     be controlled by the free will of a tree peo<lb break="no"/>ple. Clause 8 says : 
     <lb/>

     That was the same Act of 1875. which dic<lb break="no"/>tated the school laws to the Territories, and 
     <lb/>
     is it to be supposed that a people governed 
     <lb/>
     under such provisions as that were a free 
     <lb/>
     people exercising their will upon education 
     <lb/>

     or anything else? Surely such a conten<lb break="no"/>tion is absurd. There is a word or two 
     <lb/>
     from Mr. Sifton that I can quote on that 
     <lb/>
     subject. 0n the 24th of March last the conver<lb break="no"/>sion. gentleman in announcing his conver<lb break="no"/>sion to the amendments used these words :

     From my standpoint I say, inasmuch as 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are not a free com.<lb break="no"/>munity, inasmuch as the ordinances passed 
     <lb/>
     are ordinances passed under a limited power, 
     <lb/>
     therefore when they come into the family of 
     <lb/>
     provinces we ought not to apply to them the 
     <lb/>
     principle of observing the status quo, because 
     <lb/>
     the status one was not brought about by their 
     <lb/>
     own unlimited powers.

     With regard to the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, it will not be forgotten that he 
     <lb/>
     resigned his portfolio rather than accept the 
     <lb/>
     original Bill. As member for Brandon, three 
     <lb/>
     weeks later. he accepted it on the assurance 
     <lb/>
     that clause 16 would be struck out and the 
     <lb/>
     proposed amendment substituted. Now, I 
     <lb/>
     understand his explanation to be that under 
     <lb/>
     clause 11 of the Act of 1875—clause 16 of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill is in substance the same—Orders 
     <lb/>
     in Council were passed giving sectional con<lb break="no"/>trol of separate schools, Catholics controlling 
     <lb/>
     one set and Protestants the other; that these 
     <lb/>
     ordinances were amended by later ones, 
     <lb/>
     which did away with sectional control; 
     <lb/>
     that on one occasion Sir John Thompson, as 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice, had declared a certain 
     <lb/>
     later ordinance ultra vires ; and that he, the 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon feared, he would not 
     <lb/>
     say actually that. it would be so, but appa<lb break="no"/>rently he feared that if the amending ordi<lb break="no"/>nances were ultra vires, the original ordi<lb break="no"/>nances would stand good, and so we would 
     <lb/>
     have the old clause of 1875 and the old 
     <lb/>
     ordinances giving Catholics control of Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic schools, thus establishing for all time 
     <lb/>
     what he believed, according to his expe<lb break="no"/>rience in Manitoba, to be a bad system. 
     <lb/>
     That I understood to be his argu<lb break="no"/>ment, an argument based on the or<lb break="no"/>dinances, because there is not a word 
     <lb/>
     in the Act of 1875 giving more than a 
     <lb/>
     right for Catholics to have a school separate 
     <lb/>
     from Protestants, and vice verse. I 
     <lb/>
     have just read what he said on that point. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I propose to show, first, that by the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 no right to religious teaching in the 
     <lb/>
     schools was given ; second that if clause 16 
     <lb/>
     remain in the Bill, that in itself would have 
     <lb/>
     conferred no such right—that it went on 
     <lb/>
     further than the clause of 1875 ; third, 
     <lb/>
     that ordinances 29 and 30 are to-day in 
     <lb/>
     force, and contain all] and more than 
     <lb/>
     clause 16; fourth, that under the ori<lb break="no"/>ginal Bill ordinances 29 and 30, even as 
     <lb/>
     they are, could have been amended by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the new province. Section 15 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill provided that every ordinance 
     <lb/>
     should remain in force until altered by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the new province; therefore 
     <lb/>
     if the Bill had been left as it was first drawn 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of Justice ordinances 29 and 
     <lb/>
     30 would have been subject to repeal or 
     <lb/>
     amendment by the new legislature; fifth [...]
