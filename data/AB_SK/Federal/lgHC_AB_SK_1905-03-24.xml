<!-- GL, 2018-03-28, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            <!--<p> Northwest Territories. The discussion has
<lb/>
gone even farther, and it has been time and <lb/>
again written and said that those in this <lb/>
House who defend the rights of the min<lb break="no"/>ority are under clerical influence, are acting <lb/>
under the dictation of the hierarchy, what<lb break="no"/>ever that may mean. What is the meaning <lb/>
of these insinuations ? If they were utter<lb break="no"/>ed once or twice. if they appeared, so to <lb/>
speak, by accident, one would be prepared to <lb/>
treat them with the tolerance
which must <lb/>
necessarily be the quality of a public man <lb/>
if he wishes to live. But it has been so <lb/>
often stated that those who in this House <lb/>
adopt the view which I adopt are under <lb/>
the domination of the clergy, that I wish at <lb/>
any rate for my part, to enter my protest <lb/>
against that insinuation. There is no foun<lb break="no"/>dation for that accusation, and those who <lb/>
make it know not of what they speak. I <lb/>
say, I come to this House to fulfil my <lb/>
duty to my country without any control over <lb/>
me of priest or bishop or anybody else. That <lb/>
control I have never admitted, and that <lb/>
control never existed. As a matter of fact, <lb/>
I venture to say, the clergy in my province <lb/>
"do not exercise any control upon
the de<lb break="no"/>cision of public questions and the votes <lb/>
which we give in this House. That control <lb/>
does not exist ; it is a figment of the mind. <lb/>
And, when men take the trouble to write <lb/>
in newspapers—not to speak in the irrita<lb break="no"/>tion of the moment, but to write deliberately <lb/>
—that those who are in my position in <lb/>
this House are under outside control, are, <lb/>
so to speak, led by extraneous influences, <lb/>
they are casting upon us a libel which we <lb/>
do not deserve. I venture to say there is <lb/>
not a voter in the Dominion of Canada who <lb/>
would be more free from clerical influence <lb/>
than the average voter of the province of <lb/>
Quebec. Priests exercise no influence in <lb/>
these matters. They refrain from action in <lb/>
them. And they could not interfere with the <lb/>
exercise of the franchise. Take the case <lb/>
of my own county; I verily believe that <lb/>
if the parish priests of my county—and <lb/>
they are respectable men—were to unite to <lb/>
secure my election, I would lose my deposit. <lb/>
They do not interfere in elections; they <lb/>
scarcely vote. I am prepared to admit <lb/>
that there are isolated cases where a clergy<lb break="no"/>man, not of my own denomination only, but <lb/>
of other denominations as well, has inter<lb break="no"/>fered. What has been the consequence in <lb/>
Quebec Where these isolated cases have oc<lb break="no"/>curred ? They have led to lawsuits and to <lb/>
the final departure of the parish priest from <lb/>
the charge of the parish—that has been the <lb/>
history of such cases. As a matter of <lb/>
fact I repeat there is no man who would <lb/>
resent more promptly (and I could give <lb/>
numberless examples of it) any interfer<lb break="no"/>ence by the priest with the exercise of the <lb/>
franchise than would the average voter of <lb/>
the province of Quebec. And, as a public <lb/>
man, I believe that everybody is in the same <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> position of independence that I am in my<lb break="no"/>self. I would like to see anybody be he <lb/>
priest or bishop, interfere with me in the <lb/>
exercise of my functions in this House. I <lb/>
thought it necessary to make this declara<lb break="no"/>tion, because, these things being so often <lb/>
repeated it becomes essential that they <lb/>
should be denied. As to the boring under<lb break="no"/>ground of the black-robed men who are all <lb/>
the time acting by hidden, obscure, mys<lb break="no"/>terious conspiracies upon members of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, upon the electors in general—all this <lb/>
is nothing but a chimera. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Speaker, I have finished. I do not <lb/>
wish to go one step farther, but you will <lb/>
allow me in closing to quote the last sen<lb break="no"/>tence of Mr. Balfour's speech upon the Edu<lb break="no"/>cation Bill : <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> No other scheme—be it what you like—will <lb/>
give to the educational evils of this country the <lb/>
complete, radical, and final cure which this Bill <lb/>
will give. I count upon the support of our <lb/>
countrymen to enable us to close for ever these <lb/>
barren controversies which for too long have <lb/>
occupied our time, and in the interests alike <lb/>
of parental liberty and of educational efficiency <lb/>
to terminate the present system of costly con<lb break="no"/>fusion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> If I quote these sentences it is because <lb/>
they express in far better, far
loftier lan<lb break="no"/>guage than I can command my own view in <lb/>
regard to these questions in general. If I <lb/>
could have my wish in the forming of these <lb/>
two new provinces, it would be that in the <lb/>
conduct of public affairs, particularly in <lb/>
the treatment of the minority—which, prac<lb break="no"/>tically whatever we may enact, is entirely <lb/>
confided to the generosity of the majority— <lb/>
they may have men to lead the destinies <lb/>
of these two great provinces according to <lb/>
the example of these great
statesmen of <lb/>
England. <lb/>

     <lb/>
     Before the Orders of the Day are called, I 
     <lb/>
     would like to call the attention of the First 
     <lb/>
     Minister again to the information asked for 
     <lb/>
     on February 21 by the member for Carleton, 
     <lb/>
     Ontario (Mr. R. L. Borden), and not yet 
     <lb/>
     brought down, to which attention has been 
     <lb/>
     called on more than one occasion. Amongst 
     <lb/>
     other important things which we can scarce<lb break="no"/>ly do without in debating this question, he 
     <lb/>
     asked for the centres of population and the 
     <lb/>
     tendency of immigration since 1901, for the 
     <lb/>
     lands bonded for homestead purposes, the 
     <lb/>
     lands granted to the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company, and what portion of them 
     <lb/>
     yet remains to be selected in the territory 
     <lb/>
     comprising these two provinces ; the lands 
     <lb/>
     remaining invested in the Crown, a very 
     <lb/>
     important point if we are to take up the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the financial aspect of this 
     <lb/>
     question. He also asked for the practical 
     <lb/>
     condition of education in the Territories at 
     <lb/>
     present. This would include, of course, the 
     <lb/>
     number of schools—public schools. denomi<lb break="no"/>national schools, or separate schools so- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     called. All that is information which the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister will see is pertinent to the 
     <lb/>
     discussion which is now going on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I think that a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of this information is already 
     <lb/>
     before the House ; for instance, the home<lb break="no"/>steads granted have, I think, been brought 
     <lb/>
     down. I shall inquire. A return has, I 
     <lb/>
     think, been brought down already showing 
     <lb/>
     that all the lands have been selected by the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway to which it is 
     <lb/>
     entitled. The information about the condi<lb break="no"/>tion of the schools is information which is 
     <lb/>
     not at all hard to get ; it will be in the 
     <lb/>
     library and elsewhere, but I shall, if it is 
     <lb/>
     thought advisable, try to have it collected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. It would seem to me that 
     <lb/>
     some such statement as the Finance De<lb break="no"/>partment made with reference to the differ<lb break="no"/>ent financial conditions since confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ought to be put in the form of a memo<lb break="no"/>randum embracing that information. Such 
     <lb/>
     a memorandum would be very useful. It 
     <lb/>
     would be authoritative, and that is what 
     <lb/>
     we want.

     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Hon. CLIFFORD SIFTON</persName> (Brandon). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker I have been, upon a considerable 
     <lb/>
     number of important occasions, called upon 
     <lb/>
     to address the House ; and upon a good 
     <lb/>
     many of these occasions, as I have risen, 
     <lb/>
     I have felt confident that at least a consider<lb break="no"/>able section of the House would regard with 
     <lb/>
     approval the remarks I desired to make. 
     <lb/>
     But I confess that, upon the present occa<lb break="no"/>sion, although my old friends have been 
     <lb/>
     kind enough to receive me with some ap<lb break="no"/>plause as I rose, I do not exactly feel the 
     <lb/>
     confidence of former occasions that every<lb break="no"/>thing I shall say will meet with their appro<lb break="no"/>val. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It surely must be regarded as the irony 
     <lb/>
     of political fortune that the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill, a Bill for the creation of the 
     <lb/>
     two new provinces of Alberta and Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, covering territory the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of which has been my peculiar 
     <lb/>
     charge for the last eight years, and to the 
     <lb/>
     development of which I have given whatever 
     <lb/>
     of capacity and energy I may have possessed 
     <lb/>
     in official life, and have given it freely and I 
     <lb/>
     might almost say with an affectionate solici<lb break="no"/>tude for their welfare ; I say it must be re<lb break="no"/>garded as the irony of political fortune that 
     <lb/>
     the introduction of this Bill should be the 
     <lb/>
     occasion also of my retirement from the 
     <lb/>
     office I held under the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) who leads the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the severance of my official re<lb break="no"/>lations with the party with which I have 
     <lb/>
     had official relations now for some fourteen 
     <lb/>
     years. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was necessary for me, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     when giving to the House a statement of 
     <lb/>
     the reasons for my resignation—it being 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional practice to make such a 
     <lb/>
     statement—to say that the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses of this Bill had not been before me 
     <lb/>
     prior to its introduction to the House. I 
     <lb/>
     was careful to say in that statement, al<lb break="no"/>though briefly, that the same thing did not 
     <lb/>
     apply to the other features of the Bill, or  
     <lb/>
     did not apply to its principles, because I had 
     <lb/>
     had an opportunity to give my advice to my 
     <lb/>
     colleagues upon the other portions of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill. Nevertheless some, as I think, rather 
     <lb/>
     ill-natured, comments were addressed to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister in criticism of his alleged 
     <lb/>
     preparation of this Bill, or allowing it to be 
     <lb/>
     prepared, without consultation with or 
     <lb/>
     advice from the minister who must, under 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances, be supposed to have been 
     <lb/>
     in the best position to give him advice. 
     <lb/>
     These criticisms of which I speak are wholly 
     <lb/>
     without justification in the facts of the case. 
     <lb/>
     The belief that the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     were to be given provincial autonomy is 
     <lb/>
     one that, in all the discussions which have 
     <lb/>
     taken place has, been forming itself not only 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of the members of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. but in the minds of members of the 
     <lb/>
     House during the last few years. There 
     <lb/>
     may have been discussions in this House 
     <lb/>
     as to the particular time. But the 
     <lb/>
     subject has been present to our minds.

 <p>
     And for the last three years, I may say, 
     <lb/>
    I have myself, upon various occasions, 
     <lb/>given the most careful attention to the 
     <lb/>important provisions which necessarily 
     <lb/>would come within the purview of the Bill. 
     <lb/>As was explained by my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) the 
     <lb/>other evening, before leaving Ottawa, as I 
     <lb/>was obliged to do about the New Year, I 
     <lb/>took occasion to put in writing, with suffi<lb break="no"/>cient fullness, the views which I entertained 
     <lb/>in regard to the important features of the 
     <lb/>Bill. This memorandum was placed in the 
     <lb/>possession of my colleagues so that they had 
     <lb/>the benefit of my suggestions, as also had 
     <lb/>the Prime Minister in the course of cor<lb break="no"/>respondence which he did me the honour to 
     <lb/>have with me upon various questions which 
     <lb/>arose during the discussions which took 
     <lb/>place from time to time while I was absent. 
     <lb/>I gave my advice to the best of my ability. 
     <lb/>And I may say, so far as that is concerned, 
     <lb/>that in the main, other than as refers to the 
     <lb/>question of education, and although there 
     <lb/>are some variations of detail—in the main, 
     <lb/>1 say, and substantially, the Bill I recom<lb break="no"/>mended to my late colleagues is the Bill 
     <lb/>which has been introduced. There are some 
     <lb/>matters of detail respecting which difficul<lb break="no"/>ties arose, and different decisions were 
     <lb/>arrived at in the course of the discussions 
     <lb/>which took place with the representatives 
     <lb/>of the Northwest Territories. These were 
     <lb/>inevitable. But, substantially the provisions 
     <lb/>of the Bill are in accordance with the views 
     <lb/>I had formed in the course of my admini<lb break="no"/>stration of that country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     So far as the question of the number of 
     <lb/>
     provinces is concerned, I formed the opinion 
     <lb/>
     which, I think, will be shared by almost 
     <lb/>
     every person on careful investigation of the 
     <lb/>
     case, that it was not desirable that this vast 
     <lb/>
     territory should be formed into one province. 
     <lb/>
     Certainly it was not desirable to carry out 
     <lb/>
     the old idea which prevailed that there were 
     <lb/>
     to be four provinces. I think the best opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the House will be met by the decision 
     <lb/>
     which the government has reached, that the 
     <lb/>
     medium course should be taken, and, that in<lb break="no"/>stead of one or four, we should have two 
     <lb/>
     provinces. Not only is the question of area 
     <lb/>
     to be considered as was shown by the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister in his remarks in introducing the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, but you must consider also the even 
     <lb/>
     more important question of population. The 
     <lb/>
     population of this one province, if this terri<lb break="no"/>tory were made into one province, would 
     <lb/>
     eventually have such a preponderance 
     <lb/>
     as compared with the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     that it could not be said to be wise 
     <lb/>
     to make such an arrangement. These 
     <lb/>
     provinces are composed of territories 
     <lb/>
     which, almost acre for acre, is arable land 
     <lb/>
     and capable of sustaining population. No 
     <lb/>
     other provinces in the Dominion can be 
     <lb/>
     similarly described. And to make one pro<lb break="no"/>vince of that particular territory whose cap<lb break="no"/>acity for sustaining population is, on the 
     <lb/>
     average, so much greater than that of any 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
         

     other province in the Dominion, giving it 
     <lb/>
     ultimately so much greater population than 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, would certainly and 
     <lb/>
     obviously be unwise. Other considerations 
     <lb/>
     supported the same conclusion. The western 
     <lb/>
     and eastern portions of this territory lend 
     <lb/>
     themselves to different industrial conditions. 
     <lb/>
     Great grazing areas exist in the west such 
     <lb/>
     as are not found in the east. Mining possi<lb break="no"/>bilities on a large scale are to be found in 
     <lb/>
     the western part of the territory, and in the 
     <lb/>
     north, towards Edmonton, we have what is 
     <lb/>
     known as a mixed-farming district. Differ<lb break="no"/>ent classes of local legislation will be needed, 
     <lb/>
     and different conditions must be recognized 
     <lb/>
     in the two portions of the territory. Every<lb break="no"/>body who knows the conditions of that ter<lb break="no"/>ritory will be satisfied that the best results 
     <lb/>
     will result from having two local govern<lb break="no"/>ments and two legislatures. Each of these 
     <lb/>
     legislatures and each of these <choice><sic>adminis<lb break="no"/>strations</sic><corr>administrations</corr></choice> will have ample scope for all the 
     <lb/>
     energy it may see fit to display in the de<lb break="no"/>velopment of the resources of the great ter<lb break="no"/>ritory which is committed to its charge. And 
     <lb/>
     this parliament may be satisfied, I think, 
     <lb/>
     that that arrangement which is suggested 
     <lb/>
     will give the surest guarantee that the 
     <lb/>
     future development of these territories will 
     <lb/>
     be best facilitated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     While on the question of boundaries, I 
     <lb/>
     may say, having reference, for a moment, to 
     <lb/>
     a statement made by Mr. Haultain in an 
     <lb/>
     open letter addressed to the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     that I also suggested, and it was my idea, 
     <lb/>
     that the dividing line between the two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces should be about sixty miles fur<lb break="no"/>ther east than that which is provided for by 
     <lb/>
     the Bill. It was in the discussions which 
     <lb/>
     took place with the government that the 
     <lb/>
     present arrangement was arrived at. I have 
     <lb/>
     not heard the reasons which have led to this 
     <lb/>
     conclusion but I have no doubt that the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion thus arrived at after careful con<lb break="no"/>sideration, will be found upon the whole to 
     <lb/>
     be that which is supported by the best rea<lb break="no"/>sons. This in any event is a small difference 
     <lb/>
     of detail. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But there is one other point I will sug<lb break="no"/>gest, perhaps more for the future consider<lb break="no"/>ation of the House than for present con<lb break="no"/>sideration, that there should be some differ<lb break="no"/>ent principle adopted. I see no reason why 
     <lb/>
     these provinces should not extend to the 
     <lb/>
     northern boundary of the mainland of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. The experience which I have had in 
     <lb/>
     the Department of the Interior has led me 
     <lb/>
     irresistibly to the conclusion that just so 
     <lb/>
     soon as it is possible to do so, the federal 
     <lb/>
     government should divest itself of the local 
     <lb/>
     administration of distant territory : and 
     <lb/>
     therefore I see no reason why, in so far as the 
     <lb/>
     administration of these Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories come within the scope of provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislation, that their administration should 
     <lb/>
     not be carried on by the local legislatures 
     <lb/>
     that we are to establish. That however is 
     <lb/>
     not an insuperable objection. The Terri<lb break="no"/>tories of course still remain the property of 
     <lb/>

     Canada, and if it be thought wise at a future 
     <lb/>
     date they can be added to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     which we are now forming. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Upon the question of the lands which 
     <lb/>
     has been discussed at some length, I have 
     <lb/>
     very clear and positive opinions. I regard 
     <lb/>
     the question of a successful settlement 
     <lb/>
     policy—and my opinion is not changed by 
     <lb/>
     the fact that this policy may now require to 
     <lb/>
     be carried on under somebody else's super<lb break="no"/>vision—I regard the question of a successful 
     <lb/>
     settlement policy in Canada as perhaps one 
     <lb/>
     of the most important, if not the most im<lb break="no"/>portant of all subjects with which we have 
     <lb/>
     to deal. For the last two or three years es<lb break="no"/>pecially, we have seen the effect of the small 
     <lb/>
     beginnings of success of the policy of 
     <lb/>
     settling vacant lands of the west upon the 
     <lb/>
     general prosperity of Canada, and I think 
     <lb/>
     every serious minded man will admit 
     <lb/>
     that under no possible circumstances 
     <lb/>
     would this parliament be justified in 
     <lb/>
     taking any step which would imperil 
     <lb/>
     in the slightest degree the success of 
     <lb/>
     the immigration policy which we have been 
     <lb/>
     carrying on, and which the government 
     <lb/>
     proposes to carry on in the future. That 
     <lb/>
     is a thing which demands the most careful 
     <lb/>
     thought and consideration at the hands of 
     <lb/>
     this parliament. It was suggested by 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition, and has been 
     <lb/>
     suggested by others who take the opposite 
     <lb/>
     view, that the handing over of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands of the Territories to the provincial 
     <lb/>
     government would not seriously interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the conduct of immigration. Well, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, I have had on my shoulders the 
     <lb/>
     duty of carrying on a policy of immigration, 
     <lb/>
     and of harmonizing the operations of the 
     <lb/>
     lands department of the government and 
     <lb/>
     of the immigration department for the last 
     <lb/>
     eight years, and it taxes the efforts of the 
     <lb/>
     department to the utmost, when both the 
     <lb/>
     land department and the immigration 
     <lb/>
     branch are in the same hands and under 
     <lb/>
     the same control, to avoid the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     which constantly present themselves in the 
     <lb/>
     administration of this work. It would be 
     <lb/>
     difficult satisfactorily to carry on that work 
     <lb/>
     even if we had the land department in an<lb break="no"/>other branch of the same government ; it 
     <lb/>
     would be embarrassing and difficult to an 
     <lb/>
     extent that few men appreciate who have 
     <lb/>
     not had the duty of actually carrying on this 
     <lb/>
     business. But if you hand over the land 
     <lb/>
     to three provincial governments—because 
     <lb/>
     you would have to treat Manitoba in 
     <lb/>
     the same way as you are treating the 
     <lb/>
     Territories—if you hand over the land 
     <lb/>
     to three separate provincial governments. 
     <lb/>
     each with its own ideas of policy, each 
     <lb/>
     with its own Minister of Crown Lands, and 
     <lb/>
     if the federal government has to deal with 
     <lb/>
     three provincial governments, every man 
     <lb/>
     who knows anything about doing business 
     <lb/>
     between governments must know that it 
     <lb/>
     would be absolutely impossible that satis<lb break="no"/>factory results could be achieved. It is 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
         

     not necessary to suggest that the provincial 
     <lb/>
     governments would do anything that is 
     <lb/>
     wrong, it is not necessary to suggest that 
     <lb/>
     they would be improvident, that they do not 
     <lb/>
     know how to carry on business as well as 
     <lb/>
     we do. The people of the west are just 
     <lb/>
     as capable as the people in any other part 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion ; they are extremely cap<lb break="no"/>able, and when they achieve provincial sta<lb break="no"/>tus, if these lands were handed over to 
     <lb/>
     them, they would do precisely what people 
     <lb/>
     in the other provinces would do, they 
     <lb/>
     would administer these lands just as they 
     <lb/>
     saw fit and in accordance with their own 
     <lb/>
     ideas of policy. The result would be that 
     <lb/>
     you would have three governments to deal 
     <lb/>
     with, each with its own idea of policy, each 
     <lb/>
     with its Minister of Crown Lands, and pos<lb break="no"/>sibly no two of them with the same ideas 
     <lb/>
     as to the policy that should be carried out 
     <lb/>
     in respect to this subject. It might be, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, and probably would be, that in<lb break="no"/>stead of administering these lands for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of settlement they would admin<lb break="no"/>ister them for the purpose of revenue, and 
     <lb/>
     I do not know that we could blame them 
     <lb/>
     very much if they did so. But if they did 
     <lb/>
     that, the result would be that the settle<lb break="no"/>ment policy of the country would stop. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It would be quite as impossible to give 
     <lb/>
     those lands to the provinces with a limita<lb break="no"/>tion that they should carry on a home<lb break="no"/>stead policy. A homestead policy would 
     <lb/>
     have to be carried out by provincial officers. 
     <lb/>
     And moreover the very day you gave these 
     <lb/>
     lands to the provinces with any limitation 
     <lb/>
     whatever, you would find an agitation aris<lb break="no"/>ing to remove all limitations, and you would 
     <lb/>
     have that question on the floor of the House 
     <lb/>
     at every session of parliament. So, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, I am clear upon that point ; and 
     <lb/>
     if there is anything I can say to the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House that I think should com<lb break="no"/>mend itself to the judgment of both sides, 
     <lb/>
     I would say that nothing could be done 
     <lb/>
     which would more certainly imperil a suc<lb break="no"/>cessful settlement policy upon which the 
     <lb/>
     greatness and increase in the financial 
     <lb/>
     strength and resources of Canada depend, 
     <lb/>
     than, under any circumstances, to allow the 
     <lb/>
     public lands of the prairie provinces to 
     <lb/>
     pass from the control of the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As to the financial provisions, Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, I think they are generous and liberal, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not think they are too generous or 
     <lb/>
     too liberal. We expect that these great 
     <lb/>
     provinces will play a great part in the his<lb break="no"/>tory of Canada, and it is creditable to us 
     <lb/>
     that on both sides there has come nothing 
     <lb/>
     but approval of the liberal and generous 
     <lb/>
     treatment accorded by the government to 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces upon the inception of 
     <lb/>
     their provincial career. Let me say, how<lb break="no"/>ever, Mr. Speaker, not wishing to say any<lb break="no"/>thing ungracious or to throw a note of dis<lb break="no"/>cord into the discussion of this subject, that 
     <lb/>
     there is one suggestion which I desire to 
     <lb/>
    

            <pb n="3097" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3097.jpg"/>
        <fw type="num">3097</fw>    <fw type="dateline">MARCH 24, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3098</fw>
        


     make to the right hon. gentleman who leads 
     <lb/>
     the government, and it is this : I find in 
     <lb/>
     this clause of the Bill relating to the com<lb break="no"/>pensation for lands that such compensation 
     <lb/>
     is based upon an estimated acreage and 
     <lb/>
     upon a price, and the price put upon that 
     <lb/>
     estimated acreage is, I think, $1.50 an acre. 
     <lb/>
     I have no fault to find with the amount 
     <lb/>
     which has been decided upon, and which the 
     <lb/>
     government proposes to give. I think it is 
     <lb/>
     reasonable and liberal, I think it is gen<lb break="no"/>erous, and 1 am quite prepared to agree 
     <lb/>
     with it. But I submit that the amount 
     <lb/>
     should be fixed arbitrarily, it should not be 
     <lb/>
     fixed by a reference to the number of mil<lb break="no"/>lions of acres of land, nor the price per 
     <lb/>
     acre. The moment I laid my eyes upon that 
     <lb/>
     clause I felt it was a mistake, and I felt 
     <lb/>
     that just as soon as it was published the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the Territories would 
     <lb/>
     say : You have by this clause admitted 
     <lb/>
     that we are entitled to the beneficial owner<lb break="no"/>ship of these lands, you have admitted that 
     <lb/>
     we are the owners of these lands in fact, 
     <lb/>
     beneficially at least if not in law, by the 
     <lb/>
     very fact that you are basing the compen<lb break="no"/>sation you give us upon the acreage of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. And so within a few days after 
     <lb/>
     the Bill was published and before parlia<lb break="no"/>ment gave assent to it, our good friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain seized upon this phase of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     to present an objection to the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who leads the government. He 
     <lb/>
     immediately took the ground which it must 
     <lb/>
     be admitted he could take with some de<lb break="no"/>gree of force, that by that provision we ad<lb break="no"/>mitted, impliedly at least, the right of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories to claim that they are the bene<lb break="no"/>ficial owners of the land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What would be the effect ? The effect 
     <lb/>
     would be that if this passes into a statute 
     <lb/>
     it becomes an irrevocable Act because it 
     <lb/>
     does become an irrevocable Act as soon as 
     <lb/>
     parliament passes it. The effect would be 
     <lb/>
     that our friends of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories so soon as they desire to have 
     <lb/>
     their financial arrangements re-adjusted will 
     <lb/>
     claim that while we have admitted their 
     <lb/>
     ownership of the land they have not admit<lb break="no"/>ted our valuation of this land and we will 
     <lb/>
     find that the Territories as represented 
     <lb/>
     on the floor of this House will raise this 
     <lb/>
     question of the re-adjustment of the finan<lb break="no"/>cial arrangements and we will have a ques<lb break="no"/>tion raised that will cause great embar<lb break="no"/>rassment to succeeding governments in the 
     <lb/>
     future. I bring this point to the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of my right hon. friend because 
     <lb/>
     I believe we are making a mistake 
     <lb/>
     in regard to it. It may perhaps ap<lb break="no"/>pear to be a matter of detail at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time but it will not be found to be 
     <lb/>
     a matter of detail in future years and 
     <lb/>
     it is not too late to remedy it if, in the 
     <lb/>
     judgment of the government and of the 
     <lb/>
     House, the argument that I address to the 
     <lb/>
     House on this subject is correct. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another point which was raised, espec<lb break="no"/>
   

            <cb/>
      

     ially by Mr. Haultain, in the letter which 
     <lb/>
     he addressed to my right hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the government, was that 
     <lb/>
     respecting legislation, on the subject of irri<lb break="no"/>gation. That is a subject of vast importance 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories, and I must 
     <lb/>
     say that I take the responsibility of hav<lb break="no"/>ing, in all probability, induced my collea<lb break="no"/>gues to accept the view which is the effect 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill that is before the House ; that 
     <lb/>
     is to say, that the subject of irrigation for 
     <lb/>
     the present should be retained within the 
     <lb/>
     control of the federal government. The 
     <lb/>
     reasons can be given in a few words and to 
     <lb/>
     my mind they are absolutely conclusive. 
     <lb/>
     At the present time the right to use some of 
     <lb/>
     the principal streams which are of the ut<lb break="no"/>most importance in connection with the irri<lb break="no"/>gation in the Northwest Territories, is a 
     <lb/>
     subject of discussion between Canada and 
     <lb/>
     the United States and international complica<lb break="no"/>tions have already arisen in regard to these 
     <lb/>
     streams. Obviously, if irrigation were un<lb break="no"/>der the administration of two provincial 
     <lb/>
     governments, it would be difficult to adjust 
     <lb/>
     a question such as that. In addition to that 
     <lb/>
     questions are going to arise in a compara<lb break="no"/>tively short time between the residents 
     <lb/>
     of the western province and the residents of 
     <lb/>
     the eastern province in regard to the right 
     <lb/>
     of user of the water of these streams which 
     <lb/>
     flow from one into the other. It would seem 
     <lb/>
     to me most desirable, until the difficulties 
     <lb/>
     respecting international questions and the 
     <lb/>
     difficulties respecting interprovincial ques<lb break="no"/>tions are settled, and until the irrigation 
     <lb/>
     system is further developed and a body 
     <lb/>
     of law upon the subject is built up, that 
     <lb/>
     the control should remain in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the federal government. When a few years 
     <lb/>
     have elapsed, when the system is more 
     <lb/>
     fully developed, when it becomes a matter 
     <lb/>
     merely of local administration then there 
     <lb/>
     seems to be no good reason why the subject 
     <lb/>
     should not be relegated to the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As I explained a few days ago, the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the educational clause of this Bill which 
     <lb/>
     was introduced into the House and some 
     <lb/>
     of the remarks made by my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the leader of the government were the 
     <lb/>
     cause of my resigning from the government 
     <lb/>

     while my action was in no sense or nature

     pique, yet I did feel, in addition to what I 
     <lb/>
     said upon a former occasion, that the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman had not been well advised 
     <lb/>
     in bringing this clause to the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons and presenting it to the House 
     <lb/>
     without giving me an opportunity of ex<lb break="no"/>pressing such views as I might desire to 
     <lb/>
     offer on the subject. I say I have nothing 
     <lb/>
     now to add to what has been said upon 
     <lb/>
     that subject and I merer desire, with the

     indulgence of the House, to proceed to the 
     <lb/>
     discussion of the sections we have before 
     <lb/>
     us—the original section and the amended 
     <lb/>
     section—and to give the reasons which have 
     <lb/>
     guided me in coming to the conclusion at 
     <lb/>
     which I have arrived as to the support of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill or otherwise. I am in a some<lb break="no"/>what peculiar position, Mr. Speaker, find<lb break="no"/>ing as I do that I agree much more 
     <lb/>
     with the statements of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) than with the statements and argu<lb break="no"/>ments of my right hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the government who is my party leader and 
     <lb/>
     who was my leader in the government for 
     <lb/>
     so many years. Nevertheless, the conclus<lb break="no"/>ion at which I arrived will probably not be 
     <lb/>
     the same as that of the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. In the first place let me say 
     <lb/>
     that I think he was wrong in his view— 
     <lb/>
     and I agree with my hon. friend the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) in this— 
     <lb/>
     that when we are about to consider legis<lb break="no"/>lation which will bring a certain state of 
     <lb/>
     affairs into existence in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, we should shut our eyes absolutely 
     <lb/>
     and entirely to the examination of the actual 
     <lb/>
     educational effect of the proposal before us. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that almost everybody will 
     <lb/>
     agree with my hon. friend the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Finance that the man in the street, hearing 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman who leads the opposition 
     <lb/>
     say that he stands by the constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     hearing the right hon. gentleman who leads 
     <lb/>
     the government say that upon the rock of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution he stands, and seeing these 
     <lb/>
     two hon. gentlemen both standing on the 
     <lb/>
     rock of the constitution but coming to dia<lb break="no"/>metrically opposite conclusions will be like<lb break="no"/>ly to say : I cannot hope to understand the 
     <lb/>
     law or the constitution, but I do want to 
     <lb/>
     know what kind of schools they are going to 
     <lb/>
     have in the Northwest Territories. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I desire to address a few words to the 
     <lb/>House upon that which I think will interest 
     <lb/>not only the man in the street, but some of 
     <lb/>the men in the House upon the subject of the 
     <lb/>nature of the schools we have in the North<lb break="no"/>west and the kind of schools we shall have 
     <lb/>after this Bill is passed. I am not going to 
     <lb/>enter into questions as to the manner in 
     <lb/>which legislation has been passed or the 
     <lb/>remarks which have been made by legis<lb break="no"/>lators when it has been passed. My right 
     <lb/>hon. friend the leader of the government, in 
     <lb/>the remarks which he made to the House 
     <lb/>upon two occasions, or at least upon the first 
     <lb/>occasion, discussed at length the method 
     <lb/>under which the educational legislation af<lb break="no"/>fecting the Northwest Territories was first 
     <lb/>introduced. That discussion has been ampli<lb break="no"/>fied by my hon. friend the Minister of 
     <lb/>Finance in the remarks which he made the 
     <lb/>other evening, and I shall not attempt to 
     <lb/>add anything to what my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>Minister of Finance has said or to what I 
     <lb/>believe to be the accurate discussion which 
     <lb/>we have listened to on that subject. But, I do 
     <lb/>desire to call the attention of hon. members 
     <lb/>
 
            <cb/>
          

     of the House, for the purposes of my argu<lb break="no"/>ment, to the actual terms of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875. The clause which is the basis of all 
     <lb/>
     that has followed reads as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     When and so soon as any system of taxation

     the Northwest Territories, the Lieutenant Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor, by and with the consent of the council

            <p>
     That was the clause in the Act of 1875. I 
     <lb/>
     read it because it is important in view of 
     <lb/>
     the remarks I intend to address to the 
     <lb/>
     House, that its exact terms should be in 
     <lb/>
     the minds of the gentlemen who are honour<lb break="no"/>ing me with their attention.

            <p>
     What followed the passage of this law ? 
     <lb/>
     There was established in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories a complete dual system of 
     <lb/>
     schools ; a system of schools under which 
     <lb/>
     the denomination regulated the text books, 
     <lb/>
     and the conduct of the schools and by which 
     <lb/>
     everything that appertained to the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic schools was directly under the con<lb break="no"/>trol of a Roman Catholic board of education. 
     <lb/>
     We had in the Northwest Territories at that 
     <lb/>
     time, under that Act. to all intents and pur<lb break="no"/>poses what are generally known as church 
     <lb/>
     schools or clerically controlled schools. That 
     <lb/>
     was the system that was built up under this 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875. It went on for some time. It 
     <lb/>
     was exactly the same system—I do not 
     <lb/>
     know as to the efficiency, for I am not fam<lb break="no"/>iliar with that—but in principle it was the 
     <lb/>
     same system we had in Manitoba up to the 
     <lb/>
     year 1890. when it was abolished by the 
     <lb/>
     Public School Act of that year. This sys<lb break="no"/>tem went on for some time in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and then the legislature began to in<lb break="no"/>terfere and to curtail the privileges of the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. This curtailment pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded from time to time until the year 
     <lb/>
     1892 when what was known as the dual 
     <lb/>
     system was entirely swept away and that 
     <lb/>
     system which we have in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, substantially as we have it at 
     <lb/>
     present, was established. I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     trouble the House with any lengthy 
     <lb/>
     quotations, but I desire to point out 
     <lb/>
     what was conceived by the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories connected with these 
     <lb/>
     schools, to be the effect of the legislation 
     <lb/>
     of 1892. The quotations which I shall 
     <lb/>
     give will be found in the papers pre<lb break="no"/>sented to the federal government when a

     petition was presented for the disallowance 
     <lb/>
     of the Act ; because, when the old privi<lb break="no"/>leges of minority schools were abolishd 
     <lb/>
     finally by the Act of 1892, a petition was 
     <lb/>
     taken by the Roman Catholic clergy to the 
     <lb/>
     federal authority asking that the ordinances 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories of 1892 should 
     <lb/>
     be disallowed, and in support of that peti<lb break="no"/>tion many documents were filed, from which 
     <lb/>
     a few extracts will probably help to clear 
     <lb/>
     our minds as to what actually took place 
     <lb/>
     then and what the changes in the school 
     <lb/>
     system were. The statement made by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Forget was as follows :

            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Until the date of the ordinance of 1892 we

     our schools, to regulate the programme of 
     <lb/>
     studies, to choose the text books, to control the

     strictly speaking they were sufficient to pre<lb break="no"/>serve to our schools their distinctive character

     of Catholic schools.

     That is what was said by Mr. Forget the

     present Lieutenant Governor of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and at that time one of 
     <lb/>
     the members of the Catholic board of edu<lb break="no"/>cation. He continued :

     Mr. Forget of course does not mean that

     should be a Protestant, but that as a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of fact it provided for a superintendent,

     That, I may say is not the case now. 
     <lb/>
     The ordinance very properly I think under 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances now provides that a cer<lb break="no"/>tain number of members shall be Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholics. We have another statement 
     <lb/>
     made by Mgr. Taché, late Archbishop of 
     <lb/>
     St. Boniface, a most distinguished and able 
     <lb/>
     prelate of the Roman Catholic church. In 
     <lb/>
     one of the documents addressed to the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on the subject he said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The petitioners had this and other dangers in 
     <lb/>
     view when they said :

            </p>

            <p>
     The effect of the ordinance is to deprive the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic separate schools of that character 
     <lb/>
     which differentiates them from public or Pro<lb break="no"/>testant schools and to leave them Catholic sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools in name only, and such it is sub<lb break="no"/>mitted is its obviously necessary effect.

            </p></quote>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     Again on page 62 Archbishop Taché says:

     <lb/>
     the abolition of all distinct character of our 
     <lb/>
     schools. Thanks to that ordinance and to the 
     <lb/>
     regulations of the council of public instruction 
     <lb/>
     which followed, this end has been to-day prac<lb break="no"/>tically attained. Nothing essential now dis<lb break="no"/>tinguishes the Catholic schools from the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant schools but the designation, now ironi<lb break="no"/>cal, of separate schools.

            <p>
     Judge Rouleau, another member of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic board said (page 341) : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     After mature examination of this ordinance I 
     <lb/>
     have come to the conclusion that it is ultra 
     <lb/>
     vires of the powers of the legislative assembly, 
     <lb/>
     for, amongst others the following reasons : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Because it is not provided by the said ordi<lb break="no"/>nance that the separate schools should be gov<lb break="no"/>erned and controlled by the minority, but that 
     <lb/>
     they are in fact controlled and governed by the 
     <lb/>
     majority. In a word, we have no separate 
     <lb/>
     school system such as provided by the spirit of 
     <lb/>
     the law, chapter 55, section 14, of the Act of 
     <lb/>
    1875. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     3. Because the section 32 of the said ordi<lb break="no"/>nance is in contradiction of section 14 of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories Act, in that it limits the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority more than it is limited 
     <lb/>
     by the said section 14. But of course the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal objection of the Catholics to the school 
     <lb/>
     ordinance is the absolute control, the choice of 
     <lb/>
     text books, the school inspection and so forth 
     <lb/>
     by the Protestant majority. If separate schools 
     <lb/>
     exist now in name they do not exist in fact. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I have read these extracts for the purpose 
     <lb/>
     of showing that when the ordinance of 1892 
     <lb/>
     was passed the distinctive character of these 
     <lb/>
     schools as separate schools, as denomina<lb break="no"/>tional schools, as schools controlled by a 
     <lb/>
     sectarian body for sectarian purposes, ab<lb break="no"/>solutely disappeared. We have here the 
     <lb/>
     statement made by these gentlemen for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of bringing the matter before the 
     <lb/>
     executive of Canada at that time, and in 
     <lb/>
     which they set out their grievances clearly 
     <lb/>
     and distinctly and in the most moderate 
     <lb/>
     terms. We have it that the clerical control 
     <lb/>
     of these schools was absolutely abolished. 
     <lb/>
     Every one recognized that it was absolutely 
     <lb/>
     abolished and in addition to that, I desire 
     <lb/>
     to say—whatever we may think of the justi<lb break="no"/>fication for the action which was taken—it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me perfectly clear, that in abolish<lb break="no"/>ing the distinctive character of the schools, 
     <lb/>
     the legislature of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     did go beyond the powers that were bes<lb break="no"/>towed upon it by this section of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875. Upon that point Sir John Thompson 
     <lb/>
     expressed his opinion. In making a report 
     <lb/>
     on one of the ordinances passed shortly 
     <lb/>
     before 1892, but somewhat similar in its 
     <lb/>
     effect—not so sweeping in its effect—Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson in substance reported, that 
     <lb/>
     this ordinance, contracts or diminishes the 
     <lb/>
     rights of minorities to an extent not con<lb break="no"/>templated by the Act of 1875, and that the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875 must nevertheless be held to re<lb break="no"/>main in force notwithstanding the passage 
     <lb/>
     of the ordinance.

     Now, Mr. Speaker, we have in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories at the present time, this 
     <lb/>
     system of public schools which was estab<lb break="no"/>lished by the Act of 1892 and referred to 
     <lb/>
     in the statements which I have read. I 
     <lb/>
     have endeavoured from a careful study of 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances : ordinance 29, which pro<lb break="no"/>vides for the establishment of the schools, 
     <lb/>
     ordinance 30 which provides for the method 
     <lb/>
     of school assessment and ordinance 31 which 
     <lb/>
     provides for the distribution of the legis<lb break="no"/>lative grant—having reference to the effi<lb break="no"/>ciency of the schools and paying by results ; 
     <lb/>
     rewarding the school which is efficient at 
     <lb/>
     the expense of the school which is not effi<lb break="no"/>cient, and thus introducing a good and 
     <lb/>
     sound principle into the education of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories—I have endeavoured by a care<lb break="no"/>ful study of these ordinances to come to 
     <lb/>
     clear and definite conclusions as to the main 
     <lb/>
     characteristics of the school system which 
     <lb/>
     exists there at the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, what are the characteristics of this 
     <lb/>
     school system ? My hon. friend the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Customs discussed the matter with 
     <lb/>
     great clearness last evening, and read from 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances to give the House a definite 
     <lb/>
     idea of what the condition of affairs was. 
     <lb/>
     Let me give what I conceive to be an accu<lb break="no"/>rate resumé of the principles which are en<lb break="no"/>forced and carried out by these ordinances. 
     <lb/>
     We have one normal school with uniform 
     <lb/>
     normal training for all teachers, and when 
     <lb/>
     I say all teachers, I mean teachers of all 
     <lb/>
     schools, separate and public ; uniform 
     <lb/>
     curricula and courses of study for all 
     <lb/>
     schools of the same grade ; uniform text 
     <lb/>
     books for all schools ; uniform qualifica<lb break="no"/>tion of teachers for all schools ; complete 
     <lb/>
     and absolute control of all schools as to 
     <lb/>
     their government and conduct, by the cen<lb break="no"/>tral school authority set up by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature under the ordinances ; complete secu<lb break="no"/>larization of all schools between 9 o'clock 
     <lb/>
     in the morning and 3.30 in the afternoon, 
     <lb/>
     except that any school, if the trustees so 
     <lb/>
     desire, may be opened with the Lord's 
     <lb/>
     prayer ; distribution of the legislative grant 
     <lb/>
     to all schools according to educational effi<lb break="no"/>ciency on principles set out in chapter 31. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then, where there is a public school, the 
     <lb/>
     minority, Protestant or Roman Catholic, 
     <lb/>
     may organize a separate school ; but every 
     <lb/>
     separate school is subject absolutely to all 
     <lb/>
     the foregoing provisions, and is in every 
     <lb/>
     sense of the term a public school. If the 
     <lb/>
     Protestants are in the minority in a dis<lb break="no"/>trict, their school is called a separate school; 
     <lb/>
     if the Catholics are in the minority in a dis<lb break="no"/>trict, their school is called a separate school; 
     <lb/>
     but both are public schools. They are abso<lb break="no"/>lutely similar save for one distinction: where 
     <lb/>
     the trustees are Protestant, there is Protes<lb break="no"/>tant teaching from half-past three to four, 
     <lb/>
     and where the trustees are Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     there is Roman Catholic teaching from half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     past three to four. That is absolutely the 
     <lb/>
     only distinction between these schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, we are about to form two provinces, 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     and we have to deal with the educational 
     <lb/>
     subject. My right hon. friend the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister says it was his intention by the 
     <lb/>
     legislation which he proposed, to continue 
     <lb/>
     the existing system in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories; and I accept that statement, of 
     <lb/>
     course, as expressing his intentions. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Chas. Fitzpatrick) the other evening ac<lb break="no"/>cepted, as I understood, the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     for drawing the clause which contained the 
     <lb/>
     educational provisions, and I understood 
     <lb/>
     him also to say that the intention was to 
     <lb/>
     continue the existing state of affairs. No<lb break="no"/>body would think of holding the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister responsible for the exact drafting 
     <lb/>
     of this clause, and I suppose it is not likely 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     drew it either. But I am bound to say, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, that when my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice employed a draftsman 
     <lb/>
     to draw this clause, with instructions to 
     <lb/>
     maintain only the existing state of affairs 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories, the draughts<lb break="no"/>man either wholly misunderstood his instruc<lb break="no"/>tions or he possessed a most remarkable 
     <lb/>
     faculty for covering things which were 
     <lb/>
     not covered by his instructions. I 
     <lb/>
     propose to devote three or four min<lb break="no"/>utes to an examination of this clause 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of showing what I think it 
     <lb/>
     means. I am not going to address a lengthy 
     <lb/>
     legal argument to the House on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject. When this clause was introduced by 
     <lb/>
     the government of which I was then a mem<lb break="no"/>ber, I conceived it to be my duty to protest 
     <lb/>
     against it, and to carry my protest to the 
     <lb/>
     extent of laying down the seals of office. 
     <lb/>
     I have no regret for the action I took. I 
     <lb/>
     think I then understood what the clause 
     <lb/>
     meant, and I think I now understand what 
     <lb/>
     it means; and while it is perhaps of no 
     <lb/>
     moment whatever to convince anybody who 
     <lb/>
     may have any doubts on the subject, or 
     <lb/>
     who may be difficult to convince as to what 
     <lb/>
     this clause means, it is unquestionably my 
     <lb/>
     duty, speaking to this House on this occa<lb break="no"/>sion. to say what I thought this clause 
     <lb/>
     meant, and what I think it means now, and 
     <lb/>
     why I felt called upon to make the protest 
     <lb/>
     that I did. In the Bill for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     creating the territory of Saskatchewan, sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16, is the educational clause. It con<lb break="no"/>sists of three subsections. It says in the 
     <lb/>
     first place : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The provisions of section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, 1867, shall apply to the 
     <lb/>
     said province as if, at the date upon which 
     <lb/>
     this Act comes into force, the territory com<lb break="no"/>prised therein were already a province, the ex<lb break="no"/>pression ' the union ' in the said section being

            <p>
     Now, what does that subsection do ? It 
     <lb/>
     applies to the new provinces the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, which we all know by heart :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     subject and according to the following provi<lb break="no"/>sions : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     1. Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Inasmuch as ' the union ' is made to mean 
     <lb/>
     the date of the passing of this Act, and the 
     <lb/>
     word ' province ' is changed to ' territory,' 
     <lb/>
     this subsection would read : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially

     <lb/>
     when this Act comes into effect. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     What would that preserve ? First of all, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, it would preserve everything 
     <lb/>
     that is set out in chapters 29, 30 and 31 of 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances ; there cannot be any possible 
     <lb/>
     doubt about that. In the next place, it 
     <lb/>
     might preserve everything that is set out 
     <lb/>
     in section 14 of the Act of 1875. It might, 
     <lb/>
     and it might not. It might be held by a 
     <lb/>
     court that the privileges held by law at the 
     <lb/>
     union were the privileges <hi rendition="simple:italic">de facto</hi> possessed 
     <lb/>
     under the ordinances as they existed at the 
     <lb/>
     union, and the court might refuse to go 
     <lb/>
     back to the provisions of the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     it is evident that there was a doubt about 
     <lb/>
     this, because the Bill re-enacts clause 14 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1875, and thus it is revived, 
     <lb/>
     crystallized and made absolutely certain. I 
     <lb/>
     have pointed out to you what Mr. Forget, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Justice Rouleau, Archbishop Taché, Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson, and Mr. Haultain, thought 
     <lb/>
     as to the Act of 1875. It is the fact that 
     <lb/>
     under the Act of 1875, a complete dual sys<lb break="no"/>tem of clerical schools was established in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, and it is the fact 
     <lb/>
     that legal authorities, like my friend Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Haultain, a quotation from whom I could 
     <lb/>
     read if I saw fit, like Sir John Thompson, to 
     <lb/>
     whom the matter was referred, thought that 
     <lb/>
     when those privileges were curtailed and 
     <lb/>
     taken away, they were taken away in de<lb break="no"/>fiance of the clause of the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     which we find in substance in clause 16 of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill before the House. Therefore we 
     <lb/>
     should have the privileges by this Act re<lb break="no"/>tained as they are in chapters 29, 30 and 31, 
     <lb/>
     of the ordinance of 1901 and as they are in 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, what more ? Here is subsection 3 : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In the appropriation of public moneys by the 
     <lb/>
     legislature in aid of education, and in the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of any moneys paid to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the said province arising from the 
     <lb/>
     school fund established by the Dominion Lands

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     I have had something to do with the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of school laws. For a number 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     of years a good deal of my time was spent 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with subjects of that kind, and I 
     <lb/>
     can give to the House my opinion, which 
     <lb/>
     they can take for what it is worth, but 
     <lb/>
     I am fairly confident that it is an 
     <lb/>
     opinion that will be justified by any court 
     <lb/>
     to which it may be referred, that the effect 
     <lb/>
     of that clause will be that if twenty years 
     <lb/>
     from now the province of Alberta under<lb break="no"/>took to apropriate $250,000 to build and 
     <lb/>
     equip a provincial university, a proportion<lb break="no"/>ate amount of money, proportionate to the 
     <lb/>
     number of separate schools as compared 
     <lb/>
     with the public schools, would have to be 
     <lb/>
     set aside for the establishment of a separate 
     <lb/>
     school institution. That is the opinion I 
     <lb/>
     have upon that clause ; that is the opinion 
     <lb/>
     I expressed to the Prime Minister at the 
     <lb/>
     time I objected to the clause, and I say it 
     <lb/>
     would be impossible for us to pass that 
     <lb/>
     clause, to allow it to go into effect, without 
     <lb/>
     putting a constitutional, irrevocable earmark 
     <lb/>
     upon the public funds of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories and upon the $50,000,000 worth 
     <lb/>
     of public lands that are in the public school 
     <lb/>
     trust. We would earmark that fund for 
     <lb/>
     ever, and would compel the legislatures of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces to divide that money, and 
     <lb/>
     in all probability to constitute one of the 
     <lb/>
     greatest endowments of sectarian education 
     <lb/>
     that has ever been proposed. That is the 
     <lb/>
     proposition which I understand to be con<lb break="no"/>cealed—partly concealed, not concealed to 
     <lb/>
     me—which I understand to be expressed by 
     <lb/>
     the terms of this clause. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have been always a strong party man. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that my political friends in 
     <lb/>
     past years have had any cause to complain 
     <lb/>
     that I have not been willing to do my share 
     <lb/>
     of the fighting, or that I have not been will<lb break="no"/>ing to take my share of the blame. If men 
     <lb/>
     are going to act together politically, when 
     <lb/>
     one makes a mistake the rest have to take 
     <lb/>
     the blame, and I have always been willing 
     <lb/>
     to take my share of the blame, and have 
     <lb/>
     always been willing to shoulder the load 
     <lb/>
     along with the rest. But I declare, and I 
     <lb/>
     am serious—if I had not been serious about 
     <lb/>
     it I would still have been a member of the 
     <lb/>
     government—I declare that I would join 
     <lb/>
     with anybody in Canada to resist the pass<lb break="no"/>age of that Bill in the terms in which it 
     <lb/>
     was placed before the House by my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). I have 
     <lb/>
     nothing more to say with regard to that. 
     <lb/>
     It was an unpleasant necessity for me to 
     <lb/>
     speak of it, but there are occasions on which 
     <lb/>
     people have to do things which constitute 
     <lb/>
     a very unpleasant necessity. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have before us now a different pro<lb break="no"/>position. My hon. friend the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition says that he cannot see any 
     <lb/>
     difference between this proposition and the 
     <lb/>
     other.

     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. The hon. gentleman said

     ' substance,' because I have it here, but if

     although my hon. friend and I may not be 
     <lb/>
     able to agree on many things, I could con<lb break="no"/>vince him that these clauses are very differ<lb break="no"/>ent. What is the effect of the clause now 
     <lb/>
     before us ? I like the first section for one 
     <lb/>
     thing, although for another thing I do not. 
     <lb/>
     I like it, in the first place, because it is 
     <lb/>
     clear. I am bound to say that I think one 
     <lb/>
     of the things that is important in legisla<lb break="no"/>tion of this kind is that it shall be such that 
     <lb/>
     the people can understand it after it is pass<lb break="no"/>ed, and shall not have to go into the courts 
     <lb/>
     and fight for years to find out what the law 
     <lb/>
     is. I think everybody can understand what 
     <lb/>
     this means

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     What does that preserve? I have read 
     <lb/>
     these ordinances through, and all that I 
     <lb/>
     can find this section to preserve—and it is 
     <lb/>
     an important thing—let us not exaggerate 
     <lb/>
     or minimize, let us know exactly what we 
     <lb/>
     are doing—I think that this is what we are 
     <lb/>
     doing and all that we are doing. This sec<lb break="no"/>tion preserves the right of the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     or Roman Catholic minority to have their 
     <lb/>
     school, a separate school in name, but a 
     <lb/>
     public school in fact, in a separate building 
     <lb/>
     if they wish. That is the right it preserves. 
     <lb/>
     It preserves, secondly, the right of the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant or Roman Catholic minority in such 
     <lb/>
     school to have religious teaching from 3.30 
     <lb/>
     to 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman from East Grey endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     work on our sympathies yesterday by re<lb break="no"/>ferring to the difficulties which some Pro<lb break="no"/>testant families in Quebec have, because 
     <lb/>
     they have to attend what is, to all intents 
     <lb/>
     and purposes, a denominational Catholic 
     <lb/>
     school, and I understood the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to be arguing against the proposal which is 
     <lb/>
     contained in this Bill when he cited that 
     <lb/>
     fact as an illustration of the evils of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I wish to say to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman that I never contemplated 
     <lb/>
     advancing that as an argument at all, but 
     <lb/>
     I gave it as an answer— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Did anybody give 
     <lb/>
     him credit for an argument ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If I am entitled to any 
     <lb/>
     respect from that side of the House, I ought 
     <lb/>
     to be at least able to say what I intended. 
     <lb/>
     I was giving it as an answer to the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Prime Minister, who had said 
     <lb/>
     that in Quebec the Protestants have nothing 
     <lb/>
     to complain of. I was not advancing it as 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
          

     an argument with reference to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. If my hon. friend did not 
     <lb/>
     intend his argument to apply to the condi<lb break="no"/>tions of the Bill it will not be necessary 
     <lb/>
     for me to answer, but I may go on to say 
     <lb/>
     that if anybody else had in his mind any 
     <lb/>
     idea that difficulties of that kind would 
     <lb/>
     arise, he may disabuse his mind of the 
     <lb/>
     idea, because they cannot arise under the 
     <lb/>
     system which is proposed in this Bill. In 
     <lb/>
     the first place, there is no such thing as a 
     <lb/>
     denominational school. Whether it is a 
     <lb/>
     separate school or a public school, a Catho<lb break="no"/>lic separate school or a Protestant separate 
     <lb/>
     school, it is a secular school from 9 a.m. to 
     <lb/>
     3.30 p.m. Then if the religious teaching 
     <lb/>
     which is given is contrary to the faith 
     <lb/>
     of the parents of a child attending it, 
     <lb/>
     there is a conscience clause that the child 
     <lb/>
     does not need to remain. So that there 
     <lb/>
     is absolutely no reason why any person 
     <lb/>
     should be embarrassed by the practice of 
     <lb/>
     the school system which is actually in effect 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories under these 
     <lb/>
     ordinances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, something has been said–a good 
     <lb/>
     deal has been said—in the press about sub<lb break="no"/>section 2, and I wish to say a word about 
     <lb/>
     that. The House, possibly, may well under<lb break="no"/>stand that I am not particularly enthusiastic 
     <lb/>
     about subsection 1, which provides for the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, as I would not be enthusiastic 
     <lb/>
     about any provision establishing separate 
     <lb/>
     schools of any kind. Only, I am not address<lb break="no"/>ing the House with the idea of convincing 
     <lb/>
     hon. members that I am an enthusiastic 
     <lb/>
     supporter of this subsection 1, for I am not. 
     <lb/>
     But, if we are to have subsection 1, if we 
     <lb/>
     are to have a provision which allows the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools to be established, then, 
     <lb/>
     surely, Mr. Speaker, we ought also to have 
     <lb/>
     a provision making it certain that the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools may have in them the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of being efficient schools. Why, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, it would be a crime against education 
     <lb/>
     to crystallize in the law of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories a provision that such and such 
     <lb/>
     people should have the right to organize 
     <lb/>
     such and such schools as public schools and 
     <lb/>
     not to protect them in the right to get the 
     <lb/>
     money which will make those schools effi<lb break="no"/>cient and enable them to advance and in<lb break="no"/>crease in efficiency in accordance with the 
     <lb/>
     desires of the persons in charge of them. 
     <lb/>
     I hesitate to vote, I find great difficulty in 
     <lb/>
     bringing myself to vote, for subsection 1. 
     <lb/>
     But it seems to me obvious that subsection 
     <lb/>
     1 without subsection 2 would be much more 
     <lb/>
     objectionable than the whole section is as 
     <lb/>
     it stands. I should think that, without 
     <lb/>
     subsection 2, the proposition of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment would be much more objectionable 
     <lb/>
     than it is. If I have made myself clear, it 
     <lb/>
     will be seen that my observations are ad<lb break="no"/>dressed to those who look upon subsection 
     <lb/>
     2 as a very outrageous interference with 
     <lb/>
     the control of public funds by the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of the province. It is an interference— 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="3109" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3109.jpg"/>
         <fw type="num">3109</fw>   <fw type="dateline">MARCH 24, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">3110</fw>
          

     there can be no question about that. But, 
     <lb/>
     as I have said, it is an interference only to 
     <lb/>
     the extent of requiring that when a sep<lb break="no"/>arate school absolutely and entirely com<lb break="no"/>plies with the law and then comes before 
     <lb/>
     the educational authorities and says : Hav<lb break="no"/>ing complied with the law, being, in every 
     <lb/>
     sense of the word a public school, but called 
     <lb/>
     a separate school only because we happen 
     <lb/>
     to be less in number than the people who 
     <lb/>
     organized the public school, we asked to 
     <lb/>
     be paid this money in proportion to the 
     <lb/>
     efficiency we can show we possess under 
     <lb/>
     the educational statutes which you have 
     <lb/>
     seen fit to pass—that, when that is shown, 
     <lb/>
     the money necessary to the efficiency of the 
     <lb/>
     schools shall be given. There is a theore<lb break="no"/>tical—I imagine it would only prove to be 
     <lb/>
     a theoretical—interference with the control 
     <lb/>
     of the public funds to that extent; but that 
     <lb/>
     is the inevitable corollary of subsection 1 ; 
     <lb/>
     and I would object to subsection 1 estab<lb break="no"/>lishing separate schools very much more if 
     <lb/>
     it were not accompanied with the provision 
     <lb/>
     that the schools established under subsec<lb break="no"/>tion 1 should be entitled to receive their 
     <lb/>
     share of the legislative grant.

     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. I would not think it neces<lb break="no"/>sary to give an opinion. Because, why in 
     <lb/>
     the name of common sense the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta, when establishing a university, 
     <lb/>
     should establish it by an amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the school ordinance, I cannot possibly con<lb break="no"/>ceive. And, if knowing that in taking such 
     <lb/>
     a course, they were going to make them<lb break="no"/>selves liable to a division of the funds, they 
     <lb/>
     had so little intelligence as to take it, I do 
     <lb/>
     not think this parliament can see far enough 
     <lb/>
     ahead to protect them against the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of their lack of foresight. I can 
     <lb/>
     tell my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) that 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
     <lb/>
     is the kind of man they have in the district 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta ; and I want to ask him if he 
     <lb/>
     thinks that my hon. friend from Edmonton, 
     <lb/>
     if he were in the legislative assembly of Al<lb break="no"/>berta, would be likely to get into such a 
     <lb/>
     trap as that ? If the legislature of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     puts itself under this section unnecessarily 
     <lb/>
     and with malice aforethought they will have 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
          

     to take the consequence ; but they are not 
     <lb/>
     obliged to put themselves under this sec<lb break="no"/>tion at all. And let me point out further 
     <lb/>that the effect of this clause is simply to 
     <lb/>require that, when the schools—the schools 
     <lb/>mentioned under the ordinance, and, as a 
     <lb/>matter of fact they are the primary schools, 
     <lb/>what we call the public schools, and not 
     <lb/>the grammar schools, the high schools or 
     <lb/>collegiate institutes, for I understand that 
     <lb/>to be the effect of the clause—when they 
     <lb/>comply with the provisions of the law, they 
     <lb/>get the ordinary share of the legislative 
     <lb/>grant. The legislature may set apart money 
     <lb/>for management, for the conduct of normal 
     <lb/>schools, for teachers' institutes ; they may 
     <lb/>set apart money for high schools, universi<lb break="no"/>ties, agricultural schools—for any and every 
     <lb/>purpose of education that they may desire; 
     <lb/>and to these the section will not apply in 
     <lb/>any way. The legislature will be free un<lb break="no"/>less they deliberately put themselves under 
     <lb/>this clause intentionally, as they would if 
     <lb/>they did what my hon. friend suggests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, what I have tried to do in this 
     <lb/>
     discussion has been not to waste the time 
     <lb/>
     of the House going over and over, and over 
     <lb/>
     again what has been said by other speak<lb break="no"/>ers as well or better than I could say it, 
     <lb/>
     but to endeavour to make clear what the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the legislation now proposed to 
     <lb/>
     the House will be when it is actually car<lb break="no"/>ried into operation. And the conclusion, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, is this—that if this legislation is 
     <lb/>
     carried into effect it preserves just the two 
     <lb/>
     privileges which I spoke of the privilege 
     <lb/>
     of the Roman Catholic or Protestant mino<lb break="no"/>rity to have a separate school house, and the 
     <lb/>
     privilege of having religious instruction be<lb break="no"/>tween half-past three and four o'clock in 
     <lb/>
     the afternoon. But there cannot be under 
     <lb/>
     this system any control of the school by 
     <lb/>
     any clerical or sectarian body. There can<lb break="no"/>not be any sectarian teaching between nine 
     <lb/>
     o'clock in the morning and half-past three 
     <lb/>
     in the afternoon. So that, so far as we have 
     <lb/>
     objections to separate schools based upon 
     <lb/>
     the idea of church control, clerical control, 
     <lb/>
     or ecclesiasticism in any form, this system 
     <lb/>
     of schools is certainly not open to that ob<lb break="no"/>jection. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I wish to say a word or two, if the 
     <lb/>
     House will pardon me, about my own posi<lb break="no"/>tion in regard to the principle involved in 
     <lb/>
     this discussion. I have a record upon this 
     <lb/>
     question, as hon. members are all aware. It 
     <lb/>
     is of no special importance to the House, 
     <lb/>
     and I should apologize for mentioning it 
     <lb/>
     were it not for the fact that some refer<lb break="no"/>ence to it is necessary to the argument 
     <lb/>
     which I intend very briefly to present. When 
     <lb/>
     we, in the province of Manitoba undertook 
     <lb/>
     to remove what was a separate school sys<lb break="no"/>tem, that was ' inefficient to a point of absur<lb break="no"/>dity ' we found ourselves confronted with 
     <lb/>
     many and serious difficulties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The school system which we abolished 
     <lb/>
     by the Public School Act of 1890 in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba, was precisely the 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="3111" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3111.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3111</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>   <fw type="num">3112</fw>
       

     same school system as the system that was 
     <lb/>
     abolished by the ordinance of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories in 1892. The two were 
     <lb/>
     abolished almost at the same time ; but 
     <lb/>
     I am bound to say that our friends in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories succeeded in getting 
     <lb/>
     their reform with a good deal less difficulty 
     <lb/>
     and a good deal less turmoil that did the 
     <lb/>
     little province of Manitoba. If hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men will look at the documents relating to 
     <lb/>
     the suit that took place between the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba and the Dominion, or if 
     <lb/>
     they will look at the speeches that were 
     <lb/>
     made by men speaking on behalf of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince and who know the circumstances of 
     <lb/>
     the case, they will find that, although I 
     <lb/>
     myself and others took strong ground against 
     <lb/>
     the principle of separation in education—and 
     <lb/>
     my opinions upon that subject are just as 
     <lb/>
     strong to-day as they were then—although 
     <lb/>
     we took strong ground upon that principle, 
     <lb/>
     yet the attacks we made were not so much 
     <lb/>
     on that account as they were on account 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that the separate school sys<lb break="no"/>tem of the province was admittedly ineffi<lb break="no"/>cient, and that children were being allowed 
     <lb/>
     by thousands to grow up in absolute ignor<lb break="no"/>ance and illiteracy. That was the ground 
     <lb/>
     upon which we attacked that system. We 
     <lb/>
     said then : Your system is inefficient ; you 
     <lb/>
     have taken the public money and you have 
     <lb/>
     not applied it for the purpose of giving the 
     <lb/>
     children the education they ought to have ; 
     <lb/>
     and we pointed to the fact that in districts 
     <lb/>
     where this clerically controlled system had 
     <lb/>
     been in force, the children had grown up 
     <lb/>
     in ignorance and the population was illiter<lb break="no"/>ate, and that fact could not be disputed. 
     <lb/>
     
      </p>

            <p>Sir, my hon. friend the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms, speaking last night, referred to the 
     <lb/>fact that it was said that the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba had been harsh in abolishing that 
     <lb/>system. Well, Sir, I am here to say that 
     <lb/>you cannot abolish abuses of that kind 
     <lb/>by handling people with kid gloves. I am 
     <lb/>here to say that if there is any act in my 
     <lb/>public life I am proud of, it is the fact that 
     <lb/>I was one of those who helped to abolish that 
     <lb/>system of education in Manitoba in the 
     <lb/>year 1890. I know perfectly well that I am 
     <lb/>speaking upon a subject upon which there 
     <lb/>may not be very much unanimity of op<lb break="no"/>inion ; but I claim the right to have my 
     <lb/>own opinion on this subject, and I do not 
     <lb/>think that any man in this House, Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic or Protestant, will think any the 
     <lb/>less of me because I have the courage to 
     <lb/>state what I think. Although that was the 
     <lb/>fact, and although my hon. friend who sits 
     <lb/>opposite, the member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>(Mr. Foster), was one of those who tried to 
     <lb/>restore that inefficient  system and compel 
     <lb/>us again to bring about a condition of affairs 
     <lb/>in which the public money would be wasted 
     <lb/>and a proper system of education would not 
     <lb/>be given to the children, they failed in that 
     <lb/> attempt. And why did they fail ? They fail<lb break="no"/>ed because the right hon. gentleman who 
     <lb/>
   
            <cb/>
           

     leads this government stood in their way— 
     <lb/>
     that is the reason why they failed. And I 
     <lb/>
     want to say that we from the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba who were engaged in that contest 
     <lb/>
     have never forgotten that gentlemen on the 
     <lb/>
     other side of the House, that my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) with whom 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately I do not often agree, and 
     <lb/>
     many others, left their party upon that ques<lb break="no"/>tion and stood for what I believe to be 
     <lb/>
     the proper principle, and I venture to think 
     <lb/>
     that the gentlemen who did so will always 
     <lb/>
     be remembered as having on that important 
     <lb/>
     occasion done what they believed to be 
     <lb/>
     right, though contrary to the interests of 
     <lb/>
     their party. But my right hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister did not take the stand he did 
     <lb/>
     because he necessarily agreed with the views 
     <lb/>
     that I entertained, and that we in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba entertained upon that 
     <lb/>
     subject. As I understand the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, he has always been an advocate 
     <lb/>
     in principle of separate schools, he does 
     <lb/>
     not dispute that. But he did dispute the 
     <lb/>
     moral right of the gentlemen who then con<lb break="no"/>trolled the administration of Canada to 
     <lb/>
     override the deliberate judgment of the 
     <lb/>
     people of Manitoba upon a matter which 
     <lb/>
     was vital to them, and which we in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba knew very much more 
     <lb/>
     about than the gentlemen who were en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to thwart us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, notwithstanding the fact that our 
     <lb/>
     opinions upon that subject were so strong, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding the fact that we had gone 
     <lb/>
     through a violent contest, a contest in which 
     <lb/>
     the feelings of men were deeply aroused, 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Selkirk (Mr. Greenway) then the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of Manitoba and my leader, 
     <lb/>
     and myself, at that time, prior to the year 
     <lb/>
     1896, recognized the fact that it was neces<lb break="no"/>sary in some of these cases to compromise, 
     <lb/>
     that we could not expect to have, alto<lb break="no"/>gether and at all times, our own opinions 
     <lb/>
     carried out to the fullest possible extent. 
     <lb/>
     When the government of Sir Charles Tupper 
     <lb/>
     sent commissioners to the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba for the purpose of discusssing this ques<lb break="no"/>tion with us, the commissioners consisting of 
     <lb/>
     Lord Strathcona, then Sir Donald A. Smith, 
     <lb/>
     the late Mr. Dickey and Senator Desjar<lb break="no"/>dins—when they were sent up for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of discussing this question, I had the 
     <lb/>
     honour of being appointed with one of 
     <lb/>
     my colleagues, Mr. Cameron, to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the question with them. We then recognized 
     <lb/>
     the fact that a compromise of some kind 
     <lb/>
     would probably have to be adopted in the 
     <lb/>
     end, and we made certain proposals to these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen looking to a compromise with 
     <lb/>
     the view of meeting the wishes of our Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic friends. We told them that, 
     <lb/>
     whatever our private disposition might be, 
     <lb/>
     yet by reason of the pledges we had made 
     <lb/>
     to the people of the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     in the election we had just gone through, 
     <lb/>
     we could not possibly compromise upon the 
     <lb/>

     question of the separation of the children 
     <lb/>
     in the school houses, but we offered a com<lb break="no"/>promise upon other things. But the commis<lb break="no"/>sioners declined our offer and came back, 
     <lb/>
     and the government then undertook to 
     <lb/>
     proceed with the Remedial Bill. When the 
     <lb/>
     election was over and the government of 
     <lb/>
     Sir Charles Tupper had been defeated, and 
     <lb/>
    Mr. Laurier, now Sir Wilfrid Laurier, came 
     <lb/>into power, he sent for the members of the 
     <lb/>Manitoba government to which I then be<lb break="no"/>longed, and asked us what our views were. 
     <lb/>We pointed the right hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>the proposition we had made to the commis<lb break="no"/>sioners of Sir Charles Tupper, the same pro<lb break="no"/>position ipsissima verba, and we said that 
     <lb/>was the best we could do. The right hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman accepted that proposition, wisely, 
     <lb/>as the result shows, because matters are 
     <lb/>going very much more smoothly and satis<lb break="no"/>factorily in Manitoba since then. We drew 
     <lb/>up a basis of compromise. It will be found in 
     <lb/>the sessional papers of this House. The 
     <lb/>terms were submitted to the leading men 
     <lb/>of both political parties who had stood by 
     <lb/>us in the fight in which we had been en<lb break="no"/>gaged. We did not desire that any prin<lb break="no"/>ciple should be yielded without full con<lb break="no"/>sultation. Amongst others it was submit<lb break="no"/>ted to the late Dalton McCarthy, and it 
     <lb/>was approved by him. That compromise 
     <lb/>was carried into legislative effect. It does 
     <lb/>not go quite so far as the compromise upon 
     <lb/>this question which is before the House at 
     <lb/>the present time ; but it was a substan<lb break="no"/>tial compromise on the general principle 
     <lb/>with which we had to deal. Yet at that 
     <lb/>time there were some men who said : No 
     <lb/>compromise ; who said : Don't give in 
     <lb/>till you get the whole thing, you will get it 
     <lb/>if you stand up. I did not agree with that 
     <lb/>view. I thought that some compromise 
     <lb/>should be made. My colleagues in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Manitoba thought the same 
     <lb/>thing, and a compromise was made. But, 
     <lb/>Mr. Speaker,—and this is an observation I 
     <lb/>desire to commend to the attention of the 
     <lb/>House—there were very very few people 
     <lb/>who said, no compromise. And why was 
     <lb/>it that so few people then opposed the com<lb break="no"/>promise ? It was because the people of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada had been fighting about this ques<lb break="no"/>tion for five years, they were sick and tired 
     <lb/>of the contest, and desired that there should 
     <lb/>be a compromise of some kind so that 
     <lb/>they might have peace. More than that, 
     <lb/>the material progress of this country 
     <lb/>had been stopped. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>Lanark (Mr. Haggart) knows perfectly well 
     <lb/>that the Manitoba school question paralys<lb break="no"/>ed governmental activity for a considerable 
     <lb/>length of time. The members of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment practically did nothing else ; they 
     <lb/>could do nothing else but attend to the 
     <lb/>agitation and difficulties that arose out of 
     <lb/>this question. When a question of this 
     <lb/>kind has to be met it has to be met in a 
     <lb/>practical way. Complications arise, govern<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
         
mental activity and administration are ab<lb break="no"/>solutely destroyed, it is impossible for min<lb break="no"/>isters to attend to their departmental duties 
     <lb/>
     or to attend to the business of the country 
     <lb/>
     as they should. Therefore, in 1896 when 
     <lb/>
     this settlement was made—although it was 
     <lb/>
     a settlement that hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     had refused to accept—although it was a 
     <lb/>
     settlement which led my right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the government out of a great 
     <lb/>
     difficulty and made his path smooth, yet 
     <lb/>
     the settlement has never been combated or 
     <lb/>
     criticised by any member of this House 
     <lb/>
     from that time up to the present moment.

            <p>

     <lb/>
     in the compromise that wherever there was 
     <lb/>
     a certain number of Catholic children 
     <lb/>
     there should be a Catholic teacher. In that 
     <lb/>
     way it goes farther than the compromise 
     <lb/>
     we have here. I cannot from memory give 
     <lb/>
     the exact figures but in a rural district 
     <lb/>
     there was a certain number of children called 
     <lb/>
     for and in a town a larger number was 
     <lb/>
     called for, and wherever a certain number 
     <lb/>
     of Catholic children attended a school then, 
     <lb/>
     for each unit of that number, a Catholic tea<lb break="no"/>cher was required to be employed. Further, 
     <lb/>
     a provision we inserted that the children 
     <lb/>
     should, where the rooms in the school 
     <lb/>
     house permitted it, be divided up at half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     past three for the purpose of having relig<lb break="no"/>ious exercises, the Catholic teacher taking 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic children and the other teacher 
     <lb/>
     taking the Protestant children :

     number of Roman Catholic children in a

     school they are nearly all Roman Catholic

     Mr. Speaker, we are face to face with the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of dealing with the question of 
     <lb/>
     giving these provinces a constitution and 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the question of educational 
     <lb/>
     legislation. I understand that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the leader of the opposition takes 
     <lb/>
     the position, in which I concur, that we 
     <lb/>
     have a right if we so desire and the legal 
     <lb/>
     power to modify in detail the terms of 
     <lb/>
     section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act in such a way that the province as it 
     <lb/>
     was formed would have complete autonomy 
     <lb/>
     or liberty in regard to its educational legis<lb break="no"/>lation. If I am not correctly representing 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend he will correct me.

     <lb/>
     my belief. Does my hon. friend wish me 
     <lb/>
     to state what it is ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. Certainly, I would be very 
     <lb/>
     glad.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. My position is that 
     <lb/>
     if you apply to these provinces the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution as they are to-day, they 
     <lb/>
     will give to these provinces the absolute 
     <lb/>
     right to deal with their own educational 
     <lb/>
     affairs. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. I am sorry that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend said that because I had thought 
     <lb/>
     from the resolution which he has placed 
     <lb/>
     before us that his position was the posi<lb break="no"/>tion which I stated, and to my mind it 
     <lb/>
     would be a position that would be very 
     <lb/>
     much stronger. My hon. friend's amend<lb break="no"/>ment, I find, is as follows :

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Upon the establishment of a province in

            <p>
     If I understand my hon. friend aright. 
     <lb/>
     and I regret his position is not as I stated 
     <lb/>
     it, he says that by the application of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, ipsissima verba, 
     <lb/>
     the effect of it would be that the provinces 
     <lb/>
     would have unlimited power in regard to 
     <lb/>
     education. But, my hon. friend can only 
     <lb/>
     give his opinion to that effect as a lawyer. 
     <lb/>
     Other lawyers do not think so. Other law<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
          

     yers think the direct opposite. Other law<lb break="no"/>yers think that if you put section 93 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act into effect the 
     <lb/>
     time when the province came in would be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as the 1st of July, 1905, and that 
     <lb/>
     the condition of affairs which would be pre<lb break="no"/>served by the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     would be the condition of affairs as they 
     <lb/>
     exist on the 1st of July, 1905. I do not 
     <lb/>
     say which is correct. It is a difficult point 
     <lb/>
     to decide, but surely we are not, when we 
     <lb/>
     are about to legislate upon this subject, go<lb break="no"/>ing to allow the provinces to settle this 
     <lb/>
     question by a long course of litigation, 
     <lb/>
     turmoil and dispute. To show how difficult 
     <lb/>
     it is to have a positive opinion upon such 
     <lb/>
     a point I have heard men who are con<lb break="no"/>sidered to be good lawyers flout the idea, 
     <lb/>
     or the proposition of law which my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend suggests and I have heard men who 
     <lb/>
     are pretty good lawyers flout the opposite 
     <lb/>
     idea. In a question of that kind we who 
     <lb/>
     are lawyers all know it is absolutely impos<lb break="no"/>sible to tell how it will be held when it 
     <lb/>
     comes to be threshed out in the courts. To 
     <lb/>
     my mind for this parilament, sitting here 
     <lb/>
     in all its sovereign responsibility to give 
     <lb/>
     these Territories a constitution, to delib<lb break="no"/>erately go to work and, for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     getting out of the responsibility of doing one 
     <lb/>
     thing or the other, give that constitution in 
     <lb/>
     such terms that they will have to have a 
     <lb/>
     series of lawsuits for half a dozen years to 
     <lb/>
     have the question settled would be the most 
     <lb/>
     unstatesmanlike thing that we could do.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I do not want my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend to misunderstand me. He has 
     <lb/>
     in the first place only quoted part of my 
     <lb/>
     argument. He speaks of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     coming in. A large part of my argument 
     <lb/>
     was devoted not to the question of a pro<lb break="no"/>vince coming in but to that of a province 
     <lb/>
     being created which my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     not dealt with at all. But, apart from that 
     <lb/>
     and in answer to what he has just said 
     <lb/>
     my view is a very simple one. I say that 
     <lb/>
     we have the right and only the right to ap<lb break="no"/>ply the constitution as it exists at present 
     <lb/>
     in respect of the distribution of legislative 
     <lb/>
     power. My hon. friend seems to think that 
     <lb/>
     we can go on and do something more. If 
     <lb/>
     my view is correct we cannot go on and do 
     <lb/>
     anything more, and if we enact from now 
     <lb/>
     until this time next year it will not alter 
     <lb/>
     the result, because in the end our right to 
     <lb/>
     legislate must be determined in the courts. 
     <lb/>
     That is a very simple proposition.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. My hon. friends statement 
     <lb/>
     does not alter my view in regard to his posi<lb break="no"/>tion. First of all, we would unquestionably 
     <lb/>
     have to change section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>

     not the least doubt in the world of our con<lb break="no"/>stitutional capacity to do it under the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act of 1871. If my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend takes the trouble to look up the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of so eminent a predecessor of his 
     <lb/>
     own as Sir John Thompson, he will find 
     <lb/>
     that Sir John Thompson expresses the same 
     <lb/>
     opinion. I think there can hardly be any 
     <lb/>
     doubt whatever that we can and should 
     <lb/>
     exercise that power. But, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     if there were any doubt about it; if we 
     <lb/>
     passed this Act in acordance with our own 
     <lb/>
     judgment and our own discretion, giving 
     <lb/>
     these provinces such a constitution as we in 
     <lb/>
     our judgment think they ought to have by 
     <lb/>
     making a change in section 93, and there 
     <lb/>
     were any remote doubt about the constitu<lb break="no"/>tionality of that ; is it not perfectly clear 
     <lb/>
     that all the Prime Minister would have to 
     <lb/>
     do would be as was done in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act get a confirming Act from the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament. There would not be 
     <lb/>
     any difficulty about it, and if there were the 
     <lb/>
     least doubt that is the course that should be 
     <lb/>
     adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, if there is any doubt 
     <lb/>
     about our power, I say that in fact nobody 
     <lb/>
     else but us can deal with it. We are here as 
     <lb/>
     the only possible constitutional body to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question upon its merits. Does 
     <lb/>
     any one imagine that the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment is going to discuss this question and 
     <lb/>
     undertake to settle it upon its merits ? 
     <lb/>
     Then, who is going to settle it upon its 
     <lb/>
     merits ? The imperial parliament would 
     <lb/>
     never do that, they would deal with it as 
     <lb/>
     we recommended; they would say : you are 
     <lb/>
     the governing body ; possibly technically 
     <lb/>
     you may not have enough power given you 
     <lb/>
     by the Act of 1871, but if you have not we 
     <lb/>
     will give it to you ; it is your business, 
     <lb/>
     settle it as you see fit. And Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     that is the only way it can be settled. We 
     <lb/>
     are unquestionably in the position of being 
     <lb/>
     the only body that can ever deal with the 
     <lb/>
     merits of this case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For my part, Mr. Speaker, I have no hesi<lb break="no"/>tation in saying what my own opinion would 
     <lb/>
     be : it would be that the province ought 
     <lb/>
     to be left entirely free to deal with its own 
     <lb/>
     educational affairs. But, I would not get 
     <lb/>
     at it in the way that my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     R. L. Borden) does, by saying, the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion does that, but as there is a certain 
     <lb/>
     amount of doubt about it I would strike out 
     <lb/>
     the limiting clause and I would make it 
     <lb/>
     so clear that there would not be any doubt 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of any one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. If we undertake to 
     <lb/>
     do that and do not possess the power under 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Acts 1867 to 1868, 
     <lb/>
     would not the courts control in the end as 
     <lb/>
     they have a dozen times, as they have a 
     <lb/>
     hundred times both with regard to provin<lb break="no"/>cial and Dominion legislation? 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. What was done in the case 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba ? Was section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act applied ipsissima verba? 
     <lb/>
     If my hon. friend will look at it he 
     <lb/>
     will find it was not. He will find that 
     <lb/>
     in the case of the province of Manitoba a 
     <lb/>
     special section was enacted by this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and he will find that although ques<lb break="no"/>tions were raised as to the competence of 
     <lb/>
     this parliament to pass that Act, the doubt 
     <lb/>
     was not as to the competence of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to pass section 93, but as to other sec<lb break="no"/>tions. If he will go back further he will 
     <lb/>
     find that notwithstanding that questions 
     <lb/>
     were raised as to competence of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, the law officers of the Crown in Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain said we were perfectly competent, 
     <lb/>
     and that the Manitoba Act was within the 
     <lb/>
     competency of this parliament. If this par<lb break="no"/>liament had the power in the case of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba to put in a separate provision for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of placing separate schools clearly 
     <lb/>
     and distinctly upon the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     have we not the power to change section 
     <lb/>
     93 by taking out the limitation ? If we 
     <lb/>
     can do one thing we can do the other; if 
     <lb/>
     we can change a subsection then we can 
     <lb/>
     take a subsection out. That proposition is 
     <lb/>
     entirely obvious. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I said that so far as I was concerned I 
     <lb/>
     thought we had the power to leave the 
     <lb/>
     provinces absolutely free, and that for my 
     <lb/>
     part if I had my own way that is the policy 
     <lb/>
     I would pursue. But I quite recognize the 
     <lb/>
     strength of the argument upon the other 
     <lb/>
     side. We are face to face with two posi<lb break="no"/>tions— I shall only detain the House for a 
     <lb/>
     few minutes longer; I apologize for speak<lb break="no"/>ing at such length.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SIFT1">Mr. SIFTON</persName>. We are face to face with 
     <lb/>
     two propositions. We have the principle 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act to apply. 
     <lb/>
     The leader of the government and myself 
     <lb/>
     can agree that we ought to apply the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, but as to the particular way 
     <lb/>
     in which we are to apply that principle we 
     <lb/>
     do not agree. But we ought to apply the 
     <lb/>
     principle, and when we come to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion : how are we to apply it, we come up 
     <lb/>
     against two separate and distinct and irre<lb break="no"/>concilable propositions. From my stand<lb break="no"/>point I say: inasmuch as the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories are not a constitutionally free 
     <lb/>
     community; inasmuch as the ordinances 
     <lb/>
     passed are ordinances passed under a special 
     <lb/>
     and limited power ; therefore when they 
     <lb/>
     come into the family of provinces we ought 
     <lb/>
     not to apply to them the principle of observ<lb break="no"/>ing the status quo, because the status quo 
     <lb/>
     was not brought about by their own unli<lb break="no"/>mited powers. There is also the view 
     <lb/>
     that is presented to us by our friends 
     <lb/>
     led by the right hon. the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter, and held by many other gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     here. They say—it was well stated by the 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="3119" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3119.jpg"/>

     Minister of Finance—they say : you con<lb break="no"/>stituted that territory 35 years ago ; 30 
     <lb/>
     years ago you established separate schools ; 
     <lb/>
     you said when you were doing it that you 
     <lb/>
     intended it to be permanent ; those who 
     <lb/>
     made speeches when the Bill was presented 
     <lb/>
     to parliament, said we bring this Bill to 
     <lb/>
     parliament because we want the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories to know what 
     <lb/>
     kind of institutions they are going to have, 
     <lb/>
     and among others they are going to have 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. Half a million people 
     <lb/>
     have gone into the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     knowing what the laws were. Although 
     <lb/>
     I am not absolutely convinced by the argu<lb break="no"/>ment made by these gentlemen, yet I know 
     <lb/>
     that out of that population of half a million 
     <lb/>
     there are 125,000 Roman Catholics, and I 
     <lb/>
     further know that many of these people 
     <lb/>
     actually went to the educational department 
     <lb/>
     at Regina by their authorized representa<lb break="no"/>tives and got copies of these school ordin<lb break="no"/>ances so that they might know whether 
     <lb/>
     they would be allowed to have separate 
     <lb/>
     schools before they came into the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. Therefore, our friends say: 
     <lb/>
     here is a state of affairs existing for thirty 
     <lb/>
     years, carried on under your direction, creat<lb break="no"/>ing vested rights in 125,000 people who have 
     <lb/>
     gone there upon the strength of your guar<lb break="no"/>antee. And so, with some degree of plausi<lb break="no"/>bility they argue : you are far more bound 
     <lb/>
     to maintain that state of affairs than if it 
     <lb/>
     had been created by the province, because 
     <lb/>
     you are responsible for it yourselves. Here 
     <lb/>
     we have two separate and irreconcilable 
     <lb/>
     propositions. If I talked for ever I do not 
     <lb/>
     think I would convince the gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     do not think as I do upon this subject. I 
     <lb/>
     do not think I could convince them that we 
     <lb/>
     should leave the legislature of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     absolutely free in this matter—although I 
     <lb/>
     am for my part convinced after the history 
     <lb/>
     of the question in the province of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
    and from the knowledge I have of what 
     <lb/>public men in the Territories think on this 
     <lb/>whole question from beginning to end—I am 
     <lb/>firmly convinced that it would be better for 
     <lb/>the Roman Catholic people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories if the legislature were left 
     <lb/>absolutely free. But, I shall never convince 
     <lb/>the gentlemen who do not think so ; I shall 
     <lb/>never get them to think as I do on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, because if I talked for a hundred years 
     <lb/>their views would be just the same as they 
     <lb/>are to-day.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I am very much inclined to think, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that they will not be able to con<lb break="no"/>vince me. I do not think they would be able 
     <lb/>
     to convince me that it would not be better 
     <lb/>
     that the legislature of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories should be free. Now, what are we go<lb break="no"/>ing to do ? We are face to face with an abso<lb break="no"/>lutely irreconcilable state of affairs. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the Minister of Finance put it 
     <lb/>
     very well the other evening. He said : 
     <lb/>
     What are you going to do ? what are you 
     <lb/>
     going to decide ? The King's government 
     <lb/>
     must be carried on ; the business of the 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
          

     country must be carried on ; and there is 
     <lb/>
     only one of two ways in which this question 
     <lb/>
     can be decided. The Protestant people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada can say to the Roman Catholic peo<lb break="no"/>ple : You cannot convince us, we cannot 
     <lb/>
     convince you, but there are more of us than 
     <lb/>
     there are of you, and we are going to vote 
     <lb/>
     you down. I put aside a proposition of that 
     <lb/>
     kind. There is no man in this government 
     <lb/>
     who would contemplate attempting to carry 
     <lb/>
     out a proposition of that kind if he had the 
     <lb/>
     power. Least of all would my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     who leads the opposition desire to see a pro<lb break="no"/>position of that kind carried out, no matter 
     <lb/>
     what his views on the merits of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion might be. Then, what are you going to 
     <lb/>
     do ? What is the position of affairs going 
     <lb/>
     to be ? You cannot make a political reli<lb break="no"/>gious issue of these questions either for the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House or for the inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of the Dominion of Canada ; and even 
     <lb/>
     if you did—as my hon. friend the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance very well said : if those who 
     <lb/>
     thought in this House as I do combined 
     <lb/>
     with me and if the result of their efforts 
     <lb/>
     were to drive the right hon. gentleman (the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister) from office on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, all that my hon. friend the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Finance said the other night, and 
     <lb/>
     much more, would be true. No greater poli<lb break="no"/>tical misfortune could happen to hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite than that they should be 
     <lb/>
     called upon to take office under such circum<lb break="no"/>stances. Suppose it happened. Every man 
     <lb/>
     who knows the political history of Canada 
     <lb/>
     knows that we might fight about this ques<lb break="no"/>tion year in and year out for years, the 
     <lb/>
     political and financial progress of the coun<lb break="no"/>try might be paralyzed, the business of the 
     <lb/>
     country would be blocked by the condition 
     <lb/>
     of affairs, and after it was all done, we 
     <lb/>
     should be simply where we had started, and 
     <lb/>
     the people would have to come together on 
     <lb/>
     this question and compromise their differ<lb break="no"/>ences. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What I desire to say, Mr. Speaker, in con<lb break="no"/>clusion, is that I have very strong views on 
     <lb/>
     this question. I have not concealed those 
     <lb/>
     views from the members of the House. 
     <lb/>
     There is a certain distance that I am pre<lb break="no"/>pared to go in the way of compromise ; I 
     <lb/>
     have so expressed myself to my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Prime Minister. To the extent 
     <lb/>
     which is embodied in the proposition before 
     <lb/>
     this House I am willing to go. I am willing 
     <lb/>
     to go that far because I believe that the 
     <lb/>
     essential principles of a first-class, thoroughly 
     <lb/>
     national school system are not impaired, and 
     <lb/>
     the taint of what I call ecclesiasticism in 
     <lb/>
     schools, and which in my judgment always 
     <lb/>
     produces inefficiency, will not be found in 
     <lb/>
     the school system of the Northwest under 
     <lb/>
     this legislation, unless the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest choose to have it, in which case 
     <lb/>
     it is their business and not ours. I may 
     <lb/>
     say, Mr. Speaker, that I have found a very 
     <lb/>
     great deal of difficulty in deciding upon my 
     <lb/>
     course on this question. When I saw the 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="3121" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3121.jpg"/>

     Bills that had been introduced, I at once 
     <lb/>
     came to the conclusion that 1 could not de<lb break="no"/>cide upon my course while remaining a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the government, in the enjoyment of 
     <lb/>
     office and the emoluments of office. I came 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that, whatever anybody 
     <lb/>
     else might do, my course was perfectly 
     <lb/>
     clear: I should, when this question came up, 
     <lb/>
     be in a position to speak with a freedom with 
     <lb/>
     which a member of the government could 
     <lb/>
     not speak, and I should be called upon to 
     <lb/>
     decide to what extent and how far I would 
     <lb/>
     be prepared to compromise opinions which 
     <lb/>
     I had publicly expressed, and opinions which 
     <lb/>
     I still hold in order not to destroy the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the country. That question 
     <lb/>
     which comes to every man in public life 
     <lb/>
     sooner or later, comes to-day to a good many 
     <lb/>
     men in this House of Commons. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion is how far a man is justified in com<lb break="no"/>promising his opinion for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     preventing a political crisis. That is a 
     <lb/>
     question which nearly every man in this 
     <lb/>
     House has had to decide before ; but per<lb break="no"/>haps no person has had to decide it under 
     <lb/>
     quite as remarkable circumstances as the 
     <lb/>
     present. For myself, as to the political 
     <lb/>
     effect upon myself, I care not for that. I 
     <lb/>
     have relieved myself, I think, of the impu<lb break="no"/>tation that the course I have taken has been 
     <lb/>
     influenced by considerations of office or the 
     <lb/>
     considerations of my party remaining in 
     <lb/>
    office ; and therefore I have to say, having 
     <lb/>given the subject the best consideration that 
     <lb/>1 am capable of giving it, and having given 
     <lb/>it that consideration not only from the stand<lb break="no"/>point of the position of affairs in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment but from the standpoint of the position 
     <lb/>of affairs in the Northwest Territories in 
     <lb/>time to come, that I can, though not with 
     <lb/>very much enthusiasm, and with some de<lb break="no"/>gree of reluctance, give my support to the 
     <lb/>Bill.

     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that 
     <lb/>
     when the mountain would not go to Maho<lb break="no"/>met, Mahomet went to the mountain and 
     <lb/>
     that saying has been illustrated, I will not 
     <lb/>
     say in a very pleasing way, this afternooon. 
     <lb/>
     I was very much puzzled, while my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Mr. Sifton) was speaking, to know 
     <lb/>
     just what line I should be compelled to take 
     <lb/>
     in what appeared to be a triangular duel. 
     <lb/>
     I was afraid to appear even to assent to the 
     <lb/>
     opinions of my hon. friend, lest I too might 
     <lb/>
     be treated with the same contemptuous in<lb break="no"/>difference that the government according to 
     <lb/>
     his own account, had given to him ; and 
     <lb/>
     I was afraid to appear to differ from him, 
     <lb/>
     for I did not know how long it would be 
     <lb/>
     before I would find that he and I were in 
     <lb/>
     perfect accord. I thought, when the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman opened his remarks, that he 
     <lb/>
     would perhaps shed a bright light on the 
     <lb/>
     subject under discussion, which would en<lb break="no"/>able us to understand how and why this 
     <lb/>
     country is being plunged into the excitement 
     <lb/>
     which prevails, and why the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
           
tleman who brought down this Bill brought 
     <lb/>
     it down so hastily, so inadvisedly, and ap<lb break="no"/>parently with so little preparation. When 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman who has just taken his 
     <lb/>
     seat gave his reasons a short time ago for 
     <lb/>
     leaving the government, he told us that he 
     <lb/>
     had discussed various things with the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister. He told us to-day that he had 
     <lb/>
     not discussed the educational question ; and 
     <lb/>
     yet, when he spoke the other day, he was 
     <lb/>
     careful to explain that he had not neglected 
     <lb/>
     the educational question, but that, to quote 
     <lb/>
     his own words :

     When it was determined that during this ses<lb break="no"/>sion of parliament legislation should be intro<lb break="no"/>duced creating new provinces out of a portion

     And so, Sir, although the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, as he was then, was spending his 
     <lb/>
     recess in giving calm and I suppose judi<lb break="no"/>cial consideration to this important ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education, and although meeting 
     <lb/>
     his leader from time to time and discussing 
     <lb/>
     the minor features of the Bill, he never 
     <lb/>
     thought it worth his while to discuss with 
     <lb/>
     his leader, nor did his leader waste his time 
     <lb/>
     in discussing with him, this important ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And so, Sir. it is that we find that, al<lb break="no"/>though conference followed conference, no<lb break="no"/>thing was said at these conferences on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of education, but the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior retiring to the privacy of his own 
     <lb/>
     chamber, then apparently gave himself sole<lb break="no"/>ly and exclusively to rapturous contempla<lb break="no"/>tion of this interesting subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion. Perhaps the reason that the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman did not before suggest education to 
     <lb/>
     his colleagues was because he had received  
     <lb/>
     so little respect and consideration from them 
     <lb/>
     in the matters he had consulted with them 
     <lb/>
     about, that he did not think it worth his 
     <lb/>
     while even to mention this subject. He 
     <lb/>
     has told us that although he had made 
     <lb/>
     suggestions, being Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     and best cognizant of the needs of the North<lb break="no"/>west, he could not even persuade his col<lb break="no"/>leagues where they should draw the line 
     <lb/>
     between the two territories, perhaps as 
     <lb/>
     trifling a proposition as could be considered. 
     <lb/>
     They would not even accept his suggestion 
     <lb/>
     on such a trifling matter as that, but put the 
     <lb/>
     boundary some sixty miles west from where 
     <lb/>
     he thought it should be. He thought, too, 
     <lb/>
     that the provinces should extend to the 
     <lb/>
     north, and no doubt did his best to per<lb break="no"/>suade his colleagues that they should ex<lb break="no"/>tend to the north, but although he knew 
     <lb/>
     the situation ten times as well as his ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     colleagues he was not consulted, he was not 
     <lb/>
     made a member of this important sub<lb break="no"/>committee, and all his suggestions on these 
     <lb/>
     points were treated with contemptuous in<lb break="no"/>difference. Then on the important question

     of the financial arrangements and the land 
     <lb/>
     question, which are so closely connected as 
     <lb/>
     to form one subject, we find that al<lb break="no"/>though the hon. gentleman had strong views 
     <lb/>
     —and I may say that I think his views are 
     <lb/>
     far more correct than those of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment—although he presented his case as 
     <lb/>
     ably, as eloquently and as persuasively as 
     <lb/>
     he has this afternoon spoken to the House, 
     <lb/>
     still, on that point too, the government re<lb break="no"/>fused to listen, and so the land and fiscal 
     <lb/>
     questions are complicated by the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of a principle which, as pointed out by 
     <lb/>
     the minister this afternoon, shows that the 
     <lb/>
     government, by admitting to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     that we should pay for the land, have ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that the provinces have a right to 
     <lb/>
     the land. Again I say that, although he 
     <lb/>
     was right in his representations, the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment treated them with contemptuous 
     <lb/>
     indifference. Then, after making these pro<lb break="no"/>testations and after being badly treated, 
     <lb/>
     treated with indifference in this way, could 
     <lb/>
     one imagine that there was no irony conceal<lb break="no"/>ed in his remarks when he said in this 
     <lb/>
     House that there was no pique when he re<lb break="no"/>signed after this Bill was brought down 
     <lb/>
     two days before his arrival? We have 
     <lb/>
     heard many details of the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     exploits in the west; many rumours have 
     <lb/>
     drifted down to us during the past ten 
     <lb/>
     years, but I venture to say that not one of 
     <lb/>
     them will be received with less credulity 
     <lb/>
     by the country than the statement he 
     <lb/>
     made this afternoon as to the causes 
     <lb/>
     of his resignation. Just think for a 
     <lb/>
     moment the position that he put his 
     <lb/>
     colleagues in. Had the ex-minister come 
     <lb/>
     out flatly, and bravely said: ' I resign 
     <lb/>
     because I refuse to occupy a seat in a cabi<lb break="no"/>net with men who do not understand busi<lb break="no"/>ness,' then we would have understood and 
     <lb/>
     the country would have understood. But 
     <lb/>
     when we see the pitiable spectacle of minis<lb break="no"/>ters bringing down such a Bill, standing up 
     <lb/>
     and advocating it in spite of such tremend<lb break="no"/>ous objections to it as those which the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     minister pointed out, and the existence of 
     <lb/>
     which they admitted by changing the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     what are we to think of the capacity of a 
     <lb/>
     cabinet that would plunge the country into 
     <lb/>
     all the excitement and turmoil of the past 
     <lb/>
     few weeks on a measure to which they have 
     <lb/>
     given so little attention as they have given 
     <lb/>
     to this ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman to-day touched on 
     <lb/>
     many subjects. There is one subject on 
     <lb/>
     which I did not intend to speak, but I shall 
     <lb/>
     refer to it in consequence of the remarks 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. the ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton), coupled with what was said a 
     <lb/>
     night or two ago by the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     also by the Minister of Customs (Mr. Pater<lb break="no"/>son) last night. When the premier was 
     <lb/>
     speaking the other day he pointed out, with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the agitation which convulsed 
     <lb/>
     this country in 1896, that the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party had undoubtedly misunderstood their 
     <lb/>
     position, that at that time Manitoba stood 
     <lb/>
     in the same position as Nova Scotia or New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick. and that the Conservative party, 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     

     in endeavouring to pass the Remedial Bill 
     <lb/>
     dealing with Manitoba which stood on the 
     <lb/>
     same footing as Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, had entirely misconceived the 
     <lb/>
     position. The right hon. gentleman pointed 
     <lb/>
     out that the Privy Council held that there 
     <lb/>
     were no separate schools in Manitoba, prior 
     <lb/>
     to the union, and therefore no rights of 
     <lb/>
     Catholics in that province. Therefore, the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman objected to the exer<lb break="no"/>cise in this House of the powers of remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation. I refer to this, because his col<lb break="no"/>league last night repeated the same state<lb break="no"/>ment. and I tell the right hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     and I tell this House, I tell the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority in Quebec and the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority in Ontario, I tell the minorities in 
     <lb/>
     every province in this Dominion, that the 
     <lb/>
     remedial clause of section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act has been practically 
     <lb/>
     blotted from the statute by the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman and those who supported him at 
     <lb/>
     that time. The Prime Minister, the other 
     <lb/>
     evening. gave a very interesting and very 
     <lb/>
     accurate account of the circumstances under 
     <lb/>
     which the educational clauses of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act were framed. I entirely 
     <lb/>
     agree with every word he uttered on that 
     <lb/>
     point, but let me add one or two words to 
     <lb/>
     what he said. It is perfectly true that when 
     <lb/>
     confederation was about to be formed it 
     <lb/>
     was agreed between the politicians of Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada that two Bills should be 
     <lb/>
     introduced to this House. one giving educa<lb break="no"/>tional privileges to the Catholic minority in 
     <lb/>
     Upper Canada, the other giving educational 
     <lb/>
     privileges to the Protestant minority in 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canada. These Bills were introduced 
     <lb/>
     but for reasons which we need not now dis<lb break="no"/>cuss. they were uot passed, and those Bills. 
     <lb/>
     not having been passed. and confederation 
     <lb/>
     being about to be effected. the whole scheme 
     <lb/>
     would have fallen through. because the 
     <lb/>
     Protestants of the province of Quebec re<lb break="no"/>fused to enter confederation until their 
     <lb/>
     educational rights were secured. Then Sir 
     <lb/>
     George Etienne Cartier and Sir Hector Lan<lb break="no"/>gevin. speaking for the Roman Catholics. 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, said : If the Protestants of Que<lb break="no"/>bec will consent to going into <choice><sic>oconfedera<lb break="no"/>tion</sic><corr>confederation</corr></choice> without this legislation. we pledge our 
     <lb/>
     honour that at the first session of the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature of the province of Quebec. after 
     <lb/>
     confederation has been formed. we will see 
     <lb/>
     that the rights you would have secured by 
     <lb/>
     the Bill of last session. had it passed. are 
     <lb/>
     conferred on you by a statute of the local 
     <lb/>
     legislature. Sir Alexander Gait replied: 
     <lb/>
     I am perfectly satisfied to take the word of 
     <lb/>
     you gentlemen and believe that you will 
     <lb/>
     adhere to it. but times are fleeting. lives are 
     <lb/>
     uncertain and a day may come when others 
     <lb/>
     will control the legislation of Quebec. and 
     <lb/>
     in that case what the local legislature 
     <lb/>
     gave it can take away. and the minority 
     <lb/>
     may be deprived of the privileges granted 
     <lb/>
     to them. Then it was that Galt. as the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman said. drew with his 
     <lb/>
     own hand his famous clause. that if 
     <lb/>
     after confederation any right given to 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="3125" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3125.jpg"/>

     a minority by a legislature after con<lb break="no"/>federation was taken away, the minority 
     <lb/>
     had a right of appeal to Ottawa in order 
     <lb/>
     to secure their just rights. On those terms, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, the Protestants of Quebec and the Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics of Ontario came into con<lb break="no"/>federation. My hon. friend (Mr. Sifton) 
     <lb/>
     seems to be oblivious of the terms on which 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba came into confederation. It came 
     <lb/>
     in under very peculiar circumstances. The 
     <lb/>
     people of Manitoba treated with the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion and made a compact. The 
     <lb/>
     Protestants and Roman Catholics in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba alike wished to have a provision for 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. We all know the history 
     <lb/>
     of these things ; we know that it was un<lb break="no"/>certain whether the Roman Catholics or 
     <lb/>
     the Protestants would be in the majority in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and it being wholly uncertain 
     <lb/>
     whether there would be an invasion of Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics from Quebec that would 
     <lb/>
     make Manitoba a Catholic province, or an 
     <lb/>
     invasion of Protestants from England and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario which would make it a Protestant 
     <lb/>
     province, the Roman Catholics and Protest<lb break="no"/>ants combined in asking the legislature to 
     <lb/>
     make such provisions that the minority would 
     <lb/>
     have separate schools. And so it was that 
     <lb/>
     the Act was passed, an Act not worth very 
     <lb/>
     much on its face, but being a compact be<lb break="no"/>tween the people of Manitoba and this Do<lb break="no"/>minion, the Act passed by this House was 
     <lb/>
     validated by the imperial parliament, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore it is a good law to-day. What is 
     <lb/>
     the position of the people of Manitoba ? 
     <lb/>
     They came in under an express bargain 
     <lb/>
     which provided for separate schools. They 
     <lb/>
     have, under section 93, the express right of 
     <lb/>
     appeal to this parliament at Ottawa in case 
     <lb/>
     they should be deprived of any right after 
     <lb/>
     they had come into confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, Sir, when they came into confed<lb break="no"/>eration they were, as everybody supposed, 
     <lb/>
     given their separate schools. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Brandon (Mr. Sifton) this after<lb break="no"/>noon attacked gentlemen on this side, be<lb break="no"/>cause, he said, we wished to restore these 
     <lb/>
     inefficient schools. But he must remember 
     <lb/>
     that one of the conditions we insisted on 
     <lb/>
     was that the old inefficiency should be done 
     <lb/>
     away with ; and Roman Catholics were will<lb break="no"/>ing to agree that the schools should be 
     <lb/>
     made efficient. All that we on this side 
     <lb/>
     wished to do was, as loyal Canadians to 
     <lb/>
     stand by our word and keep the honour of 
     <lb/>
     Canada unsullied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The appeal came to Ottawa. As the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister said, the highest court in 
     <lb/>
     the realm, the Privy Council decided that 
     <lb/>
     it was intended to give separate schools to 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and that this legislation was 
     <lb/>
     strong enough to give them had it been 
     <lb/>
     properly based. But, as a matter of fact, 
     <lb/>
     owing to the circumstance that the schools 
     <lb/>
     were not there under the law or in practice 
     <lb/>
     before Manitoba enterd confederation, they 
     <lb/>
     had failed, and they were not entitled un<lb break="no"/>der the law, to the separate schools. The 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
          

     Roman Catholics, having appealed to the 
     <lb/>
     courts, like good subjects bowed to the de<lb break="no"/>cision, but they came to us for a law to 
     <lb/>
     remedy their grievance. And the reason 
     <lb/>
     why I say the right hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     wiped that clause out of the statute-book 
     <lb/>
     and deprived minorities throughout the Do<lb break="no"/>minion of the protection they had, is that 
     <lb/>
     no one can conceive of any circumstances 
     <lb/>
     under which any province could come to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa with a stronger case than that 
     <lb/>
     with which Manitoba came here.' Every 
     <lb/>
     one knew that separate schools were meant 
     <lb/>
     to be given, that the attempt was made to 
     <lb/>
     then give it, and that it was believed that 
     <lb/>
     that attempt was effective. Every one knew 
     <lb/>
     that Manitoba itself understood that the 
     <lb/>
     separate schools were established. And, 
     <lb/>
     under these circumstances, the strongest 
     <lb/>
     that could arise, the minority in Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     came asking us not to coerce the province, 
     <lb/>
     but to give the minority the rights which, 
     <lb/>
     it was intended to give them. And when 
     <lb/>
     the government of the day, though anxious 
     <lb/>
     to live up to the spirit of confederation and 
     <lb/>
     protect minorities , they were prevented from 
     <lb/>
     doing so by the right hon. Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). If the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Quebec should repeal every law 
     <lb/>
     that has been made to assist the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority since confederation—and many of 
     <lb/>
     them have been passed—if the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature of Ontario should repeal the laws 
     <lb/>
     under which the separate schools of that 
     <lb/>
     province have been maintained, they have 
     <lb/>
     the legal power to do it. It is beyond 
     <lb/>
     question that to-day every single privilege 
     <lb/>
     in regard to their schools that the Protes<lb break="no"/>tants of Quebec and the Catholics of On<lb break="no"/>tario enjoy, they owe to generosity and 
     <lb/>
     forbearance of the majority. All the pro<lb break="no"/>visions for the protection of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools under the constitution are practi<lb break="no"/>cally worthless because they are unwork<lb break="no"/>able. Therefore, I say the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) should speak 
     <lb/>
     with some reticence on the educational 
     <lb/>
     question in view of the lamentable exper<lb break="no"/>ience of the minorities of this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     solely through the attitude taken by the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman himself. I would not 
     <lb/>
     have dealt with this subject of Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     had it not been referred to by the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister in presenting the Bill, and last 
     <lb/>
     evening by the Minister of Customs (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Paterson) and this afternoon by the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) their 
     <lb/>
     utterances on the subject making it neces<lb break="no"/>sary to say a few words to show in what 
     <lb/>
     way they have misconceived the position 
     <lb/>
     of the Conservative party at that time. If 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman has misconceived 
     <lb/>
     the attitude of his opponents at the time 
     <lb/>
     when he came into power we may excuse 
     <lb/>
     him if he has forgotten some things which 
     <lb/>
     he might well have remembered when he 
     <lb/>
     brought this Bill down for the consideration

            <p>Now, Sir, it is not, to put it mildly, a lit<lb break="no"/>tle disappointing to hon. gentlemen on this<lb/>side, when called upon to discuss a measure<lb/>which is evoking such a feeling as this<lb/>Bill is, that the right hon. Prime Minister<lb/>in introducing it should tell us that it is<lb/>a matter of such little importance that it<lb/>is hardly worth while wasting time over it;<lb/>—while, a few days later, the Minister of<lb/>Finance—who might have been justified in<lb/>using the language of his leader, and saying<lb/>the Bill was of no moment, because his<lb/>leader thought the Bill of so little impor<lb break="no"/>tance as to be not worth while submitting<lb/>to the consideration of the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance and the Minister of the Interior, the<lb/>two experts whose opinion would be re<lb break="no"/>quired—frankly admits that it is the most<lb/>important measure that we have had in<lb/>many a day. I go further than the hon.<lb/>gentleman and say , in all sincerity , that<lb/>not only is it the most important measure<lb/>before parliament to-day, but I believe that <lb/>it is the most important measure that has <lb/>ever been before this House, the most im<lb break="no"/>portant measure—and I say it with a due<lb/>consciousness of that seriousness of my<lb/>words —that will be brought before any Eng<lb break="no"/>lish speaking assembly for many a day to<lb/>come. Let me explain why I say that.<lb/>A great deal has been said by some speak<lb break="no"/>ers in the way that I sincerely regret. I<lb/>trust I shall be able to express myself on<lb/>these vexed questions without using a sin<lb break="no"/>gle word that will be offensive to any one.<lb/>I do not see why one cannot express his<lb/>views conscientiously and frankly without<lb/>being offensive. And I must pay the ex-<lb break="yes"/>Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) the<lb/>compliment of saying that there was no<lb break="no"/>thing said by him this afternoon that could<lb/>be offensive to any one on either side of<lb/>
     

            <cb/>
          

     the House. I hope to follow the good ex<lb break="no"/>ample that the hon. gentleman has set.<lb/>But, when we are dealing with half a mil<lb break="no"/>lion square miles of territory of our North<lb break="no"/>west, we must not forget that time is fleet<lb break="no"/>ing, that history moves on, and that nowa<lb break="no"/>days great changes take place within a<lb/>few years. We have often been referred to<lb/>the year 1875 in this debate, the year when<lb/>the law was passed for regulation of the<lb/>Northwest, when the school law was placed<lb/>upon the statute-book. Who would have<lb/>expected at that time that people to-day<lb/>would be spending time in discussing the<lb/>school regulations for a country in which,<lb/>I understand, there were in 1875, only about<lb/>500 people. We know that that part of <lb/>the country was then regarded as part a part<lb/>that would not attain anything like the im<lb break="no"/>portance it has attained to-day. Within a<lb/>quarter of a century, since the building of<lb/>the Canadian Pacific Railway, wonderful<lb/>changes have come over that part of our<lb/>country. Immigration is pouring in and <lb/>developement is rapidly progressing. Not<lb/>only are the eyes of the old provinces fixed<lb/>on the Northwest, but the eyes of the em<lb break="no"/>pire are upon that country as the future<lb/>granary of the empire. More than that,<lb/>Sir, we know that the eyes of the whole<lb/>world are turned to the Northwest as be<lb break="no"/>ing the most attrative place for immigra<lb break="no"/>tion for those leaving the countries of the<lb/>old world, which are not so free as ours,<lb/>and wishing to find new homes. It seems<lb/>that we are approaching this subject in a<lb/>parish spirit if we cannot see more in it<lb/>that a few details concerning the regulation<lb/>of a few schools. The ex-Minister of the<lb/>Interior has quoted some eminent Roman<lb/>Catholic prelate as saying that these schools<lb/>differed nothing from public schools except<lb/>in the name. If there is so little to dis<lb break="no"/>tinguish them, if they are practically one<lb/>and the same thing, why should the right<lb/>hon. gentleman have thrown this firebrand<lb/>into the political arena ? The right hon.<lb/>gentleman discussed the Bill, with a sub<lb break="no"/>committee consisting of the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) whose ability as a<lb/>lawyer we are all proud of in this House ;<lb/>the Secretary of State and the Postmaster<lb/>General (Sir William Mulock). If in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing it with these gentlemen—which one<lb/>representing the Northwest I do not know ,<lb/>which one representing the adverse view<lb/>on education to that held by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister himself I do not know—none of them<lb/>was willing to discuss it from the stand<lb break="no"/>point of the majority of the Northwest,<lb/>why could not the Prime Minister have<lb/>waited until his Minister of the Interior had<lb/>returned ? Why could not the right hon.<lb/>gentleman have waited till his Minister of<lb/>Finance returned ? Why could he not have<lb/>waited an hour or two until Mr. Haultain<lb/>could have been found ? Why could not the<lb/>right hon. gentleman have done something<lb/>

     to avoid the introduction of this unfortun<lb break="no"/>ate question into the political arena ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, the position unfortunately is 
     <lb/>
     this, that, as I said a few moments ago, 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman has by his own 
     <lb/>
     act practically blotted out clause 3 from sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore it is that at such a time as 
     <lb/>
     this we should endeavour to legislate, not 
     <lb/>
     in the spirit suggested by the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman the other evening, as represent<lb break="no"/>ing individual constituencies, but legislate 
     <lb/>as representatives of the people of Canada. 
     <lb/>When the right hon. gentleman was speak<lb break="no"/>ing he pointed out that it would be impos<lb break="no"/>sible to do certain things, for instance, to 
     <lb/>extend the boundaries of Manitoba, be<lb break="no"/>cause the representatives of the Northwest 
     <lb/>objected to that. Now, I object for my 
     <lb/>part to such an interpretation of our duties 
     <lb/>as that. I submit that we shall certainly 
     <lb/>come to grief if we cannot in the first in<lb break="no"/>stance, understand our own duties and res<lb break="no"/>ponsibilities here. We are here as represent<lb break="no"/>atives, not primarily of our individual con<lb break="no"/>stituencies ; every man sitting in this 
     <lb/>House is the representative of all the people 
     <lb/>of Canada, and I claim to represent the 
     <lb/>people of the Northwest just as much as 
     <lb/>any gentleman coming from the provinces 
     <lb/>of Alberta and Saskatchewan. And when 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman is prepared to adopt 
     <lb/>the views of seven gentlemen from those 
     <lb/>Territories, gentlemen elected on different 
     <lb/>lines altogether, without regard to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion in deciding the future of that great 
     <lb/>country which at no distant day must hold 
     <lb/>the balance of power in this Dominion, I 
     <lb/>can only say on that point emphatically, 
     <lb/>that I differ from him. If we could induce 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman, assisted perhaps 
     <lb/>by the ex-Minister of the Interior—because 
     <lb/>we would be delighted to have his assist<lb break="no"/>ance, though we would want to have it be<lb break="no"/>fore we got very far away, because he might 
     <lb/>change his mind before we met again—if 
     <lb/>we could possibly induce the premier to be 
     <lb/>guided in some way by considerations of the 
     <lb/>trifling character of the change suggested 
     <lb/>in the schools as pointed out, though a 
     <lb/>tremendous change as some people think, 
     <lb/>surely something might be done to avoid 
     <lb/>this difficulty. Something has been said 
     <lb/>about the law of 1875 being a law under 
     <lb/>which the people were induced to go into 
     <lb/>the Northwest, and that they have a right 
     <lb/>to believe that it will be maintained. Now 
     <lb/>I would like to ask the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>Interior how many of his Doukhobors or 
     <lb/>Galicians could he name to-day who went 
     <lb/>to the Northwest because they had read the 
     <lb/>parliamentary debate of 1875, and were sat<lb break="no"/>isfied that their school rights would be 
     <lb/>maintained ? If by any possibility any 
     <lb/>weight were to be attached to that argu<lb break="no"/>ment—which I do not think the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man himself really considered as an argu<lb break="no"/>ment, I myself took it merely as one of his 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
          

     pleasantries—if there were any weight to 
     <lb/>
     be attached to that argument, then at least 
     <lb/>
     the same weight must be attached to the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of men of the standing of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     David Mills, and Sir Louis Davies, and Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Thompson, who all said that when par<lb break="no"/>liament came to form the provinces it would 
     <lb/>
     be perfectly free to do as it saw fit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, before discussing the subject itself, 
     <lb/>
     let me consider one or two remarks of the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior. When the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman was speaking of the causes that 
     <lb/>
     led him to withdraw from the government, 
     <lb/>
     he pointed out that the original clause as 
     <lb/>
     introduced by the government had a certain 
     <lb/>
     meaning, and that subsequently it was modi<lb break="no"/>fied so that he could accept it. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman pointed out that in the first in<lb break="no"/>stance the difference between what he want<lb break="no"/>ed and what he got was so great that he 
     <lb/>
     was compelled to lay down the seals of 
     <lb/>
     office, to abandon all the patronage and 
     <lb/>
     emoluments of office, and to sink down to the 
     <lb/>
     level of an ordinary member, and all for 
     <lb/>
     conscience. But what was it the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man had to salve his conscience for all these 
     <lb/>
     serious losses ? I think if I remember 
     <lb/>
     his language correctly he said there was a 
     <lb/>
     possibility that if a university were en<lb break="no"/>dowed, there might be a discussion as to 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the respective parties as to a 
     <lb/>
     share in the money. Then the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said that under the original clause 
     <lb/>
     as introduced, all the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875 were also enacted. Now if the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman will look at the 1875 Act, 
     <lb/>
     he will find there is nothing in that Act 
     <lb/>
     whatever that provides machinery by which 
     <lb/>
     these schools shall be carried on. The 1875 
     <lb/>
     Act says in effect that Protestant and Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics, respectively, whenever in 
     <lb/>
     a minority, are to be allowed to have sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools, are to be allowed to appropriate 
     <lb/>
     their own taxation to the support of their 
     <lb/>
     schools, and are not to be compelled to sup<lb break="no"/>port any other schools. That is all there 
     <lb/>
     was in the Act of 1875. There was not a 
     <lb/>
     word in it about giving the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy charge of the schools, there was 
     <lb/>
     not a word in it about this, that or the other 
     <lb/>
     regulation, or ordinance, but the local au<lb break="no"/>thorities were to be allowed to do as they 
     <lb/>
     saw fit, except that they must not inter<lb break="no"/>fere with the rights of minorities to have 
     <lb/>
     their own separate schools, be they Protes<lb break="no"/>tant or Roman Catholic, and to apply their 
     <lb/>
     own taxation for their maintenance. Sub<lb break="no"/>sequently the hon. gentleman pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that certain changes were made by the local 
     <lb/>
     authorities. Now would the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     pretend to say that anybody whose opin<lb break="no"/>ion was worth considering ever thought 
     <lb/>
     that the local authorities which had passed 
     <lb/>
     those ordinances had not the right to repeal 
     <lb/>
     them ? They passed them, they existed for 
     <lb/>
     a time, and they repealed them, and that 
     <lb/>
     is all there was about it. And if the Act 
     <lb/>
     as first introduced had gone into effect, the 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="3131" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3131.jpg"/>
         
<fw type="num">3131</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3132</fw>


     people of the Northwest would have had 
     <lb/>
     just such schools as they will have to-day, 
     <lb/>
     with all the rights and privileges attaching 
     <lb/>
     to those schools as they are to-day. Will 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman say that is not the case 
     <lb/>
     under the present Act ? Would he pretend 
     <lb/>
     to say that under the Act now before the 
     <lb/>
     House minorities in the Northwest have 
     <lb/>
     not exactly the same rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     they would have had under the original 
     <lb/>
     clause, except that he suggests that they 
     <lb/>
     might in some occult way be put back to 
     <lb/>
     the day of 1875 when the hierarchy were 
     <lb/>
     controlling the schools ? Then the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman's reference to the university was 
     <lb/>
     rather an amusing one. I am inclined to 
     <lb/>
     think that if the hon. gentleman will read 
     <lb/>
     the clauses carefully side by side he will 
     <lb/>
     find that there is no ground whatever for the 
     <lb/>
     objection he raises. Let me read the origin<lb break="no"/>al clause as it appeared when the Bill was 
     <lb/>
     first introduced : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In the appropriation of public moneys by 
     <lb/>
     the legislature in aid of education, and in the 
     <lb/>
     distribution of any moneys paid to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the said province arising from the 
     <lb/>
     school fund established by the Dominion Lands 
     <lb/>

     arising from the sale of lands.

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     There shall be no discrimination between the

     such moneys shall be applied to the support

            <p>
     That is to say, that every dollar applied 
     <lb/>
     for schools is to be divided equitably between 
     <lb/>
     public and separate schools. But what is 
     <lb/>
     there in that clause to suggest that if the 
     <lb/>
     legislature choose to endow a university, 
     <lb/>
     either the majority or the minority will be 
     <lb/>
     discriminated against because in 1910, per<lb break="no"/>haps, the legislature might give a sum to 
     <lb/>
     endow a university ? The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     had to go very far afield to find such an 
     <lb/>
     argument as that to justify his course. When 
     <lb/>
     we come to simmer it down—if I am omit<lb break="no"/>ting any point I am willing to be corrected— 
     <lb/>
     when we come to simmer it down he who, 
     <lb/>
     for two or three weeks, has stood on the 
     <lb/>
     highest pedestal in the Dominion of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     worshipped as a martyr from one end of 
     <lb/>
     the country to the other, whose praises could 
     <lb/>
     not be drowned even by the rolling waves 
     <lb/>
     of the Labrador coast, and which were waft<lb break="no"/>ed even to the sunny slopes of the west, 
     <lb/>
     that hon. gentleman who has posed for two 
     <lb/>
     or three weeks as a conscientious martyr 
     <lb/>
     who would lose anything rather than prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, who was prepared to suffer anything 
     <lb/>
     except a wound to his conscienne—that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman comes down to-day and kisses 
     <lb/>
     the hand that smote him, and the only pos<lb break="no"/>sible excuse that he can give for his ingrati<lb break="no"/>tude, for his disloyalty to his chief, is 
     <lb/>
     that he thought that under this second 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
          

     clause, if passed, there might possibly come 
     <lb/>
     a day when they would endow a university, 
     <lb/>
     and there might be a dispute between the 
     <lb/>
     majority and the minority as to the distri<lb break="no"/>bution of their funds for that university. 
     <lb/>
     while under the amended clause there could 
     <lb/>
     be no trouble. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Surely, if ever there was a cause to which 
     <lb/>
     the old adage parturiunt montes, nascitur 
     <lb/>
     mus—the mountain has laboured and 
     <lb/>
     brought forth a mouse—applies, it is this 
     <lb/>
     one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I think I will be justified in saying that 
     <lb/>
     when a measure of the importance of this 
     <lb/>
     is brought before this House the burden 
     <lb/>
     rests entirely on those who proposed it, of 
     <lb/>
     showing parliament that the measure of such 
     <lb/>
     a character that it is our duty to pass it. 
     <lb/>
     It is not part of the duty of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     to show that the measure is not a proper 
     <lb/>
     one. The burden surely rests on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day, bringing down such an 
     <lb/>
     important measure, to show that it is one 
     <lb/>
     that should really be passed by this House. 
     <lb/>
     The right hon. leader of the government in 
     <lb/>
     introducing the Bill—and I am sorry he is 
     <lb/>
     not here at the present moment—laid great 
     <lb/>
     stress—page 1517 of ' Hansard '—on the fact 
     <lb/>
     that we, the people of Canada, occupied a 
     <lb/>
     peculiar position, because we have bought 
     <lb/>
     and owned these Northwest lands. He de<lb break="no"/>clared that we had bought these lands, that 
     <lb/>
     we owned them and that we own them now 
     <lb/>
     and therefore surely the old saying should 
     <lb/>
     hold good: Can a man not do as he likes with 
     <lb/>
     his own ? I am sorry he is not here, but I 
     <lb/>
     see the hon. Minister of Justice in his 
     <lb/>
     place, and. I would like to ask the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice, on behalf of his chief, 
     <lb/>
     to tell me from whom Canada bought these 
     <lb/>
     lands, when she bought them and how Can<lb break="no"/>ada got her title to those lands ? When the 
     <lb/>
     statement is made, from which inferences 
     <lb/>
     are drawn, that we own these lands, I say 
     <lb/>
     that the right hon. gentleman should be pre<lb break="no"/>pared with some proof to substantiate that 
     <lb/>
     statement. I am quite prepared to admit 
     <lb/>
     that an hon. gentleman sitting behind him 
     <lb/>
     having heard him make the statement 
     <lb/>
     that we did own these lands might give 
     <lb/>
     his support to the measure which he might 
     <lb/>
     not give if he knew we did not own these 
     <lb/>
     lands and that we never owned them. If 
     <lb/>
     there were any doubt about the question 
     <lb/>
     one would only have to look at the state 
     <lb/>
     papers at the time the Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany ceded its rights to the Crown. A com<lb break="no"/>mittee was appointed, composed of Sir 
     <lb/>George Cartier and Mr. McDougall ; they 
     <lb/>looked thoroughly into the subject and they 
     <lb/>made a report. Their report was to the 
     <lb/>effect that the Hudson Bay Company had 
     <lb/>no title whatever to these lands, that 
     <lb/>they never did have a title and they gave an 
     <lb/>abundance of reasons why the Hudson 
     <lb/>Bay Company never could have had a title. 
     <lb/>Without occupying the time of the House 
     <lb/>by going into this simple question I might 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="3133" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3133.jpg"/>

     merely in a few words illustrate the point 
     <lb/>
     by saying that at the time the Hudson's 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company obtained its grant from 
     <lb/>
     Charles II the grant did not profess to give 
     <lb/>
     the lands in the Northwest Territories. In 
     <lb/>
     the next place if the Crown did profess to 
     <lb/>
     cede to the Hudson Bay Company the lands 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories, Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     did not own these lands at that time and 
     <lb/>
     did not acquire them from France for many 
     <lb/>
     years afterwards. It is certain that if Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain did not own them Great Britain 
     <lb/>
     could not give them and did not give them 
     <lb/>
     to the Hudson Bay Company. All that 
     <lb/>
     Great Britain did was to grant certain rights 
     <lb/>
     to the Hudson Bay Company in regard to 
     <lb/>
     fishing, trade and commerce. The Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company never owned these lands in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories and never profess<lb break="no"/>ed to sell them to the Dominion of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     In Vol. 11, No. 5, sessional papers, 1869, 
     <lb/>
     paper 25, April 23, after giving all the rea<lb break="no"/>sons why the Hudson Bay Company had 
     <lb/>
     never acquired any title to the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, Sir George Cartier and Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Dougall concluded as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The country which in view of these facts 
     <lb/>
     must be excluded from the operation of the

     <lb/>
     with, they say : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     We are thus led to the same conclusion as in 
     <lb/>
     the case of the territory claimed, but not owned 
     <lb/>
     by the company, viz., that what they propose 
     <lb/>
     to sell has no pecuniary or commercial value. 
     <lb/>
     They are there, however, by at least a show of 
     <lb/>
     right. Being there they obstruct the progress 
     <lb/>
     of imperial and colonial policy and put in 
     <lb/>
     jeopardy the sovereign rights of the crown over 
     <lb/>
     one-third (and as some think even a larger por<lb break="no"/>tion) of the North American continent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     What is it worth to have this obstruction 
     <lb/>
     quietly removed ? This is, perhaps the true 
     <lb/>
     question, but the answer we submit, belongs 
     <lb/>
     rather to Her Majesty's government which has 
     <lb/>
     the power, in the case of resistance, to remove 
     <lb/>
     the evil by summary process, than to those 
     <lb/>
     who are little more than spectators of the 
     <lb/>
     negotiation.

     In the first place the committee do not admit 
     <lb/>
     that the company have a legal title to that por<lb break="no"/>tion of the Northwestern territory which is fit 
     <lb/>
     for cultivation and settlement. This fertile 
     <lb/>
     tract is a belt of land stretching along the 
     <lb/>
     northern frontier of the United States to the 
     <lb/>
     base of the Rocky Mountains, and Canada has 
     <lb/>
     always disputed the title of the company to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     So we have the unquestionable fact that 
     <lb/>
     Canada always disputed with the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company that they had any title to 
     <lb/>
     these lands, and we have the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     Hudson Bay Company ceded all their rights 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     to the Crown. But, my right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     must say if the rights are in the Crown in 
     <lb/>
     regard to these lands then we have a right 
     <lb/>
     to administer them. There is where we take 
     <lb/>
     issue with the right hon. gentleman. We 
     <lb/>
     take issue with him when he says the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion is supreme. The Dominion is supreme 
     <lb/>
     in its sphere, but the provinces are just as 
     <lb/>
     supreme within their spheres. In a pro<lb break="no"/>vince the Crown is represented by the pro<lb break="no"/>vince just the same as in the Dominion the 
     <lb/>
     Crown is represented by the Dominion. The 
     <lb/>
     contention we put forward is that by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act as soon 
     <lb/>
     as the provinces come into existence the 
     <lb/>
     Crown, as to the land within them, will be 
     <lb/>
     represented by the provinces themselves 
     <lb/>
     and that while the Dominion may have the 
     <lb/>
     power to make certain laws for the peace, 
     <lb/>
     order and good government of these provin<lb break="no"/>ces the title to the land is in the Crown and 
     <lb/>
     the Crown is represented in the provinces 
     <lb/>
     by the provincial authorities. We had that 
     <lb/>
     matter before the House a short time ago. 
     <lb/>
     The Attorney General of British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     brought action against the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion. We all remember that 
     <lb/>
     when the Canadian Pacific Railway was 
     <lb/>
     built a grant was made of an area 20 miles 
     <lb/>
     on each side of the road out of the British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia lands. The province of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia received $100,000 a year from the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion in consideration of the grant, but 
     <lb/>
     after this land was granted gold was dis<lb break="no"/>covered and the question arose : To whom 
     <lb/>
     does this gold belong ? The Dominion 
     <lb/>
     said : We have the grant of land ; it is 
     <lb/>
     our gold. The province gave us the land 
     <lb/>
     and now we have the land and the minerals 
     <lb/>
     on it. But, the Privy Council said no, that 
     <lb/>
     the province represented the Crown and 
     <lb/>
     that the Crown could not part with its 
     <lb/>
     minerals unless it expressly said that it 
     <lb/>
     parted with its minerals ; the minerals re<lb break="no"/>main in the Crown, the Crown is represented 
     <lb/>
     by the province and the province is entitled 
     <lb/>
     to them. In the same way we are asked to 
     <lb/>
     believe that these lands belong to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. The right hon. leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment says that the Dominion own these 
     <lb/>
     lands, whereas we say she never bought 
     <lb/>
     them, she never owned them and the pro<lb break="no"/>vince is the proper authority to administer 
     <lb/>
     them.

<p> On section 12, <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Why do you want the <lb/>
Railway Act to apply to this private corpor<lb break="no"/>ation ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAMP3">Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>. They will build pulp <lb/>
mills, flour mills and saw mills, and possibly <lb/>
some sort of a railway will be required in <lb/>

is the objection ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The objection is that you <lb/>
are making a Railway Act apply to a private <lb/>
concern. It seems to me the only reason it <lb/>
should apply is for the purpose of appro<lb break="no"/>priating property, and I do not think it <lb/>
should apply for that purpose. <lb/>

the education of its youth. There must, of <lb/>

 course, be some reason other than
individual <lb/>
reasons; there must of necessity be some <lb/>
public, national reason, when we find in <lb/>
every land the nation, in self-defence, tak<lb break="no"/>ing charge of this particular item of educa<lb break="no"/>tion, and when we find every civilized na<lb break="no"/>tion agreeing as to the importance that is <lb/>
attached to supplying its youth with the <lb/>
best possible education they can receive. <lb/>
I think, Sir, we may take it for granted <lb/>
that the reason the state desires to control <lb/>
the education of its youth is that intelli<lb break="no"/>gent peoples recognize that the greatest <lb/>
handicap to which youth can be subjected <lb/>
is the want of education. We know perfect<lb break="no"/>ly well in our own country that if two lads <lb/>
start out in life, one handicapped by a lack <lb/>
of education and the other possessed of an <lb/>
education, there is no doubt who will be the <lb/>
successful man and who will be the hewer <lb/>
of wood and drawer of water for the other.<lb/>
The same thing applies as between nations. <lb/>
We all recognize that if one nation looks <lb/>
after the education of its youth, while an<lb break="no"/>other nation neglects to do so, the nation <lb/>
which neglects the education of its youth <lb/>
will be the servant of the other. To-day <lb/>
the nations of the world have taken upon <lb/>
themselves to look after the subject of <lb/>
education for the reason that I have given. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Why is it that in this country education <lb/>
is, by the British North America Act, al<lb break="no"/>lotted to the provinces ? We have the <lb/>
division of a great many powers given under <lb/>
the British North America Act. To the Do<lb break="no"/>minion is allotted the power to
legislate ex<lb break="no"/>clusively on many subjects and to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces is allotted the power to
legislate ex<lb break="no"/>clusively on many other subjects. Is there <lb/>
any reason why, in our own country, this <lb/>
particular subject of education has been <lb/>
allotted to the provinces ? I think there is <lb/>
a well-known reason, and I am going to <lb/>
point out that, although it has frequently <lb/>
been said in this debate that the provinces <lb/>
have not the exclusive right to legislate on <lb/>
that subject as they have touching other <lb/>
matters, practically they have the exclusive <lb/>
right. There is a limitation to their right <lb/>
to legislate upon education. They cannot <lb/>
legislate as freely perhaps as they can legis<lb break="no"/>late on other subjects, but their right is ex<lb break="no"/>clusive. No other power has the right to <lb/>
legislate, except that in certain cases an <lb/>
application can be made to the Dominion, <lb/>
under the remedial clause, which. as was <lb/>
illustrated in the Manitoba school case, has <lb/>
been practically blotted out of the statute- <lb break="yes"/>
book. We ask why it is that in our country <lb/>
the Dominion has no jurisdiction or legisla<lb break="no"/>tive power, except in exceptional cases, in re<lb break="no"/>gard to education and that the power of <lb/>
legislation is given exclusively to the prov<lb break="no"/>inces? We have the answer to that. We know <lb/>
that the great father of confederation, Sir <lb/>
John Macdonald himself, favoured a legisla<lb break="no"/>tive and not a federal union. His idea was to <lb/>
have a great central parliament, as they <lb/>
have it in the mother country, conferring <lb/>
greater powers on the county councils and, <lb/>
to save expense, dispensing with the local <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          
 legislatures. But he was unable to carry <lb/>
out his idea of a legislative union, and the <lb/>
main reason why a legislative union was not <lb/>
carried out by the Dominion of Canada was <lb/>
that the great province of Quebec insisted <lb/>
that the control of education must be left <lb/>
to the provinces. Let me quote a speech <lb/>
in the parliamentary debates on the New <lb/>
Brunswick School Act. Sir John Macdon<lb break="no"/>ald, then premier, spoke as follows: <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> It was known to every one that the
question <lb/>
of education had threatened confederation at its <lb/>
very inception, and a proposition that education <lb/>
should be left to the general legislature of the <lb/>
Dominion would have been enough to secure <lb/>
the repudiation of confederation by the people <lb/>
of Lower Canada, and it was therefore <choice><sic>ex<lb break="no"/>presly</sic><corr>expressly</corr></choice> provided in the Act of union that the <lb/>
question should be entirely left to the different <lb/>
provinces with the provision that whenever <lb/>
there was a separate system in force that sys<lb break="no"/>tem should not be interfered with. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> So we find that to-day what we of the <lb/>
opposition are contending for, that the ex<lb break="no"/>clusive right of legislation touching educa<lb break="no"/>tion shall be left to the newly
created pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, was carried out in accordance with <lb/>
the principle laid down by the province of <lb/>
Quebec, which determined the question <lb/>
whether or not we should have a legislative <lb/>
or a federal government in this country. <lb/>
We now come to these educational clauses <lb/>
that we have before us. We have heard a <lb/>
great deal about the rights of minorities. <lb/>
and I would be very sorry to say a word <lb/>
against the rights of minorities. I have in <lb/>
days gone by in this House stood up for the <lb/>
rights of minorities, even though I knew the <lb/>
penalty I must pay was the loss
of my seat <lb/>
in this House; and I have never since re<lb break="no"/>gretted that, because, although I lost my <lb/>
seat, I had the consciousness of doing what <lb/>
I believed to be right. I have no hesitation <lb/>
in saying that it is incumbent on any majori<lb break="no"/>ty, not merely to be just to the minority. for <lb/>
there is no credit to a majority any more <lb/>
than to a man in being just, but I think <lb/>
it is in honour incumbent on the majority <lb/>
to be generous to the minority in all
matters <lb/>
in which the minority take a deep interest, <lb/>
and there is no matter in which they take <lb/>
a deeper interest than in that of education. <lb/>
Therefore, I say there is no hon. member <lb/>
of this House who would have greater con<lb break="no"/>sideration for the feelings of the minority. <lb/>
to whatever class the minority might be<lb break="no"/>long, than I myself. But while paying all <lb/>
possible respect to the feelings of the minori<lb break="no"/>ty, we would be unworthy of our positions <lb/>
in this House if we entirely shut our eyes <lb/>
to the feelings or rights, or supposed rights, <lb/>
of the majority. because, where there is a <lb/>
minority, there must be a majority. It has <lb/>
been said in this House, and I was very <lb/>
sorry to hear the statement—a statement <lb/>
with which I do not agree, made by no less <lb/>
a personage than my hon. friend the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Finance (Mr. Fielding)—that so grave <lb/>
was this question, so violently exciting to <lb/>
the country, and so bitter were the passions <lb/>
that had been aroused, that if the right <lb/>

 hon. leader of the government were turned
<lb/>
from power, it would be impossible for the <lb/>
hon. leader of the opposition to form
an <lb/>
administration, because no such administra<lb break="no"/>tion could be formed on any other than a <lb/>
Protestant basis. I do not think it was <lb/>
necessary for that hon. gentleman to have <lb/>
said that. I do not think, in the face of <lb/>
what was said by the hon. ex-Minister of <lb/>
the Interior (Mr. Sifton) this afternoon; I <lb/>
do not think. in the face of what was said <lb/>
by the hon. Minister of Finance himself <lb/>
only a few minutes before. that he was <lb/>
justified in so speaking. Let me quote to <lb/>
the House what the hon. gentleman said <lb/>
that evening. At considerable length he <lb/>
recited the condition of afairs
in the, North<lb break="no"/>west Territories ; he recounted the various <lb/>
ordinances, or the result of these ordinances, <lb/>
-minimizing as much as possible their efiect,
<lb/>
to show that after all there was no great <lb/>
question at issue, or, as he himself said, no <lb/>
principle involved in this question, and he <lb/>
went on to say: <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I want the House to consider seriously, I
sub<lb break="no"/>mit the proposition again, that if it be true as <lb/>
I say, and I believe I am correct beyond the <lb/>
power of contradiction, that from the moment <lb/>
that the school Opens in the morning up to <lb/>
half-past three in the afternoon there is no <lb/>
difference between a separate school and a free <lb/>
national school, and if the only point of dif<lb break="no"/>ference between them is that half hour of <lb/>
religious instruction, is there enough in it to <lb/>
quarrel about, and to have public meetings and <lb/>
agitation throughout the length and breadth <lb/>
of this land ? I believe that the great mass of <lb/>
the people to-day who are joining in petitions <lb/>
and holding meetings have not had time to <lb/>
understand this question. I believe that they <lb/>
have an erroneous view as to what the condi<lb break="no"/>tion in the Northwest Territories is and as to <lb/>
what the condition which we propose to per<lb break="no"/>petuate is. When they discover, as they will, <lb/>
in the light of the debate which will take place <lb/>
in this House now and in the next few days, <lb/>
when the people of Canada shall learn that we <lb/>
have in the west to-day a system which is <lb/>
practically a national school system, and that <lb/>
the only point of difference between us is with <lb/>
respect to that small matter of half an hour of <lb/>
religious instruction, I think the great mass of <lb/>
the Protestant people of Canada will say that <lb/>
they regret that there has been any agitation <lb/>
on the subject. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> That, Sir, is the View expressed by my <lb/>
hon. friend the Minister of Finance in the <lb/>
presence of the right hon. leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and not repudiated by him. My <lb/>
hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz<lb break="no"/>patrick), who has had some hand in framing <lb/>
this Bill, spoke in this way of the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clause : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I wanted to make the position of the
people <lb/>
'in the Northwest with respect to educational <lb/>
matters so clear and simple that any man might <lb/>
understand the clause when he read it. I said <lb/>
that nothing should be left to doubt, uncertainty <lb/>
or misconception ; and in so far as I am con<lb break="no"/>cerned, that clause, in the terms in which it is <lb/>
now drafted, was prepared merely for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of giving to the people of the
Northwest

            <cb/>
          
 Territories those things which they now
have <lb/>
and it never was intended to go one inch be<lb break="no"/>yond that. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Now, then, we have the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Finance declaring that the only point in <lb/>
dispute is one half hour's religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion in the schools of the
Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, with the hon. Minister of Justice <lb/>
declaring that in drafting the Bill he had <lb/>
no intention of going one inch—and you <lb/>
could hardly name a smaller distance- <lb/>
farther than to perpetuate that system <lb/>
which the hon. Minister of Finance himself <lb/>
described. I have not had any conference <lb/>
with my hon. friend the member for East <lb/>
Grey (Mr. Sproule), but, if that be the tem<lb break="no"/>per of the government, if the members of <lb/>
the government were honest in stating on <lb/>
the floor of this House what the real differ<lb break="no"/>ence is, I venture to say that my
hon. friend <lb/>
from East Grey will assent at once. and <lb/>
every hon. member on this side of the House <lb/>
will assent joyfully to such a proposition. <lb/>
if the only point is whether or not instruc<lb break="no"/>tions shall be given for one half hour. If so, <lb/>
we say by all means give the children religi<lb break="no"/>ous instruction for half an hour by whatever <lb/>
clergyman of whatever church is desired. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Now that we find this statement made, it <lb/>
is only fair-speaking as I do
for the ma<lb break="no"/>jority—it is only fair to consider that the <lb/>
majority must be influenced by hearing <lb/>
such statements made. But in looking <lb/>
about and seeing the facts that are patent <lb/>
to every one, let us recall some of these <lb/>
facts. It will not be denied that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, although appealed to again and <lb/>
again from the Northwest Territories <lb/>
through the proper channels, to give auto<lb break="no"/>nomy to the Northwest Territories refused <lb/>
again and again, sometimes stating as a <lb/>
reason even for not considering the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, the absence of the ex-Minister of the <lb/>
Interior (Mr. Sifton) from
Ottawa. It will <lb/>
not be denied that the government suddenly <lb/>
decided to give provincial autonomy to the <lb/>
Northwest Territories just at the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of a political campaign. It will not <lb/>
be denied that in the interest of fair play <lb/>
and justice, if the government intended of<lb break="no"/>fering such an important proposition to the <lb/>
Northwest Territories the scheme itself <lb/>
should have been laid before the people of <lb/>
the Northwest Territories so that in pro<lb break="no"/>nouncing a verdict in the last election an <lb/>
opportunity would have been given them <lb/>
to pronounce upon that important matter. <lb/>
No such opportunity was given. It will <lb/>
not be denied that the government having <lb/>
thus suddenly promised in the heat of an <lb/>
election to give autonomy to the Northwest <lb/>
Territories, when the duly accredited repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the Northwest Territories came <lb/>
to Ottawa, negotiations were held which ex<lb break="no"/>tended over a considerable period of time <lb/>
and which covered many subjects, but at <lb/>
these negotiations the question of educa<lb break="no"/>tion was never discussed and only suggest<lb break="no"/>ed once. Can it be a surprise to any one <lb/>
          

            <pb n="3141" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3141.jpg"/>

if some persons in the country are
inclined <lb/>
to think that there must have been a rea<lb break="no"/>son for such treatment of the duly accre<lb break="no"/>dited representatives of the Northwest in <lb/>
connection with this important matter. The <lb/>
Minister of Finance is the gentleman who <lb/>
on the part of the government would be <lb/>
held responsible for the financial terms <lb/>
which however lightly they may be spoken <lb/>
of in this House and however slightly they <lb/>
may be discussed by members who may not <lb/>
feel competent to discuss such an involved <lb/>
and intricate question, are of immense im<lb break="no"/>portance to this country in view of the fact <lb/>
that some millions of dollars a year are <lb/>
to be paid out to each of these provinces. <lb/>
Yet, it cannot be denied that the one min<lb break="no"/>ister in the government who should have <lb/>
been consulted on the financial terms was <lb/>
not even in the city of Ottawa when the <lb/>
Bill was brought down, for it
was brought <lb/>
down two days I think before the date on <lb/>
which it was known the Minister of Finance <lb/>
would arrive here. The Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice was the member of the government <lb/>
who above all others was most intimately <lb/>
acquainted with all the questions involved <lb/>
in this measure, and yet it cannot be denied, <lb/>
for he himself has admitted it, that al<lb break="no"/>though he discussed different other ques<lb break="no"/>tions with the government, although he had <lb/>
given long and anxious consideration to <lb/>
the education question, this. the most im<lb break="no"/>portant of all the questions had never been <lb/>
mentioned between him and his leader up <lb/>
to the time the Bill was laid before the <lb/>
House; and the Bill was hurriedly brought <lb/>
down within a couple of days before the <lb/>
hon. gentleman's expected return. Surely we <lb/>
cannot be surprised if some people should <lb/>
think that this is a suspicious circumstance. <lb/>
We find, from the statements made to the <lb/>
House, that this important matter was de<lb break="no"/>ferred to a subcommittee of the government. <lb/>
I have not a word to say against the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of that sub-committee, but I would <lb/>
venture to suggest that perhaps those whom <lb/>
I may describe as the minority must not <lb/>
be surprised if those who happen to be in <lb/>
the majority think it rather strange, that <lb/>
when Mr. Haultain could not be consulted <lb/>
on the education clause, and when the ex- <lb break="yes"/>
Minister of the Interior and the Minister <lb/>
of Finance could not be consulted, that a <lb/>
commitee composed of the Premier, Mr. <lb/>
Fitzpatrick, the Minister of
Justice; Mr. <lb/>
Scott, the Secretary of State, and Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>liam Mulock were the four to Whom was <lb/>
referred this important question. Surely <lb/>
there is something in'that to cause the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country to wonder if everything <lb/>
is as simple and plain as has been repre<lb break="no"/>sented by hon. gentlemen opposite. We find <lb/>
on the return of the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, that he promptly resigns and hav<lb break="no"/>ing resigned he was heralded through the <lb/>
country as a man who had made sacrifices <lb/>
       
 on the ground of principle. Time went on <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
 
 and to-day
we have had the Minister of the <lb/>
Interior before the Canadian House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. I stand in the judgment of all those <lb/>
who heard him this evening, if a
more pit<lb break="no"/>iable attempt to explain what could not be <lb/>
explained was ever presented to any intel<lb break="no"/>ligent body. I am sorry the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is not here to—night. I was at a loss <lb/>
while he was speaking to know, whether <lb/>
one should pity him or pity his ex-colleagues
<lb/>
the more. Just think of the position he <lb/>
was in. The Minister of Finance says the <lb/>
only difference between the parties is that <lb/>
one half hour of religious education; the <lb/>
Minister of Justice says he did not intend <lb/>
to go one inch beyond the present condi<lb break="no"/>tions, but the clauses are drawn in such a <lb/>
tangled net that a man of the intelligence <lb/>
of the Minister of the Interior did not know <lb/>
what they meant, and he believed they were <lb/>
something so terrible that he had to resign <lb/>
from the government. There is an end to <lb/>
everything in this world, and you would <lb/>
have thought that about that time there <lb/>
was an end to the want of confidence the <lb/>
ministers exhibited towards one another. <lb/>
You would think that gentlemen of the <lb/>
intelligence of the Minister of Justice, the <lb/>
Minister of the Interior and the Minister of <lb/>
Finance when they met together and found <lb/>
they were in absolute accord as to what <lb/>
they wanted; you would have thought it <lb/>
would not have been very dificult for them <lb/>
to have said: There is a slight misunder<lb break="no"/>standing, we will make it clear in a few <lb/>
words; and then and there the Minister of <lb/>
the Interior would have been contented with <lb/>
the clauses and would not have resigned. <lb/>
Evidently there was no such discussion. or <lb/>
the discussion that was held was not what <lb/>
we have been told. Evidently we have <lb/>
not been told all the truth, or else there <lb/>
was more all round stupidity displayed <lb/>
than ever before was displayed in this or <lb/>
any other country by three cabinet min<lb break="no"/>isters. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Then, when the Minister of the Interior
had <lb/>
resigned, and the country had sounded his <lb/>
praises from one end to the other, we had <lb/>
this incident. The newspapers sometimes <lb/>
foresee What is to happen, and among them <lb/>
the Montreal 'Witness' of to-day, a paper <lb/>
published before the explanation of this <lb/>
afternoon, writes : <lb/>

            </p></quote>

            <p> Now Sir, that prophesy of the Montreal <lb/>
' Witness' is pretty nearly correct. It is <lb/>
not absolutely correct because the ex-min<lb break="no"/>ister (Mr. Sifton) did not wait until next <lb/>
week and he most certainly did not make <lb/>
a strong speech. With these two trifling <lb/>
exceptions the 'Witness' article is true. <lb/>
When one considers the position of the ex- <lb break="yes"/>
Minister of the Interior it,
reminds us of <lb/>
the cartoon which was widely circulated <lb/>
throughout this country some years ago at <lb/>
the expense of another politician; it was <lb/>
a very pretty picture with the legend at <lb/>
the bottom : The cat came back. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> We had the privilege of hearing the ex- <lb break="yes"/>
minster this afternoon and you remember <lb/>
the excuse he gave. He was perfectly pre<lb break="no"/>pared to accept the present clauses, but he <lb/>
feared the original clauses because he <lb/>
thought they might be liable to introduce <lb/>
some of these ordinances of an ephem<lb break="no"/>eral character that had come and gone <lb/>
years ago, and he also feared that <lb/>
peradventure a university might be <lb/>
founded in years to come in the dis<lb break="no"/>tant Northwest, and when founded it <lb/>
might lead to dissensions between majori<lb break="no"/>ties and minorities in that unhappy coun<lb break="no"/>try. One feels inclined to protest against <lb/>
such an affront to the intelligence of the <lb/>
members of this House, as for a gentleman <lb/>
who occupies such an exalted position to <lb/>
venture to come before parliament with <lb/>
such an excuse as this. We cannot be very <lb/>
much surprised if the majority in this coun<lb break="no"/>try are inclined to think that the truth, the <lb/>
whole truth and nothing but the truth has <lb/>
not been told them by hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite in their account of the effect of this <lb/>
Bill. If further confirmation of such sus<lb break="no"/>picions were necessary, one has but to look <lb/>
at the arguments advanced by hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite in support of their Bill. As I <lb/>
have said, the burden rests on a govern<lb break="no"/>ment which brings down a Bill to show <lb/>
good and sufficient reason to justify its <lb/>
passage. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Let us look at the arguments advanced <lb/>
by the leading gentlemen on the opposite <lb/>
side of the House who have spoken. The <lb/>
right hon. the Prime Minister spoke first, <lb/>
and assuming that a gentleman of his <lb/>
ability made the best argument that could <lb/>
be made in favour of the Bill, let us see <lb/>
what his statements were. His first justi<lb break="no"/>fication for it was, because of the cleavage <lb/>
between Roman Catholics and Protestants; <lb/>
a cleavage on matters of dogma. Now, <lb/>
if the statement of the hon. Minister of <lb/>
Finance is true, what earthly difference <lb/>
does such a cleavage make? Let the <lb/>
Roman Catholic children be instructed by <lb/>
their priests from half-past three to four <lb/>
and the children of any Protestant denomin<lb break="no"/>ation be instructed by their ministers from <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
      
 half past three to four, and where is
there <lb/>
any necessity of referring to a cleavage in <lb/>
dogma, and how can that affect the ques<lb break="no"/>tion? But even if it did affect it, what <lb/>
is the meaning of cleavage in dogma be<lb break="no"/>tween Roman Catholics and Protestants ? <lb/>
Roman Catholics and Protestants are not all <lb/>
the people of this country. The Minister <lb/>
of the interior is perhaps
responsible for <lb/>
other complications that may arise when <lb/>
we come to consider cleavage in
doctrine; <lb/>
because I believe the hon. member for East <lb/>
Grey (Mr. Sproule) will object to some of <lb/>
the settlers in the Northwest being classed <lb/>
as adherents of the Protestant faith. Where <lb/>
will you put the Doukhobors, the Mormons.
<lb/>
the members of the Greek Church ? Are <lb/>
they Protestants? If the only cleavage to <lb/>
be considered is a cleavage in doctrine, <lb/>
between two bodies, perhaps something may <lb/>
be said for separate schools; but if the <lb/>
cleavage between Mormons and Protestants <lb/>
is as broad as the cleavage between Pro<lb break="no"/>testants and Roman Catholics—and I trust <lb/>
that it is broader or if the cleavage be<lb break="no"/>tween Protestants and Doukhobors is as <lb/>
broad—and I believe it is just as broad— <lb/>
then why should there be separate schools <lb/>
instead of national schools ? The Hon. <lb/>
George Brown, whose speeches in the Sen<lb break="no"/>ate have often been quoted in admiration, <lb/>
in objecting to separate schools, pointed <lb/>
out that if they were allowed, Anglicans and <lb/>
Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists were <lb/>
just as much entitled to them as any other <lb/>
class of the community; and .hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite who are sufficiently instructed <lb/>
ir. theology will bear me out when I say <lb/>
that the difference between the
high church <lb/>
Anglican and the Roman Catholic is much <lb/>
less than the difference between the high <lb/>
church Anglican and the adherent of the <lb/>
denominations commonly known as Pro<lb break="no"/>testant.</p>

<p>
Then the hon. gentleman said: Give the <lb/>
Northwest the same rights as are given to <lb/>
Quebec and Ontario. Why did the hon. <lb/>
gentleman say that? In the British North <lb/>
America Act there was no confederation <lb/>
of Quebec and Ontario. There was a con<lb break="no"/>federation of four provinces—Quebec, On<lb break="no"/>tario, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. <lb/>
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were not <lb/>
given separate schools, Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec were not given separate schools, by the <lb/>
Act of Union; and when these
provinces <lb/>
are coming into a partnership in which there <lb/>
are seven provinces, and only two have <lb/>
separate schools, on what ground can the <lb/>
hon. gentleman say that as a matter of right <lb/>
and justice, these new provinces are en<lb break="no"/>titled to the special privileges which the <lb/>
two provinces have rather than the five pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which lack those special privileges, <lb/>
if such they be. Besides, it must be borne <lb/>
in mind—and I am trying to speak with all <lb/>
calmness and frankness in calling the at<lb break="no"/>tention of hon. gentlemen to the views of <lb/>
      

            <pb n="3145" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3145.jpg"/>

the majority—that the Protestants of Que<lb break="no"/>bec and the Roman Catholics of Ontario <lb/>
were not given any rights at all. In con<lb break="no"/>sequence of a mutual exchange the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants of Quebec and the Roman Catholics <lb/>
 of Ontario established separate schools,
and <lb/>
   it was agreed to give separate schools to
<lb/>
both. When the hon. gentleman, then, <lb/>
says that we should give the Northwest <lb/>
the same rights that we gave to Ontario and <lb/>
Quebec, he is asking for something that is <lb/>
impossible, because we did not give those <lb/>
rights to Ontario and Quebec. But if we <lb/>
take the hon. gentleman at his
word, and <lb/>
give to the minority in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories the same rights that the Protestants <lb/>
have in Quebec, would that satisfy hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite ? Would that satisfy the <lb/>
premier ? Would it satisfy some of our <lb/>
extreme friends in the province of Quebec ? <lb/>
What are those rights? What is
the con<lb break="no"/>dition in Quebec? The schools which we <lb/>
call public schools in other provinces are <lb/>
church schools there; and I say all credit <lb/>
to the Roman Catholics for insisting on an <lb/>
education in religion in the schools. I think <lb/>
it would be better for Protestants if they <lb/>
did the same; but unfortunately the divis<lb break="no"/>ions among them prevent that desirable <lb/>
consummation. But in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, as a matter of fact the majority have <lb/>
their schools conducted on religious lines. <lb/>
There is a great difference between a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant going to what is practically a church <lb/>
school and being trained in the doctrines of <lb/>
the Catholic faith, and a Roman Catholic <lb/>
child in the Northwest going to a public <lb/>
school of which the worst said is that he is <lb/>
not trained in his own faith. Surely there <lb/>
is all the difference, to use the language of <lb/>
the prayer book, between commission and <lb/>
omission in the two acts. And so, when hon. <lb/>
gentlemen opposite plead with us to give <lb/>
to the Northwest the same rights that are <lb/>
given to Quebec and Ontario, I venture to <lb/>
say that, the Protestants, being in such an <lb/>
immense majority in the Northwest, in <lb/>
many cases it would be a practical impos<lb break="no"/>sibility for the Roman Catholics to have <lb/>
their separate schools. They would feel <lb/>
that a gross injustice was being done to a <lb/>
Roman Catholic child if we set up a national <lb/>
school in the Northwest in which the dis<lb break="no"/>tinctive tenets of Protestantism were <lb/>
taught. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The right hon. gentleman said, on page <lb/>
1458, in introducing the Bill : <lb/>

            <p> Now, Sir, I must confess that I am utter<lb break="no"/>ly unable to grasp the meaning of that <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
   
 language. I am not aware of any rights <lb/>
that were given up, any valuable privileges <lb/>
of which they were shorn, any position of <lb/>
strength that was abandoned. If any com<lb break="no"/>pact or bargain has been made by which <lb/>
the people of this country are in honour <lb/>
bound to give to the Northwest separate <lb/>
schools or anything else, then I will take <lb/>
the same stand that I took in 1896, and say, <lb/>
if the honour of this country is at stake, <lb/>
let us preserve our honour. But surely it <lb/>
is on hon. gentlemen opposite to show that <lb/>
there was some compact by which we are <lb/>
in honour bound to give some system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation to which we are opposed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The right hon. gentleman, in introducing <lb/>
the Bill, made another statement, on page <lb/>
1458; and it is rather singular that he <lb/>
used such an argument and others when the <lb/>
real point at issue is whether or not re<lb break="no"/>ligious education should be given
for half <lb/>
an hour a day. The right hon. gentleman <lb/>
said : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> When I compare these two countries, when

            </p></quote>

            <p> I was rather amused when the right hon. <lb/>
gentleman said that. He was greeted with <lb/>
thunderous applause by the gentlemen be<lb break="no"/>hind him. Those hon. gentlemen, I some<lb break="no"/>times think, have got into such
a habit of <lb/>
applauding their leader for the eloquent <lb/>
passages with which from time to time he <lb/>
regales them, that they often applaud though <lb/>
they fail to grasp the point. I saw some <lb/>
gentlemen applauding that statement who <lb/>
I thought should more properly have held <lb/>
a brief for the Roman Catholics of the <lb/>
United States; and I call their attention <lb/>
to this statement which the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has advanced as an argument why <lb/>
we should pass this Bill, which is in effect <lb/>
a statement that in the United States there <lb/>
is no religion taught in the national schools; <lb/>
that in Canada you have national schools <lb/>
without religion for Protestants and separate <lb/>
schools for Roman Catholics ; and that the <lb/>
consequence is that under this educational <lb/>
system Canada has escaped the murders, <lb/>
divorces and lynchings so common in the <lb/>
United States. Now, what does that mean <lb/>
if logic means anything? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I will not try to put it in words because
<lb/>
one is so apt to be misquoted or misreported <lb/>
that I am afraid somebody will be unkind <lb/>
enough to say afterwards that I charged the <lb/>
Catholics of the United States when it is <lb/>
the right hon. the Prime Minister who has <lb/>
done that, and I stand here to defend them. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> If it be true as he said, that we have
public <lb/>
schools in Canada, in which no religion is <lb/>
taught and separate schools where the tenets <lb/>
of the Roman Catholic church are taught, <lb/>
and that in the United States they have <lb/>
only public schools wherein no religion is <lb/>
taught; therefore the murders lynchings, <lb/>
and the divorces in the United States must <lb/>
be attributable to the Catholics of the United <lb/>
States, according to his logic. It could not <lb/>
be attributed to the Protestants because the <lb/>
system of education is the same for them <lb/>
in Canada as in the United States and the <lb/>
only possible argument that can be advanced <lb/>
is: Give us separate schools here because <lb/>
the tone of morals will then be so much <lb/>
higher that we will shine in comparison with <lb/>
our less blessed neighbours to the south. <lb/>
This logical conclusion is irresistible, yet <lb/>
the hon. gentlemen opposite showed their <lb/>
approval of this as one of the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister's strongest arguments. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman spoke of the obligation resting on us <lb/>
to maintain separate schools in the west be<lb break="no"/>cause they were given by legislation and <lb/>
pointed out that we here had given the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway a certain exemption,
<lb/>
from taxation and that nobody would think 
<lb/>
of revoking that Act passed by this parlia
<lb/>
ment. I thought at the time the right hon. <lb/>
gentleman could hardly be speaking
<lb/>
seriously. Surely he must admit that there<lb/>
is all the difference in the world between an  <lb/>
ordinance passed by a legislature that can <lb/>
give one day and recall the next a solemn <lb/>
bargain between a country and a railway <lb/>
company whereby in consideration of certain <lb/>
things done and promised by the country <lb/>
the company agrees to build a railroad. In <lb/>
one case there is a bargain and in the other <lb/>
there is no bargain. If these were a <lb/>
parallel—I do not think there is an <lb/>
exact one, but if I were looking for <lb/>
one—I would find it in the case of the Land <lb/>
Act of the Northwest Territories, whereby <lb/>
land was set aside for purposes of education <lb/>
and subsequently this House deliberately <lb/>
changed that to reserve the lands for the <lb/>
public schools, and from that day to this <lb/>
thousands and thousands of acres of land <lb/>
have been held in trust for the benefit of <lb/>
public schools. If any settlers went in <lb/>
under any inducement what would be a <lb/>
greater inducement than to come to a land <lb/>
where hundreds and thousands of acres were <lb/>
set aside solemnly by the Dominion parlia<lb break="no"/>ment for the aid of public schools? And <lb/>
yet the hon. gentleman does not hesitate <lb/>
to break that law and that trust by this <lb/>
Act ruthlessly to lay hands on the public <lb/>
lands and divide the proceeds between the <lb/>
public and the so-called separate schools. <lb/>
The Minister of Finance gave us an as<lb break="no"/>surance the other night that was certainly <lb/>
very gratifying when he told us there was <lb/>
no legal or binding obligation to re-enact the <lb/>
law of 1875. If there is no legal or binding <lb/>
obligation to re-enact that law, then we on <lb/>
this side of the House cannot be blamed, I <lb/>
       

            <cb/>

suppose, if we prefer not to enact it.
The <lb/>
hon. the Minister of Finance whose intelli<lb break="no"/>gence we all admit, whose capacity fully <lb/>
to understand the full effect and grasp of <lb/>
the possibilities of the resolution before the <lb/>
House quite as well as some hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who sit behind him, would come to the <lb/>
discussion of the subject in the House with <lb/>
a breezy freshness which the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men would lack because he did not see the <lb/>
Act as soon as they and so it is fresher in <lb/>

could do by the burdens laid on them. I <lb/>
refer to the remarks of the Minister of <lb/>
Finance perhaps more frequently than those <lb/>
of other gentlemen because I enjoyed them <lb/>
as an oratorical effort. He favoured us <lb/>
with a description of the Paradise Regained <lb/>
in the little province of Nova Scotia; he <lb/>
described the absolute bliss that reigned <lb/>
there among those religious classes which <lb/>
are warring in other portions of the country <lb/>
and pointed to the absolute harmony, con<lb break="no"/>cord and progress which prevailed there be<lb break="no"/>cause they had not any separate school sys<lb break="no"/>tem and in triumph, glorying as he was in <lb/>
this happy state of Nova Scotia, his col<lb break="no"/>league the Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. <lb/>
Emmerson), not wishing to be completely <lb/>
eclipsed, called his attention to the fact that <lb/>
a similarly happy condition of affairs pre<lb break="no"/>vails in New Brunswick where there are no <lb/>
separate schools. The hon. gentleman held <lb/>
this House spell-bound with an eloquence <lb/>
which we can admire without attempting to <lb/>
imitate, in one of the most glorious oratori<lb break="no"/>cal efforts ever given in this House while he <lb/>
proved that inasmuch as Nova Scotia and <lb/>
New Brunswick were so perfectly happy
<lb/>
and free and prosperous without separate <lb/>
schools, therefore we ought to impose on the <lb/>
Northwest Territories separate schools. Is <lb/>
ii. any wonder, Sir, when we find an Act in<lb break="no"/>troduced into this House under such circum<lb break="no"/>stances as those under which this Act was <lb/>
introduced, to which we have called atten<lb break="no"/>tion before, and when we find that Act sup<lb break="no"/>ported by such argument and eloquence as <lb/>
that, is it any wonder—and I ask it in all <lb/>
seriousness—that this class of people who <lb/>
have been referred to as the majority some<lb break="no"/>times wonder if there is not more in the Act <lb/>
than is stated by hon. gentlemen opposite? <lb/>
If there is nothing more in the Act than the <lb/>
Minister of Finance said—and far be it from <lb/>
me to transgress the rules of the House or, <lb/>
outside of the House, to doubt his word, <lb/>
if there be nothing more than he said, viz: <lb/>
the paltry half-hour for religious instruction <lb/>

for Heaven's sake let us as two-hundred
and <lb/>
fifteen intelligent men, put our heads to<lb break="no"/>gether this night and settle this question of <lb/>
education in the Northwest Territories. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> I was looking over the several ordinances
<lb/>
of the Northwest Territories the other day. <lb/>
They are rather voluminous, I have not had <lb/>
time to study them since I received them, <lb/>
but while not pretending to say that there <lb/>
is anything in what I am about to say to <lb/>
cause any hon. gentleman to change his mind <lb/>
about the true purport of this Bill, still it <lb/>
is possible there are some who do not under<lb break="no"/>stand hon. gentlemen opposite as well as we <lb/>
do and have less confidence in them than we <lb/>
have. Some people outside, in
the country, <lb/>
if they should read these ordinances might <lb/>
be suspicious. Clause 10 provides: <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> All general regulations respecting the
inspec<lb break="no"/>tion of schools, the examination, training. <lb/>
licensing, and grading of teachers, courses of <lb/>
study. teachers' institutes, and text and refer<lb break="no"/>ence books shall before being adopted or <lb/>
amended be referred to the council for its dis<lb break="no"/>cussion and report. <lb/>
            </p></quote>



            <p> A rather important clause you would think
<lb/>
covering almost everything touching edu<lb break="no"/>cation. Clause 11 provides : <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> The council shall consider such matters
as <lb/>
may be referred to it as herein before provided <lb/>
for by the commissioner, and may also consider <lb/>
any question concerning the educational system <lb/>
of the Territories as to it may seem fit, and <lb/>
shall report thereon to the Lieutenant Gover<lb break="no"/>nor in Council. <lb/>
            </p>
</quote>


            <p> Still further powers. I do not wish to <lb/>
misrepresent a single word, and therefore <lb/>
call attention to the fact that this education<lb break="no"/>al clause with these broad powers is really <lb/>
an educational adviser to the educational <lb/>
commissioners of the Territories. I do not <lb/>
pretend to say, and hope I shall not be <lb/>
accused afterwards of misleading the House <lb/>
by trying to make hon. members
believe, <lb/>
that this council has power to do every<lb break="no"/>thing that it has power to report upon. But, <lb/>
when we find a member of the government <lb/>
given an advisory clause in some special <lb/>
line like education, we can well believe that <lb/>
he would feel bound, except for very good <lb/>
reasons to the contrary, to follow the ad<lb break="no"/>vise they gave. As the present Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Ontario, Mr. Whitney, said in ad<lb break="no"/>vocating an advisory board: he said the <lb/>
minister will not be bound to take their <lb/>
opinion, but he should be assuming a grave <lb/>
responsibility if he ventured to differ from <lb/>
the educational board selected for him. So, <lb/>
with regard to the educational clause of <lb/>
the Northwest Territories, I do not say that <lb/>
their findings are absolutely conclusive but <lb/>
I do say that they are entitled to the great<lb break="no"/>est weight. and that in the practical carry<lb break="no"/>ing out of education they would be found <lb/>
to have tremendous weight. And how is <lb/>
  this clause composed ? Let me read the <lb/>
section on that point : <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
      

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> There shall be an educational council
consist<lb break="no"/>ing of five persons at least two of whom shall <lb/>
be Roman Catholics to be appointed by the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor in Council,
who shall re<lb break="no"/>commend such remuneration as the Lieutenant <lb/>
Governor in Council shall decide. <lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p> Now, Sir, I make no comment; I find no <lb/>
fault. Still, we find an ordinance of this <lb/>
kind appointing a board of five, of whom <lb/>
two at least must be-the whole
five may <lb/>
be Roman Catholics. And we have been <lb/>
told of the schools of that part of the coun<lb/>
try that there are, as I understand, ten or <lb/>
twelve separate schools and 1,000 or 1,200 <lb/>
public schools. for the population is over<lb break="no"/>whelmingly Protestant. Is it any wonder <lb/>
that some people dislike crystallizing into <lb/>
law for all time to come this provision for <lb/>
a board of five members two of Whom at <lb/>
least must be Roman Catholics? Without <lb/>
a word derogatory to my Roman Catholic <lb/>
friends or to any gentleman in the ministry,  <lb/>
let me assume that one of the three non- <lb break="yes"/>
Catholics takes no more interest in educa<lb break="no"/>tion than one of the Protestant members of <lb/>
the sub-committee, Sir William Mulock,
did <lb/>
in the present Bill, and where would the <lb/>
rights of the Protestant majority be ? We <lb/>
have a mixed population there. Give the <lb/>
Roman Catholics all, and more than all, <lb/>
they are justly entitled to,
because they <lb/>
are a minority. But surely it the tables <lb/>
were turned my Roman Catholic friends <lb/>
would object to have it provided for all <lb/>
time to come that two of the members of <lb/>
the educational council must be members <lb/>
of the opposite faith. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man will allow me, I would like to ask him <lb/>
a question. Can these two members of the <lb/>
educational council vote ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. I see nothing here to <lb/>
prevent it. They all stand on the same <lb/>
footing. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. But can the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the council reach an efiective deci<lb break="no"/>sion, or have they only advisory powers ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. I was very careful, in <lb/>
introducing the subject, to explain the <lb/>
powers that they had not, so that I might <lb/>
not be accused of misleading the House. <lb/>
So, I think I am justified in what I said, <lb/>
that, while I do not claim that this council <lb/>
has the power to crystallize into law what <lb/>
they wish on these subjects, yet the com<lb break="no"/>missioner of education must be expected <lb/>
to be guided to a large extent by the deci<lb break="no"/>sions of those selected for that important <lb/>
trust. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Then, looking a little further—and I <lb/>
merely mention this as an illustration of <lb/>
something in the Act that goes a little fur<lb break="no"/>ther than the Minister of Finance thought <lb/>
—I find ordinance 31 which regulates the <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. It is the one officially <lb/>
sent to me. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCA3">Mr. L. G. MCCARTHY</persName>. It is not em<lb break="no"/>bodied in the Bill. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. I see that. But I <lb/>
gave this merely to illustrate how the Act <lb/>
must work out for a similar ordinance <lb/>
must be passed. Here is the point I want <lb/>
to make: Certain grants are made out of <lb/>
the public treasury for these schools. Take <lb/>
a rural school section, of, say, 6,400 acres. <lb/>
A certain amount of money will go to that <lb/>
section. Now, simply as a practical illus<lb break="no"/>tration of What would arise under the or<lb break="no"/>dinance <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. But what purpose is-to be <lb/>
served by giving such an illustration. when <lb/>
there is no provision of that kind in the <lb/>
Bill ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:NORT1">Mr. NORTHRUP</persName>. I suppose that when <lb/>
the public moneys are to be distributed un<lb break="no"/>der this Bill, they must be distributed <lb/>
equitably among the public and separate <lb/>
schools. If a certain amount of money is <lb/>
to go to one section, and there is only one <lb/>
school, that school will get more than it <lb/>
would if another school were established in <lb/>
the same section. That, I think, is self <lb/>
evident. I expressly said that I gave this <lb/>
as an illustration of how it would work out. <lb/>
I suppose it will be admitted that, as that <lb/>
country is sparsely settled, it must be rather <lb/>
hard, in many sections, to maintain the <lb/>
schools. If another school is started in the <lb/>
neighbourhood, a heavy burden is
placed <lb/>
upon both classes of the community and <lb/>
the schools are less efficient than they other<lb break="no"/>wise would be. I have another reason. I <lb/>
was in the Northwest about two
years ago. <lb/>
I found regions which foreigners, as for in<lb break="no"/>stance the Galicians, have come in and set- <lb break="yes"/>
tied. Now, if the Galicians get control of <lb/>
the school in one section, is it more likely <lb/>
or is it less likely that Americans, let us <lb/>
say, will settle there under the proposed <lb/>
legislation than they would if the public <lb/>
school only could be established there ? As <lb/>
a practical question is it not clear that the <lb/>
moment a number of foreigners settle in <lb/>
one section, they will effectively exclude <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
   
 other people settling in that section
unless <lb/>
they are prepared to accept the conditions <lb/>
that would be suitable to foreigners ? Take, <lb/>
for instance the Galicians, and speaking of <lb/>
them with all respect. Is it unfair to say <lb/>
that the children of Galicians not knowing <lb/>
a word of English, would not be re<lb break="no"/>garded as the most profitable fellow- <lb break="yes"/>
students at school for the children of a <lb/>
farmer coming from the south side of the <lb/>
line. Therefore I venture to say that the <lb/>
idea of splitting up the schools is not cal<lb break="no"/>culated to improve the class of immigrants <lb/>
coming into the country and that it will <lb/>
practically shut out from the country a <lb/>
great deal of a certain and excellent class <lb/>
of immigration. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I have tried calmly and quietly to call
the <lb/>
attention of the hon. gentlemen opposite to <lb/>
the fact that a majority may have feelings <lb/>
as well as a minority, and that it would be <lb/>
well in all these matters to consider the <lb/>
feelings of the majority as well as the feel<lb break="no"/>ings of the minority. I trust, Sir, that since <lb/>
it has been admitted on both sides of the <lb/>
House that painful excitement exists in the <lb/>
country, that fears have been aroused and <lb/>
passions excited, that probably many long <lb/>
days will be required to quell. I think I am <lb/>
justified in view of these facts admitted on <lb/>
both sides of the House, in appealing to the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman to tell us what is <lb/>
meant, and either say that the Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister was wrong in his definition, or if he <lb/>
stands by what he says and calls it right, <lb/>
then let us here tonight, before
we leave <lb/>
this chamber, settle on terms which will be <lb/>
satisfactory to every one of the majority in <lb/>
Canada who would gladly see all the child<lb break="no"/>ren of this country trained every day in the <lb/>
year, for half an hour or more, in the faith <lb/>
taught them by their fathers. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. FRANK OLIVER</persName> (Edmonton). If I <lb/>
have the permission of the leader of the <lb/>
opposition, whom I am sorry to see is <lb/>
not now in his place, to venture a few re<lb break="no"/>marks in regard to what is especially a <lb/>
Northwest question, I would like to take up <lb/>
the time of the House for a little while to<lb break="no"/>night. That gentleman has several times <lb/>
referred to an occasion of two years ago <lb/>
when he saw fit to bring before this <lb/>
House a motion in regard to provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy, and it has seemed a grievance to <lb/>
him that on that occasion he was replied to <lb/>
by a humble member representing part of <lb/>
the Northwest Territories instead of by a <lb/>
member of the government. I do not know <lb/>
what qualification the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position demands from members who ad<lb break="no"/>dress this House, but I would think, with all <lb/>
humility, that a member who has spent <lb/>
the greater part of his life in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, Who had some part in <lb/>
the local government of the Territories <lb/>
for many years, might possibly be able to <lb/>
contribute something to the information of <lb/>
the House on a question so closely connected <lb/>
          

            <pb n="3153" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3153.jpg"/>

 with the welfare of those Territories. I <lb/>
observe that on this particular occasion <lb/>
the leader of the opposition, in conduct<lb break="no"/>ing the debate, if he has control of its <lb/>
conduct, is apparently of the view of that <lb/>
great American humorist, Mark Twain, who <lb/>
declared the less he knew of the subject the <lb/>
more fluently he could speak on it. I notice <lb/>
that his colleagues sitting beside him, mem<lb break="no"/>bers of a government who themselves, not <lb/>
so many years ago, were painfully interested <lb/>
in a certain school question, have not so far <lb/>
replied to the three ministers of the cabinet <lb/>
who have dealt with the question in this <lb/>
debate. The duty of replying to one of the <lb/>
most important speeches that has been made <lb/>
on this occasion has been relegated to my <lb/>
hon. friend who has just sat down (Mr. <lb/>
Northrup), and I think all will agree with <lb/>
me that no serious light has been thrown <lb/>
upon the subject, that the speech has not <lb/>
done credit either to the cause or its leader, <lb/>
nor has it done discredit to the ex-Minister <lb/>
of the Interior or to the cause which he <lb/>
champions. It seems to be the strong point <lb/>
in the argument of these gentlemen that <lb/>
because they do not see fit to see something, <lb/>
that, therefore, it is not there. Now, there <lb/>
is no one so blind as he who will not see; <lb/>
and the gentleman who can see no difference <lb/>
between the provisions of clause
16 as ori<lb break="no"/>ginally introduced and the provisions as they <lb/>
now stand for the approval of the House, is <lb/>
certainly very blind; I won't say that it is <lb/>
because he does not want to see, very prob<lb break="no"/>ably it is because he cannot see. The differ<lb break="no"/>ence between these two provisions, as I <lb/>
understand them, is radical. I do not say <lb/>
that it was intentional. We have had en<lb break="no"/>ough disputations in regard to constitutional <lb/>
points in this House during this debate to <lb/>
leave us all with the full knowledge that <lb/>
there may be honest differences-of opinion <lb/>
with regard to all these points. To my mind <lb/>
the difference is very important. As stated <lb/>
by the ex-Minister of the Interior here to<lb break="no"/>day—and I speak as one who knows some<lb break="no"/>thing of this matter, as one who has had ex<lb break="no"/>perience in regard to school legislation, as <lb/>
one of those members of the Northwest <lb/>
Assembly who made the change in the <lb/>
Northwest school law between what it was <lb/>
before 1891 and what it is to-day—I say the <lb/>
difference, as I understand it, is a difference <lb/>
between clerical control of schools and na<lb break="no"/>tional control of schools. If that is not a <lb/>
sufficient difference, then I do
not under<lb break="no"/>stand what we are disputing about. I think <lb/>
it is a radical difference. It is what threw <lb/>
this country into a turmoil in 1896 and <lb/>
caused a change of government at that time. <lb/>
It is the reason why those gentlemen are <lb/>
sitting on that side of the House instead of <lb/>
on this side. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> But I wish particularly to deal at this <lb/>
time rather with the financial terms of these <lb/>
Bills than with the educational sections. To <lb/>
revert again to the leader of the opposition <lb/>
and his troubles, it seemed to be a great <lb/>
            

            <cb/>
 
worry to him that two years ago several <lb/>
members representing the Northwest had <lb/>
the temerity to vote against his proposal for <lb/>
immediate provincial autonomy to the North <lb/>
west Territories. He objected very strongly <lb/>
to the reasons given on that occasion. I can <lb/>
only say that the reasons seemed to be suf<lb break="no"/>ficient to him at the time and afterwards, <lb/>
because, although he alleged that the meas<lb break="no"/>ure was immediately important at that time <lb/>
it was the last reference he made to it, so <lb/>
far as I can recollect, until the measure was <lb/>
brought down this year. The reasons given <lb/>
were sufiicient apparently to satisfy him <lb/>
that the question was not pressing, was <lb/>
not so immediately important. I think I <lb/>
can satisfy the House that there were very <lb/>
good reasons why members representing the <lb/>
Northwest Territories should not be anxious <lb/>
to accept the suggestion of provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy without knowing very well what the <lb/>
terms of that autonomy were to be. I think <lb/>
the events of this debate are suflicient to <lb/>
prove that; and I think what has occurred <lb/>
since the opening of this session and since <lb/>
these Bills were brought down is evidence, <lb/>
if evidence were needed, that western mem<lb break="no"/>bers have been fairly careful as to what they <lb/>
agreed to, and possibly have had some in<lb break="no"/>fluence ln securing provisions which would <lb/>
be to the advantage of the people of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> In considering the question of autonomy, <lb/>
we have to consider our peculiar position. <lb/>
We have to consider our position as compar<lb break="no"/>ed with the condition of other provinces. <lb/>
The revenues that we might expect to receive <lb/>
as compared with those of other provinces, <lb/>
and consider whether our condition would <lb/>
be improved or be made worse by accepting <lb/>
provincial autonomy. We have great needs
<lb/>
to meet in that country. Here in this pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario we may make a compari<lb break="no"/>son. The settled part of the province of <lb/>
Ontario is perhaps 400 miles long by 100 <lb/>
miles wide. In that area is contained all <lb/>
there is in Ontario, in the way of agriculture, <lb/>
at any rate. There are the roads,
there are <lb/>
the schools, there are all the expenditures <lb/>
practically which the provincial government <lb/>
has to provide for. In these Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, in the province of Saskatchewan. <lb/>
we will say, there is an area of 300 by 300 <lb/>
miles of agricultural country, over which <lb/>
agricultural settlement must spread, over <lb/>
which roads must be made, throughout <lb/>
which schools must be provided and muni<lb break="no"/>cipal institutions taken care of. In Alberta <lb/>
we claim a distance of 800 miles in length <lb/>
by no less than 200 or 300 miles in width of <lb/>
agricultural country, over which settlement <lb/>
will spread, throughout which roads must be <lb/>
built, municipalities organized and schools <lb/>
maintained. If the province of Ontario, upon <lb/>
entering into confederation, found itself <lb/>
with a load of some $45,000,000 of debt in<lb break="no"/>curred because of the necessity for the <lb/>
improvement of the conditions throughout <lb/>
that comparatively small area, we might <lb/>
       

            <pb n="3155" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-24_Page_3155.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">3156</fw>
           

very well consider carefully our financial
<lb/>
position in undertaking to spread. civiliza<lb break="no"/>tion and improvement over these very much <lb/>
vaster areas under our conditions. We <lb/>
knew that we must have the means or we <lb/>
cannot have the success. We must have <lb/>
the means with which to build roads, to <lb/>
provide schools, to take care of all these <lb/>
requirements of civilization which fall to <lb/>
the lot of the provinces ; and without those <lb/>
means, without that money, if we cannot <lb/>
go forward as provinces, we had better not <lb/>
undertake the responsibility of it. We find <lb/>
that in the condition in which we are at <lb/>
the present time the Territories receive a <lb/>
matter of nearly a million and a quarter <lb/>
dollars of revenue from this Dominion, or <lb/>
of subsidy, in the place of a provincial sub<lb break="no"/>sidy. Outside of that, there are expendi<lb break="no"/>tures which, in the provinces, are borne <lb/>
out of the provincial funds, but which, so <lb/>
far, have come out of the Dominion treasury, <lb/>
and which aggregate something like half a <lb/>
million dollars. At the present time, con<lb break="no"/>sidering the Territories as a province, we <lb/>
are receiving as a subsidy from the Do<lb break="no"/>minion treasury, a matter of a million and <lb/>
three-quarters of money. Now,
compare that <lb/>
with the subsidy received by any of the <lb/>
other provinces. We find that Ontario re<lb break="no"/>ceives a subsidy of a little less than a mil<lb break="no"/>lion and a half, Quebec a little over a mil<lb break="no"/>lion, Nova Scotia under half a million, New <lb/>
Brunswick under half a million, Manitoba <lb/>
a little over halt a million, British Colum<lb break="no"/>bia $300,000 and Prince Edward Isfland <lb/>
$200,000, the two larger of these with popu<lb break="no"/>lations infinitely greater than that of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories. As I said, in the <lb/>
Northwest Territories we are not receiving <lb/>
more money than is necessary for the <lb/>
development and improvement of the <lb/>
country. Out of the money that we <lb/>
are receiving, and which bulks so large, <lb/>
comparatively as current expenditure,
<lb/>
has to be provided a great deal of what <lb/>
would ordinarily be considered capital ex<lb break="no"/>penditure. Surely it was reasonable on <lb/>
our part to say that, considering the sub<lb break="no"/>sidies given to the provinces, considering <lb/>
that these subsidies are based on population <lb/>
very largely, considering the needs of that <lb/>
great western country in the immediate <lb/>
future, considering further that our popu<lb break="no"/>lation was increasing so rapidly and <lb/>
that, with the increase of population, <lb/>
we could claim continually more fav<lb break="no"/>ourable financial terms, we had everything <lb/>
to gain by waiting for provincial autonomy <lb/>
and nothing to lose. I will not trouble the <lb/>
House to evidence that fact by comparing <lb/>
the terms demanded by the Northwest gov<lb break="no"/>ernment itself in 1901 and again in 1903. <lb/>
Because this government did not grant to <lb/>
the Northwest Territories the autonomy <lb/>
that was asked for in 1901, in the space of <lb/>
fourteen months they had made something <lb/>
like a quarter of a million dollars a year. I <lb/>
thought if we could, by waiting a matter of <lb/>
fourteen months, increase our annual <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
 
 revenue by a quarter of a million
dollars, <lb/>
we could not make money as quickly in any <lb/>
other way than by waiting a few years <lb/>
longer for provincial autonomy. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LALO2">Mr. LALOR</persName>.
Why did you not continue <lb/>
to wait a little longer ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr. Lalor) <lb/>
asks me why we did not continue to wait <lb/>
a little longer. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LALO2">Mr. LALOR</persName>. You are making money so <lb/>
fast, it is a wonder you did not wait a little <lb/>
longer. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. As far as I am concerned, <lb/>
and as far as the majority of the people <lb/>
in the Northwest Territories are concerned. <lb/>
they are prepared to continue to wait for <lb/>
provincial autonomy on those conditions. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:ARMS1">Mr. ARMSTRONG</persName>. As long as it pays ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. As long as it pays. The <lb/>
demand for provincial autonomy does not <lb/>
come from the people of the Northwest. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYC1">Mr. BOYCE</persName>. Does it not come from the <lb/>
government of the Territories ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. I believe the government <lb/>
of the Territories has made certain demands <lb/>
for provincial autonomy. I have shown the <lb/>
House how wise these demands were by <lb/>
comparing the demand of one year with the <lb/>
demand of the succeeding year. I am not <lb/>
responsible for what the
government of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories have done. I repre<lb break="no"/>sent a section of the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, and I say that the people <lb/>
of the Northwest Territories have never <lb/>
asked for provincial autonomy. However, <lb/>
if it seems good to the parliament of Canada <lb/>
and to the government of this Dominion to <lb/>
organize these Territories into provinces and <lb/>
to give them fair and reasonable financial <lb/>
consideration, certainly we are not the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to refuse that consideration or to refuse <lb/>
those reasonable financial terms. We be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the terms which have been offer<lb break="no"/>ed, and which are contained in the Autonomy <lb/>
Bills, are fair and reasonable financial <lb/>
terms, are such as we can
conscientiously <lb/>
afford to accept, and such as will be a bene<lb break="no"/>fit to the people of those Territories, and <lb/>
will tend to the improvement of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. We would be doing less than our duty ; <lb/>
we would be poor friends of our Dominion, <lb/>
if we willingly accepted anything short of <lb/>
a liberal allowance for provincial purposes <lb/>
in these Territories. As the ex-Minister of <lb/>
the Interior has said, it is on the develop<lb break="no"/>ment of these Territories that the prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty of this whole Dominion depends. He <lb/>
would be the worst friend the Dominion had, <lb/>
who would prevent the progress of civiliza<lb break="no"/>tion in these provinces by stinting the means <lb/>
whereby that can be obtained. I shall not <lb/>
go into a comparison with the subsidies <lb/>
which are given the other provinces, ex<lb break="no"/>cept to repeat that the conditions in the <lb/>
Territories are so different from those in the <lb/>
other provinces—such a small population <lb/>
 occupying such a vast area of
agricultural <lb/>

 country, which soon must be full of
people, <lb/>
and which will require large expenditure— <lb/>
that the terms which have been accorded <lb/>
the other provinces would not be satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory or suitable terms for these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of the Northwest. The conditions <lb/>
are different; the terms must" be differ<lb break="no"/>ent; the terms are different, and in so far <lb/>
the terms are satisfactory. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> As to the ownership of the lands; it has <lb/>
been urged that these lands are the property <lb/>
of the province, should remain the property <lb/>
ofthe province and should be administered <lb/>
by the province for the benefit of the re<lb break="no"/>venue of the province. It matters not to <lb/>
me what the legal rights of the province <lb/>
or the Dominion respectively are in that <lb/>
case. The lands belong to Canada
whe<lb break="no"/>ther administered by the
province or by <lb/>
the Dominion; the settlement of these
lands <lb/>
is for the benefit of all Canada. Whatever <lb/>
method of administration will give us the <lb/>
best results in the way of the settlement <lb/>
of these lands is the policy that is best not <lb/>
only for the Dominion but for the province. <lb/>
As a representative of the west, I believe <lb/>
the idea of using the lands of the west <lb/>
as a source of provincial revenue would be <lb/>
a very great detriment to these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and to the country at large. I am <lb/>
aware that the provinces must have re<lb break="no"/>.venue, and failing any other source I would <lb/>
say: Certainly we must have revenue from <lb/>
the lands. But if we can get adequate <lb/>
revenue from other sources than the lands, <lb/>
then we certainly do not want the lands <lb/>
used as a source of revenue. I can easily <lb/>
understand that with a change of policy <lb/>
on the part of the federal government, a <lb/>
change of policy back to What it was say <lb/>
twenty years ago, when it was believed to <lb/>
be the proper policy to take everything that
<lb/>
could be taken out of the land in the way <lb/>
of cash payment; then possibly it would <lb/>
be better that the lands should be in the <lb/>
hands of the province rather than in the <lb/>
hands of the Dominion. But, so long as <lb/>
we have a land policy the basic idea of <lb/>
which is the land for the settler, it is cer<lb break="no"/>tainly better for us and for the Dominion <lb/>
that the lands should be administered by <lb/>
the federal authorities. One hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said, that the lands could be better <lb/>
administered by the province than by the <lb/>
Dominion because the people of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince were closer on the ground and the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the province he'said, were just <lb/>
the same as the interests of the Dominion. <lb/>
I beg to differ; their interests
are not the <lb/>
same. The interest of a province in the <lb/>
land is in the revenue it can derive from the <lb/>
sale of the lands; the interest of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion in the lands is in the revenue that <lb/>
it can derive from the settler who makes <lb/>
that land productive. This Dominion of <lb/>
    Canada can make millions out of the lands
<lb/>
   of the Northwest. and never sell an acre;
<lb/>
    it has made millions out of these lands <lb/>


            <cb/>
        
without selling an acre. The increase in <lb/>
our customs returns, the increase in our <lb/>
trade and commerce, the increase in our <lb/>
manufactures is to a very large extent due <lb/>
to the increase in settlement on the free <lb/>
lands of the Northwest Territories. The <lb/>
prosperity this Dominion is enjoying to-day <lb/>
is to a very large extent due to the fact <lb/>
that the lands of the Northwest Territories <lb/>
have been given away and that people have <lb/>
taken them. I say that the interest of the <lb/>
Dominion is to secure the settlement of the <lb/>
lands, and whether with a price or without <lb/>
a price makes little or no difference. It <lb/>
is worth the while of the Dominion to spend <lb/>
hundreds of thousands of dollars in pro<lb break="no"/>moting immigration to that country and to <lb/>
spend thousands and thousands of dollars <lb/>
in surveying and administering these lands, <lb/>
and then to give them away. But the <lb/>
province is not in that position. The pro<lb break="no"/>vince derives no revenue from the customs <lb/>
duties or from the wealth which the settler <lb/>
creates. Every settler who goes on land <lb/>
in the Northwest Territories is a bill of <lb/>
expense to the provincial
government. <lb/>
That settler requires a road made, he re<lb break="no"/>quires a school supported, he requires the <lb/>
advantages of municipal organization, and <lb/>
these have to be provided for him out of <lb/>
the funds of the provincial government, so <lb/>
that asa matter of fact the tendency of the <lb/>
provincial government is to get such <lb/>
money as it can out of the land and to pre<lb break="no"/>vent settlement from spreading any further <lb/>
than can be helped. On the other hand, <lb/>
the interest of the Dominion is to get the <lb/>
settlers on the land, to scatter them far and <lb/>
wide so long as they are good settlers <lb/>
and they get good land. That is the posi<lb break="no"/>tion as it strikes us in the Northwest, and <lb/>
when we have secured a financial arrange<lb break="no"/>ment with the Dominion government that <lb/>
gives us adequate consideration for our <lb/>
lands—I mean to say, gives us an
adequate <lb/>
revenue as compared with the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces at any rate; gives us a revenue that <lb/>
instead of decreasing will increase as our <lb/>
needs increase; gives us a revenue that is <lb/>
proportionate not only to our population as <lb/>
it will be but to the area over which that <lb/>
population will spread—when we have secur<lb break="no"/>ed an arrangement such as that, we have <lb/>
secured a very satisfactory arrangement; <lb/>
at least as satisfactory as we can expect <lb/>
to secure. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> As to the amount we get out of our lands,
<lb/>
a word on that point may not be out of <lb/>
place. The province of British Columbia <lb/>
owns all its natural resources; it has tim<lb break="no"/>ber, it has gold mines and lead mines and <lb/>
coal mines. And I find that last year the <lb/>
 province of British Columbia derived from <lb/>
all the resources connected with the
owner<lb break="no"/>ship of its lands, the sum of $615,000. In <lb/>
the coming year, the country which is now <lb/>
the Northwest Territories Will
derive a sum <lb/>
of something like $750,000, based on the <lb/>
     


            <pb n="3159"

     calculation that has been made in regard 
     <lb/>to the land. I find that the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario with a population of two and a 
     <lb/>
     quarter millions in the year 1902, derived 
     <lb/>
     from its lands $1,499,000.
            </p>

<p>
     We find, by the arrangement that has been 
     <lb/>
     made with these Northwest provinces, that 
     <lb/>
     when their population reaches that of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario, they will be deriving 
     <lb/>
     two and a quarter millions in respect of 
     <lb/>
     their lands. I have given the total amounts 
     <lb/>
     which the provinces referred to derive from 
     <lb/>
     their lands as they are to-day. I have 
     <lb/>

     deducted nothing for the expense of manage<lb break="no"/>ment, and I have not said, what is the 
     <lb/>
     fact, that these provinces are drawing from 
     <lb/>
     their capital account while the Territories 
     <lb/>
     are taking only their annual revenue. That 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, selling their lands, dispos<lb break="no"/>ing of their natural resources, as they do to<lb break="no"/>day, and using the proceeds as their an<lb break="no"/>nual revenue, must find that revenue de<lb break="no"/>creasing from year to year, while we, with 
     <lb/>
     not a cent deducted for expense of manage<lb break="no"/>ment or for any other purpose, find our 
     <lb/>
     revenue increasing from period to period 
     <lb/>
     according to the increase of population, 
     <lb/>
     until we reach a very fair maximum amount 
     <lb/>
     and when that is reached, there will be 
     <lb/>
     people settled all over these provinces, and 
     <lb/>
     they will have the means of revenue from 
     <lb/>
     taxation which exist in the older provinces. 
     <lb/>

     Our position will be similar, and we shall 
     <lb/>
  
     be able to carry on business as they do. 
     <lb/>
     Under these circumstances the objections 
     <lb/>
     which I entertained to provincial autonomy, 
     <lb/>
     and which were shared by a large majority 
     <lb/>
     of the people of the Territories, have been 
     <lb/>
     overcome by the financial terms offered 
     <lb/>
     to these provinces in the Autonomy Bill. 
     <lb/>
     We are just as ready to take upon our<lb break="no"/>selves all the rights and responsibilities of 
     <lb/>
     self—government as the people of any other 
     <lb/>
     part of this Dominion, but we want the 
     <lb/>
     means wherewith to discharge those respon<lb break="no"/>sibilities before we assume them. We are 
     <lb/>
     not going into any blind pool—the term 
     <lb/>
     seems objectionable to the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position. We are giving our sanction to a 
     <lb/>
     definite bargain, laid down in dollars and 
     <lb/>
     cents, in regard to which there can be no 
     <lb/>
     equivocation or misunderstanding. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In regard to the educational clauses of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill, I do not know whether I dare ven<lb break="no"/>ture on a subject which has been so thor<lb break="no"/>oughly threshed out by so many legal gentle<lb break="no"/>men in this House already. But at the same 
     <lb/>
     time the laws are not all made by the 
     <lb/>
     lawyers, and they are not all administered 
     <lb/>
     upon the lawyers. It is the people at large 
     <lb/>
     who sufler from the laws, and it is not any 
     <lb/>
     harm for one of the ordinary citizens of the 
     <lb/>
     country to attempt to understand them. 
     <lb/>
     Now, on this point I differ very radically 
     <lb/>
     from some of my friends. I am not a sup<lb break="no"/>porter of separate schools because I like 
     <lb/>
     the principle of separate schools. I do not 
     <lb/>
     agree with everything that was said by 
     <lb/>

<cb/>

     our hon. friend the member for Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier (Mr. Monk) last night said so ably 
     <lb/>
     and so well. I am one of those who pin 
     <lb/>
     their faith unreservedly to a system of na<lb break="no"/>tional schools, established for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     educating the people of the country, of im<lb break="no"/>parting to them knowledge in secular sub<lb break="no"/>jects. I am one of those who believe that 
     <lb/>
     religion can best be taught by those Whose 
     <lb/>
     special training is the teaching of religion, 
     <lb/>
     that geography can be better taught by 
     <lb/>
     those whose special training is for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of teaching geography. If I under<lb break="no"/>stood the law as some of our friends under<lb break="no"/>stand it, I certainly would vote against 
     <lb/>
     the educational provisions of this Bill. But 
     <lb/>
     I do not understand the law that way, and 
     <lb/>
     I am at a loss to see how they can under<lb break="no"/>stand it that way". We have been bombarded 
     <lb/>
     here for some time with petitions in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this educational question; we have 
     <lb/>
     seen staring headlines in the papers ; there 
     <lb/>
     have been indignation meetings held in 
     <lb/>
     some parts of the country; there has been 
     <lb/>
     trouble, large, long and loud, all around; 
     <lb/>
     and what has it all been about? I noticed 
     <lb/>
     a heading in a newspaper the other day, a 
     <lb/>
     great large heading—I think it has been in 
     <lb/>
     several issues of the paper. It read: 'A 
     <lb/>
     Free West. a Common School, Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Rights, Religious Equality.' I hear some 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen laugh sarcastically. I want to 
     <lb/>
     to say that I subscribe thoroughly to the 
     <lb/>
     sentiments expressed in that headline. I 
     <lb/>
     read further: 'Toronto Vigorously Pro<lb break="no"/>tests Against Throttling the West.' Well, 
     <lb/>
     I would like to be understood as protesting 
     <lb/>
     against any attempt to throttle the west. 
     <lb/>
     'Meeting emphatically protests against the 
     <lb/>
     enactment of section 16 or any other pro<lb break="no"/>,visions inconsistent with their constitutional 
     <lb/>
     freedom in this regard.' And the mass 
     <lb/>
     meeting in Massey Hall demanded that the 
     <lb/>
     government, first should abandon the clauses. 
     <lb/>
     second, should appeal to the country, or 
     <lb/>
     third, should defer action—it must do one 
     <lb/>
     or other of these three things. I read in

     suggestion made to this House, that separate

     <lb/>
     know what they say ? Is this a demonstra<lb break="no"/>tion of objection to separate schools or is

     it an attempt to wreck the Liberal govern<lb break="no"/>ment on a second school question ? If this 
     <lb/>
     attack is honest, if it is against the sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools and not against the French

     premier, it is in order for the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) and the gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen behind him to introduce a Bill into 
     <lb/>
     this parliament as they yet may do to abo<lb break="no"/>lish separate schools in the Northwest by

     I am against separate schools but I want

     separate schools have been authorized in

     the Northwest Territories by Act of this

     parliament for 30 years at least and they 
     <lb/>
     have been in actual existence in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories for 20 years by Act or or<lb break="no"/>dinance of the Northwest legislature. There 
     <lb/>
     has been no word of protest in parliament 
     <lb/>
     or out of parliament, there has been no

     out without any such incubus upon their

     That is to say, in the Bill proposed by the

     these Territories into confederation, are these 
     <lb/>
     very provisions which are contained in the

     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule) it was that if the date

     This does not say that any provincial law 
     <lb/>
     may exist at the union. It does not allude 
     <lb/>
     in any degree—it carefully refrains from 
     <lb/>
     alluding—to the collective powers which 
     <lb/>
     may be exercised by legislation. It refers 
     <lb/>
     to the individual rights of any class of per<lb break="no"/>sons at the union, and defines the rights of 
     <lb/>
     those people when they come into the union. 
     <lb/>
     That is the purpose of the Act—not the de<lb break="no"/>fining of anything about what they were 
     <lb/>
     before they came into the union. On the 
     <lb/>
     face of it it has no reference what<lb break="no"/>ever to whether a province was organ<lb break="no"/>ized before or not. If there was a 
     <lb/>
     class of persons who had rights at the 
     <lb/>
     union, when they came into the union 
     <lb/>
     they should continue to have those rights— 
     <lb/>
     that is the whole intent and meaning of the 
     <lb/>
     section ; there is no other explanation. 
     <lb/>
     That is as Mr. Haultain understood it ; that 
     <lb/>
     is as any man, I think, must understand it 
     <lb/>
     if he reads it with due care. That being the 
     <lb/>
     case, the British North America Act being 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of this country, I say that, 
     <lb/>
     although I am no lover of separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     although I do not believe in separate schools 
     <lb/>
     as so many of our people do, this govern<lb break="no"/>ment would certainly be doing very much 
     <lb/>
     less than its duty if it undertook, under all 
     <lb/>
     the circumstances of the case especially , to 
     <lb/>
     deviate from the terms of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act or took any other course than 
     <lb/>
     loyally to carry out its provisions. In regard 
     <lb/>
     to the terms of the first clause 16 and the 
     <lb/>
     second clause 16, I will take the liberty of 
     <lb/>
     saying that for my own part, I would rather 
     <lb/>
     not have seen any clause 16 at all. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that according to the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, the separate schools of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories would have exactly the same pro<lb break="no"/>tection that they have under the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of clause 16. I know that all my friends do 
     <lb/>
     not agree with me in that view. I take it 
     <lb/>
     that clause 16 is merely a declaration on the 
     <lb/>
     part of parliament of meaning and intent ; 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of clause 16 are declaratory 
     <lb/>
     and not mandatory. I say that I would 
     <lb/>
     prefer that there would not be any clause 
     <lb/>
     16, that there should not be any declaration 
     <lb/>
     of the meaning and intent of these pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     I say that as a Protestant living in a coun<lb break="no"/>try where the large majority are Protes<lb break="no"/>tants, and as one who does not believe in 
     <lb/>
     separate schools ; living where the majority 
     <lb/>
     do not believe in separate schools. I take 
     <lb/>
     the view that, situated as we are we are in 
     <lb/>
     a sufficiently strong position to maintain our 
     <lb/>
     views without any declaration as to the ex<lb break="no"/>tent to which the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act goes. But I am bound to say that there 
     <lb/>
     are other gentlemen who do not take that 
     <lb/>
     view ; and I am bound to say also that they 
     <lb/>
     have some fairly good reasons for the view 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     
     they take. I think it is a fairly arguable 
     <lb/>
     question. I presume the reason they take 
     <lb/>
    the contrary view is this : That if the terms 
     <lb/>of the British North America Act are con<lb break="no"/>travened in this particular ; the remedy 
     <lb/>lies with parliament. You come back to 
     <lb/>this parliament for your remedy. And so 
     <lb/>they say. If parliament in the last resort 
     <lb/>has to declare what these provisions mean, 
     <lb/>it is very much better to declare them at 
     <lb/>first and avoid any question or misunder<lb break="no"/>standing in the first place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     On second thought I am somewhat in<lb break="no"/>clined to take that view myself, because, 
     <lb/>
     while we have a very large Protestant ma<lb break="no"/>jority in the Dominion of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     while this House seems to be rather strong<lb break="no"/>ly against the idea of separate schools, that 
     <lb/>
     condition has not always prevailed. We 
     <lb/>
     recall a time not so very long ago when 
     <lb/>
     an occasion such as might happen in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories actually did happen 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the province of Manitoba, and 
     <lb/>
     an appeal was made to parliament, and at<lb break="no"/>tempt was made to interpret the provision 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act by parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. And when we consider the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of that Remedial Bill as proposed 
     <lb/>
     to be applied to the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     when we consider that such conditions 
     <lb/>
     might possibly arise in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, those of us who do not like 
     <lb/>
     the idea of separate schools, and par<lb break="no"/>ticularly who do not like the idea of clerical 
     <lb/>
     control of schools, may very well say that 
     <lb/>
     we would rather have a declaration from 
     <lb/>
     this parliament at this time as to what the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act means, than 
     <lb/>
     trust to some future time when some other 
     <lb/>
     government might be in power who would 
     <lb/>
     be more ready to sell the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west for clerical support at 
     <lb/>
     the polls. We heard something to-day 
     <lb/>
     spoken in tones almost of horror as to the 
     <lb/>
     control which the advisory board had in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, because it had two 
     <lb/>
     Catholics on it.

     <lb/>
     in Manitoba, they did not stop at that.

     We do not want any legislation of that 
     <lb/>
     kind in the Northwest Territories, or for the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. Now I want to make myself 
     <lb/>
     clear, for I believe I speak for many people 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest on this subject. We ob<lb break="no"/>ject to separate schools, not on religious 
     <lb/>
     grounds at all, but merely on the grounds 
     <lb/>
     of efficiency and economy. But we can see 
     <lb/>
     that in the Northwest, under present con<lb break="no"/>ditions, separate schools conducted as they 
     <lb/>
     are to-day, do not seriously affect either 
     <lb/>
     efficiency or economy. Therefore we do 
     <lb/>
     not seriously object to these schools as they 
     <lb/>
     are to-day. But what we do object to, 
     <lb/>
     what we did object to in 1891, was the fea<lb break="no"/>ture embodied in this Remedial Bill, thor<lb break="no"/>oughly embodied in it, and that was the 
     <lb/>
     principle of absolute clerical control of 
     <lb/>
     schools. That is What we do not want. 
     <lb/>
     that is what we would not submit to. We 
     <lb/>
     had that clerical control of schools from 
     <lb/>
     1884 to 1891, and as the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior has said to-day with regard to 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba. that system was abused. It may 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
         

     be a good system in theory, it may be a 
     <lb/>
     good system in practice, in some cases, but 
     <lb/>
     we did not find it so. I was a member of 
     <lb/>
     the legislature which changed the conditions 
     <lb/>
     of the school law of the Northwest and 
     <lb/>
     made the schools strictly national. We 
     <lb/>
     have separate schools in the Northwest, 
     <lb/>
     but we have not a separate school system 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest. We concede, and I am 
     <lb/>
     glad to say that we willingly concede, to 
     <lb/>
     our Roman Catholic fellow citizens the 
     <lb/>
     right to pay their own taxes to their own 
     <lb/>
     schools, to elect their own trustees, to hire 
     <lb/>
     teachers of their own faith, and to give re<lb break="no"/>ligious instruction for one-half hour each 
     <lb/>
     day in their schools. I believe that is a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable provision, and while I cannot 
     <lb/>
     say that I approve of it, still I do approve 
     <lb/>
     of it to this extent, that it satisfies the re<lb break="no"/>ligious convictions of a large and impor<lb break="no"/>tant part of the population, whose religious 
     <lb/>
     convictions are entitled to the most careful 
     <lb/>
     and fullest consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So far I am prepared to go and justify my<lb break="no"/>self here or anywhere else. Beyond that 
     <lb/>
     point, to hand our schools, or any section of 
     <lb/>
     our schools, over to the control of a body not 
     <lb/>
     directly responsible to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country through their votes, I certainly do 
     <lb/>
     not approve of and the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories would not approve of. We 
     <lb/>
     have an efficient school system in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, a very efficient school sys<lb break="no"/>tem.  It is a national school system, essenti<lb break="no"/>ally national, and because it is national we 
     <lb/>
     approve of it. There is no occasion, there 
     <lb/>
     has been no occasion and there has been no 
     <lb/>
     justification in any way , shape or manner 
     <lb/>
     for the attacks that have been made upon 
     <lb/>
     this subject of separate schools as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of party politics within the last two or three 
     <lb/>
     weeks in this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be a matter of information to the 
     <lb/>
     members of this House to say that while the 
     <lb/>
     returns show only ten or fifteen separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the Territories, there are, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, upwards of a hundred Catholic schools. 
     <lb/>
     Wherever the Catholic people are in the ma<lb break="no"/>jority, they elect their own trustees, form 
     <lb/>
     their own school district, hire their own teach<lb break="no"/>ers and direct what form of religion shall be 
     <lb/>
     taught in the half hour allotted to religion. 
     <lb/>
     These are public schools; they are not sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools, and yet they are Catholic 
     <lb/>
     schools. So, I say that in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories we have the Catholics sharing in 
     <lb/>
     the public school system just the same 
     <lb/>
     whether they are separated from the origin<lb break="no"/>al districts or whether they form the original 
     <lb/>
     district; we have a national school system 
     <lb/>
     and it is not throttling the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and it is not doing an injustice or an 
     <lb/>
     injury to the Northwest Territories to pro<lb break="no"/>vide for a continuation of that system, espe<lb break="no"/>cially if by so doing you provide against the 
     <lb/>
     possibility of such a condition as was at<lb break="no"/>tempted to be thrust upon the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba not many years ago. 
     <lb/>

     Bill I do not think anything need be said. 
     <lb/>
     We have received in the past at the hands 
     <lb/>
     of this government very fair consideration. 
     <lb/>
     We have received representation in this 
     <lb/>
     House and in the upper chamber. We have 
     <lb/>
     received reasonable financial consideration, 
     <lb/>
     increasing as our needs increased, although 
     <lb/>
     possibly not fully up to the mark of our re<lb break="no"/>quirements. And now, that it has seemed 
     <lb/>
     good to the government of the day and to, I 
     <lb/>
     think, the large majority of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the country to erect these Territories into 
     <lb/>
     provinces, it is certainly something of which 
     <lb/>
     we may very well be proud that we enter 
     <lb/>
     confederation upon such favourable terms. 
     <lb/>
     We only regret that this particular subject 
     <lb/>
     should have been the occasion of such a 
     <lb/>
     great amount of what I may be justified in 
     <lb/>
     calling malicious misrepresentation for the 
     <lb/>
    purpose of making party capital. We had 
     <lb/>hoped that our entrance into confederation 
     <lb/>as full fledged provinces would be under 
     <lb/>altogether auspicious circumstances. With 
     <lb/>this exception they are altogether auspici<lb break="no"/>ous and perhaps when we have threshed out<lb/>this question in parliament we will all<lb/>understand each other better, we will all<lb/>know where we severally stand on this im<lb break="no"/>portant question and perhaps it will be the<lb/>last we will hear in Canada of this much<lb/>vexed school question.<lb/>

     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN (South York). Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Chairman, I wish to read a resolution in re<lb break="no"/>gard to this Ottawa Electric Bill which was 
     <lb/>
     passed by the municipal council of the city 
     <lb/>
     of Toronto. I have received the following 
     <lb/>
     letter : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     City Clerk's Office, Toronto, Feb. 14, 1905. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>Dear Sir,—I have the honour by direction of 
     <lb/>his worship the mayor to forward herewith a 
     <lb/>copy of a resolution which was adopted by the 
     <lb/>city council at its meeting held on the 13th in<lb break="no"/>stant, as follows :<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     
     Whereas, the city of Ottawa entered into cer<lb break="no"/>tain agreements with the Metropolitan Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company of Ottawa, Limited, and with the 
     <lb/>
     Consumers Electric Company, Limited, respec<lb break="no"/>tively, in which it was provided that the said 
     <lb/>
        companies should not at any time during a 
     <lb/>         period provided in the said agreement, amalga<lb break="no"/>mate or combine with any other company or<lb/>companies carrying on or which might there<lb break="no"/>after carry on in the said city of Ottawa a<lb/>business for supplying electricity for the pur<lb/>pose of supplying power, light or heat, nor<lb/>should the said company of companies enter<lb/>into any contract, agreement of arrangement<lb/>with any other such company for such purpose<lb/>or that should have such effect, nor should the<lb/>said companies enter into any contract, agree<lb break="no"/>ment or arrangement with any such other com<lb break="no"/>pany for the purpose, or that might have the<lb/>effect of creating a monopoly for the business<lb/>of supplying electricity for the purposes afore<lb break="no"/>said without the permission of the council of<lb/>the corporation of the city of Ottawa to the ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by by-law ;<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas, the Ottawa Electric Company<lb/>are by Bill No. 12 seeking legislation at the <lb/>present session of the Dominion parliament at<lb/>Ottawa which will enable them to purchase the<lb/>stock of the said Metropolitanand the said<lb/>Consumers Companies and this become the <lb/>owners thereof, and, by so doing, avoid the<lb/>said agreements ;<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas, it is desirable that the agree<lb break="no"/>ments, interests and vested rights of munici<lb break="no"/>palities should be respected and preserved, and<lb/>the passing of the proposed legislation will, in<lb/>the opinion of this council, vitally affect the<lb/>vested rights and interest of the city of Otta<lb break="no"/>wa and destroy the purposes of the said agree<lb break="no"/>ments ;<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Be it resolved, that this council does most re<lb break="no"/>spectfully petition the parliament of Canada to<lb/>resist and prevent the passage of the said<lb/>legislation, and does most respectfully request<lb/>the members of the city of Toronto to oppose<lb/>it.<lb/>
            </p>
