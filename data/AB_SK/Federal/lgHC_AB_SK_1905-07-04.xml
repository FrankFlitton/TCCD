     two hundred thousand dollars, subject to be in<lb break="no"/>creased as hereinafter mentioned, that is to say: 
     <lb/>
     a census of the said province shall be taken in 
     <lb/>
     every fifth year reckoning fro-m the general 
     <lb/>
     census of one thousand nine hundred and one, 
     <lb/>
     and an approximate estimate of the population 
     <lb/>
     shall be made at equal intervals of time be<lb break="no"/>tween each quinquennial and decennial census ; 
     <lb/>
     and whenever the population, by any such cen— 
     <lb/>
     sus or estimate, exceeds two hundred and fifty 
     <lb/>
     thousand, which shall be the minimum on which 
     <lb/>
     the said allowance shall be calculated, the 
     <lb/>
     amount of the said allowance shall 'be increased 
     <lb/>
     accordingly and so on until the population has

     reached eight hundred thousand souls,

            </p>

            <p>
     2. Resolved, That inasmuch as the said pro<lb break="no"/>vince is not in debt, it shall be entitled to be 
     <lb/>
     paid and to receive from the government of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, by half-yearly payments in advance, in<lb break="no"/>terest at the rate of five per cent per annum on

     the sum of eight million one hundred and seven

     thousand five hundred dollars. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. Resolved, That inasmuch as the public lands 
     <lb/>
     in the said province are to remain the property 
     <lb/>
     ot' Canada, there shall be paid by Canada to 
     <lb/>
     the said province annually by way of compen<lb break="no"/>sation therefor a sum based upon the estimated 
     <lb/>
     value of such Ilands, namely, $37,500,000 the said 
     <lb/>
     lauds being assumed to be of an area of 25,000,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     000 acres and to be of the value of $1.50 per 
     <lb/>
     acre, and upon the population of the said pro<lb break="no"/>vince as from time to time ascentained by the 
     <lb/>
     quinquennial census thereof, such sum to be 
     <lb/>
     arrived at as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The population of the said province being as<lb break="no"/>sumed to be at present 250,000, the sum payable 
     <lb/>
     until such population reaches 400 000 is to be 
     <lb/>
     one per cent on such estimated value, or $375,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     000 ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Thereafter, until such population reaches<lb/>800,000, the sum payable is to be one and one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     half per cent on such estimated value, or $562,- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     500 : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thereafter, until such population reaches 
     <lb/>
     1,200,000, the sum payable is to be two per cent 
     <lb/>
     on such estimated value or $750,000 ; 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And thereafter such payment is to be three 
     <lb/>
     per cent on such estimated value, or $1,125,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     4. Resolved That as additional compensation 
     <lb/>
     for such lands there shall be paid by Canada to 
     <lb/>
     the said province annually for five years to pro<lb break="no"/>vide for the construction of necessary public 
     <lb/>
     buildings, one-quanter of one per cent on such 
     <lb/>
     estimated value, or $93,750.

     Hon. W. S. FIELD'IlNG (Minister of Fin- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     once). As we are treating these two Auton<lb break="no"/>omy Bills as one all through, I would sug<lb break="no"/>gest that instead of taking up these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions seriatim, we agree that they shall be 
     <lb/>
     amended to correspond to the similar reso<lb break="no"/>lutions in the Alberta Bill, leaving it to the 
     <lb/>
     clerk to make the necessary changes for 
     <lb/>
     that purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. BERGERO'N. Are they word for 
     <lb/>
     word the same clauses? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. F'IElIlDIlNG. The resolutions were 
     <lb/>
     originally introduced in the same form. In 
     <lb/>
     the case of the Alberta Bill some amend<lb break="no"/>ments have been made. My proposal is that 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     the amendments made in the Alberta resolu. 
     <lb/>
     tions and in the Bill founded thereon be 
     <lb/>
     made also in these resolutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     \Mr. R. L. BURDEN. As I understand, the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions are the same as in the Alberta 
     <lb/>
     Bill? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. FIELDING. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. And the amendments 
     <lb/>
     necessary are the same word for word as 
     <lb/>
     those in connection'with the Alberta Bill? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FIEDDING. Precisely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     lMr. R. L. BORDEN. To keep the records 
     <lb/>
     right I suppose it will appear in the journals 
     <lb/>
     that the Minister of Finance made the neces— 
     <lb/>
     sary motions or amendments? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. FIELDING. Quite so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I am willing to 
     <lb/>
     agree to the Finance Minister's proposal ior 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of saving time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. URI'AH WILSON. I do not know 
     <lb/>
     Whether the amendments as they were finally 
     <lb/>
     in the Alberta Bill were all made in one 
     <lb/>
     day or not. The object is to conform this 
     <lb/>
     Bill word for word with the Alberta Bill? 
     <lb/>
     I would like to know on what day or days 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     the amendments in the Alberta Bill were 
     <lb/>
     made ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. FIELDING. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     (Mr. Uriah Wilson) will find these amend<lb break="no"/>ments on page 542 of the 'Votes and Pro- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ceedings.'

     Resolutions as amended reported, read the 
     <lb/>
     first and second times and agreed to.

     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. When the Alberta Bill was 
     <lb/>
     before this House the statement was fre<lb break="no"/>quently made that the desire to make Cal<lb break="no"/>gary a capital was at the bottom of a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of the opposition which had been rais<lb break="no"/>ed by members on this side of the House to 
     <lb/>
     the schedules as they were presented. Oc<lb break="no"/>casion was taken several times by members 
     <lb/>
     on this side to repudiate that statement. I 
     <lb/>
     certainly did so for my part and others did 
     <lb/>
     the same. We objected to the proposed dis<lb break="no"/>tribution on the ground that it was a most 
     <lb/>
     unfair distribution of representation. In 
     <lb/>
     the present Bill there is no question about 
     <lb/>
     the capital; there is no doubt as to the 
     <lb/>
     proposition that Regina should be selected 
     <lb/>
     for the first meeting of the new legislative 
     <lb/>
     assembly, but an examination of the sched<lb break="no"/>ules as attached to this Bill shows that there 
     <lb/>
     is apparently a deliberate intention on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the government to deprive the older 
     <lb/>
     settlers in the new province of their fair 
     <lb/>
     and legitimate share in the representation 
     <lb/>
     of that country. Under the schedule those 
     <lb/>
     older settlers who have mainly made that 
     <lb/>
     country what it is, who have borne the bur<lb break="no"/>then and heat of the day, who have legis<lb break="no"/>lated in the past for that country and suc<lb break="no"/>cessfully legislated, are to be deprived of an 
     <lb/>
     equitable voice in what the future of that 
     <lb/>
     country shall be, now that it is made into 
     <lb/>
     a province. 1 say there ought to be no mis<lb break="no"/>take whatever as to What we are contending 
     <lb/>
     for in this matter. We simply ask that 
     <lb/>
     every vote in that new country shall have 
     <lb/>
     an equal value, that the vote of the old- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     timer shall have a value equal to that of 
     <lb/>
     the new comer to the country. We ask no 
     <lb/>
     more and no less. We  ask simply for equit<lb break="no"/>able treatment to all. Taking a general aver<lb break="no"/>

            <fw type="num">8706</fw>
        

     age we find that with the distribution pro<lb break="no"/>posed, the vote of the new—comer shall be 
     <lb/>
     equivalent in value to the votes of two of 
     <lb/>
     the older settlers in that country. That is 
     <lb/>
     the general effect of the proposed distribu<lb break="no"/>tion. We desire that the principle of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation according to population should be 
     <lb/>
     adhered to, and this distribution does not 
     <lb/>
     adhere to it. In the old legislative assembly, 
     <lb/>
     in so far as concerns the present proposed 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan, there were two 
     <lb/>
     distinct legal divisions, there was the pro<lb break="no"/>visional district of Saskatchewan in the 
     <lb/>
     north and that of Assinibola in the south. 
     <lb/>
     Those two divisions have been recognized 
     <lb/>
     in all distributions of representation from 
     <lb/>
     the beginning up to the present time and 
     <lb/>
     we find that to a certain extent they have 
     <lb/>
     been recognized in the schedules which have 
     <lb/>
     been placed before us. All the seats with 
     <lb/>
     the exception of three are completely in 
     <lb/>
     either the northern district or the southern 
     <lb/>
     district. In three cases the seats, while 
     <lb/>
     properly belonging to the north, have been 
     <lb/>
     run into the south and take in a consid<lb break="no"/>erable slice of the southern districts. I 
     <lb/>
     intend to show that it is proposed to give 
     <lb/>
     a far larger representation to the northern 
     <lb/>
     parts of the province than it is entitled to, 
     <lb/>
     and a far smaller share of representation 
     <lb/>
     to the southern part of the province than 
     <lb/>
     it is entitled to. For that purpose I will 
     <lb/>
     take the old division as between the provis<lb break="no"/>ional district of Saskatchewan, which I 
     <lb/>
     shall call the northern portion, and of Assin<lb break="no"/>iboia, which I shall call the southern portion. 
     <lb/>
     This Bill, roughly speaking, gives nine seats 
     <lb/>
     to the north and sixteen seats to the south. 
     <lb/>
     The original schedules which were laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the House gave ten seats to the north 
     <lb/>
     and fifteen to the south. I did not catch 
     <lb/>
     what the right hon. Prime Minister moved 
     <lb/>
     when these schedules were brought up, but 
     <lb/>
     I understand he moved the amended sched<lb break="no"/>ules as laid on the table of the House a few 
     <lb/>
     days ago : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I moved the 
     <lb/>
     original schedule, not the amended schedule, 
     <lb/>
     but of course, my hon. friend (Mr. Lake) 
     <lb/>
     has notice of the amendment which it is pro<lb break="no"/>posed to introduce and which modifies to 
     <lb/>
     some extent his argument. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. May I ask the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister if it is his intention to move 
     <lb/>
     the amended schedule ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I think, therefore, that I 
     <lb/>
     might as well base my argument on the 
     <lb/>
     amended schedule. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The original schedule, of 
     <lb/>
     course, shows far more in favour of the 
     <lb/>
     argument which I propose to make than the 
     <lb/>
     amended schedule, but if, as I understand 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. Prime Minister, he intends to 
     <lb/>
     move the amended schedule then I suppose 
     <lb/>
       

    
            <cb/>
       

     it would be more satisfactory to this com<lb break="no"/>mittee if I based my argument on the 
     <lb/>
     amended schedule. Since the Bill was in. 
     <lb/>
     troduced we find that an amendment has 
     <lb/>
     already been made to the original schedule 
     <lb/>
     as brought in. I am very glad to find that 
     <lb/>
     the amendment has been made. It has made 
     <lb/>
     things slightly better, but this distribution 
     <lb/>
     is still about as bad, in my opinion, as it is 
     <lb/>
     possible for any distribution of seats to be. 
     <lb/>
     Now, in dealing with the question of Prince 
     <lb/>
     Albert the government laid down certain 
     <lb/>
     principles which they said would govern 
     <lb/>
     them and which did govern them in the 
     <lb/>
     distribution of seats. At page 8000 of, 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard' it is stated by the right hon. Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister that :

     the geographical distribution of the popula<lb break="no"/>tion. These are the three principles which we

            <p>
     Later he went on to elaborate this a little 
     <lb/>
     farther. At page 8100 of 'Hansard' he 
     <lb/>
     said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I stated yesterday at the opening of the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion that we took as the basis of the distri<lb break="no"/>bution which we made, the condition of things 
     <lb/>
     existing at the present time, the number of 
     <lb/>
     seats assigned to the province of Alberta in 
     <lb/>
     the present legislature of the Territory, which 
     <lb/>
     amounts to 16. First of all we had to increase 
     <lb/>
     that by 10, we had to give to Alberta 10 more 
     <lb/>
     seats than there are to-day in the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the Northwest Territories within 
     <lb/>
     the limits of Alberta. How are we to come 
     <lb/>
     to that conclusion? We come to that con<lb break="no"/>clusion upon information derived from three 
     <lb/>
     sources which we submit to the House to be 
     <lb/>
     challenged. We take first the number of votes 
     <lb/>
     recorded. We do not say to the House that 
     <lb/>
     this is the only thing we should take into 
     <lb/>
     consideration ; we say that is one thing which 
     <lb/>
     ought to be taken into consideration but not 
     <lb/>
     alone. We take next the number of votes re<lb break="no"/>gistered ; we do not say that is the only thing 
     <lb/>
     to be taken, that is only one of many things 
     <lb/>
     on which we should form our judgment. Then 
     <lb/>
     we take the census of 1901. That is the best 
     <lb/>
     thing of all. If we had a census for 1905 we 
     <lb/>
     would not have to consider the number of re<lb break="no"/>corded votes nor the number .0: registered' 
     <lb/>
     votes, nor the number of post offices, school 
     <lb/>
     districts or improvement districts ; we would 
     <lb/>
     take only the census for 1905. But we have no 
     <lb/>
     census of 1905 and therefore we have to make 
     <lb/>
     up our minds as to what is the actual popula<lb break="no"/>tion at the present time. We know that the 
     <lb/>
     population at the present time is double what 
     <lb/>
     it was in 1901, and we have to make our calcu<lb break="no"/>lation accordingly. But though the population 
     <lb/>
     

            <pb n="8707" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-04_Page_8707.jpg"/>

            <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw>
            <fw type="num">8708</fw>
         

     has doubled, I think it is only a fair sugges<lb break="no"/>tion that, we must find a wealth of information 
     <lb/>
     in the census of 1901. We say moreover that 
     <lb/>
     We think this is something to go on, not the 
     <lb/>
     number of post ofiices, school districts and im<lb break="no"/>provement districts.

            <p>
     That was the basis upon which the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution in Alberta was made, according 
     <lb/>
     to the statement of the right hon. Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister. I would like to read also a state<lb break="no"/>ment which was made in this respect by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver). He 
     <lb/>
     was more definite. He said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The definite division of the constituencies is 
     <lb/>
     based on the vote actually polled on the 3rd 
     <lb/>
     November as we believe that was the closest 
     <lb/>
     and most recent date upon which we could get 
     <lb/>
     information we could rely upon. The informa<lb break="no"/>tion with regard to post offices, homestead en<lb break="no"/>tries ancl other matters of that kind was ar<lb break="no"/>rived at in order to bear, not upon the question 
     <lb/>
     of division of constituencies, but on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether the bulk of the population 
     <lb/>
     was in one end of the country or the other. 
     <lb/>
     That information therefore would not have any 
     <lb/>
     direct bearing on the propriety of the actual 
     <lb/>
     division made, but would be merely corrobora<lb break="no"/>tive evidence to show whether the trend 0! 
     <lb/>
     population was in this direction or that.

            </p></quote>

            <p>
     Later on the Minister of the Interior made 
     <lb/>
     another statement as to the basis upon which 
     <lb/>
     they proceeded. At page 8118 he is report<lb break="no"/>ed to have spoken as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The basis of the division of the constituencies 
     <lb/>
    was necessarily, I said, the vote cast. That 
     <lb/>was not the question that he was arguing about 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
          

     at all. That question has not yet arisen. I 
     <lb/>
     said that we took the actual vote cast, be<lb break="no"/>cause it was the latest and most accurate in<lb break="no"/>formation we could get for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     drawing a dividing line between the constitu<lb break="no"/>encies. But that was not, it he followed my 
     <lb/>
     remarks of yesterday, the sole basis, from my 
     <lb/>
     point of view, of the general arrangement that 
     <lb/>
     was made. He speaks of my having introduced 
     <lb/>
     the question of the dividing line at township 
     <lb/>
     38. I do not know whether it is to the pur<lb break="no"/>pose in this argument to shut our eyes and 
     <lb/>
     ears to what we have seen and heard ever 
     <lb/>
     since these Autonomy Bills came up for con<lb break="no"/>sideration; but I instanced the increase of 
     <lb/>
     population, the number of post offices, the 
     <lb/>
     number of statute labour districts, the number 
     <lb/>
     of school districts and other matters connected 
     <lb/>
     with the northern country, as evidence. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     I would like to ask now how this basis of 
     <lb/>
     calculation applies to the distribution which 
     <lb/>
     we have before us. A number of figures 
     <lb/>
     have been brought down by the government 
     <lb/>
     showing the populations in the various pro<lb break="no"/>posed districts, the votes cast, the voters 
     <lb/>
      on the list, the area and so on. I would like 
     <lb/>to get this statement upon 'Hansard.' I 
     <lb/>have had an abstract made of the figures 
     <lb/>given by the government in a more con<lb break="no"/>cise form than their figures are given and I 
     <lb/>think it will be found correct. If hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side of the House would 
     <lb/>kindly correct me if I misquote any of the 
     <lb/>figures I would be very much obliged. The 
     <lb/>following is the statement given by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment :

   <p>
     
     These are the figures as given by the government.        
     <lb/>
       I do not think they are absolutely          
     <lb/>
    correct; I compiled figures on my own ac<lb break="no"/>count, but I find my figures and the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment figures sufl'iciently near to enable 
     <lb/>me to accept the government figures as 
     <lb/>sufliciently accurate for the purpose of the 
     <lb/>argument which I propose to make. In the 
     <lb/>original schedule proposed by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment there was an average of 1,328 votes 
     <lb/>cast in each electoral district in the south, 
     <lb/>while there was only an average of 571 
     <lb/>votes cast in each electoral district in the 
     <lb/>northern constituencies. It would be seen 
     <lb/>therefore that considerably more than 
     <lb/>double the representation to which they 
     <lb/>were entitled was given to the people in the 
     <lb/>north. according to the original schedules, 
     <lb/>than was given to the people in the south. 
     <lb/>There was also an average of 1,856 names 
     <lb/>on the voters' lists of each constituency in 
     <lb/>the south as compared with an average of 
     <lb/>1,036 nameson the voters' lists in each con<lb break="no"/>stituency in the north. Under the pro<lb break="no"/>posed original distribution, also, there was 
     <lb/>according to the census a population of 4,067 
     <lb/>in each electoral division in the south and 
     <lb/>an average population of 2,076 in each elec<lb break="no"/>toral division in the north. I wish to put 
     <lb/>this on record as showing the way in which 
     <lb/>the original distribution proposed by the 
     <lb/>government worked out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. One man in the north 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be equal to two in the south. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Under the amendment pro<lb break="no"/>posed by the Prime Minister which has 
     <lb/>
     been laid on the table of the House and 
     <lb/>
     which gives sixteen seats to the south and 
     <lb/>
     nine to the north, instead of fifteen seats 
     <lb/>
     to the South and ten to the north as origi<lb break="no"/>nally proposed, I find that, taking the census 
     <lb/>
     of 1901, there was an average population for 
     <lb/>
     each of the twenty-five constituencies, omit<lb break="no"/>ting Indians, of 3,222. Taking the votes 
     <lb/>
     polled on the 3rd November, 1904, there 
     <lb/>
     would be an average of 1,026 to each of the 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five constituencies, and an average 
     <lb/>
     of 1,529 names on the voters' lists of each 
     <lb/>
     constituency. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We find that the distribution provides for 
     <lb/>
     sixteen seats in the southern portion. There 
     <lb/>
     are to each of these constituencies, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the population of 1901, omitting In<lb break="no"/>dians. 3,813 persons ; according to the votes 
     <lb/>
     polled on the 3rd of November, 1901, 1,245 
     <lb/>
     votes; and, according to the number of 
     <lb/>
     voters on the list at the same date, 1,740 
     <lb/>
     votes. In each of the nine constituencies 
     <lb/>
     in the northern portion of the district. the 
     <lb/>
     old district of Saskatchewan, there is ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the population of 1901. omitting 
     <lb/>
     Indians, an average of 2,307 persons, an 
     <lb/>
     average of votes polled on the 3rd of No<lb break="no"/>vember, 1904, of 635, and an average num<lb break="no"/>ber of votes on the list, 1,151. These were 
     <lb/>
     the three main bases on which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment proceeded' with the distribution of 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>


     the post office guide I estimate that the 
     <lb/>
     number of post offices in the northern por<lb break="no"/>tion of Saskatchewan is about 100, and the 
     <lb/>
     number in the southern portion 285. The 
     <lb/>
     number of schools was also taken into con<lb break="no"/>sideration. I find that in the northern poro 
     <lb/>
     tion of Saskatchewan there are, roughly 
     <lb/>
     speaking, 200 schools, and in the southern 
     <lb/>
     portion 575. As further corroborative evi<lb break="no"/>dence, the number of local improvement dis<lb break="no"/>tricts in Alberta was quoted. I am inform<lb break="no"/>ed by a telegram which was sent to me 
     <lb/>
     yesterday by Mr. Bulyea of the Public 
     <lb/>
     Works Department at Regina, that in the 
     <lb/>
     northern district of Saskatchewan there are 
     <lb/>
     only eight districts organized, as against 
     <lb/>
     151 in the southern portion. He goes on to

     We were told that the number of home<lb break="no"/>stead entries should also be taken into con<lb break="no"/>sideration as evidence of the trend of popu<lb break="no"/>lation. I find that in the nine northern con<lb break="no"/>stituencies, from 1901 to May or June, 1905, 
     <lb/>
     there were 17,424 homestead entries, and in 
     <lb/>
     the southern portion 31,611, which also 
     <lb/>
     goes to show that there has been a larger 
     <lb/>
     immigration into the southern portion of 
     <lb/>
     that district than there has been into the 
     <lb/>
     northern portion. It will of course be read<lb break="no"/>ily understood that when a new popula<lb break="no"/>tion comes into a new district, practically 
     <lb/>
     everybody who goes in takes up a home. 
     <lb/>
     stead. I well remember that in the early 
     <lb/>
     eighties, when the main line of the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway first opened up the 
     <lb/>Northwest, practically every man who came 
     <lb/>to the country and was eligible to take up 
     <lb/>a homestead, made his entry. It cost him 
     <lb/>only $10, and he could take up a homestead 
     <lb/>quite close to a town. A great many of 
     <lb/>these entries were subsequently abandoned. 
     <lb/>I fancy that this will be found to be the 
     <lb/>case very largely in the northern part of 
     <lb/>Saskatchewan. Almost every railroad man 
     <lb/>who came into that country took up a home<lb break="no"/>stead. as it might become very valuable to 
     <lb/>him if he could keep his hold on it without 
     <lb/>goingupon it and putting in his settlement 
     <lb/>duties. In the last three or four years 
     <lb/>matters have been very ditterent. In the 
     <lb/>southern portion of the province it has 
     <lb/>been practically impossible to get a home 
     <lb/>stead within a reasonable distance of the 
     <lb/>railway. People have been going into the 
     <lb/>older and well known districts, where it II 
     <lb/>known that farming can be satisfactorily 
     <lb/>carried on. As they have purchased land, 
     <lb/>we do not of course find their names among 
     <lb/>the homestead entries. A great number have 
     <lb/>also come in to work for farmers. These 
     <lb/>have not been able to find homesteads near 
     <lb/>at hand. and we do not find their names 
     <lb/>among the homestead entries. A great 
     <lb/>

     number of business people have come to 
     <lb/>
     settle in the towns, and their names are 
     <lb/>
     not among the homestead entries. So that 
     <lb/>
     I think an examination of the homestead 
     <lb/>
     entries will be found to bear out my con<lb break="no"/>tention that the larger proportion .of the im<lb break="no"/>migration has been going into the southern 
     <lb/>
     portion as against the northern. However. 
     <lb/>
     it is not necessary to the argument which I 
     <lb/>
     wish to place before the House, to press 
     <lb/>
     that point home. Even supposing that a 
     <lb/>
     larger proportion of immigration has not 
     <lb/>
     been coming to the southern portion, it will 
     <lb/>
     be found that the distribution of seats will 
     <lb/>
     show that a most unjustly excessive pro<lb break="no"/>portion of the representation is being given 
     <lb/>
     to the northern portion of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan.

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. What dividing line is my

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName> Yes, but I have no doubt <lb/>that the hon. member for Saskatchewan<lb/>will endorse what I say when I say that<lb/>the figures were given by the officer of the <lb/>government for each of the amended con<lb break="no"/>stituenceis. At least, he had them so on<lb/>his statement.<lb/>

            <p/>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. I am not disputing the<lb/>figures at all, but that does not meet the 
     <lb/>
     point which the hon. member for Western 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia raised. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) is classing them as north and south. 
     <lb/>
     There is no north and south according to this 
     <lb/>
     schedule. and what the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) wanted to get at 
     <lb/>
     was on what basis the hon. gentleman was 
     <lb/>
     speaking of northern seats and southern 
     <lb/>
     seats? Where does he make the dividing 
     <lb/>
     line? According to the amended schedule, 
     <lb/>
     some constituencies extend down to Assini<lb break="no"/>boia, and vice versa.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I thought I had already made 
     <lb/>
     that plain. There are nine seats which are 
     <lb/>
     entirely or mainly in the old district of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan. Six of them are entirely in the 
     <lb/>
     old district of Saskatchewan. and three of 
     <lb/>
     them extend some little distance into the

     old district of Assinlboia. Those are what 
     <lb/>
     I call the northern seats. and those which 
     <lb/>
     are entirely in the old district of Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     I call the southern seats.

     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. In this statement numbers

     17 to 25 comprise the nine seats. All of

     Yorkton be as fairly classed as northern dis<lb break="no"/>tricts? I find the southern boundary line

     south than the southern boundary at Ba<lb break="no"/>toche, Saskatoon and Battleford.

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Yes, in the old district, but 
     <lb/>
     they are in a federal district made two years

     ago in this House, which we looked upon as

     a northern district. the district of Mackenzie.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I am not dealing with a 
     <lb/>
     federal district. I am using this for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of argument, to show that what has 
     <lb/>
     always been considered part-of the present 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan has been given an 
     <lb/>
     undue amount of representation, and 1 take 
     <lb/>
     the seats which are entirely or mainly in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan. These we call 
     <lb/>
     northern seats, and the seats entirely in 
     <lb/>
     the old district of Assiniboia I would call 
     <lb/>
     southern seats.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Just as well call them 9 
     <lb/>
    and 16. The inequality would be just the 
     <lb/>same.

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I have given the vote and 
     <lb/>population to each seat, and I would like 
     <lb/>the matter looked at from another point of   
     <lb/>view. Instead of giving nine seats to the 
     <lb/>north and sixteen to the south, if a fair 
     <lb/>division were made, based on the population 
     <lb/>as given by the census of 1901, there would 
     <lb/>be six and a quarter seats, to be exact, in 
     <lb/>the north and eighteen and three—quarters in 
     <lb/>the south. If it had been based on the votes 
     <lb/>polled and the Minister of the Interior said 
     <lb/>this was necessarily the basis in the distri<lb break="no"/>bution in Alberta—then there should be only 
     <lb/>five and a half in the north and nineteen 
     <lb/>and a half in the south.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. If it were based on the 
     <lb/>
     Haultain redistribution in 1902, what would 
     <lb/>
     you be entitled to ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. If it had been based on the

     never would have been a word raised on this

     side.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. You said that that was a

     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. There is considerable differ<lb break="no"/>ence between 1901 and 1905. The Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior will admit that there has 
     <lb/>
     been a slight change in the number of people 
     <lb/>
     living in the Northwest.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. What is the difference 
     <lb/>
     between the votes cast in Moosejaw in 1902 
     <lb/>
     and the votes cast in Batoche on this fair 
     <lb/>
     redistribution ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I am not dealing with the 
     <lb/>
     Haultain redistribution of 1902. I think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's cross-examination on that 
     <lb/>
     point is entirely irrelevant. I have made the 
     <lb/>
     statement that if as fair a redistribution had 
     <lb/>
     been made in this case, there would not have 
     <lb/>
     been a word said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:OLIV1">Mr. OLIVER</persName>. Will the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     show how fair that redistribution was ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. If the hon. gentleman will 
     <lb/>
     bring up that question later on, if he thinks 
     <lb/>
     it relevant to the point at issue, I will have 
     <lb/>
     the figures and satisfy him as to the fairness 
     <lb/>
     of that redistribution. I was comparing the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the various grounds upon which the 
     <lb/>
     distribution was made in Alberta if applied 
     <lb/>
     to Saskatchewan when I was interrupted. 
     <lb/>
     If the distribution had been based on the 
     <lb/>
     names on the voters' list there should be 
     <lb/>
     only 6 3/4 seats in the north and 18 1/4, in the 
     <lb/>
     south. If based on the number of schools, 
     <lb/>
     or post offices, or local improvement districts 
     <lb/>
     or homestead entries, there would be about 
     <lb/>
    the same results. We claim also, apart 
     <lb/>from the fact of this very undue representa<lb break="no"/>tion being given the north, that the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of seats among the various constituen<lb break="no"/>cies is exceedingly uneven. Compare, for 
     <lb/>instance, the district of Humboldt with the 
     <lb/>district of Maple Creek, each of them very 
     <lb/>large in area. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. If the hon. gentleman in<lb break="no"/>sists upon treating the province in sections— 
     <lb/>
     for instance he classes a certain part as 
     <lb/>
     north and a certain part as south—does he 
     <lb/>
     not think it unfair to make a comparison 
     <lb/>
     between a district in the south and a dis<lb break="no"/>trict in the north? Let him compare dis<lb break="no"/>tricts in the same section or compare the 
     <lb/>
     whole south with the whole north. It is not 
     <lb/>
     fair to take districts out of the south and 
     <lb/>
     compare them with districts in the north. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I can see absolutely nothing 
     <lb/>
     unfair in showing the incidence of this re<lb break="no"/>distribution. To compare one district with 
     <lb/>
     another and one constituency with another 
     <lb/>
     is the only way in which the House can be 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly seized of the fact of the distri<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
         

     bution under consideration. Compare Hum<lb break="no"/>boldt with Maple Creek. Humboldt had 
     <lb/>
     198 votes polled on the 4th November last 
     <lb/>
     and has an area of 7,657 square miles. Maple 
     <lb/>
     Creek had 846 votes polled and has an area 
     <lb/>
     of 20,669 square miles. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Is that any greater vari<lb break="no"/>ation than the difference between Batoche 
     <lb/>
     and Moosejaw at the last local election, 
     <lb/>
     which you say is fair ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. These hon. gentlemen ap<lb break="no"/>parently have been brooding over the distri<lb break="no"/>bution of 1902 and cannot throw it off. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. You say it was fair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. We will have ample time to 
     <lb/>
     consider that redistribution later on, if the 
     <lb/>
     Chairman considers it relevant to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion at issue. Batoche had 1,659 votes polled 
     <lb/>
     on November 3rd, and its area is 3,746 
     <lb/>
     square miles. Souris had 2,544 votes polled 
     <lb/>
     on November 3rd and its area is 3,190 square 
     <lb/>
     miles. Let us group a few of these consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies together and see how it works 
     <lb/>
     out. If you take Humboldt, Prince Albert, 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert city, Redberry and Batoche ; 
     <lb/>
     the total vote polled in these five amounted 
     <lb/>
     to 2,140. They are to have one member 
     <lb/>
     each. Compare this with Souris, which, un<lb break="no"/>der this distribution, is to return only one 
     <lb/>
     member. Souris polled 2,544 votes, over 
     <lb/>
     400 votes more for this one constituency 
     <lb/>
     than were cast in these five northern consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies. With two exceptions, every one 
     <lb/>
     of the sixteen southern constituencies polled 
     <lb/>
     more votes in the last election than the 
     <lb/>
     northern constituencies. The question might 
     <lb/>
     well be asked : How comes it that the voter 
     <lb/>
     in the south is not considered equal to the 
     <lb/>
     voter in the ,North ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I find that there has been a radical depart<lb break="no"/>ure, in the case of the province of Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan, from the rule laid down by the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the representation of cities. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman was very positive that cer<lb break="no"/>tain principles ought to be adopted in deal<lb break="no"/>ing with rural populations as compared with 
     <lb/>
     urban populations. As reported in 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard,' page 8300, the hon. gentleman said : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Mr. OLIVER. Population is one thing and 
     <lb/>
     there are many others. But there is one uni<lb break="no"/>versal principle and it is that a purely rural 
     <lb/>
     population, a population of producers creating 
     <lb/>
     wealth in the country is always given a greater 
     <lb/>
     share in the government than an equal number 
     <lb/>
     of consumers. 
     <lb/>
      
     Mr. HAGGART. That is so in no place. 
     <lb/>
       
     Mr. OLIVER. In every place. On what other 
     <lb/>
     grounds are the cities of our country so un<lb break="no"/>justly treated by comparison of population in 
     <lb/>
     being under-represented compared with the

     rural constituencies ?

 <p>
     Now, this is a very definite statement of 
     <lb/>
     policy. How is that policy applied in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan? It is applied 
     <lb/>
     in the case of Alberta in a way that may be 
     <lb/>
     quite satisfactory to the hon. gentleman him<lb break="no"/>self. But in Saskatchewan we find that 
     <lb/>
     the government propose to give one mem<lb break="no"/>ber each to the city of Regina, with 740 
     <lb/>
     votes polled on November 3rd. and 933 
     <lb/>
     votes on the list ; Moosejaw, with 786 votes 
     <lb/>
     polled and 1.000 on the list; and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Albert, with 542 votes polled and 740 votes 
     <lb/>
     on the list. Why should these three cities 
     <lb/>
     be given separate representation, when you 
     <lb/>
     have such thickly populated rural consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies in the province? Compare any of 
     <lb/>
     these cities with the district of Souris, 
     <lb/>
     which polled 2,544 votes and had more than 
     <lb/>
     3,348 names on the list, the area of this 
     <lb/>
     constituency being upwards of 3,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles. Or compare any of them with South 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle. with 1,930 votes polled and 2,<lb break="no"/>692 on the list. Or compare it with Salt<lb break="no"/>coats with a population of 11,004 according 
     <lb/>
     to the last census, with 1,478 votes polled, 
     <lb/>
     and 2,327 ,names on the list. If these 
     <lb/>
     three cities are to be given separate repre<lb break="no"/>sentation why was not the town of Medicine 
     <lb/>
     Hat treated in the same way ?  The town 
     <lb/>
     of Medicine Hat has a larger population, a 
     <lb/>
     larger number of votes on the list and a 
     <lb/>
     larger number of votes polled than has the 
     <lb/>
     city of Prince Albert. If Prince Albert 
     <lb/>
     is to be given one member, why should 
     <lb/>
     not the town of Medicine Hat also be 
     <lb/>
     given one member ? But we find that it has 
     <lb/>
     not suited the Minister of the Interior or 
     <lb/>
     the government to carry out in its entirety 
     <lb/>
     the principle so definitely laid down in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Alberta. It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     in every single particular, they have de<lb break="no"/>parted from their principles in distributing 
     <lb/>
     the seats for the province of Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     It will be within the memory of the House 
     <lb/>
     that, a few days back, the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) stated that 
     <lb/>
     in view of the fact that the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister had stated that it had been his desire 
     <lb/>
     on one occasion to have the distribution of 
     <lb/>
     seats submitted to a conference to the North<lb break="no"/>west members 'on both sides of the House, 
     <lb/>
     be (Mr. R. L. Borden) was perfectly will<lb break="no"/>ing and anxious to have a conference in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the distribution of the seats in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan, if it was not 
     <lb/>
     too late. This suggestion was acted upon by 
     <lb/>
    the Prime Minister. The committee met and 
     <lb/>discussed the situation generally, I was one 
     <lb/>of the members of that committee, but, of 
     <lb/>course, I do not speak omcially for the 
     <lb/>committee in any way. In the discussion it 
     <lb/>was found that the hon. member for Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan (Mr. Lamont) took an uncompro<lb break="no"/>mising position. He took the position that 
     <lb/>upon no consideration would he agree to 
     <lb/>fewer than nine members being given to 
     <lb/>what I have described as the northern part 
     <lb/>of the province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Was not the position 
     <lb/>
     taken by the hon. member for Qu'AppeIle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lake) just as uncompromising, that 
     <lb/>
     he would not give nine members to that dis<lb break="no"/>trict ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I will come to that presently. 
     <lb/>
     But the position that I have described was 
     <lb/>
     taken. The suggestion was then made by my<lb break="no"/>self that although the northern portion was 
     <lb/>
     not even entitled to as many as seven mem<lb break="no"/>bers, I was prepared to give way to this ex<lb break="no"/>tent—I would compromise on eight mem<lb break="no"/>bers for the north. I said: If you will come 
     <lb/>
     down one member I will compromise, I 
     <lb/>
     will take what I consider something a little 
     <lb/>
     better than you propose to give and I will 
     <lb/>
     compromise on eight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. The hon. gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     aware that I stated the government had 
     <lb/>
     already come down from ten to nine accord<lb break="no"/>ing to the government's first proposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The government had come 
     <lb/>
     down apparently because they found their 
     <lb/>
     position too untenable even for their fol<lb break="no"/>lowing on that side of the House. They 
     <lb/>
     had come down of their own accord. Then 
     <lb/>
     this conference was to take place and surely 
     <lb/>
     if the conference had been arranged there 
     <lb/>
     should have been some give and take on 
     <lb/>
     both sides. The member for Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     however, took that position and I was not 
     <lb/>
     backed up by the other gentleman who was 
     <lb/>
     present at that time, at least not to the ex<lb break="no"/>tent of voting down the member for Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, and consequently it resulted in 
     <lb/>
     a deadlock. As to the distribution of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation between the northern seats and 
     <lb/>
     the southern seats I made the offer to com<lb break="no"/>promise although from the figures I have 
     <lb/>
     shown. the northern portion was not en<lb break="no"/>titled to seven seats, still I was prepared to 
     <lb/>
     say: We will settle this matter without 
     <lb/>
     further dispute, let us say eight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Which of the northern 
     <lb/>
     seats would the hon. member cut out? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Of course there would have 
     <lb/>
     to be a general rearrangement of the north<lb break="no"/>ern seats made after mutual discussion of 
     <lb/>
     the counties. This, as I say, limited the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion just to the limits of the constituen<lb break="no"/>cies in the north and the limits of the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies in the south. I took the position 
     <lb/>
     at that time. and I took it strongly, that 
     <lb/>
     cities of such comparatively small popu<lb break="no"/>lation should not be given separate repre<lb break="no"/>sentation, that they should be thrown in 
     <lb/>
     with the rural constituencies. I took the 
     <lb/>
     position that a member for a city in the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly of Saskatchewan will 
     <lb/>
     have very little to do, that, as is well 
     <lb/>
     known, the members for rural constituencies 
     <lb/>
     have a very large amount to do in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the representation of their dis<lb break="no"/>tricts; they are constantly applied to in re<lb break="no"/>gard to public works and many other mat<lb break="no"/>ters of local interest. I took the ground 
     <lb/>
     that the city members would have little to 
     <lb/>

     do, and it would be better to put the cities 
     <lb/>
     in with rural constituencies and to redistri<lb break="no"/>bute these rural constituencies, and to 
     <lb/>
     give every member of the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly a certain amount of country to look 
     <lb/>
     after. I thought that would be the fairest 
     <lb/>
     distribution to ask, but this was met with 
     <lb/>
     a positive refusal and a statement that it 
     <lb/>
     was impossible to go back and take away 
     <lb/>
     the representation which had now been pro 
     <lb/>
     mised to the difierent cities.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend is aware 
     <lb/>
     that it is only to cities which are incorpo<lb break="no"/>rated by the legislative assembly, of which 
     <lb/>
     until recently he was a member, that the 
     <lb/>
     members are being given. There are only 
     <lb/>
     five incorporated cities in the Territories 
     <lb/>
     and each one of these has been given a 
     <lb/>

     of ambition, nothing else. The member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) then proposed 
     <lb/>
     to group certain constituencies together to 
     <lb/>
     provide for a seat which appeared to be 
     <lb/>
     very badly needed in the southern portion 
     <lb/>
     of the province. I disagreed with him in 
     <lb/>
     reference to one of his proposals, but I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to agree to such a redistribution 
     <lb/>
     if a suggestion which I made would be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted. I do not know whether the hon. 
     <lb/>

     based on that.

     <lb/>
     about considerably better than by the plan 
     <lb/>
     proposed by the member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia. He proposed to take Moosomin, 
     <lb/>
     Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseley, four 
     <lb/>
     of the oldest constituencies in the country, 
     <lb/>
     which are filled with the pioneers who have 
     <lb/>
     made that country, to group these together 
     <lb/>
     and give them three seats and to take the 
     <lb/>
     seat we thus save and place it where I 
     <lb/>
     think a seat is badly needed, along the Soo 
     <lb/>

     provided for in another way.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Mr. Chairman, I was refer<lb break="no"/>ring this afternoon to the proposal which had 
     <lb/>
     been made by the hon. member for West 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) in regard to group<lb break="no"/>ing four constituencies on the main line of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway, adding to 
     <lb/>
     them small portions of two constituencies, 
     <lb/>
     which lie to the north, making three new 
     <lb/>
     constituencies out of the original four and 
     <lb/>
     giving the one constituency which has been 
     <lb/>
     thus saved to the 800 line. While I am 
     <lb/>
     strongly in favour of a constituency being 
     <lb/>
     given to the Soo line, I object to the con<lb break="no"/>stituency being formed in that way. I held 
     <lb/>
     that these four constituencies on the main 
     <lb/>
     line were settled in the earliest stages of 
     <lb/>
     the country. The greater part of this area 
     <lb/>
     is occupied by people who are amongst the 
     <lb/>
     oldest settlers, who have exercised their 
     <lb/>
     franchise for years and who have contri<lb break="no"/>buted largely to the building up of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. In addition to that I have another 
     <lb/>
     objection, and it is that these four seats 
     <lb/>
     have a larger average voting population than 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="8719" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-04_Page_8719.jpg"/>

            <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw>
            <fw type="num">8720</fw>
       

     the average voting population which the 
     <lb/>
     whole of the province has as obtained 
     <lb/>
     by the even distribution of the voting popu<lb break="no"/>lation of the province into 25 different seats. 
     <lb/>
     I find that the average number of names on 
     <lb/>
     the voters' lists in these districts is 1,554, 
     <lb/>
     while the average for the whole of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince would be 1,529. I suggested as an al<lb break="no"/>ternative. provided there was a positive refu<lb break="no"/>sal to grant the extra seat from the northern 
     <lb/>
     portion of the province where I consider it 
     <lb/>
     should come from. that the three Regina 
     <lb/>
     seats should be altered as regards their area 
     <lb/>
     and that one of the seats, the south Regina 
     <lb/>
     seat, or a portion of it, should be given to the 
     <lb/>
     800 line. I found that the three Regina seats, 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden or North Regina, Regina city and 
     <lb/>
     South Regina, on the average had only 1,344 
     <lb/>
     voters on the voters' list, and I thought that 
     <lb/>
     the adoption of my suggestion would be a 
     <lb/>
     proper way of finding an additional con« 
     <lb/>
     stituency to provide for the people along 
     <lb/>
     the SOO line, who, I think, are justly en<lb break="no"/>titled to have a representative of their own. 
     <lb/>
     They have forwarded to me a copy of a 
     <lb/>
     resolution. which they have also forwarded 
     <lb/>
     to the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. Minister of the Interior. on the 
     <lb/>
     subject. During the discussion which took 
     <lb/>
     place in this committee I submitted a ten<lb break="no"/>tative suggestion of my own showing how 
     <lb/>
     the constituencies might be divided up in the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in such a way as to give a 
     <lb/>
     fairly even distribution of votes to each con<lb break="no"/>stituency. I did this for the purpose of demon<lb break="no"/>strating that it was possible to make a com<lb break="no"/>paratively even distribution, a distribution 
     <lb/>
     based on existing conditions, that is to say, 
     <lb/>
     by preserving as far as possible the constitu<lb break="no"/>encies as they exist at the present time and 
     <lb/>
     giving additional representation where the 
     <lb/>
     additional population and the additional 
     <lb/>
     number of votes on the list appear to demand. 
     <lb/>
     This distribution which accounted for 
     <lb/>
     seven seats in the northern portion of the 
     <lb/>
     district and eighteen seats in the southern 
     <lb/>
     portion, even then gave an advantage of 
     <lb/>
     8 per cent to the northern constituencies. 
     <lb/>
     The suggestion was, of course, purely ten<lb break="no"/>tative: it was drawn up after a pretty 
     <lb/>
     close examination of the vote that was 
     <lb/>
     polled and was marked on the map which 
     <lb/>
     I had in my possession, but without any 
     <lb/>
     very prolonged consideration of the matter. 
     <lb/>
     On the whole, I think it met the purpose 
     <lb/>
     fairly well, and I believe it could have been 
     <lb/>
     made into a very good distribution indeed 
     <lb/>
     if the committee had discussed the details 
     <lb/>
     and had made alterations here and there 
     <lb/>
     Where the local conditions would appear to 
     <lb/>
     demand them. Although I left the map 
     <lb/>
     with the constituencies marked in it and 
     <lb/>
     the figures showing the vote of each con<lb break="no"/>stituency with the Liberal members of that 
     <lb/>
     committee, I have heard nothing more on 
     <lb/>
     the subject from them since; it appears to 
     <lb/>
     have been ignored. I would like to put on 
     <lb/>
     record the constituencies which I proposed. 
     <lb/>
     the area of each and the number of voters 
     <lb/>
     in each according to the lists, as near as I 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     

     could estimate. I first proposed to divide 
     <lb/>
     the present constituency of Souris into two 
     <lb/>
     constituencies. one of which, the old district 
     <lb/>
     of Souris, would have 1,684 voters on the list 
     <lb/>
     and an area of 1,188 square miles. The 
     <lb/>
     second, constituency—to be named as the 
     <lb/>
     committee might decide—would have 1,593 
     <lb/>
     voters on the lists. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Would the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     say how many votes were cast last fall in 
     <lb/>
     the proposed district of Souris ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. It was absolutely impossible 
     <lb/>
     to say how many votes were cast in any of 
     <lb/>
     these constituencies; the government may 
     <lb/>
     be able to find that out by some method 
     <lb/>
     unknown to me. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) took the responsibility of preparing 
     <lb/>
     a map based entirely on the vote polled last. 
     <lb/>
     fall. He has contended strongly that the 
     <lb/>
     vote cast last fall, and that alone. was the 
     <lb/>
     proper basis for this distribution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I have never contended it 
     <lb/>
     was the proper basis. I have said it was 
     <lb/>
     not the proper basis on every occasion I 
     <lb/>
     have had an opportunity of speaking on 
     <lb/>
     this question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Was not that the plan on 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friend prepared the map ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Certainly not ; it was based 
     <lb/>
     on the number of voters on the lists. How 
     <lb/>
     is it possible for any one to say how many 
     <lb/>
     votes were cast in each of these districts ? 
     <lb/>
     It constantly happens that a polling divi<lb break="no"/>sion which was created for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion election lies in two different 
     <lb/>
     local constituencies. We could tell exactly 
     <lb/>
     how many voters there were on the lists 
     <lb/>
     in each of these constituencies, but it is 
     <lb/>
     practically impossible to tell how many of 
     <lb/>
     them cast votes unless you get at the re<lb break="no"/>turning oflicer's book, which, I believe, is 
     <lb/>
     under seal in the hands of the Clerk of the 
     <lb/>
     Crown in Chancery. I do not know if that 
     <lb/>
     is the way in which the government have 
     <lb/>
     got at the figures they have submitted; I 
     <lb/>
     have taken the figures of the government all 
     <lb/>
     through, not that I think they are abso<lb break="no"/>lutely reliable, but at all events sufficiently 
     <lb/>
     so to enable one to make a comparison. I 
     <lb/>
     said that the second constituency into which 
     <lb/>
     the old constituency of Souris is divided 
     <lb/>
     would have 1,593 voters on the list and 
     <lb/>
     1,836 square miles. A part of Cannington 
     <lb/>
     would also go to a new constituency, which 
     <lb/>
     would take in the Regina-Arcola branch, 
     <lb/>
     from Arcola some little distance westward. 
     <lb/>
     Cannington would have 1,460 voters on the 
     <lb/>
     list and an area of 1,332 square miles. The 
     <lb/>
     other Cannington constituency would have 
     <lb/>
     1,456 voters on the list and 2,340 square 
     <lb/>
     miles of area. The old district of Mooso<lb break="no"/>min would have 1,895 voters on the list and 
     <lb/>
     an area of 1.165 square miles; Whitewood 
     <lb/>
     would have 1.357 voters on the list and an

     <lb/>
     square miles ; Soo, a new constituency 
     <lb/>
     along the Soo line, which was to take in 
     <lb/>
     a portion of South Regina, South Qu'Appelle, 
     <lb/>
     Souris and a small portion of Cannington, 
     <lb/>
     would have 1,504 voters on the list and an 
     <lb/>
     area of 8,016 square miles. I proposed to 
     <lb/>
     divide Moosejaw, and instead of giving a 
     <lb/>
     city constituency and a country constituency 
     <lb/>
     I proposed two constituencies which would 
     <lb/>
     probably meet in the near vicinity of the 
     <lb/>
     city of Moosejaw. North Moosejaw would

     8,820 square miles ; South Moosejaw, 1,550 
     <lb/>
     voters on the list, area, 5,184 square miles ; 
     <lb/>
     Maple Creek, 1,303 voters on the list, area, 
     <lb/>
     28,152 square miles. This will give an 
     <lb/>
     average of 550 voters on the list of each one 
     <lb/>
     of these eighteen constituencies in the south. 
     <lb/>
     Then I proposed to divide the northern con<lb break="no"/>stituencies as follows : Kinistino, 1,385 vot<lb break="no"/>ers on the list, area, 22,716 square miles. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. How many square miles 
     <lb/>
     in Kinistino ? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. 22,716. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. I do not think that is 
     <lb/>
     right ; you are not taking in all of the 
     <lb/>
     district. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. It is not the old original dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Kinistino ; a good many of the con<lb break="no"/>stituencies I propose are slightly changed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. You are not taking in the 
     <lb/>
     whole division of Kinistino according to 
     <lb/>
     your own map ; you are not including Atha<lb break="no"/>baska.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Of course, this is exclusive 
     <lb/>
     of Athabaska, and the figures which were 
     <lb/>
     given this afternoon were also exclusive of 
     <lb/>
     Athabaska. In regard to Athabaska, as 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister said, there are only a 
     <lb/>
     few wandering hunters and Indians there, 
     <lb/>
     and I thought that for such a purpose as 
     <lb/>
     this it would be unnecessary to include that 
     <lb/>
     area. I continue : Prince Albert, 1,427 vot<lb break="no"/>ers on the list, area, 7,572 square miles ; 
     <lb/>
     Batoche, 1,551 voters on the list, area, 10,<lb break="no"/>908 square miles ; Rosthern, 1,601 voters 
     <lb/>
     on the list, area, 950 square miles ; Saska<lb break="no"/>toon, 1,535 voters on the list, area, 1,280 
     <lb/>
     square miles ; Redberry, 1,200 voters on the 
     <lb/>
     list, area, 14,292 square miles ; Battleford, 
     <lb/>
     1,279 voters on the list, area, 15,552 square 
     <lb/>
     miles. This is the division of constituencies 
     <lb/>
     I proposed, given in tabulated form :

            <p>
     This will give an average of 1,425 voters 
     <lb/>
     on the lists of each of these Saskatchewans, 
     <lb/>
     or I should say northern constituencies. 
     <lb/>
     I have avoided as much as possible using 
     <lb/>
     the word Saskatchewan as applied to the 
     <lb/>
     old district of that name, for fear it should 
     <lb/>
     get confounded with the name of the new 
     <lb/>
     province. As I said before, the distribution 
     <lb/>
     which I propose does give an advantage of 
     <lb/>
     about eight per cent in favour of the north<lb break="no"/>ern constituencies. This is practically un<lb break="no"/>avoidable, because the number which would 
     <lb/>
     be given under a fair distribution based 
     <lb/>
     on the number of voters on the list would 
     <lb/>
     give a fraction of a constituency both north 
     <lb/>
     and south. As I have said, I do not con<lb break="no"/>sider that the proposal which I made was in 
     <lb/>
     any way perfect. I thought, however, that 
     <lb/>
     I should not go to this committee prepared 
     <lb/>
     only to criticise the existing schedules, but 
     <lb/>
     prepared to make an offer of something 
     <lb/>
     which I considered to be a fair distribution, 
     <lb/>
     and I hoped the committee might take this 
     <lb/>
     as a basis for working out something that 
     <lb/>
     would be satisfactory to all the members 
     <lb/>
     of the committee. However, that apparent<lb break="no"/>ly was not to be, and I have heard nothing 
     <lb/>
     more about that proposal. It seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that the result of the conference is one 
     <lb/>
     which was to be expected under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances, when certain members took an 
     <lb/>
     absolutely uncompromising attitude which 
     <lb/>
     made it impossible to arrive at anything 
     <lb/>
     useful in the way of readjustment. It seem<lb break="no"/>ed to me that the only possible way to get 
     <lb/>
     a fair distribution of seats was by an in<lb break="no"/>dependent commission, and I am very sorry 
     <lb/>
     that the government did not take this op<lb break="no"/>portunity, which I consider was a very good 
     <lb/>
     one, to initiate this principle of distribu<lb break="no"/>tion by commission. I think it would have 
     <lb/>
     been much to the credit of the great party 
     <lb/>
     now in power if they had been the first 
     <lb/>

     to take practical steps in that direction. 
     <lb/>
     I greatly regret that from the action taken 
     <lb/>
     by the government it seems impossible for 
     <lb/>
     us to obtain that independent commission 
     <lb/>
     for this purpose. There is just one thing 
     <lb/>
     further I want to say, that is, that I have 
     <lb/>
     been making this argument on the basis 
     <lb/>
     of the votes polled. I consider that that 
     <lb/>
     was the only fair way to look at the mat<lb break="no"/>ter, because the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     had told us most distinctly that that was 
     <lb/>
     the basis upon which he had made the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That is the point I ques<lb break="no"/>tioned my hon. friend about a few moments 
     <lb/>
     ago—whether he had not made his map on 
     <lb/>
     the basis of the votes cast.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I made that map on what I 
     <lb/>
     considered to be the fairest basis—the num<lb break="no"/>ber of voters on the list. I have made my 
     <lb/>
     criticism of the government's proposal on 
     <lb/>
     the basis of the number of votes polled, be<lb break="no"/>cause that was the basis on which they had 
     <lb/>
     made the distribution. In criticising their 
     <lb/>
     distribution, it seems to me to be only fair 
     <lb/>
     to take the basis they set for themselves. 
     <lb/>

     I myself consider the fair basis on which 
     <lb/>
     to make the distribution is the number of 
     <lb/>
     voters placed on the list for the election of 
     <lb/>
     the 3rd of November last. The enumerators 
     <lb/>
     who drew up those lists were government 
     <lb/>
     employees of the administration here at Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa, and I presume that they would en<lb break="no"/>deavour to do their duty to the best of their 
     <lb/>
     ability. At any rate, they would endeavour 
     <lb/>
     to put as large a number or names on the 
     <lb/>
     list as possible of persons entitled to vote. 
     <lb/>
     That was the nearest I thought we could 
     <lb/>
     get to a fair distribution. I do not pre<lb break="no"/>tend that that would be an absolutely posi<lb break="no"/>tive standard. It is imposible to declare 
     <lb/>
     that of any basis, except a census taken 
     <lb/>
     within a month of the drawing up of the 
     <lb/>
     schedule, because of the rapidity with which 
     <lb/>
     the population of the Northwest is changing 
     <lb/>
     at the present time. I do not think I need 
     <lb/>
     add anything further to what I have said 
     <lb/>
     With regard to this distribution. The fig<lb break="no"/>ures which I have read, provided by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in regard to the schedules which 
     <lb/>
     they have submitted to the House, speak 
     <lb/>
     for themselves far more eloquently than I 
     <lb/>
     could possibly hope to do.

     far fairer one than that presented to us by 
     <lb/>
     the government, I merely desire to point 
     <lb/>
     out and to accentuate the fact that in spite 
     <lb/>
     of the statement of the Prime Minister that 
     <lb/>
     the prime object was as far as possible to 
     <lb/>
     give equality of numbers in the different 
     <lb/>
     electoral districts, and in spite of the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of the Interior to which 
     <lb/>
     I have just referred, that the definite divis<lb break="no"/>ion of the constituencies was based on the 
     <lb/>
     votes actually polled on the 3rd of Novem<lb break="no"/>ber, I find that the schedule has apparently 
     <lb/>
     been drawn up with an absolute disregard 
     <lb/>
     of all the principles which were laid down 
     <lb/>
     as those which guided the government in 
     <lb/>
     making the distribution. A distribution has 
     <lb/>
     been made based, it seems to me, if it was 
     <lb/>
     based on anything at all, on the vaguest and 
     <lb/>
     most sanguine estimates of the prospective 
     <lb/>
     population of the northern part of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and less sanguine estimates of the 
     <lb/>
     prospective population of the southern por<lb break="no"/>tion of the province. This distribution prac<lb break="no"/>tically gives double the representation, man 
     <lb/>
     for man, to the newer population who are 
     <lb/>
     going into the newer country which is being 
     <lb/>
     opened up to the north. That population is 
     <lb/>
     composed largely of late arrivals who do not 
     <lb/>
     understand the political questions of the 
     <lb/>
     day in Canada, and who are far too busy, 
     <lb/>
     as all men who go into a new country are, 
     <lb/>
     in getting started, to study these questions 
     <lb/>
     and to form personal opinions upon them. 
     <lb/>
     And over this population it cannot be doubt<lb break="no"/>ed that the Dominion government exercises 
     <lb/>
     a considerable amount of influence. Only 
     <lb/>
     half the representation to which they are 
     <lb/>
     entitled on a fair distribution is apparently 
     <lb/>
     given to the older settlements of the south 
     <lb/>
     —the men who have built up the country, 
     <lb/>
     who have taken such a leading part in gov<lb break="no"/>erning it up to the present, and who, I think, 
     <lb/>
     have governed it with a very fair amount of 
     <lb/>
     success. The distribution shows the most 
     <lb/>
     extraordinary discrepancies in individual 
     <lb/>
     constituencies, varying from 178 votes cast 
     <lb/>
     in Humboldt and 277 east in Redberry 
     <lb/>
     in the recent election—and the votes cast 
     <lb/>
     at the recent election is the basis upon 
     <lb/>
     which these constituencies were constructed 
     <lb/>
     —to 1,930 in South Qu'Appelle and 2,594 
     <lb/>
     cast in the district of Saltcoats. That is to 
     <lb/>
     say a voter in Humboldt practically exer<lb break="no"/>cises as much voting influence as fourteen 
     <lb/>
     in the old district of Saltcoats, and a voter 
     <lb/>
     in Redberry exercises as much influence 
     <lb/>
     as seven in the district of South Qu'Appelle.

     <lb/>
     an opportunity in a moment or two of mak<lb break="no"/>ing his speech. In one of his constituen<lb break="no"/>cies, to which they are only given one mem<lb break="no"/>ber, and which cast a very large number of 
     <lb/>
     votes last year, the district of Saltcoats, 
     <lb/>
     there were upwards of 11,000 inhabitants. 
     <lb/>
     Should they not have a proportionate say 
     <lb/>
     in the representation of the country just as 
     <lb/>
     well as the other new settlers. If the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will take one basis and go on 
     <lb/>
     that throughout, I am willing to support 
     <lb/>
     him. I believe the fairest basis to be just 
     <lb/>
     now the number of votes placed on the voters' 
     <lb/>
     list by the officials of the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the 3rd of November last. Here is 
     <lb/>
     another comparison I would like to make 
     <lb/>
     before sitting down. Ten southern consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies cast upwards of 1,100 votes each— 
     <lb/>
     one of them as high as 2,500. There are 
     <lb/>
     three northern constituencies which, group<lb break="no"/>ed together, did not cast 1,000 votes among 
     <lb/>
     them. That appears to me an extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     condition of affairs. The three northern 
     <lb/>
     constituencies are Redberry, Humboldt and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert. Prince Albert city and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Albert rural district get a very ample re<lb break="no"/>presentation—far more than they are en<lb break="no"/>titled to on an even distribution. I might 
     <lb/>
     refer to that question of Prince Albert 
     <lb/>
     which I mentioned just now. Prince Al<lb break="no"/>bert, city and country together, cast 1,026 
     <lb/>
     votes. There is another constituency in the 
     <lb/>
     northern part of the district, the district 
     <lb/>
     of Kinistino, which the government proposes 
     <lb/>
     to form. That district has an area, outside 
     <lb/>
     of Athabaska altogether, of 25,000 square 
     <lb/>
     miles odd. The two districts of Prince Al<lb break="no"/>bert have between them only an area of 
     <lb/>
     6,555 square miles. The vote cast in the 
     <lb/>
     district of Kinistino was 1,029. That is 
     <lb/>
     to say, even with that enormous area the 
     <lb/>
     vote cast in the district of Kinistino was 
     <lb/>
     in excess of that cast in the two 
     <lb/>
     constituencies alongside, to which the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment proposes to give two representa<lb break="no"/>tives. I may have something more to say 
     <lb/>
     on this matter later on. For the present I 
     <lb/>
     shall content myself with submitting what 
     <lb/>
     I consider a fair and moderate criticism on 
     <lb/>
     the question before the committee.

     on the Saskatchewan redistribution schedule 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
    

     is very much milder than a great deal

     of the criticisms we have seen in the Con<lb break="no"/>servative press throughout the country dur<lb break="no"/>ing the past three or four months, or some 
     <lb/>
     of the criticisms we have heard in this 
     <lb/>
     House. I think it was the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     leader who said that he found in these dis<lb break="no"/>tribution schedules the worst gerrymander 
     <lb/>
     that had ever been perpetrated anywhere in

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend from Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle (Mr. Lake) feels disposed to make his 
     <lb/>
     criticism milder. He has within recent days 
     <lb/>
     taken the responsibility of making a map 
     <lb/>
     and has found that it is much more difficult 
     <lb/>
     to make a proper distribution than offer 
     <lb/>
     criticism. When he spoke a few evenings 
     <lb/>
     ago in criticism of the Saskatchewan sche<lb break="no"/>dule, he was horrified to find the area of 
     <lb/>
     the district of Maple Creek in comparison 
     <lb/>
     with the area of the district of Rosthern. 
     <lb/>
     I am surprised to find that in the map—

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The hon. gentleman is not 
     <lb/>
     giving a fair estimate of my remarks on 
     <lb/>
     that point. I compared the area and the 
     <lb/>
     vote.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend asked the 
     <lb/>
     committee to look at the area of Maple 
     <lb/>
     Creek in comparison with the district of 
     <lb/>
     Rosthern. I find upon his own map that 
     <lb/>
     he has actually added to the area of Maple 
     <lb/>
     Creek by something over 6,000 square miles. 
     <lb/>
     And in the district of Rosthern he has cut 
     <lb/>
     off a township or two and actually makes 
     <lb/>
     it smaller than it is in the Schedule pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the government. I find also that 
     <lb/>
     one of his pet districts, the district of Wol<lb break="no"/>seley, which is certainly not a very large 
     <lb/>
     district even upon the government map, he 
     <lb/>
     has reduced by some three townships. Wol<lb break="no"/>seley did not cast a very large vote either 
     <lb/>
     last fall. They didn't have a large regis<lb break="no"/>tered vote last fall. And, consulting other 
     <lb/>
     statistics, we are led to believe that the 
     <lb/>
     population of Wolseley has not been in<lb break="no"/>creasing as fast as that of other places. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. How many votes were cut

     off the district of Wolseley ?

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. If my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     on the small side, which did not cast a 
     <lb/>
     vote last fall equal to the average, what 
     <lb/>
     was his purpose in reducing the size ? I am 
     <lb/>
     not offering these observations in criticism 
     <lb/>

     of the hon. gentleman's map, but I am try<lb break="no"/>ing to show the committee, and particularly 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. Lake), that it is much 
     <lb/>
     easier to criticise a distribution map than 
     <lb/>
     it is to frame one. We have had, as I have 
     <lb/>
     already said, from the Conservative mem<lb break="no"/>bers, the most vehement denunciation of 
     <lb/>
     these proposals. The leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition declared that the distribution of Al<lb break="no"/>berta was the worst gerrymander there had 
     <lb/>
     ever been in the world—he could not find 
     <lb/>
     anything to equal it in the United States. 
     <lb/>
     When my hon. friend from Qu'Appelle (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) was criticising the Saskatchewan dis<lb break="no"/>tribution a few evenings ago, he referred to 
     <lb/>
     the last federal redistribution. It may not 
     <lb/>
     be out of order for me to make some obser<lb break="no"/>vations on the redistribution made by this 
     <lb/>
     parliament in 1903. In the first place, who 
     <lb/>
     made the federal redistribution of 1903, so 
     <lb/>
     far as the Northwest Territories are con<lb break="no"/>cerned? Was it the bi-party committee of 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. Minister of Public Works 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Hyman) was chairman ? No. We 
     <lb/>
     have the evidence of the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition himself that the matter of redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion of the Northwest was referred to a com<lb break="no"/>mittee of gentlemen representing the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, senators and members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, representing both sides of poli<lb break="no"/>tics. It did not take us more than fifteen 
     <lb/>
     minutes to reach an agreement. Does the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman think that that redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion was not a fair one? Does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Qu'Appelle claim that it was 
     <lb/>
     unfair? Does the hon. member for Alberta 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Herron) claim that it was unfair?

            <p>

            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Perfectly fair as between 
     <lb/>
     the parties. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. For Alberta. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Yes, and for Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     And perfectly fair as between the north 
     <lb/>
     and south. At that time those who made 
     <lb/>
     that redistribution did not look upon it 
     <lb/>
     as a matter involving a division between 
     <lb/>
     north and south or any difference between 
     <lb/>
     the parties. At that time the northern 
     <lb/>
     part of the country was not looked upon 
     <lb/>
     as more Liberal than the southern part. 
     <lb/>
     I will recall to the memory of members of 
     <lb/>
     that committee—and I think that they will 
     <lb/>
     say that I am stating the facts correctly— 
     <lb/>
     that prior to the 3rd of November, nobody 
     <lb/>
     had any idea that the vote would be as it 
     <lb/>
     proved. In fact many expected that the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) was go<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>
           

     ing to be defeated in the district of Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton. On the other hand the Liberals were 
     <lb/>
     just as confident that they would carry the 
     <lb/>
     district of Alberta as they were that the 
     <lb/>
     Liberals in the person of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior would carry the district of Edmon<lb break="no"/>ton. The 1903 distribution was not looked 
     <lb/>
     upon as a disputed question between the 
     <lb/>
     north and south or as between the parties. 
     <lb/>
     There was in that sub-committee on redis<lb break="no"/>tribution no consideration of party or any 
     <lb/>
     other advantage; we approached the work 
     <lb/>
     with the simple desire to make a fair 
     <lb/>
     and equitable distribution on the basis of 
     <lb/>
     census figures, allowing for expected in<lb break="no"/>crease of population to take place within 
     <lb/>
     the next few years. If hon. gentlemen will 
     <lb/>
     look at the map of this federal distribution, 
     <lb/>
     they will find that there were five southern 
     <lb/>
     seats, as they may be called, south of the 
     <lb/>
     north line of township 34 between the 
     <lb/>
     Rocky Mountains and the elbow of the 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, being about north of Swift 
     <lb/>
     Current, and the line north of township 24 
     <lb/>
     from the elbow of the Saskatchewan to the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba boundary line. And as there 
     <lb/>
     were five constituencies south of that line, 
     <lb/>
     so there were five to the north. I think 
     <lb/>
     every one will admit that that redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion was perfectly fair in a party sense. 
     <lb/>
     That being admitted, let us consider how it 
     <lb/>
     was as between the north and the south. 
     <lb/>
     We find that in two western ridings of the 
     <lb/>
     north district there was a total of 11,000 
     <lb/>
     votes in November, as against 9,000 in the 
     <lb/>
     two ridings in the south district. So, there 
     <lb/>
     was no unfairness to the southern part of 
     <lb/>
     the country in that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. I pointed out, when 
     <lb/>
     discussing this matter before, that the 
     <lb/>
     constituency of Alberta did not go as far 
     <lb/>
     east as the fourth meridian. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. There were two constitu<lb break="no"/>encies in the western part of the north dis<lb break="no"/>trict and two in the western part of the 
     <lb/>
     south district. And the division of 11,000 votes 
     <lb/>
     to the north and 9,000 to the south was 
     <lb/>
     certainly not unfair to the south. I think 
     <lb/>
     that it must be admitted that that redis<lb break="no"/>tribution as adjusted to the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     then known, was a fair and equitable dis<lb break="no"/>tribution. Now, as between the three 
     <lb/>
     north districts in the proposed province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan and the three south districts 
     <lb/>
     in the same, there was a great disparity of 
     <lb/>
     votes on the 3rd of November last. Nobody 
     <lb/>
     expected anything else. Those who pre<lb break="no"/>pared this redistribution expected that there 
     <lb/>
     would be a larger vote in the three ridings 
     <lb/>
     of the south than in the three ridings of the 
     <lb/>
     north ; and that expectation was realized. It 
     <lb/>
     was also expected that the population in the 
     <lb/>
     northern part would thenceforth increase 
     <lb/>
     very much more rapidly than that in the 
     <lb/>
     southern part. And if that expectation was 
     <lb/>
     reasonable two years ago, it is more reason<lb break="no"/>able now, because two lines of railway are 
     <lb/>
     now being constructed across the northern 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="8729" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-04_Page_8729.jpg"/>

     part of the country; and everybody who 
     <lb/>
     knows anything about that country and the 
     <lb/>
     effect upon a new country of railway 
     <lb/>
     construction knows that in the near 
     <lb/>
     future there will be an enormous in<lb break="no"/>crease in the population of the northern 
     <lb/>
     part. I venture to say that at this moment 
     <lb/>
     there is very much less disparity between 
     <lb/>
     the populations of the three northern fed<lb break="no"/>eral constituencies and the three southern 
     <lb/>
     federal constituencies than there was 
     <lb/>
     last November. And it may be that 
     <lb/>
     before this parliament dissolves the lines 
     <lb/>
     will have to be recast, because of there 
     <lb/>
    being a majority of people in the 
     <lb/>north. Now, it is perfectly proper for 
     <lb/>this committee to consider how this local 
     <lb/>distribution fits in with the federal redis<lb break="no"/>tribution of two years ago. And, if we 
     <lb/>keep in mind this line between the north 
     <lb/>and south that I have given, it will be found 
     <lb/>that twenty-six seats are given by this Bill 
     <lb/>to the south five ridings as against twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>two to the north five ridings, the other two 
     <lb/>going to the far north country which, up 
     <lb/>to this moment has been unorganized ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. I may not be able to make that 
     <lb/>as an absolute statement. If we split hairs 
     <lb/>we may find a slightly different result. 
     <lb/>I will take the calculation made the other 
     <lb/>evening by my hon. friend from Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>(Mr. Lake) who stated that the three south 
     <lb/>ridings in Saskatchewan are given thirteen 
     <lb/>and one-half seats as against eleven and 
     <lb/>one-half to the three north ridings. It seems 
     <lb/>to me that if the federal division of three 
     <lb/>to three was a fair division two years ago, 
     <lb/>and is a fair division now, and likely to be 
     <lb/>fair up to the end of this parliament, it can<lb break="no"/>not be contended that there is unfairness 
     <lb/>to the south in the present proposed distri<lb break="no"/>bution of 11 1/2 to 13 1/2. And as a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of fact the map has been amend<lb break="no"/>ed taking one seat from the north and 
     <lb/>giving it to the south. We have then, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to my hon. friend's calculation, 14 1/2 
     <lb/>seats given to the three federal ridings south 
     <lb/>of the dividing line as against 10 1/2 for the 
     <lb/>three north of that line. I might call to 
     <lb/>the attention of the committee the fact 
     <lb/>that a portion of one of the south ridings is 
     <lb/>taken away and put into the province of 
     <lb/>Alberta, the Medicine Hat constituency. 
     <lb/>Thus really the proper calculation would 
     <lb/>show 15 1/2 to the south three ridings as 
     <lb/>against 10 1/2 to the north three. So really 
     <lb/>without splitting hairs it may be stated 
     <lb/>that the south country, the old Assiniboia 
     <lb/>district, is getting 16 seats while only 9 are 
     <lb/>given to the north or Saskatchewan dis<lb break="no"/>trict. I ask any fair-minded person where 
     <lb/>he can find unfairness in this new redis<lb break="no"/>tribution. In 1903 certain areas were 
     <lb/>treated equally, and in this redistribution 
     <lb/>any difference that is being made is largely 
     <lb/>to the advantage of the south country. It 
     <lb/>seems to me it is impossible for any person 
     <lb/>to find any outrage in this. I do not think 
     <lb/>the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Bor<lb break="no"/>
  

            <cb/>
       

     den) will be able to find, in this Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan plan at all events, those evidences of 
     <lb/>
     gerrymander which seemed to bother him 
     <lb/>
     so much in the case of Alberta. It seems to 
     <lb/>
     me it will be difficult for any one to find 
     <lb/>
     in this Saskatchewan redistribution traces 
     <lb/>
     of that Italian hand, of the work of that 
     <lb/>
     Italian gentleman of whom we have heard 
     <lb/>
     so often, Monseigneur Sbarretti. I say that 
     <lb/>
     no cry has ever been uttered in this country 
     <lb/>
     with less justification than the cries in 
     <lb/>
     regard to these plans of redistribution. I 
     <lb/>
     had a brief dispute with the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition one evening with regard to the 
     <lb/>
     question whether or not any parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     body had ever considered the question of 
     <lb/>
     area together with the matter of population 
     <lb/>
     in making a redistribution. I asked my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend how he explained the disparity that 
     <lb/>
     was permitted by this parliament when 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba was first given representation, in 
     <lb/>
     the year 1870. Manitoba was at that time 
     <lb/>
     given four members, when the population of 
     <lb/>
     the province did not entitle it to one member. 
     <lb/>
     A few years later the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies were given representation in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and although their population would 
     <lb/>
     not have entitled them to one member, par<lb break="no"/>liament made provision for four members, 
     <lb/>
     and in like manner when British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     was brought in provision was made for six 
     <lb/>
     members when the population would not 
     <lb/>
     have entitled that province to one third of 
     <lb/>
     that number. My hon. friend took very 
     <lb/>
     strong grounds ; he declared absolutely that 
     <lb/>
     area was never made a basis of representa<lb break="no"/>tion in a redistribution and he challenged 
     <lb/>
     me to produce the contrary evidence. I 
     <lb/>
     have gone to 'Hansard' of the year 1886, 
     <lb/>
     and at page 1205, I find that in the case of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories when the late Sir 
     <lb/>
     John A. Macdonald brought in a Bill to 
     <lb/>
     grant representation to the Territories he 
     <lb/>
     uttered these words:

     Now I wish to repeat that, in my opin<lb break="no"/>ion at all events, all this talk of gerrymander 
     <lb/>
     that has been going on for the last three 
     <lb/>
     or four months, since these plans were 
     <lb/>
     brought down, is pure and arrant nonsense. 
     <lb/>
     If any political advantage was to be found 
     <lb/>
     in these schedules does my hon. friend think 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal journal in Calgary would be 
     <lb/>
     complaining or that the Liberal candidate 
     <lb/>

     in Calgary at the last election, Dr. Stewart, 
     <lb/>
     would be complaining, or that that very pro<lb break="no"/>nounced Conservative journal, the Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     'Journal' would be strongly maintaining 
     <lb/>
     these schedules ? Would we see these 
     <lb/>
     things if any political disadvantage was to 
     <lb/>
     be found in the schedules against the in<lb break="no"/>terests of my hon. friends opposite ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. 
     <lb/>
     McCarthy) took the responsibility one even<lb break="no"/>ing of saying that there was a gerryman<lb break="no"/>der involved in the dividing line selected, 
     <lb/>
     the 4th meridian, but it remains for him or 
     <lb/>
     any other person to show how the political 
     <lb/>
     interests of the Liberals or Conservatives 
     <lb/>
     are affected in any way by the selection 
     <lb/>
     of that line or could be affected by any other 
     <lb/>
     line. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. The fact is, as 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend knows, that two Liberals 
     <lb/>
     were elected in the northern part and two 
     <lb/>
     Conservatives were elected in the southern 
     <lb/>
     part. I made the statement that the line 
     <lb/>
     had been moved too far west, further west 
     <lb/>
     than the point they adopted when dividing 
     <lb/>
     the country two years ago into federal 
     <lb/>
     seats. That was done for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     throwing population to the north. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend thinks the 
     <lb/>
     line should be placed further east? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That would not help his 
     <lb/>
     friend in Southern Alberta. The further 
     <lb/>
     east the line is put the more Liberals you 
     <lb/>
     have. If Alberta had been placed further 
     <lb/>
     east in the redistribution two years ago my 
     <lb/>
    hon. friend (Mr. Herron) would not be 
     <lb/>here. I make this proposition to the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Calgary : He can 
     <lb/>take the map and divide the country 
     <lb/>in any way he chooses, he may ap<lb break="no"/>ply a mathematical rule with regard 
     <lb/>to area or with regard to population and 
     <lb/>see what he gets. Or let my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>set the best expert on gerrymander that he 
     <lb/>has to work on these maps, and I venture to 
     <lb/>say he cannot produce a map in any man<lb break="no"/>ner or shape which will not show a Liberal 
     <lb/>majority in both provinces. What is the 
     <lb/>use of charging gerrymander simply be<lb break="no"/>cause possibly these plans when worked 
     <lb/>out on last fall's vote show a Liberal ma<lb break="no"/>jority in these provinces, if my hon. friend 
     <lb/>cannot produce any map which will not do 
     <lb/>so ? It is not only the northern part that 
     <lb/>is Liberal, even by last fall's vote. It is 
     <lb/>true the north gave a Liberal majority of 
     <lb/>7,000, but the south also gave a Liberal ma<lb break="no"/>jority, and the best possible proof that there 
     <lb/>is no injustice is that in the five south ridings 
     <lb/>there was a Liberal majority of fully 1,000, 
     <lb/>but nevertheless our friends opposite have 
     <lb/>three members to our two. If the lines had 
     <lb/>not been put just where they were some of 
     <lb/>our hon. friends opposite would not have 
     <lb/>been here. If you change Qu'Appelle in 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
 

     almost any conceivable way, take off or add 
     <lb/>
     on a range on the east, or take off or add 
     <lb/>
     on a range on the west, or take off or add 
     <lb/>
     on a line of townships on the north to the 
     <lb/>
     district of Qu'Appelle and my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     would not be here. It is the same with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the member for Alberta, as I have 
     <lb/>
     stated. If he had the whole southern part 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta, the province as produced down 
     <lb/>
     to the 4th meridian, he would not be here 
     <lb/>
     at all. I got a considerably larger majority 
     <lb/>
     in the Medicine Hat country in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta than the total majority upon 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. member sits in this House. 
     <lb/>
     I am going to say that, so far as I am 
     <lb/>
     concerned, I do not propose to attempt to 
     <lb/>
     justify this distribution by the plethora of 
     <lb/>
     figures which were produced in the case of 
     <lb/>
     the Alberta Bill. I shall not attempt to 
     <lb/>
     justify the Saskatchewan schedule on such 
     <lb/>
     a basis, in fact I was discouraged at the 
     <lb/>
     commencement from going into figures by 
     <lb/>
     the action of the hon. member for North 
     <lb/>
     Toronto. The Minister of the Interior pro<lb break="no"/>duced figures with regard to post offices, 
     <lb/>
     school districts, local improvement districts 
     <lb/>
     and all manner of things, but the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) at once 
     <lb/>
     said that these were all nonsense and had 
     <lb/>
     no bearing on the question. so I shall not 
     <lb/>
     attempt to inflict the same figures on the 
     <lb/>
     House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName>. You had better 
     <lb/>
     not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I will say this, that there 
     <lb/>
     never was a redistribution plan presented 
     <lb/>
     in this parliament, or in any provincial par<lb break="no"/>liament in this country, that could be so 
     <lb/>
     absolutely justified as that Alberta redis<lb break="no"/>tribution was justified by the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior. However, there was a very 
     <lb/>
     material difference in the cases of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     and Saskatchewan. In the case of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     ten seats had to be added to fifteen, and it 
     <lb/>
     was necessary to very largely recast the 
     <lb/>
     lines of the old districts as they had existed 
     <lb/>
     for the purposes of representation in the 
     <lb/>
     legislature. In the case of Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand. we were only compelled 
     <lb/>
     to add five to twenty seats, making it a 
     <lb/>
     very materially different proposition. Fol<lb break="no"/>lowing the general plan which was agreed 
     <lb/>
     upon at the outset, of giving incorporated 
     <lb/>
     cities a seat, we found it possible, by allow<lb break="no"/>ing three of the five to go to the north and 
     <lb/>
     two to the south and by putting the two in 
     <lb/>
     the south in the two cities of Regina and 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw, to leave the lines as arranged by 
     <lb/>
     the legislature three years ago absolutely 
     <lb/>
     untouched. There is not a single point of 
     <lb/>
     material change in the whole district of 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia. I would say to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Qu'Appelle that if we take his word 
     <lb/>
     for it, and he has given us his word, that 
     <lb/>
     the distribution made by the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly was as near perfection as it was 
     <lb/>
     possible to make it, we will have to come to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion that the greater part of this 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="8733" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-04_Page_8733.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">8733</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">JULY 4, 1905</fw>
            <fw type="num">8734</fw>
         

     plan—because the greater part applies to 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia—is perfection too. I would ask 
     <lb/>
     the committee, fairly looking at the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, looking at the maps and at the facts 
     <lb/>
     before it if it is not fair to give the north 
     <lb/>
     country three of these five additional seats 
     <lb/>
     and the south country two of these seats ? 
     <lb/>
     The fact is admitted by the committee that 
     <lb/>
     we cannot afford to go on the census of 
     <lb/>
     1901, that the changes since that time have 
     <lb/>
     been too great, and I say it is not fair to 
     <lb/>
     go exactly upon the vote of last fall, be<lb break="no"/>cause there were in some parts of the coun<lb break="no"/>try large blocks of men who, although al<lb break="no"/>ready in the country, had not been there 
     <lb/>
     long enough to enable them to be naturaliz<lb break="no"/>ed, and were therefore not permitted to 
     <lb/>
     vote. We must go to some extent upon 
     <lb/>
     estimate, and the best estimate that can be 
     <lb/>
     made in regard to that part of the country 
     <lb/>
     will be somewhat speculative. I would not 
     <lb/>
     take the responsibility of saying that the 
     <lb/>
     government plan will work out absolutely 
     <lb/>
     fairly. If we may be permitted in two, or 
     <lb/>
     three, or four years hence to get the actual 
     <lb/>
     population within these lines, it may be 
     <lb/>
     found in some surprising ways that the plan 
     <lb/>
     the government asks the House to adopt at 
     <lb/>
     the present moment is not an absolutely 
     <lb/>
     fair plan. I would not say that if we had 
     <lb/>
     given Saskatchewan four of these addi<lb break="no"/>tional members, as was proposed in the first 
     <lb/>
     government plan, that would be found in 
     <lb/>
     the end to work out unfairly, or if we turn<lb break="no"/>ed the proposition around and gave the three 
     <lb/>
     additions to the south and only two to the 
     <lb/>
     north, it might be that in two or three 
     <lb/>
     years hence that would be found to be a 
     <lb/>
     perfectly fair distribution. It must be re<lb break="no"/>membered that we are providing for the 
     <lb/>
     next four years. It must be expected that 
     <lb/>
     the first legislature of the province of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan will live out its life of four years, 
     <lb/>
     and keeping in mind the trend of immigra<lb break="no"/>tion as we have had it in the past, as we 
     <lb/>
     have it at the present time, and as we may 
     <lb/>
     expect to have it, and remembering the new 
     <lb/>
     railway construction in the northern part 
     <lb/>
     of the country, I may say, as a southern 
     <lb/>
     man, as a man who lives in and represents 
     <lb/>
     a southern constituency, that I am prepar<lb break="no"/>ed to agree to the giving of nine of the 
     <lb/>
     seats under this redistribution to the north 
     <lb/>
     as against sixteen to the south. The 
     <lb/>
     point of difference between hon. members 
     <lb/>
     opposite and hon. members on this side of 
     <lb/>
     the House has come down to whether three 
     <lb/>
     of the additional seats should go to the north 
     <lb/>
     country or whether only two of them should 
     <lb/>
     go to the north country, and it may not be 
     <lb/>
     uninteresting for the committee to look at 
     <lb/>
     the history of the Northwest Territories in 
     <lb/>
     so far as representation is concerned. Some 
     <lb/>
     of these figures that I am going to give to 
     <lb/>
     the committee I would call the particular 
     <lb/>
     attention of the hon. leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) to. He may finally come 
     <lb/>
     to the conclusion that there has been in 
     <lb/>
     past years in this country worse things 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
  

     done than ever were done in the United 
     <lb/>
     States in regard to gerrymanders. The first 
     <lb/>
     plan for representation in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories was based purely and entirely 
     <lb/>
     upon population. That was for the election 
     <lb/>
     of members to the old Northwest Council 
     <lb/>
     prior to the creation of the legislature. It 
     <lb/>
     was provided in the original Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories Act that as soon as any area of 
     <lb/>
     1,000 square miles had 1,000 population it 
     <lb/>
     should be made a constituency and elect a 
     <lb/>
     member. Under that plan I find upon look<lb break="no"/>ing at the records that in the year 1885 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia had eight members in the North<lb break="no"/>west Council, Alberta had four and Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan had only one. In 1887 I find that 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia had eight members, Alberta five 
     <lb/>
     and Saskatchewan one. The population of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan only entitled it to one member 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Council. In 1888 this par<lb break="no"/>liament created the first legislative assembly 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories. A Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive government was in power then, and, 
     <lb/>
     strange to say, they made a redistribution 
     <lb/>
     for that legislature. They did not refer the 
     <lb/>
     matter to the courts. That redistribution 
     <lb/>
     was made on this floor. Twenty-two elect<lb break="no"/>ed members were provided for the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, and of these eleven were given to As<lb break="no"/>siniboia, six to Alberta and no less than 
     <lb/>
     five to Saskatchewan. What was the popu<lb break="no"/>lation ? The previous census showed that 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia had 16,408, Alberta 4,871 and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan 1,792, exclusive of Indians. 
     <lb/>
     Those 1,792 people were given five members 
     <lb/>
     as against only six members for the 4,871 
     <lb/>
     people in Alberta and the eleven members 
     <lb/>
     for the 16,408 in Assiniboia. Surely a ter<lb break="no"/>rible outrage was committed there. But 
     <lb/>
     nobody seemed to think it. Nobody said 
     <lb/>
     anything about it. Saskatchewan, in 1888, 
     <lb/>
     was given five members in a house of 
     <lb/>
     twenty-two members on a census population 
     <lb/>
     of 1,792, or an average unit of 358 souls for 
     <lb/>
     each seat ; Alberta was given six members 
     <lb/>
     on a population of 4,871, an average of 812 
     <lb/>
     per seat, or more than 100 per cent differ<lb break="no"/>ence ; while Assiniboia, with eleven mem<lb break="no"/>bers, had a population of 16, 408, with a unit 
     <lb/>
     of roundly 1,500 as against a little more 
     <lb/>
     than 300 for Saskatchewan. On previous 
     <lb/>
     days we have been asked to point to a 
     <lb/>
     parallel case of this parliament provid<lb break="no"/>ing a redistribution for a new provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature. Here is a parallel case. This 
     <lb/>
     parliament did exactly what we are do<lb break="no"/>ing now in 1888 when creating the first 
     <lb/>
     legislature. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. In what year was the census 
     <lb/>
     taken ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Probably in the year 1885. 
     <lb/>
     I may say that I have gleaned these figures 
     <lb/>
     from discussions out of 'Hansard.' That 
     <lb/>
     was a real and terrible outrage, and doubt<lb break="no"/>less the first thing the assembly did when 
     <lb/>
     they got an opportunity was to remedy this 
     <lb/>
     outrage. Five members given to that popu<lb break="no"/>

     lation ! Of course, they represented a very 
     <lb/>
     large portion of the country, and possibly 
     <lb/>
     area was considered, a very heinous offence 
     <lb/>
     in the opinion of the hon. leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position. Surely the Conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernment must have considered the area in 
     <lb/>
     granting five members to 1,700 people. 
     <lb/>
     Well, now, the legislature was convened, 
     <lb/>
     but there was not a word said in the legis<lb break="no"/>lature, as far as I can find, about that awful 
     <lb/>
     outrage ; but, on the contrary, three years 
     <lb/>
     afterwards, although the population of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan had not increased probably any 
     <lb/>
     faster than the population of other parts of 
     <lb/>
     the country, the first legislature in their first 
     <lb/>
     redistribution increased the representation 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan to six members. Possibly 
     <lb/>
     in the year 1891 they had very recent 
     <lb/>
     census figures to guide them. I find that 
     <lb/>
     by the census taken in 1891 Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>
     had a population of 11,150, Alberta 25,277 
     <lb/>
     and Assiniboia 30,372. Saskatchewan was 
     <lb/>
     given six members by the legislature, not 
     <lb/>
     by this parliament, with an average of 1,858 
     <lb/>
    souls per seat, while Assiniboia was 
     <lb/>given eleven seats on a population 
     <lb/>of 30,372, or an average of 2,531, 
     <lb/>while Alberta was held down to 8 seats 
     <lb/>with a population of 25,277, or an average 
     <lb/>of 3,159, or pretty nearly 100 per cent there 
     <lb/>again, done by the legislature itself. I find 
     <lb/>that sixteen years ago this parliament gave 
     <lb/>Saskatchewan a representation of 5 seats 
     <lb/>out of 22, with a unit of only 358 popula<lb break="no"/>tion as against Assiniboia's unit of no less 
     <lb/>than 1,500. And 13 years ago the legisla<lb break="no"/>ture itself gave Saskatchewan a represen<lb break="no"/>tation of 6 out of a total of 26 seats with a 
     <lb/>unit of only 1,858 as against Alberta's unit 
     <lb/>of 3,159. Now we are giving the same dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Saskatchewan out of practically 50 
     <lb/>—because keeping in mind the province of 
     <lb/>Alberta we are dealing with the whole Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory—we are giving the Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>area 9 seats out of a total of 50. I find 
     <lb/>upon making a calculation—like my hon. 
     <lb/>friend (Mr. Lake) I would not be willing to 
     <lb/>swear to the last figure of this calculation, 
     <lb/>but roughly speaking it is correct—we are 
     <lb/>giving the Saskatchewan area 9 seats with 
     <lb/>a unit of roundly 2,850 population as against 
     <lb/>a unit of 3,250 for the balance of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, if we take the last census, or a unit 
     <lb/>of 830 votes cast as against a unit of 930 
     <lb/>votes cast in the balance of the Territories, 
     <lb/>if we take the vote last fall. If there was no 
     <lb/>outrage perpetrated by this parliament in 
     <lb/>1888 and no outrage perpetrated by the leg<lb break="no"/>islature 3 years later, it seems to me it 
     <lb/>will be difficult to work up an outrage 
     <lb/>out of what is being proposed in this Bill. 
     <lb/>My hon. friend (Mr. Lake) has referred to 
     <lb/>some of the alternative propositions which 
     <lb/>were made at this recent conference be<lb break="no"/>tween himself and his leader and some 
     <lb/>members on this side of the House. He 
     <lb/>complained very grievously in his criticism 
     <lb/>the other evening against the disparities 
     <lb/>not only between the north and the south, 
     <lb/>but against the disparities that existed in 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     the part of the new province which is com<lb break="no"/>posed by the old district of Assiniboia ; or 
     <lb/>
     at all events some of his complaints were 
     <lb/>
     based upon discrepancies which we find do 
     <lb/>
     exist even in that perfect distribution which 
     <lb/>
     was made by the assembly three years ago. 
     <lb/>
     He complained that Moosejaw had a very 
     <lb/>
     large area and a disproportionately large 
     <lb/>
     population. That is being remedied by this 
     <lb/>
     Bill. A seat is taken from the north and is 
     <lb/>
     given to the city of Moosejaw, leaving the 
     <lb/>
     district of Moosejaw in a fairly average 
     <lb/>
     position so far as population and votes cast 
     <lb/>
     is concerned. He complained also that cer<lb break="no"/>tain of the other districts, Souris, Cannington 
     <lb/>
     and South Qu'Appelle, had disproportionate 
     <lb/>
     votes compared with some other districts, 
     <lb/>
     and what he said in that regard was per<lb break="no"/>fectly true. But I think my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) himself will be the first to admit that 
     <lb/>
     there was no disadvantage to the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party in any of these disparities to which 
     <lb/>
     he drew pointed attention. Take the district 
     <lb/>
     of Souris and the district of Cannington, 
     <lb/>
     which have a large population, these are the 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country in which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from East Assiniboia (Mr. Turriff) got his 
     <lb/>
     majority last fall, and even the fact that 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw had a disproportionate vote and 
     <lb/>
     a disproportionate population did not in<lb break="no"/>volve any disadvantage to the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party, because Moosejaw is a part of the 
     <lb/>
     country which never gave anything else 
     <lb/>
     but a Liberal majority since it has ex<lb break="no"/>isted. However, when the conference met, 
     <lb/>
     recognizing very clearly that there were un<lb break="no"/>fair disparities in the old district of Assini<lb break="no"/>boia under the assembly's plan, and some of 
     <lb/>
     these disparities being such that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the local communities have sent down 
     <lb/>
     grievous complaints, I took it upon myself 
     <lb/>
     to suggest that even if we gave 9 seats to 
     <lb/>
     the north and held the south down to 16 
     <lb/>
     seats, that did not compel us to have these 
     <lb/>
     disparities remain if we could arrive at an 
     <lb/>
     agreement as to the remedy. I suggested 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend (Mr. Lake) that there was 
     <lb/>
     a part of the country on the main line of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway to the east<lb break="no"/>ern part of the province where the assemb<lb break="no"/>ly's redistribution left the area very small, 
     <lb/>
     where also the vote last fall was compara<lb break="no"/>tively small, and where the most reliable in<lb break="no"/>formation that we can get goes to show 
     <lb/>
     that the population increase is almost in<lb break="no"/>finitesimal in comparison with the increase 
     <lb/>
     in other parts of the country. I sug<lb break="no"/>gested that there were four districts. Mooso<lb break="no"/>min, Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseley, 
     <lb/>
     which might very fairly be put into three 
     <lb/>
     districts and that would enable us to pro<lb break="no"/>vide a new district in the Soo line country 
     <lb/>
     with regard to which my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     made complaint. I may say that I have 
     <lb/>
     taken the liberty of drawing a map show<lb break="no"/>ing these changes. The officials of the de<lb break="no"/>partment so far have been too busy to draw 
     <lb/>
     up the schedule to describe this map, but 
     <lb/>
     I think I can give in a very few moments 
     <lb/>
     a brief statement of the changes I propose 
     <lb/>
     

            <pb n="8737" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-04_Page_8737.jpg"/>

     from the government map. Maple Creek 
     <lb/>
     is an enormous district in area, and I think 
     <lb/>
     it would be fair to cut it down a little, and 
     <lb/>
     so I propose to take off three ranges from 
     <lb/>
     the easterly edge and throw these three 
     <lb/>
     ranges into the district of Moosejaw. I 
     <lb/>
     think the district of Moosejaw can very 
     <lb/>
     well stand the addition of these three ranges. 
     <lb/>
     I change the northern boundaries of the 
     <lb/>
     districts of Maple Creek and Moosejaw from 
     <lb/>
     the north line of township 27 to the north 
     <lb/>
     line of township 26, thus taking an addition<lb break="no"/>al line of townships off Maple Creek and off 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw and adding that line of townships 
     <lb/>
     to the northern districts, Battleford, Saska<lb break="no"/>toon and Batoche. Coming to the other 
     <lb/>
     part of the map I propose to add a range 
     <lb/>
     line to the district of Moosomin on the west 
     <lb/>
     side, taking it off the district of Whitewood. 
     <lb/>
     Coming over to the district of Wolseley I 
     <lb/>
     propose to take a range line off Grenfell and 
     <lb/>
     add it on to Wolseley, and then throw the 
     <lb/>
     districts of Whitewood and Grenfell into 
     <lb/>
     one. Thus I propose to make four districts 
     <lb/>
     into three. I propose to remedy the griev<lb break="no"/>ance with regard to Souris and Cannington 
     <lb/>
     by cutting off four ranges from the west of 
     <lb/>
     these districts. Then I propose to draw a 
     <lb/>
     line through the district of South Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle on the north line of township 10. 
     <lb/>
     These portions taken off the districts of 
     <lb/>
     Cannington, Souris and the south part of 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle will form a new Soo line dis<lb break="no"/>trict, according to the suggestion of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Mr. Lake). 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. How far west does that dis<lb break="no"/>trict go? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I propose also to take two 
     <lb/>
     ranges off the district of South Regina. By 
     <lb/>
     this map South Regina would lose two 
     <lb/>
     ranges on the east side up as far as the 
     <lb/>
     north line of township 10. I have already 
     <lb/>
     said that we should not go on the population 
     <lb/>
     of last census as a basis, and I do not think 
     <lb/>
     it would be fair to go entirely on the vote 
     <lb/>
     last fall. I think the committee will agree 
     <lb/>
     with me that possibly the fairest basis that 
     <lb/>
     can be obtained is to take the census 
     <lb/>
     population together with the homestead en<lb break="no"/>tries that have been made in the various 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country since the census was 
     <lb/>
     taken four years ago; calculate that each 
     <lb/>
     entry is worth so many people, say three if 
     <lb/>
     you like; multiply each homestead entry 
     <lb/>
     by three, and by that means we will, arrive 
     <lb/>
     fairly at what is the present population of 
     <lb/>
     these various parts of the country. Does 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Qu'Appelle suggest that 
     <lb/>
     that is not a fair method? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Certainly it is not a fair 
     <lb/>
     basis, to consider that a homestead entry in 
     <lb/>
     a new district will bring as many people 
     <lb/>
     into the country proportionately as a home<lb break="no"/>stead entry in an old district. It is not a 
     <lb/>
     fair basis for showing the increase of the 
     <lb/>
     population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I think the committee will 
     <lb/>
     agree with me that it is an approximately 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
     
     fair basis. We cannot arrive at the abso<lb break="no"/>lute facts with regard to the present popu<lb break="no"/>lation of that country. If we find a number 
     <lb/>
     of homestead entries in a particular area, 
     <lb/>
     and calculate that each entry will account 
     <lb/>
     for a certain number of people, and apply 
     <lb/>
     the same rule in all parts of the 
     <lb/>
     country we shall not be very far out. I 
     <lb/>
     find that in these four districts of Moo<lb break="no"/>somin, Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseley, 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friend thinks is so 
     <lb/>
     unfair to suggest should be thrown into 
     <lb/>
     three, there was a census population in 
     <lb/>
     1901 as follows : Moosomin, 5,163 ; White<lb break="no"/>wood, 3,733 ; Grenfell, 3,956 ; Wolseley, 
     <lb/>
     4,059 ; making a total of 16,911. There have 
     <lb/>
     been homestead entries in these four dis<lb break="no"/>tricts since the census was taken as fol<lb break="no"/>lows : In Moosomin, 631 ; in Whitewood, 
     <lb/>
     690 ; in Grenfell, 1,038 ; in Wolseley, 1,131 ; 
     <lb/>
     a total of 3,490. Now, I propose to multiply 
     <lb/>
     these homestead entries by three, and I get 
     <lb/>
     this result—that the homestead entries mean 
     <lb/>
     an addition to the population in these four 
     <lb/>
     districts since the census was taken of 
     <lb/>
     10,470. Add that to the census population, 
     <lb/>
     we get 27,421 as an estimated present popu<lb break="no"/>lation in these four districts. I may say that 
     <lb/>
     these four districts cast an aggregate vote 
     <lb/>
     last fall of 5,071. If we make them into 
     <lb/>
     three districts, we shall have a population 
     <lb/>
     unit of 9,140, and an average vote cast last 
     <lb/>
     fall in each of the three districts of 1,690. 
     <lb/>
     Now, my hon. friend objected very strongly 
     <lb/>
     to my proposition to make four districts out 
     <lb/>
     of Souris, Cannington and Qu'Appelle. I 
     <lb/>
     am going to present the same calculation in 
     <lb/>
     regard to them. The census population of 
     <lb/>
     these three districts in 1901 was as follows : 
     <lb/>
     Souris, 5,704; Cannington, 3,485; Qu'Appelle, 
     <lb/>
     5,530 ; a total of 14,719. There have been 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries made in these districts 
     <lb/>
     as follows : In Souris, 2,998 ; in Cannington, 
     <lb/>
     2,354 ; in Qu'Appelle, 2,865 ; a total of 8,217, 
     <lb/>
     as against a total of 3,490 in my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's four districts. Multiply this total 
     <lb/>
     of homestead entries by three, and we get 
     <lb/>
     an estimated increase of population in these 
     <lb/>
     three districts of 24,651. Add that to the 
     <lb/>
     total census population of 14,719, and we get 
     <lb/>
     a present estimated population for these 
     <lb/>
     three districts of 39,370 as against 27,421 in 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend's four districts which I pro<lb break="no"/>pose to make into three. Now, if I make 
     <lb/>
     these three districts into four, there will be 
     <lb/>
     a population unit for each of the four dis<lb break="no"/>tricts of 9,842 as against a population unit 
     <lb/>
     of 9,140 for each of the three districts which 
     <lb/>
     I make out of the four districts of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend ; and I find that last fall we had 
     <lb/>
     an average vote in each of the four districts 
     <lb/>
     which I make out of these three districts of 
     <lb/>
     1,889 as against an average vote in each of 
     <lb/>
     the three districts which I make out of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend's four districts of 1,690. Does 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend tell me that that is not fair ? 
     <lb/>
     Does he tell me that the suggestion he has 
     <lb/>
     made is a more equitable one ? His districts 
     <lb/>
     are less in area, less in votes cast, less in 
     <lb/>

     registered votes, less in homestead entries, 
     <lb/>
     less in every respect, than the three dis<lb break="no"/>tricts out of which I propose to get an 
     <lb/>
     additional district for the purpose of the 
     <lb/>
     new population on the Soo line. My iron. 
     <lb/>
     friend says these four districts are old 
     <lb/>
     settlements. So they are; but what does 
     <lb/>
     he propose to do ? He proposes to get a 
     <lb/>
     district for that Soo line country from just 
     <lb/>
     as old a settlement as the district he is 
     <lb/>
     speaking about. He proposes to take the 
     <lb/>
     district of Lumsden, which polled a vote 
     <lb/>
     last fall considerably larger than the votes 
     <lb/>
     polled in some of these four districts which 
     <lb/>
     he has taken under his care, and which 
     <lb/>
     has so large an area that you could put 
     <lb/>
     almost the whole of those four districts 
     <lb/>
     into it, and which had about four times 
     <lb/>
     the number of homestead entries since 
     <lb/>
     the census was taken of any single one of 
     <lb/>
     those four districts of his, and he proposes 
     <lb/>
     to take twenty-one townships just south of 
     <lb/>
     Regina, the most thickly settled in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, and add them to the 
     <lb/>
     district of Lumsden ; and he calls that fair. 
     <lb/>
     He calls that leaving undisturbed the old 
     <lb/>
     settled areas. I have occupied the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the committee a great deal longer than 
     <lb/>
     I should have done or than I had any in<lb break="no"/>tention of doing. As we sometimes do the 
     <lb/>
     work in committee by conversation more 
     <lb/>
     than by set speech, some of the other in<lb break="no"/>formation which I have may more properly 
     <lb/>
     be presented in that way.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The curious part 
     <lb/>
     of the schedule proposed for the new pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Saskatchewan is that every one of 
     <lb/>
     the arguments made by hon. gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House, and especially 
     <lb/>
     by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior, in the case of Alberta, is ab<lb break="no"/>solutely destructive of 'the schedule now 
     <lb/>
     proposed. In Alberta reliance was placed 
     <lb/>
     by this side of the House upon the federal 
     <lb/>
     distribution of 1903. A resolution based 
     <lb/>
     upon it was voted down. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has just spoken relies upon it in 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan. Reliance was placed by the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister and the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior on the principle that electors in rural 
     <lb/>
     constituencies should have a greater voice 
     <lb/>
     in the legislature than those in urban con<lb break="no"/>stituencies. That principle has been shown 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend from Qu' Appelle to have 
     <lb/>
     been entirely cast aside in the proposed dis<lb break="no"/>tribution. Reliance was then placed on the 
     <lb/>
     voters' lists, coupled with information de<lb break="no"/>rived from the number of schools, the num<lb break="no"/>ber of post offices, and the number of home<lb break="no"/>stead entries. If you take the voters' lists, 
     <lb/>
     the schools, the post offices and the home<lb break="no"/>stead entries, you will find that this pro<lb break="no"/>posed distributiop cannot be sustained as 
     <lb/>
     an equitable divisron for one moment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Take the census of 1901, which was relied 
     <lb/>
     upon to some extent in Alberta, and apply 
     <lb/>
     it to this, and you have most extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     results. In other words. if you take all the 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
  

     information and data, which were used for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of supporting the Alberta di<lb break="no"/>vision and apply it to Saskatchewan, 
     <lb/>
     you have the best possible argument to 
     <lb/>
     show that the latter is absolutely unfair, 
     <lb/>
     unjust and improper. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) has gone over the 
     <lb/>
     whole subject so thoroughly that not very 
     <lb/>
     much needs to be said in addition. Let us 
     <lb/>
     just take two illustrations—the district of, 
     <lb/>
     Humboldt and the district of Souris. You 
     <lb/>
     will find that by the census of 1901 there 
     <lb/>
     were 582 souls in Humboldt and 5,704 in 
     <lb/>
     Souris, or nearly ten times the population 
     <lb/>
     in the one that is contained in the other. 
     <lb/>
     Each one of these is given a member. If 
     <lb/>
     you eliminate the Indians, you find the com<lb break="no"/>parison still worse. Humboldt had in 1901 
     <lb/>
     a population of 271 souls and Souris a popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 5,704. Each one of these districts 
     <lb/>
     is now entitled to a representative. Take 
     <lb/>
     the votes recorded—178 in Humboldt, 2,554 
     <lb/>
     in Souris; votes registered, 298 in Humboldt, 
     <lb/>
     3,348 in Souris. Between these two ex<lb break="no"/>tremes you have every possibly variety of 
     <lb/>
     constituency that can be imagined, both as 
     <lb/>
     regards area and population. Another prin<lb break="no"/>ciple which has been absolutely cast to the 
     <lb/>
     winds is the supposed principle, relied upon 
     <lb/>
     in the case of Alberta, that the area was to 
     <lb/>
     be taken. into consideration—that a consti<lb break="no"/>tuency with a very large area might be en<lb break="no"/>titled to a representative although it had 
     <lb/>
     a comparatively small population. Well. 
     <lb/>
     observe numbers 16 and 17. Number 16, 
     <lb/>
     Maple Creek, with votes polled to the num<lb break="no"/>ber of 8-16 and registered to the number of 
     <lb/>
     1,198, and an area of 20,699 square miles, 
     <lb/>
     is given one member. Humboldt, with 
     <lb/>
     178 votes polled, 298 registered, and an 
     <lb/>
     area of 7,057 square miles, or about one— 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     third the area of the other, is given one 
     <lb/>
     member.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ADAM2">Mr. ADAMSON</persName>. Are you aware of the 
     <lb/>
     present population of Humboldt ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>: I am not aware of 
     <lb/>
     it nor has any one been able to state it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ADAM2">Mr. ADAMSON</persName>. I can state that the 
     <lb/>
     present population of Humboldt is between 
     <lb/>
     8,000 and 10,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. We are bound to 
     <lb/>
     give the hon. gentleman's statement all the 
     <lb/>
     consideration it deserves; but when we 
     <lb/>
     are told that a population of perhaps 1,500 
     <lb/>
     has increased in less than a year to 8,000 or 
     <lb/>
     10,000, that affords the best possible reason 
     <lb/>
     for having the delimitation determined by 
     <lb/>
     a tribunal which could investigate the ac<lb break="no"/>curacy of such statements. We do not want 
     <lb/>
    to delimit these constituencies accord<lb break="no"/>ing to what one or another may tell 
     <lb/>us some unnamed person has told 
     <lb/>him. We heard from the Minister 
     <lb/>of the Interior that some unnamed person 
     <lb/>had told him there were 5,000 persons, ex<lb break="no"/>clusive of Indians, in that portion of Atha<lb break="no"/>baska to be included in the new province 
     <lb/>of Alberta. We have no evidence beyond

     that statement. I am willing to give my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend's statement every consideration, 
     <lb/>
    but I have yet to learn that he is absolutely 
     <lb/>infallible in these matters, which are mat<lb break="no"/>ters of opinion and not of personal knowl<lb break="no"/>edge. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ADAM2">Mr. ADAMSON</persName>. I have been frequently 
     <lb/>
     through that district on business. The 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries will show there must have 
     <lb/>
     been a large influx of settlers. There are 
     <lb/>
     now four towns there. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Very good, let us 
     <lb/>
     take the homestead entries, and we find a 
     <lb/>
     very great discrepancy in the representation 
     <lb/>
     given to the 16 and the 9 constituencies. 
     <lb/>
     There are 31,000 homestead entries in the 
     <lb/>
     16 constituencies in the south as compared 
     <lb/>
     with 17,424 in the 9 constituencies in the 
     <lb/>
     north, yet not very much regard seems to 
     <lb/>
     have been attached to that consideration in 
     <lb/>
     the making out of this schedule. Although 
     <lb/>
     we have a population nearly three times 
     <lb/>
     greater, according, to the census of 1901, in 
     <lb/>
     the south we have 16 members allotted 
     <lb/>
     to one portion of the province and 9 
     <lb/>
     to the other. Assuming that the popula<lb break="no"/>tion has increased in the same ratio as the 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries, we would not find any 
     <lb/>
     change such as would justify the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion the government proposes to make. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Is not the proportion of 
     <lb/>
     9 members to 17,000 homestead entries just 
     <lb/>
     about the same as 16 members to 31,000 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Suppose it is, that 
     <lb/>
     would seem to indicate that the population 
     <lb/>
     in the south has increased as much as in the 
     <lb/>
     north. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Would not that also in<lb break="no"/>dicate that 9 members for the 17,000 is the 
     <lb/>
     same proportion as for the 31,000 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Not at all. The 
     <lb/>
     population of the 9 constituencies, as I have 
     <lb/>
     heard my hon. friend from Qu'Appelle (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) give it, was about 26,000 according to 
     <lb/>
     the census of 1901, out of a total of 90,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. That would be for Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, but these 9 take in a consider<lb break="no"/>able portion of Assiniboia as well, which 
     <lb/>
     would not be considered as belonging to the 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The population was exclu<lb break="no"/>sive of Indians, 20,769 in Saskatchewan, and 
     <lb/>
     61,008 in Assiniboia. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The difference to 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. gentleman has just referred 
     <lb/>
     would not very much affect the result of the 
     <lb/>
     calculation. You have a population of 
     <lb/>
     20,000 against a population of 61,000. You 
     <lb/>
     have homestead entries in the north to the 
     <lb/>
     number of 17,424 and in the south to the 
     <lb/>
     number of 31,611. The inevitable result is 
     <lb/>
     that if you base a distribution upon the 
     <lb/>
     population, according to the census of 1901, 
     <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
        

     and according to the subsequent homestead 
     <lb/>
     entries, you could not possibly arrive at any 
     <lb/>
     such result as that which the government 
     <lb/>
     is attempting to embody in the proposed 
     <lb/>
     schedule. Let us take their number of post 
     <lb/>
     offices, on which great reliance was placed 
     <lb/>
     in the case of Alberta. There are 100 in 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan and 285 in Assiniboia. Then 
     <lb/>
     take the schools, upon which the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior placed perhaps the strongest 
     <lb/>
     reliance and so did the First Minister, when 
     <lb/>
     dealing with Alberta—according to a re<lb break="no"/>turn brought down to the House from the 
     <lb/>
     government of the Territories, there are 
     <lb/>
     200 schools in Saskatchewan and 575 in 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia. Base it on any information 
     <lb/>
     you like, you cannot work out any such 
     <lb/>
     result as that which the government de<lb break="no"/>sires to enforce in making its distribution. 
     <lb/>
     I have looked over, with some interest, 
     <lb/>
     the proposal which my hon. friend from Qu'<lb break="no"/>Appelle (Mr. Lake) has submitted to the com<lb break="no"/>mittee as a basis of what may be accom<lb break="no"/>plished if you propose to distribute the 
     <lb/>
     seats in Saskatchewan upon an even basis 
     <lb/>
     of population. He has divided the province 
     <lb/>
     into 25 constituencies. I observe that the 
     <lb/>
     least number of voters which he gives 
     <lb/>
     to any constituency is 1,200, and the 
     <lb/>
     highest 1,825. The average in 16 constitu<lb break="no"/>encies in the southern part of the province 
     <lb/>
     is 1,550, and in the 9 constituencies in the 
     <lb/>
     northern part of the province, 1,425. There 
     <lb/>
     is not, it is true, absolute equality of popu<lb break="no"/>lation. It would be difficult, if not impos<lb break="no"/>sible to work that out. But when you con<lb break="no"/>sider 1,200 on the voters' list in the lowest 
     <lb/>
     division and 1,825 in the highest division, 
     <lb/>
     and compare that with what is proposed by 
     <lb/>
     the government with respect to Humboldt 
     <lb/>
     and Redberry on the one hand and Souris 
     <lb/>
     and South Qu'Appelle on the other hand, it 
     <lb/>
     seems to me absolutely obvious that it is 
     <lb/>
     possible without any difficulty, to make 
     <lb/>
     a fairer and more equitable distribution of 
     <lb/>
     seats in this province than is proposed by 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. I regret that the efforts made to 
     <lb/>
     bring about some compromise with regard to 
     <lb/>
     this vexed matter have not been successful. 
     <lb/>
     I am bound to say that I think that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Qu'Appelle is not in fault 
     <lb/>
     in that regard, because while he has strong 
     <lb/>
     opinions on this question, I have always 
     <lb/>
     found him moderate in his views and wil<lb break="no"/>ling to accept any reasonable compromise. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that the distribution proposed 
     <lb/>
     by the government in Saskatchewan is any 
     <lb/>
     better than that in Alberta. I say that for 
     <lb/>
     the information of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). I think that 
     <lb/>
     they are very much alike, except that, if 
     <lb/>
     possible, there is even a greater discrepancy 
     <lb/>
     between Humboldt and Souris in Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan than any that is to be found in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta, if we accept the evid<lb break="no"/>ence of the Minister of the Interior as to 
     <lb/>
     the northern ridings of the province. It is 
     <lb/>
     perfectly obvious that no principle was 
     <lb/>
     selected in the first place upon which these 
     <lb/>

     provinces should be divided into constitu<lb break="no"/>encies. There was a delimitation made of      
     <lb/>
     Alberta, and then principles were sought         
     <lb/>
     upon which to base that distribution. There           
     <lb/>
    was a delimitation of Saskatchewan and 
     <lb/>entirely different principles are invoked to 
     <lb/>support it. It seems obvious that in each 
     <lb/>case the redistribution was made first and 
     <lb/>the principles to justify it sought after<lb break="no"/>wards.

     to show that the schedule submitted by the 
     <lb/>
     government works an injustice to the 
     <lb/>
     south as against the north. He does 
     <lb/>
     not complain that the government has 
     <lb/>
     made a gerrymander in the ordinary 
     <lb/>
     sense of the word—that is, that it 
     <lb/>
     has hived the Conservatives in the north in 
     <lb/>
     order to enable the surrounding districts 
     <lb/>
     to return Liberals. His whole complaint 
     <lb/>
     is against the representation given to the 
     <lb/>
     north as against that given to the south. 
     <lb/>
     And he has, as has already been stated, 
     <lb/>
     submitted a schedule of his own under 
     <lb/>
     which two seats which are given to the 
     <lb/>
     north according to the government schedule 
     <lb/>
     are taken away from the north and given 
     <lb/>
     to the south. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, let us see where we stand in this 
     <lb/>
     matter and what are the conditions fronting 
     <lb/>
     us as a committee in distributing the dis<lb break="no"/>tricts of the province of Saskatchewan. We 
     <lb/>
     find that the Northwest Territories are divid<lb break="no"/>ed into two provinces, the dividing line be<lb break="no"/>ing the 4th meridian. In the province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, there were, according to the 
     <lb/>
     territorial redistribution, twenty seats out of 
     <lb/>
      thirty-five in the territorial legislature. And 
     <lb/>
     we also find that, according to this Bill, 
     <lb/>
     we are to give twenty-five seats to the new 
     <lb/>
     province of Saskatchewan. So, the task 
     <lb/>
     before us is to divide the province of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan in such a way that it will have 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five seats distributed as fairly as pos<lb break="no"/>sible. My hon. friend (Mr. Lake) has made 
     <lb/>
     his comparisons as between the north and 
     <lb/>
     the south, and he has taken as his divid<lb break="no"/>ing line the line between the old districts 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Now, I pro<lb break="no"/>pose to make several comparisons between 
     <lb/>
     the north and the south, but I do not pro<lb break="no"/>pose to follow the line heretofore followed 
     <lb/>
     and take the district of Saskatchewan as 
     <lb/>
     the north and the district of Assiniboia as 
     <lb/>
     the south. It seems to me that that is a 
     <lb/>
     most unfair way to divide the two dis<lb break="no"/>tricts into north and south. I am going 
     <lb/>
     on another basis. I find that in the Haul<lb break="no"/>tain redistribution of 1902 there were 
     <lb/>
     twenty seats in the new province of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan. My hon. friend from Qu'<lb break="no"/>Appelle (Mr. Lake) and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     from Calgary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) have 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
      

     stated to this committee that the<lb/>Haultain redistribution of 1902 was<lb/>absolutely fair and just. Well, I am pre<lb break="no"/>pared to take it as a basis. I will take<lb/>the ten southern seats according to that 
     <lb/>
     redistribution and the ten northern seats, 
     <lb/>
     and then I will endeavour to ascertain into 
     <lb/>
     which of these districts—the ten northern 
     <lb/>
     seats or the ten southern seats— we ought 
     <lb/>
     to put a majority of the new seats which 
     <lb/>
     are to be given to the province of Saskat<lb break="no"/>chewan. We have five new seats to be 
     <lb/>
     added to the twenty under the Haultain 
     <lb/>
     redistribution, and the question, to my mind, 
     <lb/>
     is where should these seats be put in order 
     <lb/>
     to make a fair distribution. Now, if the 
     <lb/>
     ten northern seats show a vastly greater 
     <lb/>
     increase in population than do the ten south<lb break="no"/>ern seats, it is reasonable that the majority 
     <lb/>
     of the five should go to the north. If the 
     <lb/>
     ten southern seats show the greater 
     <lb/>
     increase of population, the bulk of the 
     <lb/>
     five seats should go to the south. 
     <lb/>
     The ten southern seats are as follows : 
     <lb/>
     Souris, Cannington, Moosomin, Whitewood, 
     <lb/>
     Grenfell, Wolseley, South Qu'Appelle, South 
     <lb/>
     Regina, Moosejaw, and Maple Creek, 
     <lb/>
     I call these the ten southern seats 
     <lb/>
     for the following reason : They are the 
     <lb/>
     ten seats which touch the southern bound<lb break="no"/>ary line of the new province or are the 
     <lb/>
     nearest to it according to the Haultain dis<lb break="no"/>tribution. They correspond practically to 
     <lb/>
     the three southern seats of the federal redis<lb break="no"/>tribution of two years ago. Maple Creek, 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw and South Regina are in the dis<lb break="no"/>trict represented by my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). The other 
     <lb/>
     districts correspond very closely to the dis<lb break="no"/>trict represented by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for East Assiniboia (Mr. Turriff). The ten 
     <lb/>
     northern seats correspond very closely to 
     <lb/>
     the northern seats as laid down by the 
     <lb/>
     federal redistribution. Whatever difference 
     <lb/>
     there may be is in favour of the south. I 
     <lb/>
     find the actual difference to be that there 
     <lb/>
     are 124 townships which should belong to 
     <lb/>
     the north that are included in the south in 
     <lb/>
     the eastern part of the territory, and 264 
     <lb/>
     townships that should belong to the south 
     <lb/>
     are included in the north in the western 
     <lb/>
     part of the territory. So that there are 
     <lb/>
     140 townships, according to that calculation 
     <lb/>
     in favour of the south. Now then the 
     <lb/>
     question is, do these ten southern districts 
     <lb/>
     show a larger increase of population since 
     <lb/>
     the Haultain redistribution than the ten 
     <lb/>
     northern seats. I have based my calcu<lb break="no"/>lation upon the census population of 1901 
     <lb/>
     and upon the homestead entries since, for 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding what my hon. friend for 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) may say, it does seem 
     <lb/>
     to me that the homestead entries form one of 
     <lb/>
     the soundest bases on which to calculate po<lb break="no"/>pulation. Have there been more homestead 
     <lb/>
     entries since 1901 in the ten northern than 
     <lb/>
     in the 10 southern districts ? I find the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing :

            <p>
      Of homestead entries since 1901 we have, 
     <lb/>
    roughly speaking, 30,000 in the north and 
     <lb/>18,000 in the south. If that is a fair basis 
     <lb/>—and I submit it is a fair basis—then the 
     <lb/>fairest division of the five new seats we 
     <lb/>can make is to give to those ten northern 
     <lb/>seats, in which there is an increase of 30,<lb break="no"/>000 homestead entries, three seats, and to 
     <lb/>the southern group, in which there is an in<lb break="no"/>crease of 18,000 homestead entries, two 
     <lb/>seats. This is still giving an advantage to 
     <lb/>the south. There cannot be any dispute as 
     <lb/>to these figures, because they are official, and 
     <lb/>there is a reason why the increased popula<lb break="no"/>tion should appear in the north. Those 
     <lb/>who are familiar with the country unhesi<lb break="no"/>tatingly say that the increase of population 
     <lb/>during the last three or four years has been 
     <lb/>largely in the north, and the reason, as was 
     <lb/>pointed out by the hon. member for West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia (Mr. Scott), is that in the north two 
     <lb/>lines of railway have practically been built 
     <lb/>—the main line of the Canadian Northern 
     <lb/>running right across the province, and the 
     <lb/>northern branch of the Canadian Northern 
     <lb/>from Erwood, which is now built up to 
     <lb/>within a few miles of Prince Albert. Then, 
     <lb/>too, the Grand Trunk Pacific line has been 
     <lb/>surveyed there, and every one knows that 
     <lb/>a great number of settlers have gone in 
     <lb/>along that survey and taken up homesteads. 
     <lb/>As a matter of fact, we know that the north<lb break="no"/>ern country has progressed much more 
     <lb/>rapidly than the south. We know that from 
     <lb/>the homestead entries, which demonstrate be<lb break="no"/>yond question the fact that the settlement in 
     <lb/>the north is proceeding much more rapidly 
     <lb/>than in the south. Therefore,taking the home<lb break="no"/>stead entries as a basis, 30,000 as against 
     <lb/>18,000, it seems to me that no fairer distri<lb break="no"/>bution of the additional representation could 
     <lb/>be made than to give three to the north 
     <lb/>and two to the south. I have estimated the 
     <lb/>population upon these figures, and have 
     <lb/>taken the same basis as the hon. member 
     <lb/>for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) ; for each 
     <lb/>homestead entry I have allowed three per<lb break="no"/>sons, and I have added to that the census 
     <lb/>population of 1901. I find, according to 
     <lb/>that calculation, in the ten southern districts 
     <lb/>the present estimated population is 92,254, 
     <lb/>while in the ten northern districts the esti<lb break="no"/>mated population is 141,646. These figures 
     <lb/>not only justify the distribution of three new 
     <lb/>seats in the north as against two in the 
     <lb/>south, but taking into cousideration its 
     <lb/>prospective increase of population, it cer<lb break="no"/>tainly would justify four in the north and 
     <lb/>one in the south, as in the government's 
     <lb/>first schedule. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     I shall compare a few of the figures that 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     

     have been given for the northern and the<lb/>southern seats.  I might point out that my<lb/>hon. friend for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) pro<lb break="no"/>poses to allow four of the new seats to the<lb/>south, while to the ten northern seats he<lb/>is only allowing one new seat. Comparing<lb/>the figures for the two groups of districts,<lb/>I find that he has retained unaltered<lb/>according to his map, a certain num<lb break="no"/>ber of seats in the south. I shall take 
     <lb/>
     the districts of Moosomin, Whitewood, 
     <lb/>
    Grenfell and Wolseley. He has pointed 
     <lb/>out that these are old districts, and he 
     <lb/>has objected very strongly to any lessen<lb break="no"/>ing of their representation. These four seats 
     <lb/>have a census population of 16,051. Since 
     <lb/>1901 there have been 3,480 homestead en<lb break="no"/>tries made in these four constituencies. Al<lb break="no"/>lowing to each of these homestead entries 
     <lb/>three persons, those four constituencies have 
     <lb/>at the present moment a population of 26,<lb break="no"/>491, or an average for each seat of 6,622. 
     <lb/>Compare these with the four districts in the 
     <lb/>north which my hon. friend says are 
     <lb/>so much over-represented. Take Saskatoon, 
     <lb/>Battleford, Kinistino and Batoche accord<lb break="no"/>ing to Mr. Haultain's redistribution. These 
     <lb/>four districts have a census population of 
     <lb/>14,123, but since 1901 there have been 15,<lb break="no"/>386 homestead entries made within their 
     <lb/>limits. Comparing these with the four seats 
     <lb/>in the south, which have a census popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 16,051 as against a population of 
     <lb/>14,123 for these four districts in the north, 
     <lb/>and we find that the four southern seats 
     <lb/>have only added to their population, in so 
     <lb/>far as homestead entries would indicate, 
     <lb/>the population represented by 3,480 entries, 
     <lb/>while in these four northern divisions in 
     <lb/>the same time there have been ad<lb break="no"/>ded the population represented by 15,<lb break="no"/>386 homestead entries. Following the same 
     <lb/>principle of allowing three persons to each 
     <lb/>homestead entry, we have a present popula<lb break="no"/>tion in this northern district of 61,281 as 
     <lb/>against 26,491 in the south, or, while in 
     <lb/>these four districts in the south 6,222 peo<lb break="no"/>ple can elect a member, it requires 15,320 
     <lb/>people in the north, and yet my hon. friend 
     <lb/>says that the north is being over-represented. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, I need not follow out these figures. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend from Qu'Appelle has sub<lb break="no"/>mitted a map, and in so far as he lays out 
     <lb/>
     the same divisions as are laid out in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment schedule I think we may take it 
     <lb/>
     for granted that the government schedule 
     <lb/>
     is perfectly correct. I find that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman has made some criticism in re<lb break="no"/>gard to Redberry, but according to his own 
     <lb/>
     schedule he makes a district of Redberry. 
     <lb/>
     which corresponds fairly with the govern<lb break="no"/>ment one ; Battleford is practically the 
     <lb/>
     same ; Rosthern is made a little smaller ; 
     <lb/>
     Saskatoon is made smaller ; Prince Albert 
     <lb/>
     city is cut out altogether and Humboldt is 
     <lb/>
     cut out altogether and added to Ba<lb break="no"/>toche. I want to call the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the committee to the facts in regard to 
     <lb/>
     Humboldt. The hon. gentleman says that 
     <lb/>
     Humboldt should not have separate repre<lb break="no"/>

     sentation because it only cast 178 votes at 
     <lb/>
     the last election. Any one who knows any<lb break="no"/>thing about that district, knows that two 
     <lb/>
     years ago a German settlement went into 
     <lb/>
     Humboldt from the United States number<lb break="no"/>ing 4,500 people, and, as has been pointed out 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend from Humboldt (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Adamson), there is to-day in that district a 
     <lb/>
     population of from 8,000 to 10,000 people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. How does the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man get at that calculation? Is he just ac<lb break="no"/>cepting the statement of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Humboldt? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Just wait a moment and 
     <lb/>
     I will show you how I arrive at that. The 
     <lb/>
     census population of Humboldt in 1901 was 
     <lb/>
    582. But since that time there have 
     <lb/>been made 2,274 homestead entries. Fol<lb break="no"/>lowing the same principle of allowing 
     <lb/>three persons for each homestead entry 
     <lb/>that gives as far as homestead entries 
     <lb/>are concerned a population of 6,822, 
     <lb/>and including the population of 582 
     <lb/>as set out in the census of 1901, a total 
     <lb/>population of 7,304 without counting any 
     <lb/>of the town population, and everybody who 
     <lb/>has gone over the main line of the Canada 
     <lb/>Northern Railway knows that there are 
     <lb/>very considerable towns growing up along 
     <lb/>that line. Therefore, I think that my hon. 
     <lb/>friend from Humboldt is well within the 
     <lb/>mark when he says that there is a popula<lb break="no"/>tion in the district of Humboldt of between 
     <lb/>8,000 and 10,000 people. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>from Qu'Appelle thinks that population is 
     <lb/>not entitled to one representative and that 
     <lb/>Humboldt should be added to Batoche. Now, 
     <lb/>I have here the figures which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>has read showing the homestead entries 
     <lb/>for the different districts, and I find that in 
     <lb/>Batoche in 1901 there was a census popula<lb break="no"/>tion of 1,970 and in Humboldt a census 
     <lb/>population of 582. In addition, in Batoche, 
     <lb/>according to this list, there have been since 
     <lb/>1901 2,594 homesteads entered and in Hum<lb break="no"/>boldt 2,274, making a total of 4,868. Fol<lb break="no"/>lowing the same principle of allowing three 
     <lb/>persons to each homestead, we have a pres<lb break="no"/>ent population in the district to which my 
     <lb/>hon. friend would only allow one member 
     <lb/>of over 16,000 people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I had better say right here 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend from Saskatchewan that I 
     <lb/>
     think he certainly is not correctly describ<lb break="no"/>ing the boundaries of any of the districts 
     <lb/>
     which he has referred to as my distribution.

     map on the table so that it may be seen by 
     <lb/>
     any one who wishes to refer to it. I think, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Chairman, I ought to call the attention 
     <lb/>
     of the committee to this map and to show 
     <lb/>
     the committee the beautiful redistribution 
     <lb/>
     of my hon. friend. Whether or not he felt 
     <lb/>
     that the member for the Cannington district 
     <lb/>
     would have some difficulty in getting to 
     <lb/>
     Regina I cannot say, but he has built a 
     <lb/>
     beautiful series of steps that look as if 
     <lb/>
     they were calculated to assist him very ma<lb break="no"/>
            

            <cb/>


     terially in getting there. It seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that the only difference between my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Qu'Appelle and hon. members 
     <lb/>
     on this side of the House is that he refuses 
     <lb/>
     to consider that these citizens who are from 
     <lb/>
     the United States or from Europe and who 
     <lb/>
     had not been in the country for three years 
     <lb/>
     before last fall so as to be able to get their 
     <lb/>
     names on the voters' list should be entitled 
     <lb/>
     to representation. We think they should be  
     <lb/>
     entitled to representation. They are there 
     <lb/>
     on the ground and developing the resources 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and the fact that they are

     yet American citizens is not in my opinion 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient reason, although it may be a 
     <lb/>
     sufficient reason in the opinion of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, for depriving them of a voice in 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of this country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I have no intention of de<lb break="no"/>priving American citizens of fair represen<lb break="no"/>tation. They are scattered through the 
     <lb/>
     whole length and breadth of the country 
     <lb/>
     from north to south.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. My hon. friend cannot 
     <lb/>
     deny, as the homestead entries prove be<lb break="no"/>yond a doubt, that the number of new set<lb break="no"/>tlers who have gone into the north far ex<lb break="no"/>ceeds the number who have gone into the 
     <lb/>
     south.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAMO1">Mr. LAMONT</persName>. Well, I submit that the 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries demonstrate that the ten 
     <lb/>
     northern districts, according to Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain's redistribution which my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     says is fair, shows 30,000 entries as against 
     <lb/>
     18,000 for the southern districts. To my 
     <lb/>
     mind that is conclusive. Even though a 
     <lb/>
     very large number of these 30,000 peo<lb break="no"/>ple had not been in the country for three 
     <lb/>
     years last fall, yet we know that they 
     <lb/>
     are improving their farms, they are improv<lb break="no"/>ing the country, they have come here on 
     <lb/>
     our invitation and they require roads and 
     <lb/>
     bridges and schools to as great an extent 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps greater than the settlers in 
     <lb/>
    the older districts of whose interests 
     <lb/>my hon. friend has been so solici<lb break="no"/>tous. In the older districts the settlers 
     <lb/>have better roads than in the newer dis<lb break="no"/>tricts. Their interests have been looked 
     <lb/>after in the past ; their schools are estab<lb break="no"/>lished and their roads and bridges are prac<lb break="no"/>tically built, and they will not require the 
     <lb/>same amount of attention on the part of 
     <lb/>the government that the newer settlers will. 
     <lb/>It seems to me that this ground of difference 
     <lb/>is the only one between us. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has made a calculation of the 
     <lb/>voters on the lists, but there were 
     <lb/>thousands and thousands of settlers in 
     <lb/>that northern country who had not 
     <lb/>been there three years and were consequent<lb break="no"/>ly not entitled to have their names on the 
     <lb/>lists. The hon. gentleman cuts out Hum<lb break="no"/>boldt and Prince Albert. As the member 
     <lb/>for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has said, 
     <lb/>we have adopted the principle of giving to 
     <lb/>incorporated cities a member, and if we

     give a member to Calgary, Regina and 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw, I do not see on what principle 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert can be cut out. There are a 
     <lb/>
     few facts to which I will call attention in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the Prince Albert seat. Until 
     <lb/>
     the redistribution of 1902, which my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend (Mr. Lake) says was fair and just, 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert had two seats, East and West 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert, and the Haultain administra<lb break="no"/>tion in 1902 cut out one of these seats, put<lb break="no"/>ting a large portion of it into Prince Albert 
     <lb/>
     West forming one seat, and putting the 
     <lb/>
     polling divisions down the Saskatchewan 
     <lb/>
     river into Kinistino. To my mind and 
     <lb/>
     to the mind of the Prince Albert 
     <lb/>
     people that was most unjust. It was 
     <lb/>
     stated in the district, it was stated in 
     <lb/>
     the legislature that it was an unjust gerry<lb break="no"/>mander, and the votes cast at the next elec<lb break="no"/>tion proved that to be the case. The Haul<lb break="no"/>tain government took away one seat from 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert and formed a new seat of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatoon. Prince Albert at the next elec<lb break="no"/>tion had a vote of 771 while Saskatoon had 
     <lb/>
     a vote of only 376. Between Prince Albert 
     <lb/>
     and Kinistino was divided the extra terri<lb break="no"/>tory which up to that time had been in 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert. Up to that time there had 
     <lb/>
     been three seats, but by the 1902 redistri<lb break="no"/>bution they only were given two. These 
     <lb/>
     two seats provided a vote of 1,453 at the 
     <lb/>
     next election whereas the three other seats 
     <lb/>
     in Saskatchewan in which elections were held 
     <lb/>
     gave only 1,065 votes, so that the Haultain 
     <lb/>
     administration divided 1,065 votes into three 
     <lb/>
     seats, whereas they only divided 1,453 votes 
     <lb/>
     into two seats, taking one seat away from 
     <lb/>
     Prince Albert. Yet my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) says that was a fair redistribution. 
     <lb/>
     </p>

            <p>It was stated over and over again on the 
     <lb/>platform and elsewhere that the reason for 
     <lb/>cutting off one seat from Prince Albert was 
     <lb/>because Prince Albert East and Prince Al<lb break="no"/>bert West returned two strong opponents of 
     <lb/>the Haultain government, while Saskatoon 
     <lb/>was supposed to be friendly, and at the 
     <lb/>next election Saskatoon returned a govern<lb break="no"/>ment supporter, while in the two seats that 
     <lb/>had been fused into one in Prince Albert the 
     <lb/>government nominee lost his deposit. Now, 
     <lb/>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to take up the 
     <lb/>time of the committee further. It seems to me 
     <lb/>that if we look at this question on fair and 
     <lb/>broad principles, if we take the 10 south<lb break="no"/>ern and the 10 northern seats as laid out by 
     <lb/>Mr. Haultain—and in which distribution my 
     <lb/>hon. friend (Mr. Lake) had a part—and if 
     <lb/>we take the homestead entries in each of 
     <lb/>these 10 seats since 1901 we are forced to 
     <lb/>the conclusion that a fair distribution of the 
     <lb/>extra five seats we have to add to Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, would be 3 to the north and 2 to the 
     <lb/>south. In my opinion if we were to con<lb break="no"/>sider the prospective increase, it should 
     <lb/>be 4 in the north and 1 in the south, but 
     <lb/>certainly not less than 3 in the north and 2 
     <lb/>in the south. I believe that before the next 
     <lb/>local election, if the term of the legislature 
     <lb/>runs four years, there will be a vastly 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          

     greater population in the north than there 
     <lb/>
     is in the south. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr. Lamont) 
     <lb/>
     has taken up a great deal of time trying 
     <lb/>
     to prove what a terrible gerrymander was 
     <lb/>
     made by the Haultain government in 1902, 
     <lb/>
     but the opinion of the gentleman (Mr. Scott) 
     <lb/>
     who sits beside him was very different at 
     <lb/>
     the time the Haultain redistribution was 
     <lb/>
     made. The Regina ' Leader ' of the 24th of

     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. Mr. Mackay was the only

     at all, and he did it, not in a very determined

     there was a gerrymander, the Bill would not

     have gone through as it did in the course of

     a few minutes, accepted practically by the

     distribution, as the Regina ' Leader ' said, 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan is taken as a basis and one

     member was given for every 4,279 of the

     population according to the census of the

     and in Alberta one member for every 4,700

     of the population. It was as even a distri<lb break="no"/>bution as it was possible to make. If there 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Will my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lake) permit me to point out that if he 
     <lb/>
     will calculate the result of that redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion upon the basis of the most recent vote 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories at the previous federal 
     <lb/>
     election, as we are compelled to some extent 
     <lb/>
     to do in this case, he will find a very great 
     <lb/>
     disparity. Saskatchewan was given 6 seats, 
     <lb/>
     and the old Assiniboia 15 seats, while the 
     <lb/>
     vote polled the previous November showed 
     <lb/>
     11,857 for Assiniboia as against 2,529 for 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan, being an average in Assini<lb break="no"/>boia of 790 votes for each member as 
     <lb/>
     against only 420 in Saskatchewan. This 
     <lb/>
     will tend to show to the committee what

     of the Interior took for the distribution he

     has given in both of these Bills.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I quoted the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior's own remarks, which I think were 
     <lb/>
     pretty absolute in regard to that matter. 
     <lb/>
     That was the first basis of distribution. 
     <lb/>
     He said : ' The basis of the division of the 
     <lb/>
     constituencies was necessarily the vote cast ; 
     <lb/>
     it was the latest and most accurate estimate 
     <lb/>
     we could get.' In another place he said : 
     <lb/>
     'The definite division of the constituencies 
     <lb/>
     is based on the vote actually polled on the 
     <lb/>
     3rd of November.' The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan made a very long argument 
     <lb/>
     in regard to north and south, as he would 
     <lb/>
     make the division. I do not propose to follow 
     <lb/>
     him into that question. He makes a very 
     <lb/>
     arbitrary division when he brings one of his 
     <lb/>
     northern constituencies apparently down to 
     <lb/>
     the main line of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way. I think that will be sufficient for any 
     <lb/>
     one acquainted with that country to esti<lb break="no"/>mate the value of the hon. gentleman's re<lb break="no"/>marks in that respect. Then, in endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to prove from the homestead entries 
     <lb/>
     what a very large population had gone into 
     <lb/>
     the north, he took an all-round estimate that 
     <lb/>
     three would be about the proportlon of indi<lb break="no"/>viduals who would go with each homestead 
     <lb/>
     entry. When he endeavoured to apply this 
     <lb/>
     principle to the absolute statement of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Humboldt (Mr. Adamson) 
     <lb/>
     as to the population in that constituency, 
     <lb/>
     he found that it fell short of the estimate 
     <lb/>
     made by the hon. member for Humboldt. 
     <lb/>
     In order to make up for this defi<lb break="no"/>ciency, he immediately said this was out<lb break="no"/>side of the numbers who had gone into the 
     <lb/>
     towns which were springing up all along the 
     <lb/>
     line. Once he departs from that general 
     <lb/>
      basis of three to every homestead entry, his 
     <lb/>
     whole argument falls to the ground ; be<lb break="no"/>cause I contend that he cannot compare an 
     <lb/>
     entirely new country, which is being opened 
     <lb/>
          
    
            <cb/>
       

     up for the first time, and in which every 
     <lb/>
     man who goes into it for business purposes 
     <lb/>
     or any other purposes, immediately makes a 
     <lb/>
     homestead entry with the older settled por<lb break="no"/>tions of the country, such as the Indian 
     <lb/>
     Head district, which has been referred to, in 
     <lb/>
     which every bit of vacant land has for years 
     <lb/>
     been taken up, and into which great num<lb break="no"/>bers of new population have been coming. 
     <lb/>
     There people who go in to farm, being un<lb break="no"/>able to find homesteads, buy lands. Then, 
     <lb/>
     an immense number of labourers go in to 
     <lb/>
     work, and business men to carry on business 
     <lb/>
     in the towns ; and these have no opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of finding homesteads. So that it is absurd 
     <lb/>
     to take for granted generally that for every 
     <lb/>
     homestead entry in a particular district, 
     <lb/>
     three people have come into that district. 
     <lb/>
     Certainly three people would be no fair esti<lb break="no"/>mate in the older districts ; probably four 
     <lb/>
     would be nearer the mark ; whereas in the 
     <lb/>
     newer districts probably every other person 
     <lb/>
     who comes in makes a homestead entry. As 
     <lb/>
     I said when the hon. member for Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan was speaking, his verbal description 
     <lb/>
     of the distribution which I submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     committee was an absolutely incorrect one. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think I need go any further. Any 
     <lb/>
     one who chooses to look at that map and 
     <lb/>
     compare it with his statements as they ap<lb break="no"/>pear in ' Hansard ' will find [that he has not 
     <lb/>
     correctly described the constituencies which 
     <lb/>
     he undertook to criticise ; so that I do not 
     <lb/>
     think I need follow his remarks in that re<lb break="no"/>spect.

     that the hon. gentleman had made the dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Redberry, and had added to it 
     <lb/>
     Battleford. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The hon. gentleman also said 
     <lb/>
     that I added Humboldt to Batoche. I did 
     <lb/>
     not add the whole of Humboldt to Batoche. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman, perhaps unintentionally, 
     <lb/>
     did not give a fair description of those con<lb break="no"/>stituencies. My hon. friend from Western 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia proposed to cut up four con<lb break="no"/>stituencies in Eastern Assiniboia—Moosomin, 
     <lb/>
     Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseley—and 
     <lb/>
     make three of them, and he compared that 
     <lb/>
     proposal with the alternative suggestion I 
     <lb/>
     made on the spur of the moment, to the dis<lb break="no"/>advantage of that suggestion. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's proposal would work out on the 
     <lb/>
     basis of numbers on the voters' lists as fol<lb break="no"/>lows : Moosomin, 2,282 ; Broadview, 2,280 ; 
     <lb/>
     Wolseley, 1,850. These are figures which I 
     <lb/>
     took from the figures at my disposal. The 
     <lb/>
     average of these four constituencies, as I 
     <lb/>
     have stated before, is already above the 
     <lb/>
     average throughout the whole province of 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan. I suggest that we should 
     <lb/>
     take the three constituencies around Regina, 
     <lb/>
     which are considerably below that average, 
     <lb/>

     and add to the portions of south Qu'Appelle, 
     <lb/>
    Souris and Cannington, and thus remove a 
     <lb/>certain amount of congestion in those three 
     <lb/>districts.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. The vote polled in Lumsden 
     <lb/>
     was just about up to the average, and since 
     <lb/>
     the census of 1901 almost as many home<lb break="no"/>stead entries have been made in Lumsden 
     <lb/>
     as in the four districts. Yet my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     proposes to add to that district of Lumsden, 
     <lb/>
     which is already big enough, both in area 
     <lb/>
     and population, a portion of the thickly 
     <lb/>
     settled territory in the neighbourhood of 
     <lb/>
     Regina—twenty-one townships as thickly 
     <lb/>
     settled as any in the Territories, with an 
     <lb/>
     area almost as large as Wolseley. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The figures which my alter<lb break="no"/>native suggestion shows would give to Lums<lb break="no"/>den 2,230 votes. That is less than two of 
     <lb/>
     the constituencies which he proposes to 
     <lb/>
     create in the eastern part along the main 
     <lb/>
     line. It would still leave the city of Re<lb break="no"/>gina, with a very small vote under 1,000, 
     <lb/>
     and it would make South Regina up to 
     <lb/>
     about 2,270. Curiously enough they work 
     <lb/>
     out in exactly the same figures, according 
     <lb/>
     to the calculation which I made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. According to my figures I 
     <lb/>
     find that Lumsden had 3,096 of a population 
     <lb/>
     according to the census of 1901, and cast 
     <lb/>
     a vote last fall of 1,122 and there have been 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries, since the census of 1901, 
     <lb/>
     in that district to the number of 3,254. 
     <lb/>
     Does my hon. friend contend that these new 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries do not mean population ? 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden shows 3,200 entries as against only 
     <lb/>
     3,400 in the whole four districts of Mooso<lb break="no"/>min, Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseley, and 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden is in the same class as the other 
     <lb/>
     districts practically, except in the north<lb break="no"/>ern portion. The southern portion, parti<lb break="no"/>cularly in the neighbourhood of Regina, 
     <lb/>
     is entirely the class of old-settled district 
     <lb/>
     to which he refers and to which belong 
     <lb/>
     Moosomin, Grenfell, Whitewood and Wol<lb break="no"/>seley. The old settlers are to be found 
     <lb/>
     there. According to my suggested division, 
     <lb/>
     by putting these four districts into three, 
     <lb/>
     we will have a record of the vote polled last 
     <lb/>
     fall in the new districts of as follows : 
     <lb/>
      Moosomin, 1,573 ; Broadview, 1,383 ; Wol<lb break="no"/>seley, 1,366. Compare those with the two 
     <lb/>
     districts on the north : Saltcoats, 1,473 ; 
     <lb/>
     Yorkton, 1,081. On the other hand, take 
     <lb/>
     the districts to the south, Souris will have 
     <lb/>
     2,114, very much larger still than in the 
     <lb/>
     other three which I make out of his four ; 
     <lb/>
     Cannington, 1,508.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. How many will the three 
     <lb/>
     Reginas then have ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I will give the figures for 
     <lb/>
     each of these according to the map I have 
     <lb/>
     suggested. I take the votes polled : Souris, 
     <lb/>
     2,114 ; Cannington, 1,508 ; Moosomin, 
     <lb/>
     1,593 ; Broadview, 1,383 ; Wolseley, 1,366 ; 
     <lb/>
     Saltcoats, 1,473 ; Yorkton, 1,081 ; Weyburn— 


            <cb/>
         

     this is the new district on the Soo line 
     <lb/>
     which I propose to create—1,282 ; South 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle, 1,383 ; North Qu'Appelle, 927. 
     <lb/>
     I do not propose any change in the 
     <lb/>
     North Qu'Appelle district. South Regina, 
     <lb/>
     1,153 ; Regina city, 740 ; Lumsden, 1,122 ; 
     <lb/>
     Moosejaw district, 1,168 ; Moosejaw city, 
     <lb/>
     786 ; Maple Creek, 783. If my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     will look at that a moment, he must agree 
     <lb/>
     with me that it is a fairer redistribution 
     <lb/>
     than the government plan, observing what 
     <lb/>
     was done three years ago by the legislature, 
     <lb/>
     and very much fairer than his alternative 
     <lb/>
     suggestion, by which he proposes to add 
     <lb/>
     to a district, already fairly large in votes 
     <lb/>
     cast, large in area, and exceedingly large in 
     <lb/>
     the population which we must conclude has 
     <lb/>
     come into it, judging by the number of home<lb break="no"/>stead entries made since the census was 
     <lb/>
     taken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. If hon. members on that 
     <lb/>
     side would take one basis of calculation, 
     <lb/>
     we should begin to know where we are, 
     <lb/>
     but it is absolutely impossible to follow 
     <lb/>
     all their different positions. When it suits 
     <lb/>
     their arguments in one district, they use 
     <lb/>
     the basis of population according to the cen<lb break="no"/>sus of 1901 and add to their calculation the 
     <lb/>
     homestead entries. When it suits them in 
     <lb/>
     another district to use another basis, they 
     <lb/>
     take the votes polled. Let them take one 
     <lb/>
     basis and hold to it all through. I could 
     <lb/>
     not find a moment ago the average of the 
     <lb/>
     votes on the lists in the three Reginas, 
     <lb/>
     but I have it now. I am not taking the 
     <lb/>
     votes polled in my calculation. The average 
     <lb/>
     on the voters' lists was 1,344 in those three 
     <lb/>
     Regina seats. The average voters on the 
     <lb/>
     lists for Moosomin, Whitewood, Grenfell and 
     <lb/>
     Wolseley, was 1,554, so that the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman is taking four constituencies which 
     <lb/>
     already, on an average, have a larger num<lb break="no"/>ber of names on the voters' lists than the 
     <lb/>
     average for the whole of the province. He 
     <lb/>
     has just told us exactly how many votes 
     <lb/>
     were polled in each of these new constitu<lb break="no"/>encies, which he has been redistributing. 
     <lb/>
     How does he get at that ? For instance. 
     <lb/>
     here I find the polling division of Yellow 
     <lb/>
     Grass for the federal election had a voters' 
     <lb/>
     list of 300 names. Right through the centre 
     <lb/>
     of that polling division, which is a very large 
     <lb/>
     one, containing some eight townships, goes 
     <lb/>
     the dividing line between the two consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies. How many does he reckon cast 
     <lb/>
     their votes on the west side of the divid<lb break="no"/>ing line and how many on the east side ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It seems to me that when we 
     <lb/>
     have to come down to a dispute about in<lb break="no"/>dividual cases in a matter dealing with so 
     <lb/>
     large an area, we pretty nearly bring the 
     <lb/>
     whole thing down to the level of farce. 
     <lb/>
     Nobody imagines that these figures are ac<lb break="no"/>curate, but they are approximately so. If 
     <lb/>
     there are divergencies on the one side, there 
     <lb/>
     will be corresponding divergencles on the 
     <lb/>
     other.

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. No one pretends they are 
     <lb/>
     absolutely accurate, but I object to having 
     <lb/>
     the number of votes polled taken as the 
     <lb/>
     basis, because it is impossible even to get 
     <lb/>
     near the number of persons qualified to 
     <lb/>
     vote even in that way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. If my hon. friend will com<lb break="no"/>pare the number of votes polled with the 
     <lb/>
      number given on the lists, which he con<lb break="no"/>tends are absolutely accurate, he will find 
     <lb/>
     that the number of votes polled are given 
     <lb/>
     with approximate accuracy, which is my 
     <lb/>
     contention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The number of votes polled 
     <lb/>
     as compared with the number on the lists 
     <lb/>
     vary considerably in the different consti<lb break="no"/>tuencies. In one of the northern constitu<lb break="no"/>encies only 49 per cent of the voters on 
     <lb/>
     the lists voted, whereas in one of the 
     <lb/>
     southern constituencies, that of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's himself, there were 76 per cent 
     <lb/>
     votes polled of the voters registered. If the 
     <lb/>
     government would only take one basis and 
     <lb/>
     stick to it, that would give some chance to 
     <lb/>
     members on this side to offer alternative 
     <lb/>
     suggestions, which could not fail to be an 
     <lb/>
     improvement on their schedules. I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to follow this matter very much 
     <lb/>
     further. I do not think that the argument 
     <lb/>
     made by the hon. members for Western As<lb break="no"/>siniboia and Saskatchewan have added any<lb break="no"/>thing to the information of members of this 
     <lb/>
     committee. I think they have not proved 
     <lb/>
     the case they started out to prove in any 
     <lb/>
     particular. They depend on vague calcu<lb break="no"/>lations as to prospective populations and 
     <lb/>
     so on. In reference to the accusation made 
     <lb/>
     against me that I wish to deprive the new<lb break="no"/>comers of their right to representation, that 
     <lb/>
     is absolutely incorrect. Incoming American 
     <lb/>
     citizens were especially mentioned in this 
     <lb/>
     connection by the hon. member for Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan (Mr. Lamont). These American 
     <lb/>
     citizens have not settled in one corner of the 
     <lb/>
     country, but have spread everywhere. They 
     <lb/>
     have come in very largely into my own 
     <lb/>
     neighbourhood. Within a very few miles of 
     <lb/>
     me there are a considerable number of 
     <lb/>
     American citizens who were not entitled to 
     <lb/>
     vote at the last election. A great many of 
     <lb/>
     these American citizens, men of means, 
     <lb/>
     have determined to settle in the districts 
     <lb/>
     which have proved their capacity for grow<lb break="no"/>ing grain. They have not struck into the 
     <lb/>
     remote districts whereit is not finally estab<lb break="no"/>lished that wheat can be profitably grown. 
     <lb/>
     A very large proportion of the best class of 
     <lb/>
     these new-comers have settled in the older 
     <lb/>
     districts, where they know they can make 
     <lb/>
     a success of farming. I propose that all 
     <lb/>
     should be treated alike, both those who go 
     <lb/>
     into the north and those who go into the 
     <lb/>
     south—all should be given their fair share 
     <lb/>
     of representation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I daresay we are to take it 
     <lb/>
     for granted that the division between the 
     <lb/>
     north and the south is going to be main<lb break="no"/>tained by the committee—nine to the north 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
   

     and sixteen to the south. But I am going 
     <lb/>
     to appeal to the hon. member for Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle (Mr. Lake) that we should join hands 
     <lb/>
     on the suggestion I have offered, which, to 
     <lb/>
     a great extent, would remove the disparities 
     <lb/>
     and discrepancies in Assinibola which exist 
     <lb/>
     in the plan presented by the government, 
     <lb/>
     that being the redistribution made by the 
     <lb/>
     assembly three years ago. My hon. friend, 
     <lb/>
     like myself, knows very well that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple on the Soo line contend, with a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of justice, that a different distribution 
     <lb/>
     ought to be made of Assiniboia to serve 
     <lb/>
     their purposes. They feel themselves at the 
     <lb/>
     extremes in South Regina and South Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle. They feel that the weight is against 
     <lb/>
     them, and they have sent down a great 
     <lb/>
     many strong representations asking that 
     <lb/>
     different lines be run to create a district, 
     <lb/>
     the centre of which would be one of the 
     <lb/>
     towns on the Pasqua branch or the Soo 
     <lb/>
     line. I have made a proposition that I 
     <lb/>
     think is fair. These four districts on the 
     <lb/>
     main Canadian Pacific Railway line at the 
     <lb/>
     east of the province are comparatively 
     <lb/>
     small in area and in vote, and are exceed<lb break="no"/>ingly small in increase of population, if we 
     <lb/>
     take the homestead entries as being any 
     <lb/>
     proper guide in that respect. I feel some<lb break="no"/>what strongly in regard to this, and I am 
     <lb/>
     satisfied that the committee would be will<lb break="no"/>ing to agree to my suggestion if the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) would 
     <lb/>
     accept it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I am quite prepared to agree 
     <lb/>
     with the hon. member for Western Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Scott) in so far as he asserts that 
     <lb/>
     there should be a constituency given along 
     <lb/>
     the Soo line, taking in a portion of the dis<lb break="no"/>tricts of South Regina, South Qu'Appelle, 
     <lb/>
     Souris, and possibly Cannington. But I 
     <lb/>
     cannot agree with him as to where he is 
     <lb/>
     to take off one constituency in order to place 
     <lb/>
     a new constituency in that district. He 
     <lb/>
     proposes, as I have said, to go into the old 
     <lb/>
     districts of Moosomin, Whitewood, Grenfell 
     <lb/>
     and Wolseley and cut off one member from 
     <lb/>
     there. I have shown that already they have 
     <lb/>
     a very large vote in those four districts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. They are under the average 
     <lb/>
     of the sixteen Assiniboia districts. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. But they are over the aver<lb break="no"/>age for the whole province of Saskatchewan. 
     <lb/>
     The only difference between my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) and myself is that I suggest 
     <lb/>
     that he should get this extra seat from the 
     <lb/>
     three constituencies which now group around 
     <lb/>
     Regina—Lumsden, Regina and South Re<lb break="no"/>gina—and that he should redistribute these 
     <lb/>
     seats. The average for these seats is 1,344 
     <lb/>
     as against an average in the constituencies 
     <lb/>
     he proposes to cut up of 1,554. I contend 
     <lb/>
     that it would be very much easier and a 
     <lb/>
     much more suitable and fairer distribution 
     <lb/>
     to do as I suggested—to make the new Soo

     tion of South Qu'Appelle, a portion of Souris 
     <lb/>
     and possibly a small portion of Cannington, 
     <lb/>
     and extending the North Regina or Lums<lb break="no"/>den district south to the 15th township 
     <lb/>
     line. As I have said, it would work out 
     <lb/>
     that the two constituencies of Lumsden and 
     <lb/>
     the Soo line would have something over 
     <lb/>
     2,200 names on the voters' list ; and Re<lb break="no"/>gina city, which would have a member, 
     <lb/>
     who, no doubt, would be approached by 
     <lb/>
     farmers in either of these constituencies if 
     <lb/>
     they wished to see him, would have a very 
     <lb/>
     small proportion of votes. Of course, I am 
     <lb/>
     agreeing to this suggestion on the assump<lb break="no"/>tion that the government are determined to 
     <lb/>
     force through this distribution as between 
     <lb/>
     the old district of Saskatchewan and the 
     <lb/>
     old district of Assiniboia.

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I made a suggestion the

     other day in the conference to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) that the 
     <lb/>
     boundary of Grenfell should be slightly 
     <lb/>
     changed by taking away from the district 
     <lb/>
     of Yorkton five townships, in the southwest 
     <lb/>
     corner of the district of Yorkton. Owing 
     <lb/>
     to the building of the Kirkella extension of 
     <lb/>
     the railway these people will be nearer to 
     <lb/>
     that railway than to the Manitoba and North<lb break="no"/>western Railway, and their interests will be 
     <lb/>
     much better served by adding these five 
     <lb/>
     townships to Grenfell. The member for 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle said that he would have no ob<lb break="no"/>jection to this being done.

     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. I do not remember this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. As in the case of the Alberta con<lb break="no"/>stituencies an agreement was arrived at in 
     <lb/>
     the conference as to some changes of this 
     <lb/>
     nature, and the understanding was that some 
     <lb/>
     authority would make the changes and have 
     <lb/>
     them properly arranged the next morning.

     of the votes and settlement there I am not

     <lb/>
     to make with regard to Lumsden. There 
     <lb/>
     should be a slight change made here which 
     <lb/>
     affects Lumsden, Moosejaw and Batochc, on 
     <lb/>
     account of a lake, Last Mountain lake, 
     <lb/>
     through which the boundary runs, leaving 
     <lb/>
     on the east side of the lake, cut off from 
     <lb/>
     Lumsden, about a dozen or perhaps twenty 
     <lb/>
     or even forty people living in there separated 
     <lb/>
     by the lake from the district in which they 
     <lb/>
     are placed by the present boundary and cut 
     <lb/>
     off from the neighbours with whom they 
     <lb/>
     would naturally vote.

            </p>
   
            <p>

     Whereas, in and by the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act, 1867, being chapter 3 of the Acts of the

     such terms and conditions in each case as are

     in the addresses expressed and as the Queen

     should think fit to approve, subject to the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the said Act ; and that the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of any Order in Council in that behalf

     should have effect as if they had been enacted

     Great Britain and Ireland. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas in and by the Rupert's Land Act,

     <lb/>
     it was, among other things, enacted that it

     and declare that from and after the 15th day of

     July, 1870, the said territory should be admitted

     was thereby further ordered that, without pre<lb break="no"/>judice to any obligations arising from an ap<lb break="no"/>proved report therein recited, Rupert's Land 
     <lb/>
     should from and after the said 15th of July,

     in the session thereof held in the thirty-fourth 
     <lb/>
     and thirty—fifth years of the reign of Her late 
     <lb/>
     Majesty Queen Victoria, it is enacted that the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada may from time to time 
     <lb/>
     establish new provinces in any territories form<lb break="no"/>ing for the time being part of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, but not included in any province there<lb break="no"/>of, and may, at the time of such establishment, 
     <lb/>
     make provisions for the constitution and ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of any such province, and for the 
     <lb/>
     passing of laws for the peace, order and good 
     <lb/>
     government of such province and for its repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the said parliament of Canada ;

     of the parliament of the United Kingdom passed 
     <lb/>
     in the session thereof held in the forty-ninth 
     <lb/>
     and fiftieth years of the reign of Her said Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty, the parliament of Canada was empowered 
     <lb/>
     to make provision for the representation in 
     <lb/>
     the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     of any territories which for the time being form 
     <lb/>
     part of the Dominion of Canada but are not in<lb break="no"/>cluded in any province thereof ; and it was 
     <lb/>
     thereby also enacted that the said Act, and the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, 1867, and the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act, 1871, shall be construed 
     <lb/>
     together.

     territory hereinafter described has not been in<lb break="no"/>cluded in any province of the Dominion and has 
     <lb/>
     heretofore been provisionally governed by and 
     <lb/>
     pursuant to legislation of the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And whereas it is expedient to establish as a 
     <lb/>
     province that part of the said land and terri<lb break="no"/>tory hereinafter described, and to make pro<lb break="no"/>vision for the constitution and administration 
     <lb/>
     of such province and for the passing of laws 
     <lb/>
     for the peace, order and good government there<lb break="no"/>of and for its representation in the parliament

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. This is a Bill dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the powers of the Territories, and I

     think it would be well to have the explana<lb break="no"/>tion before we go into committee on it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. This Bill is intended

     to provide for the government of that part

     of the Northwest Territories which is not 
     <lb/>
     included in the two provinces, that is to say,

     all that part of Rupert's Land and the North<lb break="no"/>western Territory which is not included in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, the dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Keewatin and the Yukon Territory, 
     <lb/>
     and it provides for it by continuing all the

     provisions of the Northwest Territories Act 
     <lb/>
     which are already in existence and which 
     <lb/>
     are already applicable to these Territories.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. The law that has

     been in existence since 1875 without any 
     <lb/>
     change. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. Whatever state of law 
     <lb/>
     applied to the Territories in 1875, now made 
     <lb/>
     into provinces, the same state of law would 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. The same law as govern<lb break="no"/>ed the two new provinces down to 1875 will 
     <lb/>
     now govern the Territories. Therefore by 
     <lb/>
     passing this Act we will be giving our sanc<lb break="no"/>tion to the continuance to that state of law. 
     <lb/>
     We are affirming the state of law said to ex<lb break="no"/>ist in these Territories at present. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I would not like to 
     <lb/>
     put it that way.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. We are re-enacting in a 
     <lb/>
     certain sense and giving our legislative sanc<lb break="no"/>tion to whatever state at law exists in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories at present. The result would 
     <lb/>
     be that in giving our sanction to the exist<lb break="no"/>ing state of the school laws there, whether 
     <lb/>
     those laws be good or bad, we may be con<lb break="no"/>fronted in the future with the same unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate condition as we had to face this ses<lb break="no"/>sion. When we come to establish this re<lb break="no"/>maining portion of the Territories into a 
     <lb/>
     province, we may be met with the same 
     <lb/>
     argument on the school question as we were 
     <lb/>
     met with this session and be told that we 
     <lb/>
     are bound by what happened years before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I think my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Minister of Justice inadvertently 
     <lb/>
     misstated a little the condition of affairs. 
     <lb/>
     The Bill, as originally drafted, contemplated 
     <lb/>
     the repeal of the Northwest Territories Act. 
     <lb/>
     That was abandoned afterwards. The po<lb break="no"/>sition now is that that Act is left exactly as 
     <lb/>
     it is but these provinces are withdrawn 
     <lb/>
     from its operation to a certain extent. Any 
     <lb/>
     provision of the Act particularly applicable 
     <lb/>
     to a new province remains in force until re<lb break="no"/>pealed by a provincial legislature, so far as 
     <lb/>
     it has jurisdiction, or by the Dominion parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, in so far as its jurisdiction extends. 
     <lb/>
     The Northwest Territories Act, as a statute, 
     <lb/>
     remains, and what is intended by the Bill is 
     <lb/>
     to make certain supplementary provisions 
     <lb/>
     which the government believe to be neces<lb break="no"/>sary, in view of the fact that a very large 
     <lb/>
     portion of the Territories is about to be es<lb break="no"/>tablished into provinces. The Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act is really not repealed.

     of this sort would be exceedingly useful to

     us, because there are islands in the north

     that belong to Canada, and already two 
     <lb/>
     foreign states have entered into possession 
     <lb/>
     of a portion of our territory. In order to 
     <lb/>
     make my position clear, I may say that this 
     <lb/>
     is taken from the Order in Council which 
     <lb/>
     was passed July 1st, 1880—it is an adapta<lb break="no"/>tion of that description.

     <lb/>
     to avoid a description by saying that the

     Northwest Territories Act is withdrawn so 
     <lb/>
     far as the provinces of Saskatchewan and 
     <lb/>
     Alberta are concerned ? If that is done, it 
     <lb/>
     will remain just as it is for the rest.

            <p>

     <lb/>
     that it is exactly the same language, but it 
     <lb/>
     is the same thing. It is the law applicable 
     <lb/>
     to all these territories originally before they 
     <lb/>
     had power of legislation. It refers to the 
     <lb/>
     power which the Governor in Council exer<lb break="no"/>cises with regard to disallowance. A statute 
     <lb/>
     of a province goes into effect unless dis<lb break="no"/>allowed within a certain time. But in the

     Yukon and other territories ordinances come

     into effect after they have been submitted

     previous section—No. 6, ordinances by the

     Commissioner in Council. There appears

           to be a difference between the Yukon and

     We have the Northwest Territories Act, 
     <lb/>
     which provided that no matter what author<lb break="no"/>ity was governing the country they shall 
     <lb/>
     provide a certain system of education. In 
     <lb/>
     the Yukon there seems to be no such pro<lb break="no"/>vision whatever, but the Yukon Council 
     <lb/>
     goes on and provides a system of education 
     <lb/>
     similar to what they have in the Territories. 
     <lb/>
     I asked on one occasion before, by what 
     <lb/>
     authority this was done. I would ask again 
     <lb/>
     is it under such a clause as this clause 6 
     <lb/>
     that this has been done in the Yukon Terri<lb break="no"/>tory ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Under section 6 
     <lb/>
     they would have authority to legislate only 
     <lb/>
     on those matters, jurisdiction over which 
     <lb/>
     is assigned to them by the Governor in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I do not find any evi<lb break="no"/>dence that jurisdiction has been given by

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. There are some as<lb break="no"/>sets that have to be distributed, and I 
     <lb/>
     thought instead of having an involved 
     <lb/>
     scheme such as that employed with respect 
     <lb/>
     to the old provinces of Canada, as these 
     <lb/>
     Territories are not quite so pretentious in 
     <lb/>
     their belongings we would appoint a liqui<lb break="no"/>dator to distribute the assets between them.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It seems curious to

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I may say that I

            </p>

            <p>

     to have it continue for 30 or 40 years.

            <p>

     in order that it may be badly done.

            <p>

     avoid what occurred in the case of Ontario

   <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. When the elector

     has the right to go to him at any time during 
     <lb/>
     that period the least we can expect is that 
     <lb/>
     the enumerator, who is our officer, shall be

     in attendance at the place appointed.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. There is not a very heavy

     remuneration provided in any case for the

     enumerators.

            </p>

     that when they earn it they do not always

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. That is another point. In

     many cases the Auditor General has inter<lb break="no"/>posed objections to their getting that which 
     <lb/>
     they ought to have under the existing law. 
     <lb/>
     I venture to say that the average enumer<lb break="no"/>ator has not been necessarily obliged in the

     full performance of his duty to remain tied 
     <lb/>
     up for sixteen hours for the purpose of pro<lb break="no"/>viding these certificates.
