     Before this Bill finally passes, I wish to 
     <lb/>
     refer at some length to a very important 
     <lb/>
     matter of detail, namely, the Canadian Pa<lb break="no"/>cific Railway exemption. In committee 
     <lb/>
     upon this Bill I proposed an amendment to 
     <lb/>
     section 23 and my amendment was as fol<lb break="no"/>lows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Provided that the foregoing shall not preju<lb break="no"/>dice the right of the parliament of Canada, by

     expropriation or otherwise, to obtain the re<lb break="no"/>linquishment by the said company of the com<lb break="no"/>pany's rights under section 16 of the contract 
     <lb/>
     aforesaid.

            <p>
     I am sorry to say that in Committee of 
     <lb/>
     the Whole my proposition received very 
     <lb/>
     scant attention. The failure of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite to give more attention to it 
     <lb/>
     would have been a matter of surprise if 
     <lb/>
     any one really thought that these hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen were sincere in the talk they have 
     <lb/>
     been indulging in for the past five months 
     <lb/>
     with regard to provincial autonomy. 0n 
     <lb/>
     the question of education, they have been 
     <lb/>
     disturbing the whole of Canada with the 
     <lb/>
     exception of the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     They failed, however, to disturb the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories on the 
     <lb/>
     matter of education and upon the subject 
     <lb/>
     they have been seeking to create a distur<lb break="no"/>bance about practically nothing. As a re<lb break="no"/>presentative of the Territories I tell them 
     <lb/>
     here and now that the Bills creating the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces are granting to these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces, in relation to education, all the 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8778</fw>
         

     freedom they desire. The Bills leave the 
     <lb/>
     provinces free to do exactly as they please 
     <lb/>
     in that matter. The Bills leave them 
     <lb/>
     free to retain their existing admirable 
     <lb/>
     school system, and I think the House and 
     <lb/>
     country have been given the most ample 
     <lb/>
     proof that what the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     desire to retain and maintain their present 
     <lb/>
     school system. But if any one is seriously 
     <lb/>
     concerned in the question of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights he should devote his attention rather 
     <lb/>
     to section 23, which concerns the matter of 
     <lb/>
     tax exemptions than to section 16 regard<lb break="no"/>ing education. In the  matter of tax 
     <lb/>exemptions involved in section 23, the 
     <lb/>provinces are not left free. If the 
     <lb/>school districts and municipalities and legis<lb break="no"/>latures were left free to tax the Canadian 
     <lb/>Pacific Railway, they would without doubt, 
     <lb/>use that freedom. The failure of members 
     <lb/>on this side and members of the government 
     <lb/>to support my proposed amendment was to 
     <lb/>me a matter both of surprise and regret. In 
     <lb/>any case I had the right to expect from the 
     <lb/>government at least a moment's consider<lb break="no"/>ation of the proposal and a statement of 
     <lb/>their reasons for rejecting it, if any good 
     <lb/>reasons exist. The extremely casual way 
     <lb/>in which my amendment was rejected in 
     <lb/>committee may have been due to my own 
     <lb/>failure to make sufficiently plain my posi<lb break="no"/>tion in the matter, the intrinsic importance 
     <lb/>of the subject, and why the amendment 
     <lb/>ought to be adopted. If I fail to make these 
     <lb/>points plain now, it will not be my fault. 
     <lb/>To make my meaning plain, I must refer 
     <lb/>to the autonomy question in a general way. 
     <lb/>Prior to my first coming to this House in 
     <lb/>1901, I was an advocate of immediate au<lb break="no"/>tonomy for the Territories. In 1901 and 
     <lb/>1902, I urged my opinions in that direc<lb break="no"/>tion strongly in this House. In March, 
     <lb/>1903, the Manitoba courts gave a judgment 
     <lb/>on certain test tax cases, to which I shall 
     <lb/>refer later. That judgment was such as to 
     <lb/>lead me to revise my views as to the de<lb break="no"/>sirability of the Territories immediately ob<lb break="no"/>taining autonomy. The Ottawa corres<lb break="no"/>pondent of the Winnipeg ' Free Press ' ob<lb break="no"/>tained interviews upon that judgment from 
     <lb/>most of the Northwest members. In my 
     <lb/>statement to that correspondent, I spoke 
     <lb/>as follows :

     As a Northwest citizen I was disappointed last 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     then found it inexpedient to grant our demand. 
     <lb/>
     We will now wish for no constitutional change 
     <lb/>
     until judgment on the contention raised by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howell has been obtained from the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council, and if the judgment of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     arrangement to be arrived at with the Canadian

            <p>
     Let me say, in conclusion, that in face of the 
     <lb/>
     position of this Canadian Pacific Railway tax 
     <lb/>
     matter, in view of the millions of acres of the 
     <lb/>
     land that are involved, of the millions of value 
     <lb/>
     in railway property of the company that are 
     <lb/>
     involved, it appears to me that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest would be simply crazy at present 
     <lb/>
     to accept autonomy unless driven to it as a last 
     <lb/>
     resort—and we are not driven to the last resort 
     <lb/>
     this year, because our immediate financial needs 
     <lb/>
     are fairly well met; the lack of borrowing 
     <lb/>
     power remedied by the capital advance method ; 
     <lb/>
     and little room for complaint is left us as re<lb break="no"/>gards railways. Such being the case, I certainly 
     <lb/>
     approve of delay until all doubts of the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway tax question is removed. 
     <lb/>
     I hope this doubt will not exist very long. I 
     <lb/>
     hope the case will soon be settled by a judgment 
     <lb/>
     of the Privy Council. Possibly it may be too 
     <lb/>
     much to hope that it may be settled before next 
     <lb/>
     year, because the law counts move slowly. But 
     <lb/>
     the position I take is that the government 
     <lb/>
     should obtain from the Privy Council a final 
     <lb/>
     decision upon this Canadian Pacific Railway tax 
     <lb/>
     exemption, and that as soon as it is obtained 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest should be granted 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     This view thus expressed in the news<lb break="no"/>papers and in the House, I also expressed 
     <lb/>
     very distinctly to my electors in West As<lb break="no"/>siniboia, particularly during the election con<lb break="no"/>test last autumn, and I have every reason 
     <lb/>
     to believe that the majority of the electors 
     <lb/>
     of West Assiniboia concurred in the view. 
     <lb/>
     I declared explicitly in the contest that I 
     <lb/>
     should oppose any constitutional change un<lb break="no"/>til the tax exemption matter became more 
     <lb/>
     clear, and until the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west learned definitely that they would not 
     <lb/>
     as provinces stand in danger of the burden 
     <lb/>
     of that perpetual limitation upon their taxing 
     <lb/>
     power which was imposed upon the added 
     <lb/>
     portion of the province of Manitoba in 1881. 
     <lb/>
     The situation in January last when the 
     <lb/>
     autonomy negotiations opened was that no 
     <lb/>
     final judgment had been obtained. It is 
     <lb/>
     true that. since January. the Supreme Court 
     <lb/>
     of Canada has given judgment overturning 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba court's decision, of March, 
     <lb/>
     1903. But, until the case has been carried 
     <lb/>
     to the Privy Council and judgment, obtained 
     <lb/>
     there. the matter cannot be considered as 
     <lb/>
     finally settled. I need not repeat to the 
     <lb/>
     House that in January last I was opposed 
     <lb/>
     to proceeding with the autonomy measures. 
     <lb/>
     Now, I shall explain briefly the reason why 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba court judgment led me to re<lb break="no"/>vise my view on the question of autonomy. 
     <lb/>
     The Northwest test case was that of a school 
     <lb/>
     district, the Springdale school district. It 
     <lb/>
     was not a case brought by a municipality, 
     <lb/>
     nor a case directly raising the question 
     <lb/>
     of the powers of the local legislature to levy 
     <lb/>
     a tax upon the company. The case was 
     <lb/>
     taken for the purpose of obtaining an inter<lb break="no"/>pretation of the disputed question of the 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8780</fw>
           

     twenty years' land tax exemption, without 
     <lb/>
     reference to the roadway. But the argu<lb break="no"/>ments made by the government's counsel, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Howell, of Winnipeg, were such that, 
     <lb/>
     if concurred in by the court, as was the 
     <lb/>
     case in the Manitoba court, they necessar<lb break="no"/>ily applied as well to the feature of the 
     <lb/>
     exemptions relating to the roadway. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Howell raised the contention that a tax 
     <lb/>
     levied by any body or power within these 
     <lb/>
     Territories did not come within the class 
     <lb/>
     of taxes from which the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway Company were exempted by the 
     <lb/>
     contract, these classes of taxes being such 
     <lb/>
     as might be levied ' by the Dominion, by 
     <lb/>
     any province hereafter established or by 
     <lb/>
     any municipality therein, in other words 
     <lb/>
     the contention was that, as long as we 
     <lb/>
     remained Territories the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway had no right to exemption of tax<lb break="no"/>ation in the Northwest, either upon lands 
     <lb/>
     or upon toadbed; and that it was not until 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest was created a province that 
     <lb/>
    any exemption rights became existent. The 
     <lb/>contention was a new one. Until it was 
     <lb/>raised by Mr. Howell. no one ever thought 
     <lb/>of questioning the company's rights to free<lb break="no"/>dom from taxation on the roadway or free<lb break="no"/>dom for at least twenty years on the land. 
     <lb/>Let me quote from Chief Justice Killam's 
     <lb/>judgment to show that the judgment meant 
     <lb/>just what I have stated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The case from the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
    raised another question. Does the exemption 
     <lb/>apply to the enactments of the legislature of 
     <lb/>the Northwest Territories or to the taxation 
     <lb/>by subordinate bodies created by that legis<lb break="no"/>lature ? . . . . Evidently these words— 
     <lb/>' taxation by the Dominion '—did not mean 
     <lb/>taxation by any government or authority in 
     <lb/>the Dominion having the power of levying 
     <lb/>taxes. Taxation by a province or by a muni<lb break="no"/>cipal corporation was recognized as something 
     <lb/>different from taxation by the Dominion. 
     <lb/>In my opinion the expression ' taxation by the 
     <lb/>Dominion ' did not, either from the import of 
     <lb/>the words themselves or by reference to other 
     <lb/>portions of the clause or the contract, include 
     <lb/>taxation by the government of the Territories 
     <lb/>or any body to be established by it, within its 
     <lb/>then powers.

            <p>
     I repent that. when I became aware of the 
     <lb/>
     purport of that judgment I at once made up 
     <lb/>
     my mind that the Northwest had better 
     <lb/>
     accept no constitutional change until we had 
     <lb/>
     ascertained finally whether Chief Justice 
     <lb/>
     Killam's view was the right one, because, 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion, any loss to be occasioned by 
     <lb/>
     delay of two or three years in gaining 
     <lb/>
     autonomy would be light and temporary in 
     <lb/>
     comparison with the permanent loss to the 
     <lb/>
     province involved in the perpetual inability 
     <lb/>
     to tax the Canadian Pacific Railway road<lb break="no"/>bed. If the Privy Council were to uphold 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba judgment and if it were finally 
     <lb/>
     found that the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     must pay taxes as long as we remained Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, it needs no argument to show that to 
     <lb/>
     obtain prior relinquishment by the company 
     <lb/>
     of the exemption rights that would other<lb break="no"/>wise become effective with the erection of

            <p>
     I now ask the House to consider the in<lb break="no"/>trinsic merits of this question. There is a 
     <lb/>
     railway mileage involved in the two provin<lb break="no"/>ces of 750 miles, with six divisional points. 
     <lb/>
     Assume that this has a taxable value of 
     <lb/>
     $100000 for each three miles—and it is 
     <lb/>
     stocked and bonded for $193,500 for each 
     <lb/>
     three miles—and you have a total taxable 
     <lb/>
     value of $25,000,000 to-day. A tax of 5 mills 
     <lb/>
     on the dollar which is only 1/2 of 1 per cent, 
     <lb/>
     would amount to $125,000 per annum. But 
     <lb/>
     it is not particularly for to-day or for the 
     <lb/>
     immediate future that we are concerned. 
     <lb/>
     To-day it is the custom at least in the newer 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country, to give aid to railways 
     <lb/>
     rather than to levy taxation upon them. It 
     <lb/>
     is to the future that we have to look. If 
     <lb/>
     that property is worth $25,000,000 to-day. it 
     <lb/>
     will be worth—everybody will admit—some 
     <lb/>
     day, $100,000,000. While it is not our policy 
     <lb/>
     to tax railways to-day, yet when more stable 
     <lb/>
     conditions come and the country is more 
     <lb/>
     fully developed it will be fair that railway 
     <lb/>
     properties equally with the other properties 
     <lb/>
     shall contribute toward the cost of school, 
     <lb/>
     municipal and general government. I say 
     <lb/>
     that the loss involved to these two new 
     <lb/>
     provinces if they should be subjected to 
     <lb/>
     perpetual inability to tax this property is a 
     <lb/>
     loss simply beyond calculation. The ex<lb break="no"/>emption of the land is the least momen<lb break="no"/>tous, because it is only temporary, but it 
     <lb/>
     is still serious enough. I will give the House 
     <lb/>
     figures showing the land that the company 
     <lb/>
     owns at present in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. The company has earned land

     The company has made sales up to date of 
     <lb/>
     approximately 10,000,000 acres—for about 
     <lb/>
     $33.500,000, I may say—of which as nearly 
     <lb/>
     as can be learned upwards of 7,500,000 acres 
     <lb/>
     were out of the lands in the two new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, leaving roughly 11,300,000 acres 
     <lb/>
     still owned, by the company in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territory, or about 70,500 quarter sec<lb break="no"/>tions, which if taxed at $10 per quarter 
     <lb/>
     section would yield annually $705,000. Now, 
     <lb/>
     you may cut my calculation in two, 
     <lb/>
     and still have a very large amount. 
     <lb/>
     You will still find that by this exemption at 
     <lb/>
     this moment you are leaving each province 
     <lb/>
     shorn of a resource of a value about equal

     to what you are going to pay each province

     far more forcible than any which I could

     some twenty-five years ago. They should 
     <lb/>
     appeal especially to hon. members on this

     twenty-five years, the bitter experience of

     twenty-five years has shown the truth of 
     <lb/>
     everyone of these words. I shall quote the 
     <lb/>
     words of Hon. Edward Blake, spoken in this

     <lb/>
     found in 'Hansard.' 1880-1, page 97. Mr.

     They have perpetual exemption from taxation

     <lb/>
     which is to be the period of bondage in other

     is for longer than twenty years from now ; it

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     If you want to tie them, take the contract ; 
     <lb/>
     if you want to keep them free, take the other 
     <lb/>
     proposal. The choice is yours, the responsi<lb break="no"/>bility of choosing is yours. Choose, then, and 
     <lb/>
     choose wisely. The contract frees from taxa<lb break="no"/>tion the railway, its property, and its stock. 
     <lb/>
     That exemption is contrary to the general rule 
     <lb/>
     in the United States. A little book which con<lb break="no"/>tains the report of Charles Francis Adams and 
     <lb/>
     others on the subject of railway taxation in the 
     <lb/>
     United States, and elsewhere, summarizes the 
     <lb/>
     law upon this subject and makes it to appear 
     <lb/>
     that in the whole of the states of the Union 
     <lb/>
     there is no instance of general exemption from 
     <lb/>
     taxation. There may be one or two isolated 
     <lb/>
     cases in particular states of partial and tem<lb break="no"/>porary exemption from taxation of particular 
     <lb/>
     railways under special circumstances ; but the 
     <lb/>
     general rule of almost universal application is 
     <lb/>
     that there is no exemption in one form or 
     <lb/>
     another from taxation. The instances which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Railways quoted in other 
     <lb/>
     places in Minnesota and Wisconsin, are in<lb break="no"/>stances of exemption from taxation by one 
     <lb/>
     statute and the imposition of taxation by ano<lb break="no"/>ther—a license tax, a tax upon gross receipts, 
     <lb/>
     is imposed in lieu of other taxes, and it may 
     <lb/>
     be that this is the fairest mode of taxation. 
     <lb/>
     Some hon. gentlemen have said that it is of 
     <lb/>
     very little consequence, that the road-bed is 
     <lb/>
     taxed very lightly in Ontario, that some of our 
     <lb/>
     legislatures have declined to tax railway com<lb break="no"/>panies at all. But what kind of railway com<lb break="no"/>panies were these ? They were railways built 
     <lb/>
     by private capital, and were not paying interest 
     <lb/>
     on their investments. I do not say that a rule 
     <lb/>
     of this kind does not apply to a railway that is 
     <lb/>
     built at public charge and that is given a mon<lb break="no"/>opoly to secure it in obtaining good rates for 
     <lb/>
     its traffic. But this is no temporary exemption, 
     <lb/>
     it lasts for ever ; no matter how bloated this 
     <lb/>
     corporation may become, no matter how magni<lb break="no"/>ficent may be its network of railways, no mat<lb break="no"/>ter how blooming its country, no matter how 
     <lb/>
     prosperous the towns which are tributary to it, 
     <lb/>
     no matter how exaggerated its dividend, for 
     <lb/>
     ever and for ever and for ever you free it from 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, new provincial and municipal taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. In considering that, you have to look at 
     <lb/>
     the general result of taxation. Some of the 
     <lb/>
     United States railways you find paying a tax of 
     <lb/>
     $300 or $400 per annum, and $600 or $800 per 
     <lb/>
     annum is paid as taxes by the English railways. 
     <lb/>
     You find, therefore, that the possibilities of 
     <lb/>
     railway taxation are very great. You find the 
     <lb/>
     Illinois Central Railway paying almost the 
     <lb/>
     whole expenses of the government of that state, 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8784</fw>
         

     and You find the people so nervous lest the 
     <lb/>
     legislature should be corrupted and should dis<lb break="no"/>pense with that, that they have actually put a 
     <lb/>
     clause in the constitution providing that the 
     <lb/>
     taxation of the Illinois Central Railway shall 
     <lb/>
     not be modified by the legislature, but shall be 
     <lb/>
     referred to the general voice of the people. 
     <lb/>
     But you do not keep your hands free, you tie 
     <lb/>
     them, and you say for all time we will never 
     <lb/>
     charge this railway company any taxation upon 
     <lb/>
     its property, its stock, or its capital. I say 
     <lb/>
     that I can well conceive a time when a tax on 
     <lb/>
     the gross receipts of railways might be a very 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory tax and a very satisfactory source 
     <lb/>
     of revenue to this Dominion. A tax for trans<lb break="no"/>portation would apparently be a very equal 
     <lb/>
     taxation, and if the necessity arose of adding 
     <lb/>
     to the revenue, it is quite possible that we 
     <lb/>
     might wish to avail ourselves of such a tax. 
     <lb/>
     There is another point in which this exemption 
     <lb/>
     is objectionable. It places this company in the 
     <lb/>
     position of a monopoly by itself, because it 
     <lb/>
     places at a disadvantage all competitors who 
     <lb/>
     are to raise the funds themselves to build their 
     <lb/>
     railways. The contract requires perpetual ex<lb break="no"/>emption, the other offer does not demand any ex<lb break="no"/>emption at all. Choose ! The choice is yours ! 
     <lb/>
     Take the perpetual exemption in the contract 
     <lb/>
     or take the liability to taxation in the offer. 
     <lb/>
     Yours is the choice ; for it you will be held re<lb break="no"/>sponsible. Then the contract provides that the 
     <lb/>
     land grant shall be exempt from taxation for 
     <lb/>
     twenty years, unless sold or occupied from the

     date of the grant. The money gain to the com<lb break="no"/>pany is enormous, there can be no doubt about 
     <lb/>
     that. There can be no doubt but that the 
     <lb/>
     burdens which this company are freed from 
     <lb/>
     are most serious. Hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     have said so. They have said they could not 
     <lb/>
     use this land grant otherwise, that nobody 
     <lb/>
     would buy if they supposed the syndicate was 
     <lb/>
     to be subjected to the same taxes as the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the world. They get the choice of land and 
     <lb/>
     they are not to pay the same taxes as the rest 
     <lb/>
     of the community. Why should they not ? Is 
     <lb/>
     it because they get a large profit ? Because 
     <lb/>
     they are getting altogether four prices for 
     <lb/>
     building the prairie section, that, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     they are to be untaxed and free ? Then the in<lb break="no"/>direct loss is still greater by this mode of set<lb break="no"/>tlement, by the burdens it imposes on the ad<lb break="no"/>joining settlers for the benefit of the railway 
     <lb/>
     company itself, by the imposition of double 
     <lb/>
     taxes on those who go in for the benefit of this 
     <lb/>
     great corporation. I do not know of anything 
     <lb/>
     that will more interfere with the development 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest than this clause of exemption 
     <lb/>
     from taxation. Will you free the lands, or will 
     <lb/>
     you make them subject to taxation ? Will you 
     <lb/>
     give the company the benefit of exemption from 
     <lb/>
     taxation, or will you let the lands be subject to 
     <lb/>
     taxation, and let the progress of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     country be advanced by those lands, like other 
     <lb/>
     lands, being subject to taxation ? The choice is 
     <lb/>
     yours ; choose.

     Every December the tax collector will call on

     It is 25 years ago that these words were

     uttered in this House with rare prophetic 
     <lb/>
     insight. I have quoted them here to estab<lb break="no"/>lish my proposition that section 23 invol<lb break="no"/>ves a limitation upon provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     of no trivial character. I trust that I have 
     <lb/>
     said enough now to show the House clearly 
     <lb/>
     my own position in the matter in its re<lb break="no"/>lation to the Autonomy Bills and as well 
     <lb/>
     the intrinsic importance of the subject. I 
     <lb/>
     propose next to show particularly why I 
     <lb/>
     think my amendment should be adopted. 
     <lb/>
     Probably it is not necessary for me at this 
     <lb/>
     stage to say that I am not proposing re<lb break="no"/>pudiation. I am not proposing to take away 
     <lb/>
     from the company any of its contract rights. 
     <lb/>
     I stand in that regard just as my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) who 
     <lb/>
     when referring to this subject some weeks 
     <lb/>
     ago said that no right thinking person would 
     <lb/>
     propose to deprive this company of any 
     <lb/>
     rights which the parliament and people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada 25 years ago with their eyes open 
     <lb/>
     gave to them. I admit, as any right- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     thinking person must admit, that the 
     <lb/>
     contract must be respected. But I ask, 
     <lb/>
     whose was the contract ? Was it not a con<lb break="no"/>tract made between the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada and the company ? The Canadian Paci<lb break="no"/>fic Railway was and is a federal under<lb break="no"/>taking. These exemptions were and are a 
     <lb/>
     part of the cost of the undertaking. Then, 
     <lb/>
     why shift part of such cost price upon these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces more than upon the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Nova Scotia or any of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion ? The new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are, without these exemptions, bear<lb break="no"/>ing their fair share of the undertaking with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces of Canada. Then, why 
     <lb/>
     place them under a double burden? Let 
     <lb/>
     me quote a little further from the debates 
     <lb/>
     of 1881, when the contract was first before 
     <lb/>
     parliament. I will quote from a gentleman 
     <lb/>
     whose name is fairly well known and res<lb break="no"/>pected throughout the Dominion of Canada, 
     <lb/>the Hon. George W. Ross, who was a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this House in 1881. He spoke as fol<lb break="no"/>lows :

     contributes its equal share. If these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are left under these particular ex<lb break="no"/>emptions you are placing a double burden 
     <lb/>
     upon them—they are paying equally with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces the money subsidies and 
     <lb/>
     the price of the $27,000.000 worth of com<lb break="no"/>pleted road that was given the company— 
     <lb/>
     they pay almost the whole of the land sub<lb break="no"/>sidy—they bear equally with you the loss 
     <lb/>
     involved in the exemption from taxation by 
     <lb/>
     Dominion—and in addition to their full and 
     <lb/>
     equal share of the whole cost and burden, 
     <lb/>
     you leave them to bear alone a substantial 
     <lb/>
     piece of the cost of this federal undertak<lb break="no"/>ing beyond that share which the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are carrying. Is there any fair<lb break="no"/>ness in that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Look at it closely. The $25,000,000 cash 
     <lb/>
     subsidy to the company is looked on as a 
     <lb/>
     heavy charge to Canada. What is it ac<lb break="no"/>tually ? Three per cent on $25,000,000 is 
     <lb/>
     $750,000 a year. If my calculations are cor<lb break="no"/>rect, the provincial tax exemptions will cost 
     <lb/>
     these two provinces easily as much. What 
     <lb/>
     then are you doing? You are asking the

     provinces to bear alone a portion of the 
     <lb/>
     cost of the Canadian Pacific Railway equal 
     <lb/>
     to the item of cost which the whole of Can<lb break="no"/>ada bears by its $25,000,000 cash subsidy. 
     <lb/>
     I ask again, is there any fairness in that ? 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Ross saw in 1881, if the exemptions 
     <lb/>
     were made an item of the contract, that 
     <lb/>
     when provinces were created it would be 
     <lb/>
     improper and unjust to leave them saddled 
     <lb/>
     with the burden of the exemptions. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake in 1881 declared that the people of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest would be less than men if 
     <lb/>
     they suffered such a limitation upon their 
     <lb/>
     autonomy to exist. In January, 1905, when 
     <lb/>
     confronted with the declaration of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that provinces were to be erected 
     <lb/>
     this year, I took the position that if it was 
     <lb/>
     intended to leave the provinces under these 
     <lb/>
     exemptions I must oppose the measures, in 
     <lb/>
     particular view of the possibility that by 
     <lb/>
     waiting for the Privy Council judgment on 
     <lb/>
     the test cases a comparatively easy way 
     <lb/>
     might be found of obtaining relinquishment 
     <lb/>
     by the company of the provincial exemption 
     <lb/>
     rights. The Prime Minister intimated to 
     <lb/>
     me his recognition that these exemptions, 
     <lb/>
     both Dominion and provincial. would have 
     <lb/>
     to be abrogated in the interests not alone 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces but of the Dominion. With 
     <lb/>
     that intimation that the provinces need 
     <lb/>
     not fear that they would be left under the 
     <lb/>
     exemption perpetually I consented to take 
     <lb/>
     my part in discussing the autonomy terms 
     <lb/>
     and voted for the second reading of the 
     <lb/>
     Bills. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If you had not got that 
     <lb/>
     you would be on strike I presume. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. You can have your own 
     <lb/>
     opinion about that. The Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     has publicly repeated the assurance which 
     <lb/>
     he gave to me. What I ask now is that 
     <lb/>
     the government and the House shall con<lb break="no"/>cur in that assurance in a tangible way by 
     <lb/>
     putting in black and white in these provin<lb break="no"/>cial charters the notice of intention to can<lb break="no"/>cel these exemptions,—a notice to all con<lb break="no"/>cerned, to the company, to the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and especially to the people of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. Is it unnecessary ? I say 
     <lb/>
     it is no more unnecessary than your section 
     <lb/>
     23. Section 23 does not say that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince cannot tax the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way road or lands. It is not section 23 of 
     <lb/>
     these Bills, but section 16 of the contract 
     <lb/>
     of 1881 which imposes the limitation. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion 23 merely states that the provinces are 
     <lb/>
     subject to that contract—to the degree that 
     <lb/>
     the contract is good or bad in legality or 
     <lb/>
     constitutionality, weak or strong, doubtful 
     <lb/>
     or perfect, to that degree the provinces are 
     <lb/>
     bound. If you deem it proper and impera<lb break="no"/>tive to thus give notice to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     that their autonomy has been invaded by a 
     <lb/>
     previous parliament, then I say that it is 
     <lb/>
     not only equally proper, but doubly impera<lb break="no"/>tive, if there is sincerity behind the assu<lb break="no"/>rance given by the Prime Minister, which 
     <lb/>
     I do not for a moment question, that you 
     <lb/>
     shall give notice at the same time and in 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8790</fw>
         

     the same manner that parliament will in 
     <lb/>
     good time remedy that invasion, and that 
     <lb/>
     the provinces will not be left for ever under 
     <lb/>
     the unfair burden of these exemptions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I appeal to the Liberal party on the 
     <lb/>
     strength of the principle of provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights ; on the statement I made here in 
     <lb/>
     1901, that entire equality as between the 
     <lb/>
     provinces is the only sure guarantee of the 
     <lb/>
     permanency of confederation ; on the sound 
     <lb/>
     doctrine preached in this Chamber 25 years 
     <lb/>
     ago by Blake, Cameron, Charlton, Mills, Pa<lb break="no"/>terson, Cartwright, Laurier, and other Lib<lb break="no"/>eral leaders ; and particularly on the decla<lb break="no"/>ration made in 1881 by Hon. G. W. Ross, 
     <lb/>
     which I have read. I appeal to the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party in this matter because the 
     <lb/>
     difficulty is of their creation. It is not these 
     <lb/>
     Bills, it is not section 23 which limits pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy, but section 16 of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway contract. What<lb break="no"/>ever substantial or serious lack of autonomy 
     <lb/>
     there is against which these provinces will 
     <lb/>
     have to complain, is not the deed of the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party, but of the Conservative party. 
     <lb/>
     Let me tell my hon. friends opposite that 
     <lb/>
     they need not think so far as the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, that by raising a school question 
     <lb/>
     dust or a land question dust they are going 
     <lb/>
     to hide from the people of these Territories 
     <lb/>
     the knowledge of the fact that it is the Con<lb break="no"/>servative party that is responsible for the 
     <lb/>
     only material limitation upon their autonomy 
     <lb/>
     which is being granted by these Bills to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. In every other respect 
     <lb/>
     where there is a departure from the strict 
     <lb/>
     plan of confederation it is a departure with 
     <lb/>
     which the people of the new provinces are 
     <lb/>
     entirely content. There is a departure with 
     <lb/>
     respect to representation ; provision is made 
     <lb/>
     in these Bills for redistribution upon a cen<lb break="no"/>sus to be taken midway between two 
     <lb/>
     decennial censuses and there never has 
     <lb/>
     been any such provision made for any 
     <lb/>
     other province. That departure is in 
     <lb/>
     the interest of the people of these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. There is a departure 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the debt or capital 
     <lb/>
     account. When I raised that question my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. Foster) took the position 
     <lb/>
     that it was much better in the interests 
     <lb/>
     of the people of these provinces that they 
     <lb/>
     should be put in a different position from 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces with regard to their 
     <lb/>
     capital or debt account. For instance, sev<lb break="no"/>eral million dollars stand to the credit of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and it is 
     <lb/>
     in the power of the governments of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces to withdraw that capital and use 
     <lb/>
     it immediately in any way they choose. 
     <lb/>
     But by these Bills the governments of Al<lb break="no"/>berta and Saskatchewan are not going to 
     <lb/>
     be left at liberty to withdraw their capital; 
     <lb/>
     all they will be able to do is to take from 
     <lb/>
     year to year 5 per cent interest on the capi<lb break="no"/>tal account. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Where does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman find authority for saying that 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
        

     the other provinces could withdraw their 
     <lb/>
     capital account? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I refer my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Grey to his friend from North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster) who, when we discussed this mat<lb break="no"/>ter, stated that one of the maritime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces had withdrawn a portion of its ca<lb break="no"/>pital and acted very foolishly in doing so. 
     <lb/>
     There is a very material difference in these 
     <lb/>
     Bills from the confederation plan with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the land, but my opinion is that 
     <lb/>
     the people of the new provinces are quite 
     <lb/>
     content with that. I do not think I can 
     <lb/>
     quote any better authority on that point 
     <lb/>
     than Mr. Haultain, who in a formal letter 
     <lb/>
     to Sir Wilfrid Laurier stated he was quite 
     <lb/>
     willing to admit that the plan adopted in 
     <lb/>
     these Bills would work out more advan<lb break="no"/>tageously to the people of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     than had the actual confederation plan been 
     <lb/>
     followed. I hope I have said enough—

     <lb/>
     evidently think I have said enough, but they 
     <lb/>
     will have to hear more of this and some 
     <lb/>
     other questions out in the new provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     have no doubt that these gentlemen would 
     <lb/>
     be pleased indeed if these questions were 
     <lb/>
     never heard of again either here or anywhere 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion of Canada. Have I left any<lb break="no"/>thing to be said ? I trust that I have been 
     <lb/>
     able to put the case in a way to prove that 
     <lb/>
     this is no light matter—that it is no imma<lb break="no"/>terial limitation upon Northwest autonomy 
     <lb/>
     that is at issue—that a real and substantial 
     <lb/>matter of provincial rights is involved. I 
     <lb/>trust that I have left no room for doubt as 
     <lb/>to my own position. On last 3rd November, 
     <lb/>in last January, on the 3rd of May when I 
     <lb/>voted for the general principle of autonomy 
     <lb/>and for the principles bound up in the main 
     <lb/>details of the measures, I deemed myself 
     <lb/>in honour bound, and at this moment I deem 
     <lb/>myself in honour bound, to oppose any auto<lb break="no"/>nomy scheme which will leave the North<lb break="no"/>west provinces for ever under these exemp<lb break="no"/>tions. As a whole, I believe the Bills pro<lb break="no"/>vide not only fair but generous terms. On 
     <lb/>that account, and further because of the 
     <lb/>other vexed and complicating difficulties 
     <lb/>which have arisen and which would almost 
     <lb/>necessarily have led to a contrary vote by 
     <lb/>me being misconstrued, I have not deemed 
     <lb/>it fair nor right to oppose the Bills nor to 
     <lb/>withdraw my support from the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister on the measures. But in view of the 
     <lb/>position which I held on this question be<lb break="no"/>fore my electors, I have open to me only one 
     <lb/>alternative. If the government and the 
     <lb/>House can see their way clear to adopt my 
     <lb/>amendment, I shall have redeemed the 
     <lb/>pledge upon which I accepted election in 
     <lb/>West Assiniboia. I therefore beg to move,

     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     I regret, as much as my hon. friend him<lb break="no"/>self who has spoken with a good deal of 
     <lb/>
     warmth on this subject, the necessity under 
     <lb/>
     which the government has found itself im<lb break="no"/>pelled to introduce the section in the Bill to 
     <lb/>
     which he has taken such strong exception. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend is aware, and the House is 
     <lb/>
     aware also, that the party to which he and 
     <lb/>
     I belong did everything we could to prevent 
     <lb/>
     parliament from accepting that clause of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway contract 
     <lb/>
     when it was submitted to parliament in the 
     <lb/>
     year 1881. Unfortunately the efforts we 
     <lb/>
     made at that time were unavailing ; parlia<lb break="no"/>ment thought differently. That parliament 
     <lb/>
     made a mistake on that occasion I do not 
     <lb/>
     think is susceptible now of any discussion. 
     <lb/>
     However, even though parliament did make 
     <lb/>
     a mistake on that occasion, it is a rule 
     <lb/>
     which has never been violated, and which 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend himself admits, that, even 
     <lb/>
     under such a sense of mistake which would 
     <lb/>
     be shared by the parliament of this day, 
     <lb/>
     there is nothing to do but to abide loyally 
     <lb/>
     by what has been done ; and I understand 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend himself does not pro<lb break="no"/>pose that parliament at this juncture should 
     <lb/>
     with a rough hand attempt to repudiate the 
     <lb/>
     engagement which was entered into in 1881. 
     <lb/>
     His amendment does not go that length, nor 
     <lb/>
     did he imply in his argument that we should 
     <lb/>
     attempt to give to the new provinces which 
     <lb/>
     we are now creating the power of taxing 
     <lb/>
     the property of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company, in face of the exception 
     <lb/>
     which was made in its favour when the 
     <lb/>
     contract was entered into in 1881. The only 
     <lb/>
     amendment which my hon. friend wants to 
     <lb/>
     have made is a declaration to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     this clause which we insert in the Bill giv<lb break="no"/>ing effect to the exemption contained in the 
     <lb/>
     Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     Company, ' shall not prejudice the right of 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada, by expropriation 
     <lb/>
     or otherwise, to obtain the relinquishment 
     <lb/>
     by the said company of the company's rights 
     <lb/>
     under section 16 of the contract as afore<lb break="no"/>said.' The only answer I have to make to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend on this point is that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment do not think it advisable to com<lb break="no"/>plicate this Bill further than it is at present 
     <lb/>
     by the unfortunate necessity of inserting in 
     <lb/>
     the Bill the section which he wants thus 
     <lb/>
     amended. The parliament of Canada made 
     <lb/>
     a solemn contract with the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway Company, and this contract cannot 
     <lb/>
     be done away with except in one of two 
     <lb/>

     ways, that is to say, by mutual agreement 
     <lb/>
     between the contracting parties, that is, be<lb break="no"/>tween the parliament of Canada and the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway Company, or by 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada exercising its 
     <lb/>
     power of eminent domain, and expropria<lb break="no"/>ting from the company the privilege which 
     <lb/>
     was given to it by parliament. I appeal to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend on this matter. I do not see 
     <lb/>
     that this right of the Canadian parliament 
     <lb/>
     would be made any stronger than it is by 
     <lb/>
     applying to it a declaration of this kind. 
     <lb/>
     It would simply amount to a declaration, 
     <lb/>
     and nothing else; it would have no more 
     <lb/>
     effect than the passing of the section in 
     <lb/>
     silence. It would simply complicate this 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     on whose behalf my hon. friend has spoken 
     <lb/>
     with great effect and warmth, would not be 
     <lb/>
     benefitted in the least. I said on a previous 
     <lb/>
     occasion that in this matter we are part<lb break="no"/>ners with the new provinces of Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan; we are in the same boat 
     <lb/>
     with them. The exemptions from which 
     <lb/>
     they suffer this parliament also suffers 
     <lb/>
     from ; and our interests being common, the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories can rely 
     <lb/>
     that the Canadian government, in protect<lb break="no"/>ing its own interests, must likewise protect 
     <lb/>
     those of the new provinces which we are 
     <lb/>
     creating. I have only to repeat that in my 
     <lb/>
     opinion this is a blemish which has been 
     <lb/>
     placed, not only on the people of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but on the people of Canada 
     <lb/>
     generally, and that the time has come, I 
     <lb/>
     am not prepared to say when, when the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada must address itself to 
     <lb/>
     this question. Therefore I do not see that 
     <lb/>
     we can accept this amendment.

     A more absolutely irrelevant proviso could 
     <lb/>
     not be imagined. It is utterly absurd. The 
     <lb/>
     words in section 23 do not in the slightest 
     <lb/>
     degree affect the power of the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to deal with that question, and 
     <lb/>
     there is not any lawyer in the House who 
     <lb/>
     would venture for one moment to stake his

     professional reputation upon the contrary

     assertion.

            <p>
     The parliament of Canada is giving not<lb break="no"/>ice to the new provinces of the contract 
     <lb/>
     entered into by the Crown with the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Pacific Railway. It is not withdraw<lb break="no"/>ing anything from its own power. 'It is 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the powers of the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature. It does not purport, in any 
     <lb/>
     word or syllable of this section, to be tak<lb break="no"/>ing away anything from its own power, 
     <lb/>
     and it will have, if this section be passed, 
     <lb/>
     exactly the same power to do that mention<lb break="no"/>ed in this proviso as it had before the sec<lb break="no"/>tion passed. Therefore, I propose to vote 
     <lb/>
     against the amendment. I shall vote against 
     <lb/>
     it because it has not any effect or meaning, 
     <lb/>
     and I cannot see that it adds anything to or 
     <lb/>
     takes anything from the meaning of the

     I do not know what assurance of the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister the hon. gentleman referred 
     <lb/>
     to this afternoon when he spoke of some 
     <lb/>
     assurance of the right hon. gentleman. I 
     <lb/>
     only heard some rather vague prophecy as 
     <lb/>
     to what parliament might or might not be 
     <lb/>
     obliged to do at some time in the remote 
     <lb/>
     future. So far as the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way exemption from taxation is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     the question remains to be determined 
     <lb/>
     whether or not the legislature of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories will or Will not under this act have 
     <lb/>
     full jurisdiction to deal with provincial tax<lb break="no"/>ation. In good faith that jurisdiction must 
     <lb/>
     be exercised subject to the terms of the con<lb break="no"/>tract, just as this parliament, if it saw fit 
     <lb/>
     to attempt the expropriation referred to by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman, would be obliged in good 
     <lb/>
     faith to have regard to the terms of the con<lb break="no"/>tract. As I gave my views in committee, 
     <lb/>
     it is not worth while detaining the House by 
     <lb/>
     repeating them. I might add that one of 
     <lb/>
     the justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     in dealing with this question under exactly

     <lb/>
     Manitoba exercised that right, because

     section 16 of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way contract does not exempt its earnings

     They are general. They do not deal with

     the Canadian Pacific Railway alone but with

     all railway companies, and it is under that 
     <lb/>
     general provision that the tax to which I 
     <lb/>
     have alluded has been collected. All the rail<lb break="no"/>way companies, I believe, have protested. as 
     <lb/>
     they always do under the circumstances; 
     <lb/>
     but neither the Canadian Pacific Railway nor 
     <lb/>
     any other company has seen fit to test the. 
     <lb/>
     validity of the tax imposed. For those 
     <lb/>
     reasons I shall vote against the amendment

     <lb/>
     on it at present. I do not think my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from West Assiniboia goes far enough 
     <lb/>
     or I would support his motion. In my op<lb break="no"/>inion, section 28 should not be enacted at 
     <lb/>
     all. If the parliament of Canada had full 
     <lb/>
     power to enter into the contract it did with 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881, there 
     <lb/>
     can be no necessity for our continuing the 
     <lb/>
     exemption therein provided by any new 
     <lb/>
     enactment now. If it was intra vires of the 
     <lb/>
     government at that time, it holds good 
     <lb/>
     now. even after the new provinces are 
     <lb/>
     created. But if it was ultra vires of the 
     <lb/>
     government to continue that exemption be<lb break="no"/>yond the time when the Territories became 
     <lb/>
     provinces, we should not do so by an en<lb break="no"/>actment now. Either this section is for 
     <lb/>

     may have existed by reason of it not having

     we would not be in any way ignoring a

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. This Bill, which is 
     <lb/>
     now under consideration for its third read<lb break="no"/>ing, has been so elaborately discussed, both 
     <lb/>
     on the second reading and in committee, 
     <lb/>
     that I propose to occupy the time of the 
     <lb/>
     House but a few minutes in moving an

     amendment to refer the Bill back to the 
     <lb/>
     Committee of the Whole House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So far as the main features of the Bill are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, those to which I am particularly 
     <lb/>
     opposed are pretty well known. I will 
     <lb/>
     briefly enumerate them and content myself 
     <lb/>
     with just summing up a few ideas which 
     <lb/>
     have been elaborated on more than one 
     <lb/>
     occasion during the discussion of the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I object to the policy of the government 
     <lb/>
     as far as the lands are concerned. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, as I have expressed it on a great 
     <lb/>
     many occasions during the past three years, 
     <lb/>
     the true policy for the government to adopt 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the lands in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories would have been to entrust the 
     <lb/>
     administration and control of these lands to 
     <lb/>
     the people and the legislatures of the new 
     <lb/>
     province, and not. to retain that control and 
     <lb/>
     administration at Ottawa. The government, 
     <lb/>
    by adopting that view, would have 
     <lb/>followed the analogy of the British 
     <lb/>North America Act, section 109 of 
     <lb/>which provides that each province shall re<lb break="no"/>tain its lands and shall control and adminis<lb break="no"/>ter them. In the next place, it would have 
     <lb/>followed the British practice which has 
     <lb/>prevailed as between the government of 
     <lb/>Great Britain and the dependencies of the 
     <lb/>empire during the past sixty or seventy 
     <lb/>years. Every argument which has been ad<lb break="no"/>vanced for retaining the control and admin<lb break="no"/>istration of these lands in the central gov<lb break="no"/>ernment would have availed equally in 
     <lb/>favour of retaining the control and adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the lands of this country in the 
     <lb/>imperial government at London. There is 
     <lb/>no doubt about that. The British govern<lb break="no"/>ment attempted to enforce that principle. 
     <lb/>They did enforce it for a time, with results 
     <lb/>so absolutely unsatisfactory to themselves 
     <lb/>and to the people of the various dependencies 
     <lb/>of the empire that it was found necessary 
     <lb/>to make an absolute change. Further than 
     <lb/>that, the policy of the government in this 
     <lb/>regard is absolutely opposed, as I believe 
     <lb/>to the wishes of the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>as expressed by the legislature in the Bill 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="8797" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8797.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">8797</fw> <fw type="dateline">JULY 5, 1905</fw> 
       

     presented by Mr. Haultain, which had been 
     <lb/>
    unanimously adopted by the legislature of 
     <lb/>the Northwest Territories. It is also opposed 
     <lb/>to many expressions in the public press 
     <lb/>of the west during the time of this debate. 
     <lb/>And it is not unwise at this moment 
     <lb/>to recall the circumstances that, with 
     <lb/>respect to the boundary, with respect 
     <lb/>to many details that have been dealt 
     <lb/>with by this Bill, the wishes of the 
     <lb/>Northwest have been put forward as the 
     <lb/>true test. But when we come to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of administering and controlling the 
     <lb/>lands we have departed from any considera<lb break="no"/>tion of the wishes of the people of the new 
     <lb/>provinces, and have decided to withhold the 
     <lb/>control and retain the administration of 
     <lb/>these lands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Another argument in favour of entrusting 
     <lb/>
     these lands to the people is that the lands 
     <lb/>
     can be better administered and controlled 
     <lb/>
     in the province than at Ottawa. They can 
     <lb/>
     be better administered and controlled by 
     <lb/>
     officers of the provincial government in 
     <lb/>
     touch with the people and comparatively 
     <lb/>
     near at hand than by the officers of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government. What reason is 
     <lb/>
     there, as I have said before, why a citizen 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario should have the right and privi<lb break="no"/>lege to deal with the minerals and public 
     <lb/>
     lands of his own province at Toronto, while 
     <lb/>
     the citizen of the Northwest must be obliged, 
     <lb/>
     for the same purpose, to write or send to 
     <lb/>
     the city of Ottawa ? I am not going into an 
     <lb/>
     extended argument on this subject. The 
     <lb/>
     matter has been dealt with in detail by my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. S. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) and my hon. friend from Qu'Ap<lb break="no"/>pelle (Mr. Lake), as well as by other hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen ; and for me to indulge in an 
     <lb/>
     elaborate argument at this stage of the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion would be weariness to the House 
     <lb/>
     as well as to myself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The arguments of the government on this 
     <lb/>
     subject are threefold. The Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) bases his main con<lb break="no"/>tention on the necessity of controlling the 
     <lb/>
     lands that they may be used as a means of 
     <lb/>
     promoting immigration. He says there 
     <lb/>
     must be free homestead entries, and there<lb break="no"/>fore there must be control of the lands at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa. This consideration seems entitled 
     <lb/>
     to no great weight. I dealt with it on a 
     <lb/>
     previous occasion. Another hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     seemed to be under the impression 
     <lb/>
     that there would be less corruption 
     <lb/>
     if the administration of the lands were 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the central govern<lb break="no"/>ment than if they were administered 
     <lb/>
     by the provinces. The Prime Minister ad<lb break="no"/>duces on this subject the example of the 
     <lb/>
     United States, where the federal government 
     <lb/>
     has retained the control of the public lands 
     <lb/>
     —although he took good care not to follow 
     <lb/>
     the United States with respect to certain 
     <lb/>
     other features of the Bill to which public 
     <lb/>
     attention has been called. The example of 
     <lb/>
     the United States has not been a happy one, 
     <lb/>
     if we test this question by the possibility of 
     <lb/>
     corruption. Those who have investigated

     the political affairs of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     know that some of the greatest scandals 
     <lb/>
     which have occurred in that country have 
     <lb/>
     been in connection with the public lands. 
     <lb/>
     The additional reasons which influenced the 
     <lb/>
     administration are those which they do not 
     <lb/>
    openly state—the desire for preserving pat<lb break="no"/>ronage, for retaining power over the elector<lb break="no"/>ate of that country. In respect of these mat<lb break="no"/>ters, no doubt, there were influences which 
     <lb/>were exercised upon the administration. 
     <lb/>But looking at the matter from the stand<lb break="no"/>point solely of the public interset, I venture 
     <lb/>to say that the policy should have been to 
     <lb/>hand over the lands to the administration 
     <lb/>and control of the provincial executives and 
     <lb/>provincial legislatures. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The next proviston of the Bill to which I 
     <lb/>
     have specially referred is that which deals 
     <lb/>
     with the division of the province for 
     <lb/>
     the purpose of the election of a provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature. Now, I am not going over a 
     <lb/>
     twice-told tale. I shall not review the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of clause 12 of the Bill and of the 
     <lb/>
     schedule which forms part of that clause. 
     <lb/>
     These matters have been discussed very 
     <lb/>
     elaborately in the committee of the whole 
     <lb/>
     House. But I will just point out one object 
     <lb/>
     lesson in this distribution which seems to 
     <lb/>
     me to afford a guide to the principle, or lack 
     <lb/>
     of principle, which has guided the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration and its friends in framing 
     <lb/>
     clause 12. The population of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta is estimated by the government at 
     <lb/>
     250,000. The number of members in the 
     <lb/>
     new legislature is to be twenty-five. Two 
     <lb/>
     constituencies are to be established in the 
     <lb/>
     northern part of the province in communi<lb break="no"/>ties which have not, up to the present time, 
     <lb/>
     been given any representation either in the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada or in the provincial 
     <lb/>
     legislature. Hon. gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>
     are now extremely solicitous about the per<lb break="no"/>sons who inhabit these portions of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. They are extremely solicitous that 
     <lb/>
     those people should be represented in par<lb break="no"/>liament. But up to the present time I have 
     <lb/>
     not heard a murmur of protest, either in this 
     <lb/>
     parliament or in the territorial assembly, on 
     <lb/>
     account of their lack of representation in 
     <lb/>
     parliament or in the territorial assembly. 
     <lb/>
     We have certain sources of information 
     <lb/>
     which have been pointed out by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment as those which guided them in making 
     <lb/>
     this distribution. One source of information 
     <lb/>
     is the census of 1901. According to that 
     <lb/>
     census the electoral division of Peace River 
     <lb/>
     contained 92 whites and 677 half-breeds, or 
     <lb/>
     a total population of 769 among whom elec<lb break="no"/>tors might be found. The constituency of 
     <lb/>
     Athabaska, according to the census of 1901, 
     <lb/>
     contained 117 white persons and 824 half- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     breeds, or a total population of 941 among 
     <lb/>
     whom electors might be found. In addition 
     <lb/>
     to this, the Peace River district contained 
     <lb/>
     at that time 955 Indians and Athabaska 
     <lb/>
     contained 735 Indians. There is one post 
     <lb/>
     office in the entire territory comprised in the 
     <lb/>
     two ridings, and the income from that one 
     <lb/>
     post office is $90 per annum. You will 
     <lb/>

     therefore realize the extent and importance 
     <lb/>
     of the population to which has been given 
     <lb/>
     a representation of two members in the new 
     <lb/>
     provincial assembly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, we need not perhaps stop at that; 
     <lb/>
     it is not fair perhaps to stop at that, be<lb break="no"/>cause we have certain further information 
     <lb/>
     derived from my hon. friend the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior. Some one told some per<lb break="no"/>sons who told the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     that there is a population of 5,000 souls in 
     <lb/>
     these two ridings exclusive of Indians—or 
     <lb/>
     perhaps it may be that some one told my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend that directly. I think that was 
     <lb/>
     the way he put it to the House—some per<lb break="no"/>son, at some indefinite time, at some un<lb break="no"/>known place, the person being also unnamed 
     <lb/>
     and unknown to this House, has informed 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior that these two 
     <lb/>
     combined electoral divisions contain at the 
     <lb/>
     present time 5,000 persons exclusive of In<lb break="no"/>dians. Well, I venture to think that if 
     <lb/>
     you look at the other sources of information 
     <lb/>
     upon which reliance has been placed by the 
     <lb/>
     government with respect to other portions 
     <lb/>
     of the constituency, we might discount that 
     <lb/>
     statement a great deal. For my part I 
     <lb/>
     should be extremely surprised if it could 
     <lb/>
     be proved by any evidence worth the name 
     <lb/>
     that there are more than 2,500 persons at 
     <lb/>
     the present time in those two electoral divi<lb break="no"/>sions, not including Indians. But let us 
     <lb/>
     take the statement of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior; let us take his statement, which 
     <lb/>
     it was not even worth while to put in writ<lb break="no"/>ing, of which it was not worth while to 
     <lb/>
     give any details; let us assume that there 
     <lb/>
     are in these two electoral divisions at the 
     <lb/>
     present time 5,000 people outside of Indians, 
     <lb/>
     and what have you? You have 245,000 peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the new province of Alberta to whom 
     <lb/>
     is allotted a representation of 23 members 
     <lb/>
     in the new legislature, and you have a sup<lb break="no"/>posed 5,000 people in the northern portion 
     <lb/>
     of that constituency to whom two represen<lb break="no"/>tatives are allotted. That is to say, to 
     <lb/>
     one-fiftieth of the assumed population of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta a representation of two 
     <lb/>
     is given, and to all the rest, to the other 
     <lb/>
     forty-nine-fiftieths of that population, a re<lb break="no"/>presentation of 23 is given. Now, there can 
     <lb/>
     be no excuse for that ; there can be no justi<lb break="no"/>fication for it ; here can be no apology for 
     <lb/>
     it. I do not know the motives which in<lb break="no"/>fluenced the Minister of the Interior and 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister in forcing this upon the 
     <lb/>
     House. We can only guess at them. But 
     <lb/>
     it seems to be a transaction which is worthy 
     <lb/>
     of being characterized in the strongest pos<lb break="no"/>sible terms that parliamentary usage will 
     <lb/>
     permit. It seems to me to be indecent and 
     <lb/>
     indefensible that 5,000 persons in the north<lb break="no"/>ern part of that constituency should be given 
     <lb/>
     a representation of two members, while to 
     <lb/>
     245,000 persons 23 members are allotted, and 
     <lb/>
     that this should be done by hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in this House who stand up and state that 
     <lb/>
     they are solely desirous of distributing the 
     <lb/>
     representation of that province according to 
     <lb/>
     the standards of fair-play, according to 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8800</fw>
         

     equality of population and other similar con<lb break="no"/>siderations. It is perhaps inadvisable to ex<lb break="no"/>press our opinion as to why this is done, 
     <lb/>
     why a population hitherto absolutely un<lb break="no"/>represented in the provincial legislature 
     <lb/>
     should be given four times the voice in the 
     <lb/>
     new province that any similar number of 
     <lb/>
     persons in any other part of the province 
     <lb/>
     receive under the terms of this distribution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Another provision to which I desire to 
     <lb/>
     call attention for a few moments is that 
     <lb/>
     contained in section 16. This has been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed very fully. I will sum up what I 
     <lb/>
     have to say with regard to that in a very few 
     <lb/>
     words. The argument has been made not 
     <lb/>
     only by private members on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the House, but by ministers of the Crown 
     <lb/>
     as well, not, I think, by the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, but by some of his colleagues, that 
     <lb/>
     an obligation is imposed upon parliament 
     <lb/>
     to pass this legislation because of a com<lb break="no"/>pact which was made in 1870 at the time 
     <lb/>
     the Territories came into the confederation. 
     <lb/>
     That argument was disposed of by the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman the other evening, and it 
     <lb/>
     was disposed of by my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice on the same evening. If 
     <lb/>
     there was any compact such as that which 
     <lb/>
     has been relied upon, it extended not only 
     <lb/>
     to separate schools in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, but to the use of the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage. A disclaimer was made by the 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General, concurred in by the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, both of whom declared that no 
     <lb/>
     such compact existed under anything that 
     <lb/>
     took place in 1870; therefore, so far as that 
     <lb/>
     is concerned we come down to what the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice quoting from the judg<lb break="no"/>ment of a court, calls a parliamentary com<lb break="no"/>pact, and we find the obligation to enact 
     <lb/>
     this legislation, if we find it anywhere. in 
     <lb/>
     the statute of 1875. The Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     and his colleagues have taken away from 
     <lb/>
     themselves that argument; they have taken 
     <lb/>
     it away deliberately, with their eyes open, 
     <lb/>
     in answer to the motions of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) and my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), be 
     <lb/>
     cause they say that there is no compact by 
     <lb/>
     reason of the Act of 1877, and I challenge 
     <lb/>
     any distinction between the Act of 1877 
     <lb/>
     and the Act of 1875 in that regard. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I am free to state upon the authority 
     <lb/>
     of the Prime Minister himself, upon the au<lb break="no"/>thority of his Minister of Justice and 
     <lb/>
     of his Solicitor General, upon the au<lb break="no"/>thority of every member of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment who combatted this motion, that there 
     <lb/>
     was no compact contained in the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875, because otherwise the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman and his colleagues would have felt 
     <lb/>
     themselves obliged to accede to the motions 
     <lb/>
     which they voted down. Therefore, we 
     <lb/>
     come down after all to the question of con<lb break="no"/>stitutional power, of constitutional right, 
     <lb/>
     and as to whether it is sound policy in this 
     <lb/>
     regard to limit the rights of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I do not admit that there is any 
     <lb/>
     constitutional power; I deny that there is 
     <lb/>
     any constitutional right, and I deny further 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="8801" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8801.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">8801</fw> <fw type="dateline">JULY 5, 1905</fw> 
 

     that it is sound policy to limit in this re<lb break="no"/>spect the rights of the new provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     say that so far as the distribution of the 
     <lb/>
     legislative power between parliament and 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures of the new provinces is con<lb break="no"/>cerned we should content ourselves with 
     <lb/>
     adopting that code which is contained in 
     <lb/>
     sections 91, 92, 93 and the two following 
     <lb/>
     sections of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     These constitute the code of distribution 
     <lb/>
     of legislative power between the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the legislatures of all the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, including those provinces we are 
     <lb/>
     now creating, and I say it is wise for us, 
     <lb/>
     from all standpoints, to abide by the consti<lb break="no"/>tution in that regard. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I pointed that out a little more in detail 
     <lb/>
     the other evening than I shall do at the 
     <lb/>
     present time. I pointed out that in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the minority in this country as 
     <lb/>
     well as in the interest of the majority, it 
     <lb/>
     is right and wise that we should abide by 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, because, that constitution, 
     <lb/>
     if it is invaded to-day for one class, may 
     <lb/>
     be invaded to-morrow for another class. I 
     <lb/>
     deny that there is any intolerance in asking 
     <lb/>
     that we should abide by the compact and 
     <lb/>
     the constitution which were deliberately 
     <lb/>
     adopted in 1867. Any argument as to tol<lb break="no"/>erance is an argument which ought to be 
     <lb/>
     addressed to the people and to the legisla<lb break="no"/>tures of the new provinces. I think that 
     <lb/>
     all of us on this side of the House may 
     <lb/>
     at the same time treat with some disdain 
     <lb/>
     the arguments of those who throw the taunt 
     <lb/>
     of intolerance in our teeth and at the same 
     <lb/>
     time turn to their friends and colleagues 
     <lb/>
     and say : We may grant this after all to 
     <lb/>
     the minority because it is absolutely useless 
     <lb/>
     to them; these are not separate schools ; the 
     <lb/>
     privilege granted is absolutely worthless 
     <lb/>
     and in a few years the name of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools will disappear from the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     That is a very high exemplification of tol<lb break="no"/>erance ! If it is so regarded by some hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite, I do not so regard it. 
     <lb/>
     If there was any compact, if there was any 
     <lb/>
     agreement, why grant separate schools are to 
     <lb/>
     be of no value at all to those who demand 
     <lb/>
     them ? It seems to me that a different policy 
     <lb/>
     should have been pursued. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now there is this one thing more. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think enough has been said in this House in 
     <lb/>
     regard to a certain motion which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Saskatchewan (Mr. Lamont) 
     <lb/>
     moved the other evening. Perhaps some 
     <lb/>
     members of this House and a great many 
     <lb/>
     people in this country do not thoroughly rea<lb break="no"/>lize what the import and effect of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment are. My hon. friend from Beauhar<lb break="no"/>nois (Mr. Bergeron) and my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) proposed cer<lb break="no"/>tain motions when this Bill was in com<lb break="no"/>mittee. I will not weary the House per<lb break="no"/>haps if I state the reasons for these mo<lb break="no"/>tions, as I understand them. The amended 
     <lb/>
     clause 16 of this Bill provides that :

     The Protestant or Roman Catholic min<lb break="no"/>ority in any school section in the Northwest

     Now, inasmuch as the Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     or the Protestant minority could establish 
     <lb/>
     separate schools and could elect their own 
     <lb/>
     trustees, they would, in respect to such 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, control the religious in<lb break="no"/>struction. But in respect of schools which 
     <lb/>
     were not within the designation of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools, the legislature of the 
     <lb/>
     new province was not in any way con<lb break="no"/>trolled by the provisions of section 16. I 
     <lb/>
     am trying to state this proposition in as 
     <lb/>
     simple and distinct terms as I possibly can. 
     <lb/>
     Inasmuch as these public schools—I may 
     <lb/>
     call them that to distinguish them from 
     <lb/>
     separate schools—were not within the de<lb break="no"/>signation of separate schools, contained in 
     <lb/>
     clause 16 of this Bill, the provisions of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16, to which I have just referred, 
     <lb/>
     would not prevent the legislature of the new 
     <lb/>
     province from interfering with the power of 
     <lb/>
     the trustees or from vesting that control over 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction in the Commissioner of 
     <lb/>
     Education, or in the council of public in<lb break="no"/>struction. or in any other body which it 
     <lb/>
     may designate at any time in the future. 
     <lb/>
     That was the position and my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Labelle, in the first instance, and my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Beauharnois afterwards 
     <lb/>
     proposed motions in Committee of the Whole 
     <lb/>
     House, which in their opinion, guarded the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the Catholic minority when that 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority happened to be a majority 
     <lb/>
     in anyparticular school district. These mo<lb break="no"/>tions were voted down. They were voted 
     <lb/>
     down without very much discussion by the 
     <lb/>
     government and without very much reason 
     <lb/>
     being given by any member of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They were regarded as unneces<lb break="no"/>sary or inexpedient—I do not know which— 
     <lb/>
     perhaps both ; at all events, they were very 
     <lb/>
     summarily disposed of and the matter was 
     <lb/>
     supposed to end there. But, it did not end 
     <lb/>
     there. Then came a very pretty little piece 
     <lb/>
     of by-play. That which had been proposed 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend from Labelle and by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Beauharnois and some<lb break="no"/>thing more to which I will call attention 
     <lb/>
     was proposed by the hon. member for Sas<lb break="no"/>

     katchewan evidently by reason of an un<lb break="no"/>derstanding between himself and the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the administration. What was pro<lb break="no"/>posed by the hon. member for Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan was this : He proposed to add to 
     <lb/>
     clause 16 as it had been amended these 
     <lb/>
     words : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     So that the section as it now stands be<lb break="no"/>fore us to receive the sanction of the House

     Now, I regard those words which I have 
     <lb/>
     just read and which are embodied in 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan as an unnecessary and un<lb break="no"/>warranted attack upon the legislative power 
     <lb/>
     of the new province. They embody what 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Labelle and my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend for Beauharnois had in mind 
     <lb/>
     but they embody something more. They 
     <lb/>
     embody an absolute restriction of the powers 
     <lb/>
     of the provincial legislature at all times in 
     <lb/>
     the future in regard to the control of re<lb break="no"/>ligious instruction in the public schools. 
     <lb/>
     There can be no doubt about that. The 
     <lb/>
     words are very distinct and very explicit. 
     <lb/>
     If you omit the immaterial words you have 
     <lb/>
     this language : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     It might be proper if the policy of the

     government were one in which we all 
     <lb/>
     agreed to go as far as my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Labelle and my hon. friend from Beauhar<lb break="no"/>nois proposed to go, but it is absolutely un<lb break="no"/>necessary to go beyond that and to limit and 
     <lb/>
     restrict the powers of the legislatures of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in respect to religious in<lb break="no"/>struction in all public schools. What is the 
     <lb/>
     provision relied upon? I have already read 
     <lb/>
     it, but I will read it again : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     No religious instruction except as hereinafter

     afternoon, after which time any such instruc<lb break="no"/>tion permited or desired by the board may be

     given.

            <p>
     Whatever right or privilege is embodied 
     <lb/>
     in that provision, whatever power is vested 
     <lb/>
     in the trustees, under that provision, so as 
     <lb/>
     to create a right or privilege, must remain 
     <lb/>
     at all times in the future as part of the or<lb break="no"/>ganic law of the new provinces. That is 
     <lb/>
     to say, if the legislature of the new province 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8804</fw>
          

     should for any special reason in any district 
     <lb/>
     desire to divest the tustees of that power and 
     <lb/>
     to vest it in the commissioner of education 
     <lb/>
     or the council of public instruction or any 
     <lb/>
     other body, it would find itself unable to 
     <lb/>
     do so. This is a specific and definite pro<lb break="no"/>vision ' that no right or privilege with 
     <lb/>
     respect to religious instruction in any 
     <lb/>
     public or separate school ' shall be preju<lb break="no"/>dicially affected. When this section first 
     <lb/>
     came down I called attention to this. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister differed from me on the 
     <lb/>
     construction of the section. I was not able 
     <lb/>
     to precisely gather exactly what the view 
     <lb/>
     of the administration is with respect to 
     <lb/>
     the clause, but I am giving to the House 
     <lb/>
     my view as to what the difficulties would 
     <lb/>
     be. If the government have any differ<lb break="no"/>ent opinion it should be expressed in this 
     <lb/>
     House at the earliest possible moment in 
     <lb/>
     such distinct, definite and specific terms as 
     <lb/>
     will leave no room for misapprehension and 
     <lb/>
     misunderstanding. In view of the provisions 
     <lb/>
     contained in section 16; in view of its res<lb break="no"/>trictions on the legislative freedom of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, once more I desire to test 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of the House upon that section. 
     <lb/>
     and I therefore move in amendment to the 
     <lb/>
     main motion : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     committee for the reason that I believe it is 
     <lb/>
     wisest to adhere to the terms of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution. It is wisest, because the observance 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution is a protection to all of 
     <lb/>
     us ; wisest, because the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution will leave these matters to be 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by the legislature of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vince ; wisest, because that will in the end 
     <lb/>
     tend to better relations among the people of 
     <lb/>
     all Canada ; wisest, because it will confine 
     <lb/>
     within the restricted provincial area differ<lb break="no"/>ences and difficulties of an essentially local 
     <lb/>
     character. It will leave. the wider area of 
     <lb/>
     Dominion politics free from questions which 
     <lb/>
     concern only a particular province, a parti<lb break="no"/>cular district or a particular territory. All 
     <lb/>
     of us who have had experience of the far 
     <lb/>
     reaching and harmful effect of such differ<lb break="no"/>ences when they overpass provincial bounds 
     <lb/>
     by such differences; all of us who have strong 
     <lb/>
     opinions on the desirability of not lighting 
     <lb/>
     fires which are so easily spread ; we all be<lb break="no"/>lieve that in the end it is better to leave 
     <lb/>
     such matters to be dealt with within the 
     <lb/>
     restricted area which is most directly con<lb break="no"/>cerned. The motion which I propose will 
     <lb/>
     have that result. It is a result that is not 
     <lb/>
     likely to be fraught with any injustice to 
     <lb/>
     the minority. That feeling of tolerance of

     which mention has been made so often in 
     <lb/>
     this House is just as strong in the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest of Canada as it is in the 
     <lb/>
     people of any province of Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     people of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island have been cited as 
     <lb/>
     examples of the good fellowship which ex<lb break="no"/>ists in the maritime provinces between peo<lb break="no"/>ple of different races and different religious 
     <lb/>
     belief. There is no reason for apprehen<lb break="no"/>sion that any different result will obtain 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest of Canada it these mat<lb break="no"/>ters are restricted to the provincial area and 
     <lb/>
     it the provincial legislature is left to deal 
     <lb/>
     with these questions. The people of the 
     <lb/>
     west are not less broad, they are not more 
     <lb/>
     narrow than the people of eastern Canada. 
     <lb/>
     than the people of Nova Scotia, of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick and of Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     who, even without the sanction of legisla<lb break="no"/>tive enactment, have been broad enough to 
     <lb/>
     grant rights which are appreciated by the 
     <lb/>
     minority. For what reason are we to con<lb break="no"/>jecture that the people in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     of Canada would exercise the legislative 
     <lb/>
     rights conferred upon them in any less rea<lb break="no"/>sonable or fair manner ? I hope that the 
     <lb/>
     government, even at this late hour, may 
     <lb/>
     accept this motion to leave the constitution 
     <lb/>
     untouched, and to let the new provinces be 
     <lb/>
     governed by the exact provisions of section 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act, unim<lb break="no"/>paired and unaltered.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Hon. CHARLES FITZPATRICK</persName> (Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice). I am absolutely certain that 
     <lb/>
     I give expression to the view, not only of 
     <lb/>
     every member of this government, but of 
     <lb/>
     every member of this House who is sup<lb break="no"/>porting the government on this legislation, 
     <lb/>
     when I say that it has been proposed with 
     <lb/>
     only one desire and that desire is to res<lb break="no"/>pect the true principles of the constitution, 
     <lb/>
     not only in its spirit but in its letter. So 
     <lb/>
     far as we are concerned there is no desire 
     <lb/>
     to antagonize any element of the commu<lb break="no"/>nity, any more than there is a desire to 
     <lb/>
     single out any class in the community for 
     <lb/>
     special favours. We have, however, to bear 
     <lb/>
     in mind that there are obligations on this 
     <lb/>
     government which the government cannot 
     <lb/>
     refuse to accept the responsibility of. It 
     <lb/>
     would be very poor statesmanship, it would 
     <lb/>
     be a very paltry thing, if, by simply shut<lb break="no"/>ting our eyes to the duty cast upon us we 
     <lb/>
     would attempt to get rid of it. I shall not 
     <lb/>
     detain the House at any length; I shall 
     <lb/>
     merely deal with the question of the land 
     <lb/>
     and clause 16, and leave the question of the 
     <lb/>
     distribution of seats to the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior and other hon. gentlemen. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) has said that 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the land we are departing 
     <lb/>
     from the principle laid down by the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. I take direct issue 
     <lb/>
     with my hon. friend on that, and I submit 
     <lb/>
     to the House that there is absolutely no 
     <lb/>
     analogy between the case we now have in 
     <lb/>
     hand and the case of the provinces as they 
     <lb/>
     came into confederation in 1867 and after.

     These provinces were separate political 
     <lb/>
     entities in existence when they decided to 
     <lb/>
     enter confederation. At the time they came 
     <lb/>
     into confederation, these separate political 
     <lb/>
     entities had vested in. them their public 
     <lb/>
     lands; all their public properties were the 
     <lb/>
     property of these federated provinces; and 
     <lb/>
     when in the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     we proceed to deal with the question of 
     <lb/>
     lands and properties, what do we do ? We 
     <lb/>
     re-vest in the provinces those lands a part 
     <lb/>
     of which have been taken by this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     That is What we did at confederation. Let 
     <lb/>

     That is, simply a revesting, in so far as 
     <lb/>
     a revesting is necessary of those lands which 
     <lb/>
     are their property, or which, by the terms 
     <lb/>
     of this section, are declared to be their 
     <lb/>
     property. What are the facts in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the public lands in the Territories ? The 
     <lb/>
     facts are that in 1870 they were almost 
     <lb/>
     entirely the property of the Hudson Bay 
     <lb/>
     Company; and what occurred ? The Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada, acting in concert with 
     <lb/>
     the imperial authorities, contracted to pay 
     <lb/>
     to the Hudson Bay Company £300,000 sterl<lb break="no"/>ing for the purpose of acquiring these pro<lb break="no"/>perties, they to become the property of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion; and can any man to-day 
     <lb/>
     dispute our title to those properties? Now, 
     <lb/>
     where is the analogy between the case of 
     <lb/>
     a province which has its property vested 
     <lb/>
     in the province, coming into confederation 
     <lb/>
     and retaining control of that property except 
     <lb/>
     the part which it gives up to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, and the property of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, which to-day is the pro<lb break="no"/>perty of the people of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada ? How can you compare the two ? 
     <lb/>
     How can you draw any argument from 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act to make

     it applicable to the case in hand ? That

     is not all, Mr. Speaker. My hon. friend

     The constitution of this country is not only,

     strictly speaking, the terms of the British

     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada, absolutely the 
     <lb/>
     same position which the public lands of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories occupy to-day, except that 
     <lb/>
     in the interval we have spent enormous sums 
     <lb/>
     of money to develop that country, in con<lb break="no"/>nection with immigration, irrigation, and 
     <lb/>
     other matters. How did we deal with the 
     <lb/>
     case of Manitoba ? We dealt with it abso<lb break="no"/>lutely in the way in which we are dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the Territories. Were we to do 
     <lb/>
     otherwise and Manitoba were to come to 
     <lb/>
     us, are we to say to her : We have 
     <lb/>
     given these lands to the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta and Saskatchewan, but so far 
     <lb/>
     as you are concerned lands occupying the 
     <lb/>
     same position are not to be dealt with 
     <lb/>
     in the same way ? Why should we distin<lb break="no"/>guish between the two ? But, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     we have more than that. This question 
     <lb/>
     has not been raised here for the first time. 
     <lb/>
     It was the subject of much consideration 
     <lb/>
     by the government in power in 1884, and a 
     <lb/>
     report to Council was made by gentlemen, 
     <lb/>
     members of the government, who had been 
     <lb/>
     appointed to consider the whole of these 
     <lb/>
     questions, and chiefly the question that was 
     <lb/>
     then raised, as to the right of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba to the control, management 
     <lb/>
     and sale of the public lands within its 
     <lb/>
     limits—the same question that is now be<lb break="no"/>ing considered. How was that question 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by the report of Council of May 
     <lb/>
     20, 1884 ? I have made a few extracts from 
     <lb/>
     that report, which I will read :

     My hon. friend dealt afterwards with sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16, the school clause. I shall not go 
     <lb/>
     over the position I have already taken 
     <lb/>
     with respect to that section or the argu<lb break="no"/>ments which I have already advanced. 
     <lb/>
     Briefly, I think I may put it in this way. 
     <lb/>
     You have to provide by this constitutional 
     <lb/>
     Act for the distribution of a legislative 
     <lb/>
     power as between the Dominion and the 
     <lb/>
     province. Sections 91, 92 and 93 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act must be made 
     <lb/>
     applicable, section 91 being the section 
     <lb/>
     which is applicable to the Dominion, section 
     <lb/>
     92 the one applicable to the province, and 
     <lb/>
     section 93, the one applicable to both. Nei<lb break="no"/>ther the province nor the Dominion can 
     <lb/>
     deal exclusively with the subject mentioned 
     <lb/>
     in section 93. The Dominion can deal ex<lb break="no"/>clusively with the subjects mentioned in sec<lb break="no"/>tion 91, and the province can deal exclus<lb break="no"/>ively with the subjects mentioned in section 
     <lb/>
     92. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But when we come to deal with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of education, we find by section 93 
     <lb/>
     that it is a subject over which both the Do<lb break="no"/>minion and the provinces exercise legislative 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction. Section 93 provides for this 
     <lb/>
     condition of things, that if a school system 
     <lb/>
     has grown up in a province under which any 
     <lb/>
     class in that particular province has ac<lb break="no"/>quired a right or a privilege, then that right 
     <lb/>
     or privilege is guaranteed that particular 
     <lb/>
     class for all time to come. That is the re<lb break="no"/>striction placed upon the powers of a pro<lb break="no"/>vince to deal with the subject of education. 
     <lb/>
     It can only deal with that subject under the 
     <lb/>
     restriction that all the rights and privileges 
     <lb/>
     therefore vested in any class in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince cannot be interfered with. There can 
     <lb/>
     be no doubt on that point because it has 
     <lb/>
     been irrevocably settled as the result of two 
     <lb/>
     judicial decisions. If these Territories 
     <lb/>
     were a province now in existence, the school 
     <lb/>
     system there existing would be of necessity 
     <lb/>
     perpetuated, and whatever rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges are conferred on the minority 
     <lb/>
     under that school system would be guaran<lb break="no"/>

     teed them for all time. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     says, however, that these Territories are not 
     <lb/>
     provinces and conseqently this section does 
     <lb/>
     not in terms apply to the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Conceivably that is true. There is a doubt 
     <lb/>
     in my mind as to whether or not these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, not being provinces, come within 
     <lb/>
     the wording of section 93 ; and in the techni<lb break="no"/>cal meaning of the term, the minority might 
     <lb/>
     not have those rights and privileges which 
     <lb/>
     they enjoy under the School Ordinance. That 
     <lb/>
     is the letter of the law, but what is the 
     <lb/>
     spirit ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Was that point ever raised 
     <lb/>
     in the Manitoba case ? Manitoba was not a

     province either.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. It could not be 
     <lb/>
     raised in the Manitoba case because in that 
     <lb/>
     case there was a special section which pro<lb break="no"/>vides that the minority shall have not only 
     <lb/>
     the rights and privileges which exist by law 
     <lb/>
     but also those which exist by practice.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Manitoba became a

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I am charging no 
     <lb/>
     narrowness or fanaticism to my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition. I believe the 
     <lb/>
     view he has given to be his conception of 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     and that he is seeking to apply that Act, but 
     <lb/>
     I put this question to him ? Have we not at 
     <lb/>
     present in the Territories conditions which 
     <lb/>
     are practically analogous to those which ex<lb break="no"/>ist in a province ? At the time the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories came in, did we not petition the home 
     <lb/>
     authorities to give us the power to legislate 
     <lb/>
     with respect to them ? And did we not, at 
     <lb/>
     the same time, give the undertaking that 
     <lb/>
     we would give them institutions similar to 
     <lb/>
     those which existed in the provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. If we had power, 
     <lb/>
     under the Act of 1871, to absolutely disre<lb break="no"/>gard section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, then of course there is no further ques<lb break="no"/>tion. We cannot make a new section 93. 
     <lb/>
     If, on the other hand, we are bound to ob<lb break="no"/>serve section 93, it does not seem to me that 
     <lb/>
     we can increase our power by passing any 
     <lb/>
     Act restricting the powers of a territorial 
     <lb/>
     legislature, and then, the following year, 
     <lb/>
     when creating a province, say : there you 
     <lb/>
     have restrictions operating upon the ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial legislature and the provincial legis<lb break="no"/>lature must also be governed thereby. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. My answer is cadit 
     <lb/>
     questio. Proceeding on the assumption that 
     <lb/>
     we are dealing with these Territories, under 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1871, as Manitoba was dealt with 
     <lb/>
     and British Columbia and Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and every province brought into the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion since confederation, we are apply<lb break="no"/>ing to these new provinces the same prin<lb break="no"/>ciple we applied to those provinces. If 
     <lb/>
     these Territories were coming in as pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, created previous to this time, there 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8810</fw>
         

     would be no question as to the application 
     <lb/>
     of section 93, and all the rights and privi<lb break="no"/>leges guaranteed the minority under existing 
     <lb/>
     legislation would be continued ; but because 
     <lb/>
     they do not come within the word 'province ' 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend says : your door is barred 
     <lb/>
     and section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act does not apply. My answer is that 
     <lb/>
     when these Territories were brought into 
     <lb/>
     confederation, they were brought in under a 
     <lb/>
     compact entered into between the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the imperial authorities. We 
     <lb/>
     find in the petition to the imperial authori<lb break="no"/>ties the following language :

     <lb/>
     What then did we proceed to do ? In 1875 
     <lb/>
     we gave these Territories a constitution in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the solemn compact entered 
     <lb/>
     into with the imperial authorities. In that 
     <lb/>
     constitution what did we provide ? We pro<lb break="no"/>vided for separate schools, or rather we pro<lb break="no"/>vided, under section 11 of the Act of 1875, 
     <lb/>
     for a system of education. That is the letter 
     <lb/>
     of our constitution. At the time that consti<lb break="no"/>tution was given these Territories, in the 
     <lb/>
     execution of our solemn undertaking to<lb break="no"/>wards the imperial authorities, the man 
     <lb/>
     who was responsible for section 11 of the

     <lb/>
     Act we had settled for all time this vexed 
     <lb/>
     question of education in so far as these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were concerned. I need not repeat 
     <lb/>
     his words. Mr. Blake then said to the people 
     <lb/>
     of Canada : We are taking out of provincial 
     <lb/>
     politics and out of municipal control this 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Do not they exercise the 
     <lb/>
     same rights—

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I fear I am wan<lb break="no"/>dering from the point to which I was ad<lb break="no"/>dressing myself. Without being offensive 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) I will claim 
     <lb/>
     my right to proceed. I feel that he cannot 
     <lb/>
     convince me, and I fear that I cannot con<lb break="no"/>vince him. Now, that system was given to 
     <lb/>
     this country at that time, and at that time 
     <lb/>
     those who were opposed to the principle of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools so far as the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories are concerned, through Hon. 
     <lb/>
     George Brown, voiced this sentiment : You 
     <lb/>
     have passed this legislation ; you have set<lb break="no"/>tled the question for all time ; it has passed 
     <lb/>
     out of the domain of Dominion controversy. 
     <lb/>
     I gave you the views of those who pro<lb break="no"/>moted this legislation and were favourable 
     <lb/>
     to it. Here I give you also the opinion 
     <lb/>
     concerning it and the construction put upon 
     <lb/>
     by the man who most bitterly opposed it. 
     <lb/>
     So there, friend and foe alike, joined to say 
     <lb/>
     that this question was settled for ever. 
     <lb/>
     And, as I have said, it passed beyond our 
     <lb/>
     domain. Subsequently, in 1891, an attempt 
     <lb/>
     was made to settle this question, other<lb break="no"/>wise. That is when the Act was be<lb break="no"/>ing consolidated, if I remember rightly, 
     <lb/>
     and at that time the attention of the House 
     <lb/>
     was again drawn to this section 11, to this 
     <lb/>
     provision in the constitution we had given 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8812</fw>
         

     to this territory. We were told : You 
     <lb/>
     must repeal that provision, you must not 
     <lb/>
     consecrate that principle by your positive 
     <lb/>
     legislation ; because if you do, the system 
     <lb/>
     will be continued under which rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges will be acquired, which, when you 
     <lb/>
     come to deal with these Territories and 
     <lb/>
     make them into provinces, you will find 
     <lb/>
     in existence and you will not be able to 
     <lb/>
     get rid of them. Not only that, but, if I 
     <lb/>
     remember rightly, it was in 1880, that a 
     <lb/>
     statute was passed by this parliament 
     <lb/>
     with respect to the constitution of these 
     <lb/>
     Territories in which we made the provision 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act with res<lb break="no"/>pect to education, that is to say, section 
     <lb/>
     98, expressly applicable to the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. Now, in the light of these 
     <lb/>
     facts, we are called upon to deal with these 
     <lb/>
     provinces. and we have to remember the 
     <lb/>
     pledge we gave to the imperial authorities 
     <lb/>
     that we would give to these Territories in<lb break="no"/>stitutions similar in principle to our own. 
     <lb/>
     We have to bear in mind the fact that 
     <lb/>
     we have by our own Act created in the 
     <lb/>
     province a certain condition of things with 
     <lb/>
     respect to schools, that by our positive act 
     <lb/>
     that school system has been continued up 
     <lb/>
     to the present time. And, when we come 
     <lb/>
     to apply section 93, what do we do ? The 
     <lb/>
     rights that have grown up in that territory 
     <lb/>
     under the present school system, if these 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges have been brought in 
     <lb/>
     by reason of the legislation of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, go on in spite of anything that could 
     <lb/>
     be done. But, because they have been 
     <lb/>
     created and have grown up not by reason 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of the territorial authority, but 
     <lb/>
     by reason of our Act, we are to repudiate, 
     <lb/>
     and say to these people : It is true, we 
     <lb/>
     have created that system, true we are res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for it ; true if these had been pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and the legislation had been their 
     <lb/>
     work, we would not have had any right to 
     <lb/>
     deal with it;—but because these things have 
     <lb/>
     grown up under our Act, we have the right 
     <lb/>
     to repudiate them. That is a position this 
     <lb/>
     government refuses to take. So far as this 
     <lb/>
     government is concerned, there will be no 
     <lb/>
     repudiation, either with respect to the con<lb break="no"/>tracts entered into with the Hudson Bay 
     <lb/>
     Company or the implied parliamentary con<lb break="no"/>tract entered into with the minority of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion has accurately stated the conditions 
     <lb/>
     which exist in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     as the result of section 16, No. 2. The min<lb break="no"/>ority—and I do not want to use the word 
     <lb/>
     'Roman Catholic ' or the word ' Protestant,' 
     <lb/>
     I speak of the minority—the minority in any 
     <lb/>
     school district would have guaranteed to 
     <lb/>
     them all the rights and privileges they en<lb break="no"/>joy at the present time under chapter 29 of 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances. With respect to the min<lb break="no"/>ority in general, when they happen to form 
     <lb/>
     a majority in a school district, they would 
     <lb/>
     not have a guarantee of the continuance 
     <lb/>
     of these rights which they now have. 
     <lb/>

<fw type="num">8813</fw> <fw type="dateline">JULY 5, 1905</fw> 
           

     The intention of this amendment is to 
     <lb/>
     continue to the majority in number in 
     <lb/>
    a school district, where it happens to 
     <lb/>be a minority in the province, the same 
     <lb/>rights and privileges with respect to re<lb break="no"/>ligious education that they now enjoy. 
     <lb/>That is, we are not depriving them of one 
     <lb/>iota of the benefits of the provisions of the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories ordinances. We are 
     <lb/>giving to the minority in general. whether 
     <lb/>Roman Catholic or Protestant, when they 
     <lb/>are a majority in a school district, the same 
     <lb/>privileges that they now enjoy. Now my 
     <lb/>hon. friend says that the result of this is 
     <lb/>to impose restraints on the action of the 
     <lb/>legislature. That is true ; there is a res<lb break="no"/>traint upon the action of the legislature. 
     <lb/>But here is the condition we have : My 
     <lb/>hon. friend says that we are vesting this 
     <lb/>control of religious education in the hands 
     <lb/>of the trustees. My construction of the Bill 
     <lb/>—I am not dealing with it otherwise than 
     <lb/>as I construe it—is that which is placed 
     <lb/>upon it by the leader of the government 
     <lb/>(Sir Wilfrid Laurier). Secular education, 
     <lb/>for which the state pays, is under control 
     <lb/>of the statute ; but religious education, 
     <lb/>which is essentially that which concerns 
     <lb/>the parents themselves, remains under the 
     <lb/>control of the parents. The trustee is the 
     <lb/>representative of the parent, for he is elected 
     <lb/>by the parent. I take all the responsibility 
     <lb/>for saying that I have no desire to see the 
     <lb/>control of religious education vested in any 
     <lb/>other person or authority than the parent. 
     <lb/>I have no desire to see it vested in the 
     <lb/>superintendent of education or any person 
     <lb/>who is under the control of the state. I 
     <lb/>wish to see it vested in the person elected 
     <lb/>as representative of the parent. That is 
     <lb/>what I think my hon. friend's amendment 
     <lb/>carries out, and that. I think, we ought to 
     <lb/>give effect to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. There is a point which 
     <lb/>
     is not very clear and which I would like 
     <lb/>
     to have explained, if the minister will al<lb break="no"/>low me a question. Under clause 137, the 
     <lb/>
     minister has just stated, the trustees would 
     <lb/>
     decide what kind of religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     would be given. It is perfectly clear so 
     <lb/>
     far as that is concerned. But suppose a 
     <lb/>
     school section in which the majority is not 
     <lb/>
     Protestant or Roman Catholic—say, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, of the Greek Orthodox church. And 
     <lb/>
     suppose they decided to devote the half 
     <lb/>
     hour for religious instruction to instruction 
     <lb/>
     according to that church. Then, I suppose 
     <lb/>
     the minority would either have to simply 
     <lb/>
     prevent their children from attending the 
     <lb/>
     school during that half hour of religious in<lb break="no"/>struction or form a separate school. In 
     <lb/>
     that case, which would be the minority to 
     <lb/>
     have the right to form a separate school 
     <lb/>
     under section 41 ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I am not able to 
     <lb/>
     answer that question. I am not giving off<lb break="no"/>hand legal opinions to-day.

     <fw type="num">8814</fw>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. But, if the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) will allow 
     <lb/>
     me, I think I put my question courteously. 
     <lb/>
     In case the majority is neither Protestant 
     <lb/>
     nor Roman Catholic, would the minority 
     <lb/>
     have the right to establish a separate 
     <lb/>
     school? That is a simple question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. It may be a simple 
     <lb/>
     question, but it is a question to which I 
     <lb/>
     have not given consideration, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     want to commit myself to anything that I 
     <lb/>
     have not considered. The leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position also referred to the right to use 
     <lb/>
     the French language, and as I understood 
     <lb/>
     him, he said that the right to use the 
     <lb/>
     French language was as sacredly guaran<lb break="no"/>teed to those who speak that language in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, as the right to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I said there seemed 
     <lb/>
     to be as much of a parliamentary compact 
     <lb/>
     in the one case as in the other, because 
     <lb/>
     both depended on the statute. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I will deal with 
     <lb/>
     that question when we have to consider the 
     <lb/>
     amendment which will be moved in that 
     <lb/>
     connection. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STOC1">Mr. STOCKTON</persName>. I was unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     absent from the House when the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Saskatchewan (Mr. Lamont) 
     <lb/>
     moved his amendment, which was adopted 
     <lb/>
     by the government and passed. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     I wish to make one or two observations 
     <lb/>
     upon section 16, subsection 1, as it is af<lb break="no"/>fected by the amendment of the member 
     <lb/>
     For Saskatchewan. I do not object to the 
     <lb/>
     interpretation put upon section 93 by the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice. We know that a pro<lb break="no"/>vince has an absolute right to legislate with 
     <lb/>
     respect to education. I ask this question : 
     <lb/>
     What legislative authority outside of the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly of the province of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick has a right to legislate for that 
     <lb/>
     province in respect to education ? No legis<lb break="no"/>lative authority whatever, Sir, except the 
     <lb/>
     assembly of the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. But with the interpretation that has 
     <lb/>
     been put upon section 93 by the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice, I agree. If the legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly of the province of New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     to-day, or to-morrow, passed a law giving 
     <lb/>
     certain rights to the minority, and next 
     <lb/>
     year sought to withdraw those rights by 
     <lb/>
     which withdrawal they were prejudicially 
     <lb/>
     affected, then I entirely agree with the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice that there might be an ap<lb break="no"/>peal to this parliament to interfere. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. That would be a 
     <lb/>
     case for remedial legislation.  
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STOC1">Mr. STOCKTON</persName>. Yes.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. And it would be 
     <lb/>
    subject to an appeal.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STOC1">Mr. STOCKTON</persName>. It would be subject 
     <lb/>
     to an appeal. Under that explanation, I 
     <lb/>
     entirely agree with the interpretation which

     the Minister of Justice has put upon sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I will very briefly show 
     <lb/>
     in what respect the Bill as now before the 
     <lb/>
     House is a departure from the Bill as ori<lb break="no"/>ginally presented by the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     and as afterwards amended by him. Sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools, under section 41 of the ordi<lb break="no"/>nance 29, can only be established by a 
     <lb/>
     minority of the ratepayers. Under the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875, section 11, the majority of the 
     <lb/>
     ratepayers can establish a school district 
     <lb/>
     and provide for education. After the 
     <lb/>
     school district is established then the mino<lb break="no"/>rity can ask for and have separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     The question was asked the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice by the hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Bourassa), under what circumstances 
     <lb/>
     could a school be established if there were 
     <lb/>
     neither Catholics or Protestants in the dis<lb break="no"/>trict. Now if you put a construction upon 
     <lb/>
     section 11 of the Act of 1875, that rate<lb break="no"/>payers mean only Catholics or Protestants, 
     <lb/>
     then a difficulty might arise. But under 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the ordinance 29, a meaning is 
     <lb/>
     given to the word ' ratepayer,' such as 
     <lb/>
     you would expect to be given it, that is, 
     <lb/>
     a person who pays rates, with the limita<lb break="no"/>tion of a certain residence within the dis<lb break="no"/>trict before he casts his vote for the election 
     <lb/>
     of a trustee. Now, the First Minister pro<lb break="no"/>vided in his Bill for the minority but not 
     <lb/>
     for the majority. The amendment of the 
     <lb/>
     member for Saskatchewan, following the 
     <lb/>
     amendment moved by the member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle, and following to a certain extent 
     <lb/>
     the amendment moved by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), sought 
     <lb/>
     to cure this defect, with the exception that 
     <lb/>
     the amendments of the member for La<lb break="no"/>belle and the member for Beauharnois were 
     <lb/>
     summarily voted down at the instance of 
     <lb/>
     the government and afterwards, when the 
     <lb/>
     member for Saskatchewan, under the inspi<lb break="no"/>ration I imagine of the First Minister, or 
     <lb/>
     some member of the government, moved 
     <lb/>
     his amendment, it was accepted by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and adopted by the House, under 
     <lb/>
     the authority of the First Minister. What 
     <lb/>
     is the effect of that amendment ? I think, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, that many members of this House do 
     <lb/>
     not fully understand the element that has 
     <lb/>
     been introduced into the organic constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the province by this amendment. At 
     <lb/>
     the end of subsection 1, section 16, these 
     <lb/>
     words are added : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     With respect to religious instruction in any 
     <lb/>
     public or separate school as provided in the 
     <lb/>
     said ordinances. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     Now, under section 137 of the ordinance 29 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction can be given from 3.30 
     <lb/>
     p.m. to 4 o'clock, under the direction of the 
     <lb/>
     trustees in separate schools. But what if 
     <lb/>
     you apply it to all the schools ? As the law 
     <lb/>
     now stands it can be changed, it can be 
     <lb/>
     amended by the provincial authorities, be<lb break="no"/>cause the amendment does not form part of 
     <lb/>
     the organic law ; but by introducing this 
     <lb/>
     amendment into the constitution you make 
     <lb/>
        
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8816</fw>
          

     it a fixture, you make it part of the organic 
     <lb/>
     law. and it puts the trustees for the time 
     <lb/>
     being above the educational authority of 
     <lb/>
     the province, it puts them above the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Education, above the government of 
     <lb/>
     the province, and it makes them for all time 
     <lb/>
     supreme with respect to their action on this 
     <lb/>
     matter. It takes the control away from the 
     <lb/>
     provincial authorities, and it makes the 
     <lb/>
     amendment, as I have said, a part of the 
     <lb/>
     organic law, incapable of amendment or re<lb break="no"/>peal by any authority in Canada, either in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest or in this House, incapable 
     <lb/>
     of amendment except by an appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     imperial authorities. I think the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice will agree with me that that is the 
     <lb/>
     effect of the amendment which was moved 
     <lb/>
     by the member for Saskatchewan and adopt<lb break="no"/>ed by the government ; it places the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial authority for all time to come in a 
     <lb/>
     position of servitude to a law which they 
     <lb/>
     have not asked for, and which they do not 
     <lb/>
     want. But the irony of the situation is ac<lb break="no"/>centuated by the fact that this is an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, moved by the hon. member for Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan, which, at the instance of the 
     <lb/>
     government, puts shackles upon the freedom 
     <lb/>
     of action of the people of the west, an 
     <lb/>
     amendment moved by a gentleman from the 
     <lb/>
     west, who should have been solicitous to 
     <lb/>
     look out for the freedom and liberty of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west.

            <p><persName ref="pers:ROSS2">Mr. DUNCAN ROSS</persName> moved third reading<lb/>of Bill (No. 139) respecting the Vancouver,<lb/>Victoria and Eastern Railway and Naviga<lb break="no"/>tion Company,<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I understood that there <lb/>was a question raised by the Minister of<lb/>Justice with reference to the fourth clause.<lb/>I do not see the minister in his place, but<lb/>I believe that the objection he raised was<lb/>sufficiently important to lead the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister to say that it would be looked into<lb/>before the third reading.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>.     The point <lb/>raised by the Minister of Justice was that<lb/>the clause with refernce to the amalga<lb break="no"/>mation was rather vague, declaring that<lb/>certain roads are for the general advant<lb break="no"/>age of Canada when they are all put to<lb break="no"/>gether. I have not spoken to the Minister,<lb/>but I have had the matter looked into for my<lb/>own information, and I find that the<lb/>
   
     companies here referred to are Canadian 
     <lb/>
     companies and the roads Canadian roads. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore, it is only a question of degree 
     <lb/>
     how far the government should permit the 
     <lb/>
     amalgamation and should declare these roads 
     <lb/>
     to be for the general advantage of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     If they are all amalgamated, they are for 
     <lb/>
     the general advantage of Canada, and if 
     <lb/>
     only a part of them are amalgamated, they 
     <lb/>
     are for the general advantage of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     These questions have all, I am sure, been 
     <lb/>
     considered by the Railway Committee, and 
     <lb/>
     I have always made it a rule to support the 
     <lb/>
     report of the Railway Committee unless 
     <lb/>
     there are strong reasons to the contrary. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>.      I understood that pro<lb break="no"/>vision was made for the amalgamation of 
     <lb/>
     some roads which are not specified. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. They are all 
     <lb/>
     specified. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>.     Mr. Speaker,  when  the 
     <lb/>
     Bill was before the Railway Committee I 
     <lb/>
     objected to the third clause and desired to 
     <lb/>
     have it amended, but my amendment was 
     <lb/>
     laid over on the suggestion of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance that it would be considered by 
     <lb/>
     the government. I, therefore, did not test 
     <lb/>
     the efficacy of that amendment in the com<lb break="no"/>mittee as I otherwise would have done, and 
     <lb/>
     l propose new to submit it to the House. 
     <lb/>
     My amendment is as follows: 
     <lb/>
           [...] </p>

<p>
    [...] cause the Prime Minister himself has intim<lb break="no"/>ated that he is not aware of what the amend<lb break="no"/>ment is, although it was previously placed 
     <lb/>
     before the House. This is a question which 
     <lb/>
     not only affects the province of British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia, but the whole of the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. British Columbia is not a province 
     <lb/>
     in which you can build a railway wherever 
     <lb/>
     you please, because its topographical confor<lb break="no"/>mation makes that impossible.

     Mr. Speaker, on the motion for the third 
     <lb/>
     reading of this Bill I desire to propose an 
     <lb/>
     amendment similar to that which I have 
     <lb/>
     already proposed in Committee of the Whole. 
     <lb/>
     When I proposed this amendment in the 
     <lb/>
     committee the Minister of Justice criticised 
     <lb/>
     its wording more than the principle which it 
     <lb/>
     contained. I have therefore tried to meet 
     <lb/>
     his views by making a more perfect trans<lb break="no"/>lation into English of this amendment, 
     <lb/>
     which I originally wrote in French. I have 
     <lb/>
     modified the wording slightly, and have 
     <lb/>
     added a few words at the end of paragraph 
     <lb/>
     D. I beg to move, seconded by Mr. Paquet :

     after the question was put. Under these

     do not permit my vote to be recorded. If

     I am properly informed as to the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, I would have voted nay.

     <persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. Mr. Speaker, each 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces of the Dominion of Canada 
     <lb/>
     when it entered the confederation came in 
     <lb/>
     with a school system of its own manufac<lb break="no"/>ture. That is all that is asked in relation 
     <lb/>
     to the elevation of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories into two provinces of the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     I hold in my hand a motion which reads 
     <lb/>
     as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     That all the words after ' now ' to the end

     Recommitted to a Committee of the Whole

     House, with an instruction that they have

     power to strike out section 2 of the Bill, and

     to substitute the following section therefor : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. The provisions of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Alberta in the same way and to the 
     <lb/>
     like extent as they apply to the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     heretofore comprised in the Dominion, except 
     <lb/>
     such provisions as in terms or by reasonable

            <p>
     I shall not detain the House with any re<lb break="no"/>marks on the motion further than to point 
     <lb/>
     out that if under the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act the provinces are entitled to absolute 
     <lb/>
     control of educational affairs subject to the 
     <lb/>
     restrictive clauses of the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act, well and good; but if under the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces would be subject to the legislation 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 and subsequent legislation, then we 
     <lb/>
     are satisfied that it should be so construed, 
     <lb/>
     and if separate schools are to be attached 
     <lb/>
     to the Northwest Territories which are now 
     <lb/>
     being erected into provinces, all we ask is 
     <lb/>
     that we stand by the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act.

     ority in the Territories. I do not see how 
     <lb/>
     we can respect one pledge and not the other. 
     <lb/>
     Moreover, clause 16, as it has been amended 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend from Saskatchewan (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lamont), to my mind, will create a very 
     <lb/>
     strange position indeed. Of course, I voted 
     <lb/>
     for the amendment of my hon. friend when 
     <lb/>
     that amendment stood by itself before the 
     <lb/>
     committee because it was based on the true 
     <lb/>
     principle that it is the right of the rate<lb break="no"/>payer and the father of a family to decide 
     <lb/>
     what kind of education his children shall 
     <lb/>
     receive. But when that amendment is con<lb break="no"/>nected with clause 16 it brings about a 
     <lb/>
     state of things which should be well put 
     <lb/>
     before the House and the country before a 
     <lb/>
     final vote is given. According to clause 16, 
     <lb/>
     as now before the House, it will be the 
     <lb/>
     right of the majority of every school dis<lb break="no"/>trict in the new provinces to decide what 
     <lb/>
     kind of religious teaching shall be given in 
     <lb/>
     the public schools. The legislatures will 
     <lb/>
     have no right whatever to interfere; and 
     <lb/>
     the result will be that if the majority 
     <lb/>
     should happen to be of any denomination 
     <lb/>
     other than Protestant or Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     that majority may decide that the religious 
     <lb/>
     education given in the public schools will 
     <lb/>
     be one that will suit neither Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     nor Protestants, and neither this House nor 
     <lb/>
     the legislature will have any power to in<lb break="no"/>terfere. In that case, where will be the 
     <lb/>
     minority ? My hon. friend to my left says 
     <lb/>
     they will not send their children to the 
     <lb/>
     schools. Then what becomes of the right of 
     <lb/>
     the minority to have the school teaching 
     <lb/>
     such as we are promised by this amend<lb break="no"/>ment? The government press have been 
     <lb/>
     saying that the effect of the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Saskatchewan (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lamont) will be to secure to the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     the right of having everywhere such reli<lb break="no"/>gious teaching as they desire. But in a 
     <lb/>
     district where the Greek Orthodox Church, 
     <lb/>
     or the Mormons, or Jews, or others who 
     <lb/>
     are neither Protestant nor Roman Catholic, 
     <lb/>
     are in a majority, they will be able to dic<lb break="no"/>tate what kind of religious teaching will be 
     <lb/>
     had in the public schools, and a separate 
     <lb/>
     school cannot be formed by the secession of 
     <lb/>
     either the Protestant or Catholic minority. 
     <lb/>
     If the majority should be neither Catholic 
     <lb/>
     nor Protestant, you will deprive the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics of any religious instruction in the pub<lb break="no"/>lic schools, and they will be deprived of 
     <lb/>
     their right to secede under section 41 of the 
     <lb/>
     ordinances. So that their position would be 
     <lb/>
     worse than it is now. This answers the 
     <lb/>
     argument of my hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition who said the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Sasktchewan covered 
     <lb/>
     my point and something more. What he 
     <lb/>
     should have said is that the amendment, 
     <lb/>
     connected with clause 16 of this Bill and 
     <lb/>
     with clause 41 of the ordinances of 1901, 
     <lb/>
     does not cover my point, although it covers 
     <lb/>
     something never asked for by me or any<lb break="no"/>body else. It will prevent the local legisla<lb break="no"/>tures from dealing with the matter of reli<lb break="no"/>gious education in the public schools. 
     <lb/>

     Neither the local legislatures nor this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment will be able to protect the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     or Catholic minority in any district where 
     <lb/>
     they both may be in a minority. I may be 
     <lb/>
     told that I am predicting an imposslble 
     <lb/>
     state of things; but I would point out that 
     <lb/>
     there is now litigation before the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court of Canada as to the relative rights 
     <lb/>
     of the Greek Orthodox Church and the 
     <lb/>
     Catholics on church matters, and we may ex<lb break="no"/>pect before long the same condition will 
     <lb/>
     exist with respect to schools. Certainly be» 
     <lb/>
     fore ten or twenty years will have elapsed 
     <lb/>
     that state of things will exist in a large 
     <lb/>
     portion of the school districts of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I need not explain further the purport of 
     <lb/>
     my amendment. Its object is to guarantee 
     <lb/>
     what this government and parliament have 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged to be a pledge given to the 
     <lb/>
     minority, that wherever they are in a ma<lb break="no"/>jority they shall be authorized to have 
     <lb/>
     schools of their own, and wherever they are 
     <lb/>
     in a minority they shall be authorized to 
     <lb/>
     separate from the public schools. Clause 
     <lb/>
     16, No. 2 does not cover that point, and the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of the hon. member for Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan (Mr. Lamont), although good in 
     <lb/>
     its spirit, does not cover it either, so that I 
     <lb/>
     shall record my vote on this motion as pro<lb break="no"/>testing against the abandonment of the 
     <lb/>
     pledge which this government and parlia<lb break="no"/>ment have acknowledged as binding upon 
     <lb/>
     them.

     hon. friend the leader of the opposition re<lb break="no"/>specting the legal aspect of the clause, and 
     <lb/>
     on further consideration, I think that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
     <lb/>
     will find that if the majority in any district 
     <lb/>
     should happen to be either Catholic or Pro<lb break="no"/>testant, the right for the Protestant or 
     <lb/>
     Catholic ratepayers to establish a school un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly exists. As to the right of the 
     <lb/>
     Mormons to teach their peculiar tenets in 
     <lb/>
     the Territories including the unsavoury one 
     <lb/>
     of polygamy, I submit, with all deference 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bour<lb break="no"/>assa). that no such right exists in view of 
     <lb/>
     our Criminal Code.

     He said: Just one word of explanation. 
     <lb/>
     This is the law of the Territories at the 
     <lb/>
     present time, and, under the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, that law would be continued until 
     <lb/>
     altered by the provincial legislature. The 
     <lb/>
     law was enacted in 1891. Previous to 1891 
     <lb/>
     the scope of the law was wider. The French 
     <lb/>
     language had the same status as the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish language in the Northwest assembly. 
     <lb/>
     This amendment, passed in 1891, permits 
     <lb/>
     the assembly of the Territories to regulate 
     <lb/>
     its proceedings as it thinks fit and to adopt 
     <lb/>
     the English language. It has done so. Under 
     <lb/>
     this amendment, if adopted by the House, 
     <lb/>
     the legislatures of the two provinces would 
     <lb/>
     be free to regulate their own proceedings 
     <lb/>
     absolutely and to adopt the English langu<lb break="no"/>age. The only right that is safeguarded 
     <lb/>
     by this amendment is the right to use the 
     <lb/>
     French language in the courts and also in 
     <lb/>
     the debates if a member of the House sees 
     <lb/>
     fit to use that language, and it provides for 
     <lb/>
     the translation of the statutes. It main<lb break="no"/>tains to that extent, and to that extent only, 
     <lb/>
     the agreement to which I referred at length 
     <lb/>
     when I proposed this amendment in the

     emanates from a source that we should not 
     <lb/>
     and could not have anticipated. In truth, 
     <lb/>
     when that hon. member delivered an address 
     <lb/>
     on the constitutional question affecting the 
     <lb/>
     schools in the new provinces, we did not 
     <lb/>
     differ in opinion, and we all were unanimous 
     <lb/>
     in recognizing that his speech was evidence 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member had thoroughly studied 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8840</fw>
         

     the question. During the debate on the 
     <lb/>
     second reading of this Bill, the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Jacques Cartier defined the principles 
     <lb/>
     that should guide us in the exercise of our 
     <lb/>
     powers, as a parliament, regarding the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the new provinces created in the 
     <lb/>
     west. At page 3071, the hon. member ex<lb break="no"/>pressed himself thus : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     My interpretation of section 2 of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1871, is that that Act clearly gives us 
     <lb/>
     the creative power. It enables us to decree the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of a province, to constitute it 
     <lb/>
     by defining its limits and entering into other 
     <lb/>
     details which are absolutely necessary for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of such creation, but the moment that 
     <lb/>
     act has been performed our power is exhausted 
     <lb/>
     and the new province comes under the control 
     <lb/>
     of the different clauses of the Act of 1867, and 
     <lb/>
     these clauses apply in their entirety to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     The hon. member therefore stated that, 
     <lb/>
     in his opinion, this parliament has not the 
     <lb/>
     right to change the provisions of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, nor to alter it in any way, when 
     <lb/>
     we apply it to these western territories ; all 
     <lb/>
     that which we could do, to his mind, was 
     <lb/>
     merely to create those provinces, to define 
     <lb/>
     and limit their powers, and that from the 
     <lb/>
     moment we have defined their powers, the 
     <lb/>
     federal parliament has exhausted its own 
     <lb/>
     legislative power. Such is the theory advo<lb break="no"/>cated by the hon. gentleman. If the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Jacques Cartier decided to vote 
     <lb/>
     for clause 16, such as proposed by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, it is because that principle was 
     <lb/>
     consecrated and recognized by the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion as the one constructed by the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman himself, and that he considered it 
     <lb/>
     opportune to remove all doubts. But the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman is not the only one to claim 
     <lb/>
     that this parliament had not the right to 
     <lb/>
     limit the powers of the new provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Beauhrarnois (Mr. Bergeron) 
     <lb/>
     followed in his footsteps, and at page 3496, 
     <lb/>
     I read the following in his speech of March 
     <lb/>30 last :<lb/>
            </p>

    
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In speaking of the position taken by my 
     <lb/>
     leader, I wish to say openly that, to my mind, 
     <lb/>
     he made an admirable speech to which nobody 
     <lb/>
     can take exception. We may not all share the 
     <lb/>
     conclusions to which he came, but every man 
     <lb/>
     on this side, and I believe on the other side as 
     <lb/>
     well is convinced that the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion spoke in all sincertity without any bias, 
     <lb/>
     and influenced solely by a desire for the wel<lb break="no"/>fare of Canada. So much is that the case, that 
     <lb/>
     if in that amendment of his, ten words were 
     <lb/>
     struck off at the end, I would be disposed to 
     <lb/>
     support it. And in doing so I would be stand<lb break="no"/>ing on a good principle, namely, provincial au<lb break="no"/>tonomy and provincial rights ; and in my opin<lb break="no"/>ion clause 93 of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>would give the new provinces the school system 
     <lb/>they have to-day. But as a doubt has been ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by the Minister of Justice, I would 
     <lb/>have clause 16. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     As will be seen, the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Beauharnois did affirm the very principle 
     <lb/>
     formulated by the hon. member for Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier (Mr. Monk). As I said a moment 
     <lb/>
     ago, there is ground for surprise at seeing 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="8841" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8841.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">8841</fw> <fw type="dateline">JULY 5, 1905</fw> 
          


     the hon. member for Jacques Cartier laying 
     <lb/>
     down a proposition to restrict the rights of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, rights that are evidently 
     <lb/>
     recognized as theirs by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member stated also that we 
     <lb/>
     were abolishing the French language ; but 
     <lb/>
     we are not doing away with the French 
     <lb/>
     language, and it will continue to exist by 
     <lb/>
     law. But that is not the issue before us ; 
     <lb/>
     what we are dealing with now, is whether or 
     <lb/>
     not we should place a restriction upon the 
     <lb/>
     liberty of the provinces. That is the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. It is now a matter of formulating the 
     <lb/>
     principle that this parliament has not the 
     <lb/>
     right to enact without any necessity, special 
     <lb/>
     provisions, when making a constitution for 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the hon. member for Jacques Car<lb break="no"/>tier after having upheld that position and 
     <lb/>
     having also supported his leader, even to the 
     <lb/>
     school question, was obliged to abandon him. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. leader of the opposition had, like<lb break="no"/>wise, followed the hon. member as long as 
     <lb/>
     he could do so, he paid him back, he sup<lb break="no"/>ported him down to the moment of voting 
     <lb/>
     exclusively, but there his zeal stopped. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman having advocated the 
     <lb/>
     principle that we had not the power to give 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces the constitution we want<lb break="no"/>ed to give them, exclaimed: ' Why, if you 
     <lb/>
     restrict the power of the provinces on the 
     <lb/>
     school question, why not also do the same as 
     <lb/>
     to all their powers ' ? We made answer to 
     <lb/>
     this, that it was necessity alone that could 
     <lb/>
     justify the government in defining more 
     <lb/>
     clearly clause 93 of the constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, the hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     stated that, in his opinion, this motion did 
     <lb/>
     not go far enough, and he moved an amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the amendment. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
      for Jacques Cartier claimed that the legis<lb break="no"/>lature should have the power to abolish the 
     <lb/>
     French language in its proceedings, as en<lb break="no"/>acted in the motion passed in 1890. He 
     <lb/>
     considered that it was a question of policy 
     <lb/>
     and that the legislature should be left free 
     <lb/>
     to deal with the question as it deemed fit. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Labelle wished to 
     <lb/>
     take that power away from the legislatures, 
     <lb/>
     and yet the hon. member for Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>
     supported the amendment moved by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Labelle. But if the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Monk) was of the opinion 
     <lb/>
     that it was but fair to leave it in the hands 
     <lb/>
     of the legislatures to abolish or to maintain 
     <lb/>
     the French language, what are the grounds 
     <lb/>
     which have compelled him, since he moved 
     <lb/>
     his amendment, to change his mind ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1890, the hon. member for Beauharnois 
     <lb/>
     voted in favour of a proposition similar to 
     <lb/>
     that of the hon. member for Jacques Car<lb break="no"/>tier, allowing the legislative assembly of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories to abolish the use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language in their proceedings, when<lb break="no"/>ever they shall deem it opportune to do so. 
     <lb/>
     He voted for that resolution, with all the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative members of the day. How, 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8842</fw>
        

     then, could he vote for the amendment of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle, as he did the 
     <lb/>
     other day ?  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. (Translation.) Does my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend believe that we are not bound by 
     <lb/>
     clause 16 of the ' Bill of Rights ' submitted 
     <lb/>
     by the delegates from the Red River settle<lb break="no"/>ment in 1870 to the government of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     which provides for the use of the dual lan<lb break="no"/>guage throughout the whole extent of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest ? Does not the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     believe that the pledge is being now broken 
     <lb/>
     by the abolition of the French language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEME2">Mr. DEMERS</persName>. (Translation.) I think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. the Prime Minister, amongst others, 
     <lb/>
     has demonstrated in a most absolute man<lb break="no"/>ner that the contention of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Jacques Cartier was indefensible. 
     <lb/>
     I do not wish to go now into the merits 
     <lb/>
     of that question. This question had been 
     <lb/>
     discussed by this parliament in 1900 and 
     <lb/>
     this House has allowed the abolition of 
     <lb/>
     the French language in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
     The legislature of those Territories had been 
     <lb/>
     authorized by a vote of this House to do 
     <lb/>
     away with the French language. A most 
     <lb/>
     significant fact, that cannot escape the at<lb break="no"/>tention of most members is this, that when 
     <lb/>
     the Bill was submitted to this House the 
     <lb/>
     vast majority of members approved of it. 
     <lb/>
     Take the speeches that were delivered dur<lb break="no"/>ing the debate on the second reading of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, and you will see, Mr. Speaker, that not 
     <lb/>
    one of all those who spoke has found fault 
     <lb/>with the government for not providing for 
     <lb/>the use of the French language in the 
     <lb/>legislatures of the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I would like to know if among all those 
     <lb/>
     members, who then spoke, there was to be 
     <lb/>
     found one single speaker who made the 
     <lb/>
     slightest reservation in favour of the French 
     <lb/>
     language. For my part I did not hear any. 
     <lb/>
     Did not my hon. friend the member for 
     <lb/>
     Montmagny (Mr. Lavergne), give his un<lb break="no"/>qualified approval of the Bill to the 21st 
     <lb/>
     February ?

     <lb/>
     the school question, I did approve of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, but not on the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEME2">Mr. DEMERS</persName>. (Translation.) I say that 
     <lb/>
     there was no question of the French langu<lb break="no"/>age, that no complaint was made that its 
     <lb/>
     use was not prescribed, and I aflirm that 
     <lb/>
     no member, before voting on the second 
     <lb/>
     reading, had made any reservation on that 
     <lb/>
     point, nor blamed the government for not 
     <lb/>
     having provided for the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language. Moreover, how comes it, that 
     <lb/>
     the ' Club Jacques-Cartier ' of Montreal, 
     <lb/>
     which showed so much zeal in regard to 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, that had petitions circulated, did 
     <lb/>
     not think of that omission of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment ? And the Conservative newspapers, 
     <lb/>
     I will say further, the opposition newspapers 
     <lb/>
     such as the ' Nationaliste,' for example, did 
     <lb/>
     not think of that slip. The correspondent

     of that paper, Pont Bernard, on the 26th  
     <lb/>
    February, referred to the debate raised by 
     <lb/>this Bill, and to the speech made by the 
     <lb/>Premier, but he did not say a single word 
     <lb/>regarding the omission concerning the use 
     <lb/>of the French language. No person, at that 
     <lb/>time, had noticed that awful omission, and 
     <lb/>it was only later on that, for the purpose 
     <lb/>of having a vote, it was thought of. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     As I said, it is a most remarkable fact, 
     <lb/>
     that, after the second reading of the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     no person had stated that the French Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, in the Territories, had an absolute 
     <lb/>
     right to the maintenance of the French 
     <lb/>
     language. As a matter of fact, I have not 
     <lb/>
     heard of any representations having been 
     <lb/>
     made to the government on the matter, up 
     <lb/>
     to that date.

     grounds that were so ably set forth by the

     hon. the Prime Minister ; on this ground, 
     <lb/>
     namely, that under the constitution, we 
     <lb/>
     have a right to the use of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the Dominion parliament, before 
     <lb/>
     the federal courts, and before the courts 
     <lb/>
     and in the legislature of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, but nowhere else. That is the 
     <lb/>
     right provided for by the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     1867. But, I may be told that there was 
     <lb/>
     a law passed in 1877, which provides for 
     <lb/>
     the use of the French language. We do 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     we are not doing away with the use of 
     <lb/>
     the French language. I hold, moreover, that 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution, we have no right 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. (Translation.) I have been 
     <lb/>
     enlightened by the argument made by the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Inland Revenue.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEME2">Mr. DEMERS</persName>. (Translation.) Precisely, 
     <lb/>
     but it is regrettable that the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     did not allow himself to be enlightened 
     <lb/>
     upon other points by the hon. the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Inland Revenue. The school question is 
     <lb/>
     one thing and the use of the French langu<lb break="no"/>age is another thing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We should be very solicitous about the 
     <lb/>
     autonomy of the provinces. We are bound 
     <lb/>
     to give them all the rights conferred upon 
     <lb/>
     them by the constitution. That constitution 
     <lb/>
     restricts the powers of the provinces, as to 
     <lb/>
     the educational question, but not as to the 
     <lb/>
     language. That restrictive provision is to 
     <lb/>
     be found in article 93, with which we are 
     <lb/>
     all familiar. The provision relating to the 
     <lb/>
     French language is limited only to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec, and to the federal parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, and it applies nowhere else. Could the 
     <lb/>
     government impose this new restriction on 
     <lb/>
     the western provinces, the more so as our 
     <lb/>
     French speaking fellow-countrymen are so 
     <lb/>
     few in numbers there that they would not 
     <lb/>
     even speak French in the legislature, were 
     <lb/>
     they given that right ? The French Cana<lb break="no"/>dian population in the west represent but 
     <lb/>
     about four per cent of the total population ; 
     <lb/>
     such being the figures laid before the House 
     <lb/>
     without being challenged by anybody. Each 
     <lb/>
     legislature will have 25 members, making 
     <lb/>
     50 in all. According to that ratio of 4 per 
     <lb/>
     cent. there would only be one French member  
     <lb/>
     in each legislature. That there may be an 
     <lb/>
     assembly, at least three people are needed, 
     <lb/>
     and as that French member would be alone, 
     <lb/>
     he would have to speak French to himself. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To my mind it is not a matter of senti<lb break="no"/>ment, but it is one of principle. I do not 
     <lb/>
     call in question the good faith of any hon. 
     <lb/>
     member. I am quite willing to believe that 
     <lb/>
     the mover of this motion is a sincere con<lb break="no"/>vert. To my mind, this is a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     matter, and I say that we should not im<lb break="no"/>pose, without an absolute necessity, any re<lb break="no"/>strictions on the new provinces. This view 
     <lb/>
     of mine tallies with the statement I made 
     <lb/>
     on the first reading of the Bill. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa), is of a 
     <lb/>
     different opinion, and I regret very much 
     <lb/>
     that I cannot see this matter in the same 
     <lb/>
     light as he does. For us, it is a very delicate 
     <lb/>
     duty to be obliged to vote against the bind<lb break="no"/>ing use of the French language, but we 
     <lb/>
     have to follow the wise dictates of reason 
     <lb/>
     rather than those of sentiment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The present circumstances recall to my 
     <lb/>
     mind an anecdote. A great Greek orator 
     <lb/>
     one day declared at a public meeting in 
     <lb/>
          

            <pb n="8845" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8845.jpg"/>

     Athens that he had devised a great scheme 
     <lb/>
     for the good of his country, but that he 
     <lb/>
     could not inform his audience of it. He 
     <lb/>
     begged of them to point him out a person 
     <lb/>
     to whom he could communicate his plan. 
     <lb/>
     Socrates was the person selected. So<lb break="no"/>crates, being informed of it, returned to the 
     <lb/>
     Greeks and told them that nothing would be 
     <lb/>
     more useful than the project in question, but 
     <lb/>
     he added that nothing could be more unjust. 
     <lb/>
     The people, then, with one voice, refused at 
     <lb/>
     once to be a party to the scheme. Their 
     <lb/>
     example should be a guide for us. It is 
     <lb/>
     regrettable that public men should have to 
     <lb/>
     pronounce upon delicate matters that touch 
     <lb/>
     their national pride and dignity. I, there<lb break="no"/>fore, consider that this motion, under the 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, is inopportune.

     <lb/>
     (Translation.) Before moving an amendment 
     <lb/>
     to the amendment, moved by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Jacques Cartier—that is to say be<lb break="no"/>fore making the same motion that I made 
     <lb/>
     on Friday—I wish to offer a few remarks in 
     <lb/>
    reply to my hon. friend the member for St. 
     <lb/>John and Iberville. (Mr. Demers), I congra<lb break="no"/>tulate the hon. gentleman on the language 
     <lb/>that he has used, which contrasts happily 
     <lb/>with the stump-speech wherewith another 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman honoured me last Friday on 
     <lb/>the same subject. No more today than last 
     <lb/>week do I propose replying to that language, 
     <lb/>but I will take the liberty of saying that 
     <lb/>I was surprised at the applause with which 
     <lb/>certain French Canadian members, so-called 
     <lb/>Liberals, received those passages in the 
     <lb/>speech of the member for Kamouraska (Mr. 
     <lb/>Lapointe) which insulted the memory of a 
     <lb/>man whom the Liberal party had long 
     <lb/>claimed as its founder and as the most 
     <lb/>illustrious of its leaders. 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. (Papineau). (Trans<lb break="no"/>lation.) It is scarcely necessary that I 
     <lb/>
     should strive to refute an old time calumny 
     <lb/>
     long known to be false, not only by the dis<lb break="no"/>ciples and admirers of Papineau, but even 
     <lb/>
     by his opponents. To that colleague who 
     <lb/>
     deemed it fit to unearth that calumny and 
     <lb/>
     to those who cheered him, I will simply re<lb break="no"/>call the words used by a great French writer 
     <lb/>
     in reply to the insult launched by an ob<lb break="no"/>scure calumniator against the memory of an 
     <lb/>
     illustrious man. ' A filthy insect may soil 
     <lb/>
     his statue; but the wind that blows carries 
     <lb/>
     off the insect and the stain, and the marble

     remains intact in its imperishable beauty.'

     The first argument brought forward by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for St. John and Iberville 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Demers), and that upon which he most 
     <lb/>
     depended to oppose the motion of the member 
     <lb/>
     for Jacques Cartier, is that no one here—re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the maintaining of the French 
     <lb/>
     language, during the debate that preceded 
     <lb/>
     the second reading of this Bill. I agree that 
     <lb/>
     from the standpoint of narraw logic, that 
     <lb/>
     argument might have some weight; but I 
     <lb/>
     do not think I shall have much trouble in

     reputing it and in explaining why I did not 
     <lb/>
     deal with this question, at the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     the discussion. It is needless to recall to 
     <lb/>
     the House the explosion of fanaticism that 
     <lb/>
     greeted the attitude taken, in the first place, 
     <lb/>
     by the government in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     educational clause. From the outset of the 
     <lb/>
     debate, the leader of the opposition laid 
     <lb/>
     down a proposition that narrowed the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion to the consideration of the principle 
     <lb/>
     of the interference of the federal power in 
     <lb/>
     educational matters. When I spoke during 
     <lb/>
     that debate, I squarely opposed the pro<lb break="no"/>position of the leader of the opposition and 
     <lb/>
     the policy of his party on that subject, and 
     <lb/>
     gave a loyal support to the position taken 
     <lb/>
     by the government. I did not then think it 
     <lb/>
     wise to introduce into the discussion the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the subject which we are 
     <lb/>
     now dealing with. I had, however, decided 
     <lb/>
     to move an amendment similar to that of 
     <lb/>
     the member for Jacques Cartier, or rather 
     <lb/>
     to move the amendment that I submitted 
     <lb/>
     to the House on Friday, and that in a 
     <lb/>
     moment I will repeat. I have, moreover, no 
     <lb/>
     fault to find with my colleague who has got 
     <lb/>
     ahead of me, and I do not hesitate in any 
     <lb/>
     way to give him my support, while yet pro<lb break="no"/>posing to impart a more complete scope to 
     <lb/>
     his amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>
     is accused of seeking to make political 
     <lb/>
     capital out of this question. It is strange 
     <lb/>
     that the government members and news<lb break="no"/>papers should so treat the hon. member. 
     <lb/>
     When he supported the policy of the 
     <lb/>
     government, the ' Herald ' and the organs 
     <lb/>
     of the cabinet could not find language suf<lb break="no"/>ficiently eulogious to sing the praises of his 
     <lb/>
     patriotism. To-day, when he is not in har<lb break="no"/>mony with them, but while he continues to 
     <lb/>
     uphold the rights of the Catholic and French 
     <lb/>
     minority in the west, of which the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party pretends to be the champion, they 
     <lb/>
     have only insults to heap upon him. As to 
     <lb/>
     me, I am in accord with him on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion which affects our national honour, as 
     <lb/>
     I was in accord with him on the school 
     <lb/>
     question, the solution of which affects to 
     <lb/>
     such a degree the minority of the west and 
     <lb/>
     the prosperity of the whole country. I 
     <lb/>
     decided from the very start, to take in all 
     <lb/>
     these questions a stand in conformity with 
     <lb/>
     my convictions, without any regard for the 
     <lb/>
     interests and the intrigues of the cliques. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I was sufficiently liberal to consider all 
     <lb/>
     propositions submitted to this House accord<lb break="no"/>ing to their intrinsic merits, and to give 
     <lb/>
     them my support, no matter from whom 
     <lb/>
     they emanate, if I find them in accord with 
     <lb/>
     my principles and convictions. This, per<lb break="no"/>haps, is in what my liberalism differs from 
     <lb/>
     that of a number of my colleagues on the 
     <lb/>
     right. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Upon the constitutional ground, whereon 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for St. John and Iber<lb break="no"/>ville. based his second line of defence, he 
     <lb/>will allow me to tell him that he entrenches 
     <lb/>himself too easily behind the general and 
     <lb/>absolute proposition that the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="8847" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8847.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">8847</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
          

     has completely disposed of the theory of the 
     <lb/>
     member for Jacques Cartier. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Demers) attaches no impor<lb break="no"/>tance whatsoever to the Bill of Rights which 
     <lb/>
     the delegates from the Red River presented 
     <lb/>
     to the Federal government in 1870. He 
     <lb/>
     denies the existence of the contract that 
     <lb/>
     arose from the acceptance of that document 
     <lb/>
     by the Federal authorities. He does not 
     <lb/>
     agree with his leader on that point. The 
     <lb/>
     Premier recognizes the existence of the con<lb break="no"/>tract, but he denies that the obligations 
     <lb/>
     born thereof extend beyond the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman further wholly dis<lb break="no"/>agrees with another of his leaders, the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Brodeur), who 
     <lb/>
     not only admits the existence of the <choice><sic>argee<lb break="no"/>ment</sic><corr>agreement</corr></choice>, but has recalled it in the course of 
     <lb/>
     his argument as made on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories, as well 
     <lb/>
     as on that of the people of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have already clearly defined my posi<lb break="no"/>tion on the subject. I entirely agree with 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Inland Revenue. I believe 
     <lb/>
     in the existence of the agreement, and I 
     <lb/>
     do not find anything in the records of this 
     <lb/>
     House to warrant the contention of the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister. I cannot bring myself to 
     <lb/>
     believe that in tracing the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, the Dominion parliament have 
     <lb/>
     thereby shown their intention of denying 
     <lb/>
     to the French speaking people settled in the 
     <lb/>
     remainder of the Territories, the guaran<lb break="no"/>tees which they granted to that part of 
     <lb/>
     the population comprised within the limits 
     <lb/>
     of the new provinces. Now then, if the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Inland Revenue and myself are 
     <lb/>
     right, would not the compact whereby the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government is bound to guarantee 
     <lb/>
     to the Catholic minority in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     their separate schools, bind them to main<lb break="no"/>tain at the same time the official use of the 
     <lb/>
     French language, since these two consti<lb break="no"/>tutional rights were both included in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill of Rights presented by the delegates 
     <lb/>
     from the Red River and accepted by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion parliament ? I willingly ac<lb break="no"/>knowledge the ability of the member for 
     <lb/>
     St. Johns in all legal matters ; but, with all 
     <lb/>
     due respect, I think I may, in a matter of 
     <lb/>
     this kind, abide rather by the opinion of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Inland Revenue, who is also 
     <lb/>
     an eminent lawyer.

     will allow me to stand by the opinion of

     another of his leaders, a legal authority of 
     <lb/>
     still greater eminence than the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Inland Revenue, I mean the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick). That hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has clearly set forth the difference 
     <lb/>
     which exists between the letter and the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the constitution. Of course, the 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8848</fw>
         

     Confederation Act has no provision which 
     <lb/>
     defines the powers of the Dominion par<lb break="no"/>liament in this transaction. But, as stated 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. Minister of Justice, beside and 
     <lb/>
     above the written law, there is a consti<lb break="no"/>tutional doctrine, which it is diificult to 
     <lb/>
     define, growing out of the gradual and 
     <lb/>
     reasoned carrying out of the very princi<lb break="no"/>ples embodied in the constitution. The Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1867 provided at the outset solely for 
     <lb/>
     the organization of the provinces then con<lb break="no"/>stitutional. Even before entering confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, these provinces enjoyed self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; they had their parliament, their 
     <lb/>
     official tongue, their rules of parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     procedure. The idea did not occur to the 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation to alter that con<lb break="no"/>dition of things ; but in establishing the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion parliament, they did so on a 
     <lb/>
     basis in harmony with the rights and 
     <lb/>
     traditions of the two elements which make 
     <lb/>
     up the Canadian nation ; and that is why 
     <lb/>
     they provided that the French and English 
     <lb/>
     tongues would be, on equal terms, the 
     <lb/>
     official language of Canada. Later on, the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion parliament acquired those im<lb break="no"/>mense western territories out of which were 
     <lb/>
     carved the province of Manitoba and those 
     <lb/>
     of Alberta and Saskatchewan. These ter<lb break="no"/>ritories were acquired in the name and 
     <lb/>
     with the money of the whole Canadian peo<lb break="no"/>ple, French as well as English, Catholic as 
     <lb/>
     well as Protestant. And when parliament 
     <lb/>
     established the former of these provinces, 
     <lb/>
     they did not forget the rights of the French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people, they deemed it fair and 
     <lb/>
     reasonable that the two official languages 
     <lb/>
     of Canada be also declared to be such in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba. Does the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for St. Johns contend that the 
     <lb/>
     legislators of 1870, that the Macdonalds, 
     <lb/>
     the Cartiers, the Holtons, the Huntingtons, 
     <lb/>
     that all those eminent statesmen who were 
     <lb/>
     then at the head of both parties, broke the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of 1867 when, in 1870, they re<lb break="no"/>cognized the rights of the French language 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba.

     Prime Minister. The right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     acknowledges the existence of the moral 
     <lb/>
     agreement entered into in 1870. But he 
     <lb/>
     suggests that its scope is limited to the

     province of Manitoba and that it would not 
     <lb/>
     be possible to make it applicable to the 
     <lb/>
     other western provinces. I contend that

     the slightest evidence in support of that 
     <lb/>
     statement. However, the fact remains that 
     <lb/>
     the makers of the Manitoba constitution 
     <lb/>
     have enacted section 23 provided for the 
     <lb/>
     official use of the French language in that 
     <lb/>
     province; and if they had the right to do 
     <lb/>
     so, why should we be debarred from im<lb break="no"/>posing the same terms on the provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and Saskatchewan. I shall go fur<lb break="no"/>ther : I contend that not only have the 
     <lb/>
     promoters of the Act of 1870 not violated 
     <lb/>
     the constitution of 1867, but they have, on 
     <lb/>
     the contrary, been inspired by its funda<lb break="no"/>mental principle, in granting to the French 
     <lb/>
     language in Manitoba the same rights which 
     <lb/>
     the constitution itself grants to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament. And if we wish ourselves 
     <lb/>
     to remain faithful to that principle, we 
     <lb/>
     should follow their example and provide 
     <lb/>
     that the French and English tongues will 
     <lb/>
     be for ever, and on an equal footing, official 
     <lb/>
     in Alberta and Saskatchewan, two provin<lb break="no"/>ces cut out, as was Manitoba, from those 
     <lb/>
     vast territories which are the property of 
     <lb/>
     the whole Canadian people. What I claim, 
     <lb/>
     is the carrying out of the same principle 
     <lb/>
     which was applied in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     establishment of the Dominion itself. It 
     <lb/>
     is the principle which Sir John Macdonald 
     <lb/>
     advocated when he proclaimed that there 
     <lb/>
     were no longer in Canada victors and 
     <lb/>
     vanquished, but two allies whose rights, 
     <lb/>
     equal by virtue of the constitution, are not 
     <lb/>
     measured by the numbers and riches of the 
     <lb/>
     various groups. That is the principle which 
     <lb/>
     is embodied in the constitution of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     That is the principle which I would have 
     <lb/>
     recognized and applied to-day. I am not 
     <lb/>
     breaking the constitution, but parliament 
     <lb/>
     will be breaking it, should they reject my 
     <lb/>
     proposal and that of the member for 
     <lb/>
     Jacques Cartier. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for St. John's has re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the small numbers of French 
     <lb/>
     speaking people in the Territories. The 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General argued on the same lines, 
     <lb/>
     when he stated that we had no right to 
     <lb/>
     claim the official recognition of the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the Northwest Territories, be<lb break="no"/>cause the French speaking people were not 
     <lb/>
     as numerous as the Germans, the Douk<lb break="no"/>hobors or the Mormons. The Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister spoke in a similar strain, when he 
     <lb/>
     stated that the French Canadians in Massa<lb break="no"/>chusetts have stronger claims to the official 
     <lb/>
     recognition of their tongue in that state, 
     <lb/>
     than the French speaking people have in 
     <lb/>
     our western provinces. Have we really 
     <lb/>
     reached that point ? Are we, with one 
     <lb/>
     stroke of the pen, to blot out 150 years 
     <lb/>
     of our history; and on this Canadian soil, 
     <lb/>
     which our ancestors opened up to civiliza<lb break="no"/>tion, under the British flag which we twice 
     <lb/>
     saved from the savage onslaughts on the 
     <lb/>
     part of Anglo-Saxon Protestants from the 
     <lb/>
     neighbouring republic, under this constitu<lb break="no"/>tion which is the mere outcome of the com<lb break="no"/>pact entered into by the two great groups 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian nation, are we to be told 
     <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8850</fw>
       

     that we are entitled to no more consider<lb break="no"/>ation than our fellow countrymen who have 
     <lb/>
     drifted to a foreign land? Is that really 
     <lb/>
     the reward coming to us after a century 
     <lb/>
     and a half of unfaltering loyalty to British 
     <lb/>
     institutions ? Is that the result of the com<lb break="no"/>pact loyally gone into in 1867 between 
     <lb/>
     English and French speaking Canadians ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In order to do away with a proposal rest<lb break="no"/>ing on the wide and solid foundation which 
     <lb/>
     I have mentioned, subterfuges are resorted 
     <lb/>
     to. It is argued that the original compact 
     <lb/>
     and the rights of the French language in the 
     <lb/>
     west have already been interfered with by 
     <lb/>
     parliament in 1890. That is only a pretense. 
     <lb/>
     l have a higher notion of the duties and re<lb break="no"/>sponsibilities devolving on the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the Canadian nation. If the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of 1890 has made a mistake, that is no 
     <lb/>
     reason for us to repeat it and aggravate it. 
     <lb/>
     If parliament in 1890 misapprehended the 
     <lb/>
     work of the fathers of confederation and 
     <lb/>
     of the makers of the Manitoba constitution, 
     <lb/>
     it is our bounden duty to correct that mis<lb break="no"/>take. Parliament in 1890 abolished the use 
     <lb/>
     of the French language in the legislative 
     <lb/>
     assembly; and now that injustice becomes 
     <lb/>
     an argument for those who wish to carry 
     <lb/>
     through that sinister work and do away 
     <lb/>
     with the printing in French of statutes and 
     <lb/>
     legal proceedings. An effort is made to pal<lb break="no"/>liate that wrong by covering it up with a 
     <lb/>
     further crime. To that I answer boldly: 
     <lb/>
     Instead of resuming the work initiated by 
     <lb/>
     parliament in 1890, let us retrace our foot<lb break="no"/>steps and take the stand taken formerly by 
     <lb/>
     the promoters of the Act of 1870. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In this connection there has been some 
     <lb/>
     quibbling. It has been contended that we 
     <lb/>
     are not doing away with the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage, but that we are simply leaving to 
     <lb/>
     the legislature in the new provinces the 
     <lb/>
     right to act as they think fit. That is 
     <lb/>
     another attempt at hedging. We all knew 
     <lb/>
     what fate is reserved to the French lan<lb break="no"/>guage if provincial legislatures are granted 
     <lb/>
     full sway. Past experience is sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     enlighten us in that respect. When, in 1890, 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Thompson moved that the legis<lb break="no"/>lative assembly of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     be granted the right to decide in what 
     <lb/>
     tongue its proceedings would be carried on. 
     <lb/>
     the then leader of the opposition, to-day 
     <lb/>
     Premier of this Dominion (Sir Wilfrid Lau<lb break="no"/>rier) seconded his motion. He drew atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the fact that there was not at the 
     <lb/>
     time a single French Canadian member in 
     <lb/>
     the legislative assembly. He added that if 
     <lb/>
     the French minority should elect a single 
     <lb/>
     representative, the English-speaking major<lb break="no"/>ity would, no doubt, refrain from abolishing 
     <lb/>
     the use of the French language. What was 
     <lb/>
     the outcome ? In 1892. Mr. Haultain moved 
     <lb/>
     the abolition of the French language. At 
     <lb/>
     the time there were two French Canadian 
     <lb/>
     representatives in the legislature. One of 
     <lb/>
     them, Mr. Prince, spoke on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority, appealed to the spirit 
     <lb/>
        

            <pb n="8851" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8851.jpg"/>

     of fairness of the majority, claimed equal 
     <lb/>
     rights for the two great Canadian nation<lb break="no"/>alities ; but his efforts were in vain, and the 
     <lb/>
     French language was done away with. So, 
     <lb/>
     then, we are in a position to know what 
     <lb/>
     are the feelings towards us of the English- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     speaking majority in the west; and if we 
     <lb/>
     are anxious to perpetuate in these provinces 
     <lb/>
     the conditions of the compact of 1867, if 
     <lb/>
     we are anxious to carry on the work of 
     <lb/>
     the makers of the Manitoba constitution. 
     <lb/>
     if we are anxious to maintain the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional basis which I have referred to, let us 
     <lb/>
     introduce in the Bills submitted to us a 
     <lb/>
     clause guaranteeing the rights of the minor<lb break="no"/>ity against any interference similar to that 
     <lb/>
     of which the English majority has been 
     <lb/>
     guilty in 1802. Instead of seeking in our 
     <lb/>
     past experience an excuse for our present 
     <lb/>
     inactivity. I find therein a lesson which 
     <lb/>
     should induce us to define clearly the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minority and safeguard them by 
     <lb/>
     means of a precise and unmistakable enact<lb break="no"/>ment. Let us not delude ourselves in the 
     <lb/>
     matter! If the House rejects my proposal 
     <lb/>
     and that of the hon. member for Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier, then let us give up all hope as to the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the French language in the west. 
     <lb/>
     French Canadian members who are fighting 
     <lb/>
     us are making for the downfall of our 
     <lb/>
     nationality: and should parliament reject 
     <lb/>
     our amendment, I say an essential principle 
     <lb/>
     of our constitution is being violated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let each one of us consult his conscience 
     <lb/>
     and realize what responsibility he is assum<lb break="no"/>ing just now. As for me, I refuse to take 
     <lb/>
     a hand in this unpatriotic work. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prime Minister recalls the obliga<lb break="no"/>tions which parliament has assumed to<lb break="no"/>wards the Canadian Pacific Railway com<lb break="no"/>pany. He does not hesitate to go counter 
     <lb/>
     to the letter and spirit of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     in order to secure the rights of that power<lb break="no"/>ful corporation ; and in this connection he 
     <lb/>
     has the support of the whole House ; the 
     <lb/>
     agreement is considered sacred ; and all 
     <lb/>
     enactments, all constitutions are bound to 
     <lb/>
     disappear in order to secure its full carry<lb break="no"/>ing out. Why, then, should the no less 
     <lb/>
     sacred obligations which parliament and 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian people have assumed towards 
     <lb/>
     the French people of the west be violated ? 
     <lb/>
     Is it because that powerful Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway Company commands a greater num<lb break="no"/>ber of votes than the French minority in 
     <lb/>
     the west ? I refuse to measure or weigh 
     <lb/>
     by such a standard my moral responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     and obligations. I give my support to the 
     <lb/>
     government when they wish to compel the 
     <lb/>
     western provinces to respect the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway Company ; but 
     <lb/>
     I regard as still more sacred the rights of 
     <lb/>
     my fellow-countrymen ; and that is why I 
     <lb/>
     am movng in this House a provision which 
     <lb/>
     guarantees those rights still more com<lb break="no"/>pletely than the amendment introduced by 
     <lb/>
     the member for Jacques Cartier. I wish to

     blot out the wrong committed by'the legisla<lb break="no"/>tors of 1890, and to revert to the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional basis laid down by parliament in 1870. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I therefore move. seconded by Mr. La<lb break="no"/>vergne, member for Montmagmy, that the 
     <lb/>

     The <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Right Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. 
     <lb/>
     (Translation.) The hon. member for La<lb break="no"/>belle, knows that there is a principle which 
     <lb/>
     all Liberals, and particularly French-speak<lb break="no"/>ing Liberals have always held sacred, and 
     <lb/>
     that is the absolute right of the provinces to 
     <lb/>
     make their own laws. It is an historical 
     <lb/>
     fact, well known to all, that if we have to<lb break="no"/>day a federal, instead of a legislative union, 
     <lb/>
     that is due to the persistent efforts of the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians, who, in order to secure 
     <lb/>
     self-government, in order to he in a position 
     <lb/>
     to legislate for themselves, and to settle all 
     <lb/>
     questions of internal economy have insisted 
     <lb/>
     on having that division of powers implied 
     <lb/>
     in a federal union. Well, among the rights 
     <lb/>
     embodied in section 92 of the constitution, 
     <lb/>
     there are some which are perhaps more im<lb break="no"/>portant than all others ; I mean property 
     <lb/>
     and civil rights. The language question is 
     <lb/>
     one of civil rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I deny the statement which has just been 
     <lb/>
     made by the hon. member for Labelle. that. 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution enacted in 1867—I am 
     <lb/>
     mistaken, to which we freely gave our assent 
     <lb/>
     in 1867—the French language was put on 
     <lb/>
     an equal footing in the various provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. (Translation.) I think 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. Prime Minister is mistaken; 
     <lb/>
     that is not what I said. I said that each of 
     <lb/>
     the original provinces had preserved its 
     <lb/>
     rights; but that the French language had 
     <lb/>
     been put on an equal footing with the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish in the Dominion parliament, and that I 
     <lb/>
     considered we should do the same as re<lb break="no"/>gards the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. (Translation) 
     <lb/>
     I am very much pleased to hear that state<lb break="no"/>ment ; in the heat of the debate the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member seems to have gone beyond what 
     <lb/>
     he intended to say. At any rate, if, in this 
     <lb/>
     House, we have the right to use both langu<lb break="no"/>ages, it is not simply a theoretical right. It 
     <lb/>
     is because the great majority of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec send French Canadian re<lb break="no"/>presentatives to parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am now coming to the principle express<lb break="no"/>ed by the hon. member for Labelle—and I 
     <lb/>
     trust he will recognize it as I do on all 
     <lb/>
     occasions—and that is that the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces are absolute within the limits of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, and that among these 
     <lb/>
     rights there is the freedom to legislate as 
     <lb/>
     regards the language to be used in the 
     <lb/>
     counts and the legislative assembly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, if the House agreed to that amend<lb break="no"/>ment, as desired by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle, and if we inserted it in the consti<lb break="no"/>

     tution which we are enacting for the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Alberta and for that of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, we would be interfering thereby with 
     <lb/>
     one of the rights of these provinces, that of 
     <lb/>
     deciding in what language the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     will be carried on in the legislatures. 
     <lb/>
     There is one other thing which he will re<lb break="no"/>cognize. In the constitutions which we are 
     <lb/>
     giving to Alberta and Saskatchewan, we 
     <lb/>
     have deliberately restricted the rights of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces to legislate on educational 
     <lb/>
     matters. We have done so under the 
     <lb/>
     authority granted by section 93 of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution. For, in matters of education, the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the provinces are not absolute ; 
     <lb/>
     they are restricted by the powers of inter<lb break="no"/>ference of the Dominion parliament. We 
     <lb/>
     have done so with a view to remaining faith<lb break="no"/>ful to the principle laid down, whereby in 
     <lb/>
     matters of education the fundamental right 
     <lb/>
     of the provinces is limited, in order to safe<lb break="no"/>guard separate schools. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     stated a moment ago that we had refrained 
     <lb/>
     from dealing with the French language 
     <lb/>
     question, on account of the commotion 
     <lb/>
     which the discussion on separate schools 
     <lb/>
     had given rise to. Does my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     think that the excitement has now subsid<lb break="no"/>ed ? Is he of opinion that the agitation is 
     <lb/>
     about to cease, and that he may safely to<lb break="no"/>day do what he considered unadvisable two 
     <lb/>
     or three months ago ? I ask him, is he any 
     <lb/>
     more justified in taking that stand just new 
     <lb/>
    than he would have been a few weeks ago ? 
     <lb/>No ; we would have been grievously amiss 
     <lb/>if we had given further cause to the agita<lb break="no"/>tion already on foot. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     If my hon. friend were able to point out 
     <lb/>
     in the constitution a single clause stating 
     <lb/>
     that the French language shall have official 
     <lb/>
     recognition in every province, I would be 
     <lb/>
     ready to agree with him. But he will seek 
     <lb/>
     in vain in the whole British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act a provision dealing with the French 
     <lb/>
     language in the same way as schools are 
     <lb/>
     dealt with. Schools have been put on a dif<lb break="no"/>ferent footing. Exception has been made 
     <lb/>
     for them ; but no such exception has been 
     <lb/>
     made as regards the French language. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I need not tell my hon. friend of Labelle 
     <lb/>
     that I am as proud of my tongue as be him<lb break="no"/>self may be. that I am as proud of my race 
     <lb/>
     as he is, and that I am anxious to see it re<lb break="no"/>spected in the other provinces. If the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians, however, are desirous 
     <lb/>
     that their rights be respected in the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, they, should always be the first 
     <lb/>
     to abide by the constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a matter of fact, I do not at all agree 
     <lb/>
     with my hon. friend for Jacques Cartier (Mr 
     <lb/>
     Monk) as to the guarantee which he claims 
     <lb/>
     to find in the Bill Of Rights. But another 
     <lb/>
     question comes up here : Is not that merely 
     <lb/>
     an illusory right ? Of what use would it 
     <lb/>
     be, following on the enactment of 1890 ? 
     <lb/>
     According to the member for Labelle, par<lb break="no"/>liament committed a wrong, in 1890. In my 
     <lb/>
     opinion, parliament did not do anything of 
     <lb/>
     the sort. If there had been a number of 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8854</fw>
         

     French-speaking members in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     legislature in 1890, if there were a number 
     <lb/>
     of these French-speaking members in that 
     <lb/>
     legislature today, he would have no reason 
     <lb/>
     to fear-the emergency he refers to. But I 
     <lb/>
     need not recall to the hon. member for La<lb break="no"/>belle that the hopes he entertains regarding 
     <lb/>
     the development of the French idiom in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest will not materialize. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I remember—I was not here then, but it 
     <lb/>
     is an historical fact—that Sir George Cartier 
     <lb/>
     speaking from the very seat which I occupy 
     <lb/>
     at present, stated, in 1870, that the province 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba, which was then being created. 
     <lb/>
     would be a second Quebec. Sir John A. 
     <lb/>
     Macdonald made a similar statement. but 
     <lb/>
     these hopes have not materialized ; the tide 
     <lb/>
     of French Canadian emigration did not flow 
     <lb/>
     towards that province. as was then expected. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In 1890, two Acts were passed by the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba legislature, one abolishing separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools, and the other abolishing the 
     <lb/>
     official use of the French language. Enor<lb break="no"/>mous efforts were made to prevent the abol<lb break="no"/>ition of separate schools, but as regards the 
     <lb/>
     French language, what steps have been 
     <lb/>
     taken ? Sir John Thompson stated in a 
     <lb/>
     memorandum, that the Act doing away with 
     <lb/>
     the official use of the French language was 
     <lb/>
     entirely ultra vires. Nevertheless, no steps 
     <lb/>
     were taken to have it repealed. Why ? Be<lb break="no"/>cause the French-speaking people out there 
     <lb/>
     did not care to undertake the tight, being 
     <lb/>
     too weak, and, I imagine, realizing that 
     <lb/>
     there was no need for the use of that langu<lb break="no"/>age in the legislature. Well, today, in these 
     <lb/>
     territories where French Canadians are so 
     <lb/>
     few, of what avail would it be to grant a 
     <lb/>
     right which would limit the power of the 
     <lb/>
     legislature on that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I regret that it should be so, but I for one 
     <lb/>
     intend to vote against these amendments. 
     <lb/>
     I am not ignorant of the consequences which 
     <lb/>
     may result therefrom : but even in face of 
     <lb/>
     these. I do not hesitate to say that I trust 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians will be the first on this 
     <lb/>
     occasion, as on any other of the same kind, 
     <lb/>
     to respect the constitution which guarantees 
     <lb/>
     their rights in the province of Quebec.

     The hon. member for Laval (Mr. Leonard) 
     <lb/>
     has already spoken on the motion of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk). 
     <lb/>
     He has no right to move an amendment, 
     <lb/>
     because he has already seconded a previous 
     <lb/>
     amendment.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. I think the point is well 
     <lb/>
     taken.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEON1">Mr. LEONARD</persName>. (Translation). I never 
     <lb/>
     spoke on the motion ; but in answer to 
     <lb/>
     the objection raised by the hon. minister, 
     <lb/>
     I may say that if my name has been given 
     <lb/>
     by the Speaker, as having seconded the 
     <lb/>
     motion, it was altogether without my know<lb break="no"/>ledge.

     <lb/>
     been well taken. If the hon. member desires 
     <lb/>
     to appeal from the ruling of the chair of 
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName> (Calgary). I have 
     <lb/>
     an amendment which I desire to make to 
     <lb/>
     the motion of the right hon. the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) to read the Bill 
     <lb/>
     a third time. The motion which I propose 
     <lb/>
     to offer in amendment is similar to the one 
     <lb/>
     which I had the privilege of introducing 
     <lb/>
     when the matter was under discussion in the 
     <lb/>
     committee. The intention of that motion 
     <lb/>
     was that the distribution of the local seats 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Alberta should be referred 
     <lb/>
     to a commission of Judges of the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court residing in that province. While 
     <lb/>
     this matter was being discussed in the 
     <lb/>
     committee I assigned then reasons which I 
     <lb/>
     had hoped would have induced the govern<lb break="no"/>ment to have looked at the proposal in a 
     <lb/>

     favourable light and to have referred this 
     <lb/>
     matter to a commission of judges. I do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to repeat the arguments that I 
     <lb/>
     then assigned or the reasons Why I thought 
     <lb/>
    that this matter should be referred to a 
     <lb/>commission of judges. I therefore will move, 
     <lb/>seconded by Mr. Herron :

     Amendment (Mr. W. J. Roche) negatived

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. R. S. LAKE</persName> (Qu'Appelle). I propose 
     <lb/>
     to move an amendment which, if adopted, 
     <lb/>
     would have the effect of granting to the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces the lands, mines, minerals 
     <lb/>
     within their boundaries. To give to the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces those rights and powers in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the public domain as are declared 
     <lb/>
     by the British North America Act to come 
     <lb/>
     within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion. I have already 
     <lb/>
     spoken at considerable length in advocacy 
     <lb/>
     of this principle, first on the second read<lb break="no"/>ing of the Bill and subsequently on more 
     <lb/>
     than one occasion when the Bill was in 
     <lb/>
     committee. 1 have nothing to add to the 
     <lb/>
     arguments which I then used. They are be<lb break="no"/>fore the House and it is not necessary that 
     <lb/>
     I should repeat them. I believe that if the 
     <lb/>
     House refuses to accept this amendment 
     <lb/>
     and passes the Bill in its present form it 
     <lb/>
     will be doing a great wrong not only to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces, but to the whole Do<lb break="no"/>minion. The provincial ownership of the 
     <lb/>
     public domain is one of the basic principles 
     <lb/>
     of confederation ; to disregard it and the 
     <lb/>
     other fundamental principles of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act is to undermine the 
     <lb/>
     whole structure of confederation and to lay 
     <lb/>
     up a store of trouble in the days to come. 
     <lb/>
     The struggle for provincial rights will only 
     <lb/>
     begin when this Bill comes into effect on 
     <lb/>
     the 1st September next, if it remains in its 
     <lb/>
     present form. The culmination of that 
     <lb/>
     struggle may not be reached this year or 
     <lb/>
     next year, but it must inevitably come some 
     <lb/>
     day in the future and it will be due to the 
     <lb/>
     action of this parliament if that struggle 
     <lb/>
     does injury to our common country. I said 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="8863" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8863.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
       

     in the first words that I uttered about this 
     <lb/>
    Bill that the action of Canada in dealing 
     <lb/>with what may be called her own colonies 
     <lb/>in the matter of self-government, would be 
     <lb/>watched with interest not only in the mother 
     <lb/>land but throughout the empire. Compari<lb break="no"/>sons will be drawn between the treatment 
     <lb/>accorded to the north American colonies 
     <lb/>when they become self-governing colonies 
     <lb/>by Great Britain on the one hand and the 
     <lb/>treatment accorded to her new provinces 
     <lb/>by Canada on the other hand. Those com<lb break="no"/>parisons will not be flattering to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament if the Bill goes through 
     <lb/>in its present form. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     No satisfactory reason has been offered 
     <lb/>
     to this House for disregarding the clear and 
     <lb/>
     definite provisions of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act in regard to provincial own<lb break="no"/>ership of the public domain. The ar<lb break="no"/>guments adduced by the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     and others in respect to this matter will 
     <lb/>
     not be regarded either by the country 
     <lb/>
     at large or by the new provinces as ade<lb break="no"/>quate or indeed even as quite worthy of 
     <lb/>
     the great principle involved. In the argu<lb break="no"/>ment he used this afternoon surely the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice did not intend to suggest, 
     <lb/>
     although his words sounded like it, that 
     <lb/>
     Canada had purchased from the Hudson 
     <lb/>
     Bay Company, through the medium of Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain, the absolute title to one-third of the 
     <lb/>
     North American continent for £300,000. That 
     <lb/>
     sum, as I understand it, was paid for the 
     <lb/>
     surrender to the Crown of certain claims and 
     <lb/>
     privileges which the Hudson Bay Company 
     <lb/>
     had over this vast area. The claims and 
     <lb/>
     privileges of the company being thus re<lb break="no"/>moved, the property itself was vested in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, the title being in the Crown. The 
     <lb/>
     very fact that Great Britain having thus 
     <lb/>
     procured a surrender of the Hudson Bay 
     <lb/>
     Company's rights over this area then handed 
     <lb/>
     it over to the administration of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of Canada with the evident view of its 
     <lb/>
     ultimate formation into provinces is the 
     <lb/>
     very strongest argument that could possibly 
     <lb/>
     be used that the Dominion should hand over 
     <lb/>
     the area comprised in the new provinces to 
     <lb/>
     the administration of those provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     hope that even at this stage it is not too 
     <lb/>
     late, and that the House will be induced to 
     <lb/>
     reverse the policy it has up to this time 
     <lb/>
     sanctioned. I beg to move, seconded by

     I therefore do not intend to occupy the time

     for the action we are taking in constituting 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, not merely the Act of 1871 
     <lb/>

     America Act of 1867, the Act of 1871, the

     final Act of 1886, and also the Rupert's

     very foundation of the constitution both of

     contained in the British North America Act,

     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. H. BOURASSA</persName>. I rise to offer a 
     <lb/>
     word of personal explanation and to give 
     <lb/>
     the reasons why I do not feel disposed to 
     <lb/>
     vote either for the third reading of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     or against it, so that I may not be accused 
     <lb/>
     of shirking the vote. My reason is this : 
     <lb/>
     I am in favour of the principle of the Bill; 
     <lb/>
     that is, I am in favour of giving the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories their autonomy, but the 
     <lb/>
     Bill does not contain what in my opinion is 
     <lb/>
     a sufficient guarantee of the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     minorities that we are bound to protect, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore I cannot vote with those who 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="num">8866</fw>
          

     are opposed to any kind of guarantee to 
     <lb/>
     the minorities, nor can I vote for a Bill 
     <lb/>
     which in my opinion does not give a suffi<lb break="no"/>cient measure of guarantee.

     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. ARMAND LAVERGNE</persName>. Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     I suppose I shall not surprise any one in the

     House by saying that I take the same posi<lb break="no"/>tion as the hon. member for Labelle. I 
     <lb/>
     therefore leave the House before the vote

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Mr. Speaker, before this mo<lb break="no"/>tion passes I would ask the House to allow 
     <lb/>
     me to occupy a few minutes further on the 
     <lb/>
     subject of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     exemption. I have no hope, after the re<lb break="no"/>ception that was given to the amendment I 
     <lb/>
     moved this afternoon, that I shall succeed 
     <lb/>
     with a similar amendment moved to the 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan Bill, but I feel that I would 
     <lb/>
     not be doing my full duty to the proposed 
     <lb/>
     province in which I live, and to the electors 
     <lb/>
     in that proposed province which I have the 
     <lb/>
     honour to represent, if I did not utter on 
     <lb/>
     this motion a further word of protest with 
     <lb/>
     regard to this feature of the measure; and 
     <lb/>
     I do this notwithstanding that I am prob<lb break="no"/>ably bringing again upon myself the severe 
     <lb/>
     disapprobation of the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. In face of the fact that that 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has for three or four months 
     <lb/>
     been responsible for a waste of the time 
     <lb/>
     of this parliament, and responsible for a 
     <lb/>
     great deal of disturbance throughout the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada upon these autonomy 
     <lb/>
     measures, he rises to censure a representa<lb break="no"/>tive from the Northwest Territories who 
     <lb/>
     has the hardihood to ask the House to listen 
     <lb/>
     for thirty or forty minutes to a protest with 
     <lb/>
     regard to a limitation on the autonomy pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be given to the people of these two 
     <lb/>
     provinces, which is a very serious matter 
     <lb/>
     in comparison with the comparatively trifl<lb break="no"/>ing matter that he is responsible for causing 
     <lb/>
     to be discussed at such great length and 
     <lb/>
     disturbing the country to such an extent. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. leader of the opposition said that 
     <lb/>
     the words I used in my amendment were 
     <lb/>
     meaningless—that the power of expropria<lb break="no"/>tion was inherently in this parliament, and 
     <lb/>
     that, therefore, it was meaningless to put 
     <lb/>
     in this Act words giving notice to the people 
     <lb/>
     of these provinces and to the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Pacific Railway Company that this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment intends to exercise its inherent powers 
     <lb/>
     of expropriation if it were not able by some 
     <lb/>
     other means to obtain the relinquishment 
     <lb/>
     of these exemptions.

     what construction he places on the amend<lb break="no"/>ment proposed by the hon. leader of the

     <lb/>
     to strike out section 16 and substitute this:

     <lb/>
     hon. friend cannot tell me, nor can the hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition himself tell me what 
     <lb/>
     that means. It means about the same thing 
     <lb/>
     as the amendment he proposed formerly in 
     <lb/>
      relation to education. The hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition admitted, when the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Inland Revenue questioned him on 
     <lb/>
     the floor of the House of Commons, that 
     <lb/>
     he did not know how it would work out, 
     <lb/>
     and that he did not know what it meant. 
     <lb/>
     Does the hon. leader of the opposition think 
     <lb/>
     when he speaks before the people of this 
     <lb/>
     country and before the members of this 
     <lb/>
     House that he is speaking to children ? Let 
     <lb/>
     him go to the head of the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway or to the head of the Canadian 
     <lb/>
     Northern Railway and ask these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     if they think these words specifying the in<lb break="no"/>tention of parliament to exercise its in<lb break="no"/>herent power of expropriation do not mean 
     <lb/>
     anythng.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I rise to a point of 
     <lb/>
     order. I submit that the hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     no right to refer to a previous debate. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I propose, Mr. Speaker, to 
     <lb/>
     move an amendment, and I trust I am not 
     <lb/>
     out of order in discussing the amendment 
     <lb/>
     which I propose to move. It concerns the 
     <lb/>
     Canada Pacific Railway exemption feature 
     <lb/>
     and the inherent right of expropriation pos<lb break="no"/>sessed by this parliament with regard to 
     <lb/>
     that exemption feature. I was proceeding 
     <lb/>
     to remind the House that a couple of years 
     <lb/>
     ago we granted certain rights to the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Northern Railway, and it was pro<lb break="no"/>posed at that time that it should be specified 
     <lb/>
     in the Bill that parliament retained the right 
     <lb/>
     to expropriate. I can tell the hon. leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition that Mr. Willam Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie, the president of the Canadian North<lb break="no"/>ern Railway, did not think these words 
     <lb/>
     meaningless, because he opposed the pro<lb break="no"/>position strenuously, and whenever the same 
     <lb/>
     proposition has been made with regard to 
     <lb/>
     a railway which is being chartered, it has 
     <lb/>
     been opposed by the promoters of the chart<lb break="no"/>er. It is not so long ago that discussion 
     <lb/>
     took place in this House on the Grand 
     <lb/>
     Trunk Pacific proposition, and if my memory 
     <lb/>
     serves me rightly, we had an amendment 
     <lb/>
     moved on the other side of the House that 
     <lb/>
     the Bill should specify that under such and 
     <lb/>
     such conditions parliament would expro<lb break="no"/>

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8868</fw>
         

     priate the undertaking. Am I stating the 
     <lb/>
     fact correctly ? I put that squarely to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition. Silence, I 
     <lb/>
     suppose, gives consent; but we may as well 
     <lb/>
     have the actual proof. On May 26, 1904, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. leader of the opposition summar<lb break="no"/>ized certain resolutions which he had in 
     <lb/>
     the previous months presented to this House 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the Grand Trunk Pacific pro<lb break="no"/>position. Some of these amendments, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, were not entirely meaningless, but so 
     <lb/>
     many were presented that I venture to say 
     <lb/>
     that no single person in the whole of Can<lb break="no"/>ada can tell at this moment whether the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition faced north, 
     <lb/>
     south, east or west on the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Pacific question. Here is what the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman said on May 26, 1904, as found 
     <lb/>
     at page 3558 of ' Hansard ': 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     We then moved an amendment that if the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Pacific should exercise its right 
     <lb/>
     to force on the government any unprofitable 
     <lb/>
     branches at the end of fifty years, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment might take all or any of the remaining 
     <lb/>
     branches. In this way we desired to prevent

     <lb/>
     having to take and operate unprofitable 
     <lb/>
     branches without having the option of con<lb break="no"/>trolling the situation by taking also all the

            <p>
     That surely was a meaningless proposi<lb break="no"/>tion, because parliament had the inherent 
     <lb/>
     right of expropriation. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     was needlessly taking up the time of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment when he discussed that proposition at 
     <lb/>
     great length.

     have haulage rights and running powers over 
     <lb/>
     the western division for the same period grant<lb break="no"/>ed to the company over the eastern division. 
     <lb/>
     Both these amendments were rejected.

            </p>

            <p>
     Then we proposed that the government should 
     <lb/>
     be empowered to expropriate the railways from 
     <lb/>
     ocean to ocean, upon paying fair compensation, 
     <lb/>
     and in addition we moved a further amendment

     empowering the government to do so in case 
     <lb/>
     these railways should not carry out the true

     applaud the remark. I am, therefore, giving 
     <lb/>
     an accurate discription of what they have 
     <lb/>
     attempted. We had some reference here 
     <lb/>
     a few days ago to a Northwest conference 
     <lb/>
     called by Mr. Haultain and to the matters 
     <lb/>
     discussed there. I proposed a motion at 
     <lb/>
     that conference with regard to the redistri<lb break="no"/>bution schedules. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberta (Mr. Herron) arose here and de<lb break="no"/>clared that the motion made by me was 
     <lb/>
     not as I stated, but was that we should 
     <lb/>
     hold out together to get our land and min<lb break="no"/>erals for the new provinces.

     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. I state now that you did 
     <lb/>
    make that statement, and it is the only

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I state now deliberately to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend that the matter of lands was 
     <lb/>
     not discussed at that conference at all, and 
     <lb/>
     I say it in the hearing of several gentle<lb break="no"/>men who were present. There were three 
     <lb/>
     conferences in all. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake) attended the first 
     <lb/>
     two, but was not present at the third, and 
     <lb/>
     the matter of lands was not mentioned at 
     <lb/>
     the third conference concerning which we 
     <lb/>
     had the discussion on this floor. I tell the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman now that there never was 
     <lb/>
     any such motion made at any of the three

     Mr. Haultain bring up the subject of educa<lb break="no"/>tion ? Was that one of the large and broad

     subjects which we were brought together 
     <lb/>
     to discuss ? I say that the subject was 
     <lb/>
     never mentioned. In that fact alone we 
     <lb/>
    have the complete proof that the Northwest

     government and the Northwest people gen<lb break="no"/>erally were not asking for any change in

     their educational constitution.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LALO2">Mr. LALOR</persName>. Did you not make the 
     <lb/>
     statement on a previous occasion in this 
     <lb/>
     House that it was the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     who called this conference ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. My hon. friend is quite 
     <lb/>
     mistaken. The Prime Minister suggested 
     <lb/>
     to Mr. Haultain that he should furnish to 
     <lb/>
     the government the schedules of redistribu<lb break="no"/>tion, and Mr. Haultain called a third confer<lb break="no"/>ence partly for the purpose of getting as<lb break="no"/>sistance from the Northwest members and 
     <lb/>
     senators generally with regard to redistri<lb break="no"/>bution and two or three other matters. I re<lb break="no"/>peat that no motion was made at any confer<lb break="no"/>ence as is described by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberta (Mr. Herron) either by myself, him<lb break="no"/>self or by the hon. member for Qu'Appelle 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lake) or by Mr. Haultain to the effect 
     <lb/>
     that we should stand out for the absolute 
     <lb/>
     transfer of our public lands. What I did 
     <lb/>
     at that conference however, was to attempt 
     <lb/>
     to get it to take the position—not by mo<lb break="no"/>tion, but by suggestion ; and that is doubt<lb break="no"/>less what has misled the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Alberta—that we should unitedly and resol<lb break="no"/>utely stand out for the principle that the 
     <lb/>
     public lands belong to the people of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and that we should have their actual 
     <lb/>
     transfer or a fair price. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HERR2">Mr. HERRON</persName>. The hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged just now that he was wrong. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It is my hon. friend who 
     <lb/>
     admits the mistake. I suggested that 
     <lb/>
     we should unitedly take the position, 
     <lb/>
     and hold to it resolutely, that the lands 
     <lb/>
     were ours, and that we should get an 
     <lb/>
     actual transfer of them or a fair price. 
     <lb/>
     And in my opinion, and in that of the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the people of the Northwest, even 
     <lb/>
     of Mr. Haultain himself—because he has 
     <lb/>
     said so in a public letter—we have got a 
     <lb/>
     fair price for the lands. Let me say to 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen opposite, from their leader 
     <lb/>
     down, that in view of the history of the 
     <lb/>
     last two years with regard to the subject of 
     <lb/>
     autonomy, it does not lie in the mouth of 
     <lb/>
     any Conservative anywhere in the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     to charge any Northwest Liberal—

     <lb/>
     patient and I will give them plenty of 
     <lb/>
     proof. I say it does not lie in their mouths 
     <lb/>
     to charge any Northwest Liberal with a wil<lb break="no"/>lingness to sacrifice any Northwest local in<lb break="no"/>terest at the behest of any party leader. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Qu'Appelle (Mr. Lake)

servatives in the Territories up to two years 
     <lb/>
     ago were of the belief that, in view of 
     <lb/>
     early autonomy negotiations entered into 
     <lb/>
     with the Ottawa government, it was es<lb break="no"/>sential that the people of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories should be united and not have party 
     <lb/>
     divisions in their local affairs, so that we 
     <lb/>
     might come down as one man, with the 
     <lb/>
     whole strength of a united people, in the 
     <lb/>
     presentation of our case to the government 
     <lb/>
     here. I think I am stating the thing fairly. 
     <lb/>
     But what has occurred in the last two 
     <lb/>
     years ? At the instigation of the hon. the 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition, the Conservatives 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories were called into conven<lb break="no"/>tion in April, 1903, at Moosejaw, for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of reorganizing for the next federal 
     <lb/>
     election. What was one of the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant actions taken by that convention ?

     <lb/>
     will have a good deal of trouble to success<lb break="no"/>fully deny it in the Territories. We had the

     matter of the capital advance. Mr. Haultain

     the capital advance—that on certain condi<lb break="no"/>tions he would be satisfied to have it. And

     on these conditions it was granted. Is that

     not true? It was granted on the very con<lb break="no"/>ditions that he himself had set out. I make 
     <lb/>
     the statement to my hon. friend from Qu'<lb break="no"/>Appelle Mr. Lake, that on the first day 
     <lb/>
     of the meeting of the succeeding legislature 
     <lb/>
     in the fall of 1903, he told a man in Regina 
     <lb/>
     that the capital advance was not going to

     be accepted. I make the further statement 
     <lb/>
     that Mr. Haultain did not disclose to his 
     <lb/>
     Liberal supporters in the legislature, until 
     <lb/>
     practically the closing week of the session 
     <lb/>
     the fact that the capital advance was not

     <lb/>give my hon. friend privately the name of 
     <lb/>the gentleman to whom he gave that in<lb break="no"/>formation on the first day of the sitting.

     <lb/>told by Mr. Haultain that he did not in<lb break="no"/>tend to accept the capital advance. And 
     <lb/>my hon. friend (Mr. Lake) knows perfectly 
     <lb/>well—1 know he knows—that over that 
     <lb/>capital advance matter the unity which had 
     <lb/>prevailed in the assembly was very nearly 
     <lb/>broken; and if it was not broken it was 
     <lb/>not because of any excessive desire on the 
     <lb/>part of these Conservatives, or on the part 
     <lb/>of my hon. friend, or on the part of Mr. 
     <lb/>Haultain, that means should be taken to 
     <lb/>preserve it. Any sacrifice that was made 
     <lb/>was made by the Liberals in the Assembly, 
     <lb/>and to preserve that unity in local affairs 
     <lb/>that was so important, the Northwest Lib<lb break="no"/>erals have for two years past been putting

     <lb/>But, for the purpose of preserving the unity 
     <lb/>that they considered essential for the pre<lb break="no"/>sentation of the autonomy matter to this

     <lb/>up with this kind of thing. But Mr.

     own opinion, section 23 in these Bills means 
     <lb/>
     absolutely nothing—or at all events very lit<lb break="no"/>tle. But I say that if section 23 is put in

     the Bill, then it is fair, it is right, it is 
     <lb/>
     imperative that further notice be put in 
     <lb/>
     the Bill that parliament intends, as the 
     <lb/>

     Bill, so that the provinces, the people of

     and this parliament should hold sacred the

     contracts made with the former government

     and parliament by any party or corporation. 
     <lb/>
     But, as I stated this afternoon—and I do 
     <lb/>
     not intend to repeat my remarks—I con<lb break="no"/>tend that if the government in 1881 had 
     <lb/>
     power to make this contract and to pass 
     <lb/>
     that law, there is no necessity for this sec<lb break="no"/>tion in the Act, for that law would apply, 
     <lb/>
     and it cannot be overridden by local legis<lb break="no"/>lation afterwards. On the other hand, if 
     <lb/>
     this law was ultra vires the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada in 1881, then this parliament is not 
     <lb/>
     called upon to confirm any portion of a con<lb break="no"/>tract that was ultra vires of parliament 
     <lb/>
     when it was made. There is a vast differ<lb break="no"/>ence between carrying out a contract made 
     <lb/>
     with a former parliament which contract 
     <lb/>
     was within the powers of that parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and carrying out a portion of a contract 
     <lb/>
     made that was not within the powers of 
     <lb/>
     parliament. If it was within the power 
     <lb/>
     of parliament to make it, then the rights of

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has covered 
     <lb/>
     a very wide range in his speech, including 
     <lb/>
     the convention in the Northwest Territories, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain's secrecy as to capital ad<lb break="no"/>vances, the conferences held between mem<lb break="no"/>bers from the Northwest Territories during 
     <lb/>
     the recent session, besides formulating a 
     <lb/>
     number of questions, which no one, him<lb break="no"/>self included, seemed able to answer, with 
     <lb/>
     regard to certain alleged opinions of the 
     <lb/>
     president of the Canadian Northern Rail<lb break="no"/>way. These questions seemed to be par<lb break="no"/>ticularly irrelevant to the matter we have 
     <lb/>
     been discussing this evening. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Scott) says this is a serious 
     <lb/>
     matter. It certainly is a serious matter, 
     <lb/>
     but he did not treat it in a serious way. 
     <lb/>
     It is a serious matter. But any one who 
     <lb/>
     looks over the volume of ' Hansard ' during 
     <lb/>
     the last four or five years and observes 
     <lb/>
     the gyrations the hon. gentleman has in<lb break="no"/>dulged in on this question can form a pretty 
     <lb/>
     good opinion as to how serious he is in 
     <lb/>
     taking up the time of the House in discuss<lb break="no"/>ing it at this stage. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Look at his motion as he defines it, a 
     <lb/>
     motion in respect of which he has taken up 
     <lb/>
     40 minutes of the time of this House. He 
     <lb/>
     says that section 23 means nothing, there<lb break="no"/>fore he takes 40 minutes to ask us to strike 
     <lb/>
     it out. If it means nothing then striking 
     <lb/>
     it out means nothing. That is the position of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman according to his own 
     <lb/>
     statement. That is his own definition of the 
     <lb/>
     position which he occupies in taking up the 
     <lb/>
     time of the House to-night. If it means 
     <lb/>
     anything at all it means that a right which 
     <lb/>
     has been made with the Crown, confirmed 
     <lb/>
     by the parliament of this country in 1881, 
     <lb/>
     may be taken away without compensation. 
     <lb/>
     If it has any meaning at all I would sup<lb break="no"/>pose it to mean that, or that it was an at<lb break="no"/>tempt to accomplish that result. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know what the hon. member for Kootenay 
     <lb/>
      (Mr. Galliher) means by discussing the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to whether it was within the com<lb break="no"/>petence of the government to make this 
     <lb/>
     agreement in 1881. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. If it was not within 
     <lb/>
     the competence of the government to make 
     <lb/>
     it we did not need this section, because that 
     <lb/>
     right will pass on to them notwithstanding 
     <lb/>
    

            <pb n="8875" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8875.jpg"/>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
          

     that they are formed into provinces ; and if 
     <lb/>
     it was not within the right of this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to make such an agreement, then I 
     <lb/>
     raised the question whether it was incum<lb break="no"/>bent upon us to carry out the contract. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It is not a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of their right to make a contract, it is 
     <lb/>
     a question of the effect of a contract when 
     <lb/>
     made, it is a question as to whether the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this country, by virtue of an 
     <lb/>
     Act of parliament passed in 1881, can make 
     <lb/>
     a contract which shall have effect in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories after they are created into pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I suppose that is what the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman means. I have already expressed 
     <lb/>
     my opinion with regard to that, but the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) does 
     <lb/>
     not seem to be able to understand it. I have 
     <lb/>
     expressed in committee the view which I 
     <lb/>
     entertain with regard to it. I say the con<lb break="no"/>tract is binding upon the Crown because it  
     <lb/>
     was ratified by parliament. The question of  
     <lb/>
     legislative jurisdiction respecting Dominion 
     <lb/>
     taxation remains in the parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada ; the jurisdiction over provincial taxa<lb break="no"/>tion goes to the provinces. But in both 
     <lb/>
     cases there is a contract to be observed, 
     <lb/>
     and neither in the one case or the other 
     <lb/>
     could the parliament or legislature properly 
     <lb/>
     interfere without compensation. That is 
     <lb/>
     the situation as I regard it. But how<lb break="no"/>ever that may be, the motion of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Assiniboia does not commend 
     <lb/>
     itself to my judgment because it does not 
     <lb/>
     accomplish what, after all, I presume, he 
     <lb/>
     wishes to accomplish. He referred to a pro<lb break="no"/>vision for expropriation which we proposed 
     <lb/>
     to introduce into the National Transcontin<lb break="no"/>ental contract. We were not doing what 
     <lb/>
     he is doing now, or what he did this after<lb break="no"/>noon. We prepared a clause providing for 
     <lb/>
     and authorizing expropriation and stating 
     <lb/>
     the terms of it. The hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     done nothing of the kind. If he had made 
     <lb/>
     any such motion as that with regard to sec<lb break="no"/>tion 23, or introduced it by an independent 
     <lb/>
     Bill, I could understand it : but his motion 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon was obviously meaningless for 
     <lb/>
     the reason I have stated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. It was open to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to help improve it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, there are 
     <lb/>
     some motions conceived and framed in such 
     <lb/>
     a form that no human agency could possibly 
     <lb/>
     improve them. The hon. gentleman has ap<lb break="no"/>parently accomplished that result in this 
     <lb/>
     case. If expropriation is desired, the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada can act in the future, and 
     <lb/>
     with all deference to my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice, I think the legislature of 
     <lb/>
     the province can act also in respect to ex<lb break="no"/>emption from provincial taxation. But nei<lb break="no"/>ther the motion which the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     proposed this afternoon nor the motion 
     <lb/>
     which he proposes now seems to me to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the matter in the way in which it 
     <lb/>
     should be dealt with. If his motion means 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8876</fw>
         

     nothing, because it strikes out something 
     <lb/>
     which means nothing, surely that does not 
     <lb/>
     improve the situation. If his motion means 
     <lb/>
     to disregard a contract into which the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this country entered in 1881, his 
     <lb/>motion means something, but it means some<lb break="no"/>thing with which I certainly cannot agree. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. In the hon. gentleman's 
     <lb/>
     opinion, does section 23 mean anything ? 
     <lb/>
     Does it change the situation ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It is a notice to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of this contract, it has at 
     <lb/>
     least that operation ; and it is proper that 
     <lb/>
     at least the provinces should be notified of 
     <lb/>
     a contract into which the Crown has enter<lb break="no"/>ed, and in respect of which the action of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown has been ratified by parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. Is there or is there not a 
     <lb/>
     possibility that by leaving out section 23 the 
     <lb/>provinces might be free to tax ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. That the provinces 
     <lb/>
     might be free to tax—I would not think that 
     <lb/>
     would improve the situation at all, because 
     <lb/>
     even if by inadvertence a provision of that 
     <lb/>
     kind were left out of the constitution and 
     <lb/>
     an attempt were made to expropriate with<lb break="no"/>out compensation that which was a vested 
     <lb/>
     right in either the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     or any other corporation, surely the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman knows that over and over again 
     <lb/>
     the executive of Canada has been called 
     <lb/>
     upon to disallow provincial legislation in 
     <lb/>
     cases of that kind. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. Would not the ques<lb break="no"/>tion whether that was a vested right or not, 
     <lb/>
     depend upon the question whether parlia<lb break="no"/>ment in 1881 had power to legislate beyond 
     <lb/>
     to the time when these Territories were 
     <lb/>
     formed into provinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada at that time was the only parliament 
     <lb/>
     that had power to enact this legislation. 
     <lb/>
     But it the hon. gentleman believes what he 
     <lb/>
     says he does to-night, does he not recognize 
     <lb/>
     that he has been voting against his con<lb break="no"/>scientious convictions on section 16 of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill ? If he does not recognize that, then it 
     <lb/>
     is useless for me to argue with him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. Argument of that kind 
     <lb/>
     is no answer to a legal question. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, it would seem 
     <lb/>
     to me to be very much an answer. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. Supposing even I was 
     <lb/>
     wrong, would that strengthen my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's argument ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, on clause 16, has taken the position 
     <lb/>
     that the parliament of Canada in 1875 could 
     <lb/>
     deal with a similar matter, and that there 
     <lb/>
     was an obligation on us in future for all 
     <lb/>
     time to be governed by that provision. He 
     <lb/>
     has distinctly taken that position, if he has 
     <lb/>
     taken any position at all. On the other hand 
     <lb/>
           

            <pb n="8877" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-07-05_Page_8877.jpg"/>

     where we have not any such shadowy or 
     <lb/>
     vague understanding as was relied upon for 
     <lb/>
     clause 16, but where there is a distinct, 
     <lb/>
     binding agreement made by the Crown at a 
     <lb/>
     time when these provinces were Territories, 
     <lb/>
     he denies that parliament has any right to 
     <lb/>
     legislate. He says that in the one case there 
     <lb/>
     is an absolute obligation in 1905 to continue 
     <lb/>
     legislation with regard to the schools, but 
     <lb/>
     there is not any obligation whatever to con<lb break="no"/>tinue the contract made with regard to this 
     <lb/>
     tax exemption. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. I have not argued that 
     <lb/>
     it was ultra vires of the parliament in 1881 
     <lb/>
     to make this law and to enter into this con<lb break="no"/>tract. But I say that if it was within their 
     <lb/>
     power to do so, that right goes on, and we 
     <lb/>
     can absolutely leave that alone and dis<lb break="no"/>pense with section 23 entirely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I am afraid that 
     <lb/>
     I cannot appreciate or even understand my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend's argument when he talks 
     <lb/>
     about this contract being ultra vires, a con<lb break="no"/>tract ratified by the parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     in 1881, when this parliament had the abso<lb break="no"/>lute right to deal with the Territories. I am 
     <lb/>
     not able to follow that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Galliher) means to say, I think, that 
     <lb/>
     in 1881 we had power, but when these 
     <lb/>
     Territories became provinces then that pow<lb break="no"/>er would be restricted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It is a suflicient 
     <lb/>
     answer to say that the legislation which we 
     <lb/>
     are passing in clause 23 cannot have a great<lb break="no"/>er operation than that which we passed in 
     <lb/>
     1881. It seems to me that if it is ultra vires 
     <lb/>
     in the one case it necessarily follows that it 
     <lb/>
     is ultra vires in the other case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. I think not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>.Well, that is my 
     <lb/>
     argument at all events. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. I think not for the rea<lb break="no"/>son that by the virtue of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act the provinces are entitled to 
     <lb/>
     absolute control in regard to taxation, but 
     <lb/>
     we are limiting that control of taxation by 
     <lb/>
     this section 23. At the time we are granting 
     <lb/>
     them powers as provinces we are limiting 
     <lb/>
     the power of taxation by section 23 which 
     <lb/>
     says that it shall be subject to the existing 
     <lb/>
     agreement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, I do not see 
     <lb/>
     the distinction of the hon. gentleman. Per<lb break="no"/>haps he can see it; I do not. It seems to 
     <lb/>
     me that the parliament of the Dominion in 
     <lb/>
     1881 had the absolute right to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     contract in respect to a railway running 
     <lb/>
     through the Territories which were subject 
     <lb/>
     absolutely to the legislative jurisdiction of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. That may be true.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     says that we have not the right to limit the

            </p>
   
            <p>

     all.

            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. I have not said that the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada had not the right to 
     <lb/>
     make the law in 1881. If they had the right 
     <lb/>
     to make that law the instant that these 
     <lb/>
     Territories became provinces that right 
     <lb/>
     passes without this section 23 of this Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Very good. Then, 
     <lb/>
     in that view section 23 is absolutely harm<lb break="no"/>less.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GALL2">Mr. GALLIHER</persName>. Not harmless, because 
     <lb/>
     I say that by section 23 we are going fur<lb break="no"/>ther now. We are forming these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories into provinces by this Act. We are 
     <lb/>
     giving them the right to exercise the power 
     <lb/>
     of taxation, but we are limiting that right 
     <lb/>
     by section 23. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Well, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman will have to be content with his own

     opinion. It seems to me to be absolutely 
     <lb/>
     clear that we had the right to make that 
     <lb/>
     contract in 1881. It became a contract bind<lb break="no"/>ing upon the Crown in the right of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Canada and that binds the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     and the provinces after the Territories have 
     <lb/>
     been created into provinces. On the very 
     <lb/>
     lowest position that can be taken it is proper 
     <lb/>
     to insert in his Bill a notice to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the contract so entered into by the Crown 
     <lb/>
     ratified by parliament at a time when parlia<lb break="no"/>ment had power so to legislate. I do not 
     <lb/>
     want to take up the time of the House, be<lb break="no"/>cause this is a matter between the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Western Assiniboia, the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice. 
     <lb/>
     1 am not responsible for section 23. I 
     <lb/>
     think it is right to give notice to these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but after all the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     is responsible for this measure as he is re<lb break="no"/>sponsible for a similar clause in the Bill in 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Hudson Bay Company. I 
     <lb/>
     have stated my view as to what should be 
     <lb/>
     done. The contract should be observed. 
     <lb/>
     There should be no expropriation without 
     <lb/>
     compensation. I think upon that we can all 
     <lb/>
     agree. It seems to me, as I have stated 
     <lb/>
     over and over again, that the right 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion to legislate and the 
     <lb/>
     right of the provinces to legislate within 
     <lb/>
     their respective spheres of jurisdiction con<lb break="no"/>tinue subject to the contract in both cases. 
     <lb/>
     I might, in conclusion, refer the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) to some 
     <lb/>
     language of his upon a motion in regard to 
     <lb/>
     this same tax exemption which was intro<lb break="no"/>duced in 1901. The hon. gentleman then 
     <lb/>
     said:

     It was a resolution declaring that in the 
     <lb/>
     opinion of parliament the tax exemption of 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway should extend 
     <lb/>
     only to a period of 20 years. The hon. mem

     I would say to my hon. friend that I do 
     <lb/>
     not see any good whatever in either of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions which he has moved to-day. I 
     <lb/>
     refer him to his word which I have 
     <lb/>
     quoted. If I was a little warm in any of 
     <lb/>
     my expressions this afternoon I trust he 
     <lb/>
     will understand that I did not intend to be 
     <lb/>
     offensive to him in any way. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     either of his resolutions has the merit of 
     <lb/>
     being practical. As far as this one is con<lb break="no"/>cerned I shall vote against it with the same 
     <lb/>
     goodwill as I voted against the one he 
     <lb/>
     moved this afternoon.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TAYL1">Mr. TAYLOR</persName>. Mr. Speaker, the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion intended to assist the government in 
     <lb/>
     every way they could in passing these two 
     <lb/>
     Bills before the early hours of the morning. 
     <lb/>
     But the hon. member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia occupied an hour and twenty minutes 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon and 40 minutes more to-night 
     <lb/>
     with speeches and with resolutions similar 
     <lb/>
     to one moved by my hon. friend from South 
     <lb/>
     York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) a few years ago 
     <lb/>
     on this very same question which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman (Mr. Scott) then characterized as 
     <lb/>
     a buncombe resolution. But I only intend 
     <lb/>
     to deal with one of the many reckless state<lb break="no"/>ments that he made this afternoon. He 
     <lb/>
     made the statement that the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     had always been in favour of building the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway through the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. Does he know the history of 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party in regard to the building 
     <lb/>
     of that railway that created that country 
     <lb/>
     and made something of it? A contract was 
     <lb/>
     made by the Conservative government pre<lb break="no"/>vious to 1873 to build that railway, but by 
     <lb/>
     the opposition then offered in the House, the 
     <lb/>
     government of the late lamented Sir John 
     <lb/>
     A. Macdonald were driven from power on 
     <lb/>
     account of having entered into that con<lb break="no"/>tract. The Liberals came into office. Did 
     <lb/>
     they make a contract to build that railway 
     <lb/>
     or did they attempt to build that railway? 
     <lb/>
     They attempted to use the water stretches 
     <lb/>
     and to connect Port Arthur with Winnipeg 
     <lb/>
     by a part water and part rail route. They 
     <lb/>
     built the Fort Francis lock, squandered a 
     <lb/>
     lot of money, but did not do anything to<lb break="no"/>wards the building of the railway. Then 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party came in again; they 
     <lb/>
     entered into negotiations, and in 1881 this 
     <lb/>
     contract was made. The Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">8880</fw>
         

     Railway, under the contract, spent millions 
     <lb/>
     and millions of money in attempting to 
     <lb/>
     construct the railway in that country. When 
     <lb/>
     they had spent the last dollar they had and 
     <lb/>
     when they had exhausted the last dollar of 
     <lb/>
     credit they could obtain owing to the op<lb break="no"/>position of the Liberal party and of the 
     <lb/>
     Grand Trunk Railway Company, they came 
     <lb/>
     down to this parliament and asked for a 
     <lb/>
     loan of $30,000,000 to save them from going 
     <lb/>
     into bankruptcy. If they had gone into 
     <lb/>
     bankruptcy, what would be the position of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories to-day? The gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of that day said: We will assist 
     <lb/>
     you, we will grant you a loan of $30,000,000 
     <lb/>
     and take ample security. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Western Assiniboia to-day quoted the 
     <lb/>
     words of Mr. Blake, Mr. Ross and Sir Richard 
     <lb/>
     Cartwright. What did these gentlemen say? 
     <lb/>
     They said that if this railway were ever 
     <lb/>
     built it would not earn enough to pay for 
     <lb/>
     the axle grease, and every Liberal in the 
     <lb/>
     House at that time—and there are a few of 
     <lb/>
     them left, as there are only a few on this 
     <lb/>
     side of the House who supported that mea<lb break="no"/>sure—opposed the granting of this assist<lb break="no"/>ance. The supporters of the government of 
     <lb/>
     that day stood up and voted in favour of 
     <lb/>
     loaning the Canadian Pacific Railway $30,<lb break="no"/>000,000, because, notwithstanding the fact 
     <lb/>
     that under the contract they had the lands 
     <lb/>
     and they had the exemption from taxation 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend is now complaining 
     <lb/>
     about, they could not raise a dollar to go 
     <lb/>
     on and complete the road. Yet, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman makes the reckless statement that 
     <lb/>
     the Liberal party were always in favour of 
     <lb/>
     building this road. A few Conservatives 
     <lb/>
     who are here now were in the House then 
     <lb/>
     and they stood up and voted to loan the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway $30,000,000. The 
     <lb/>
     measure was carried notwithstanding the 
     <lb/>
     opposition of every Liberal in the House at 
     <lb/>
     that time, and there are only a few of them 
     <lb/>
     left. We loaned them $30,000,000: the road 
     <lb/>
     was completed; the company paid back the 
     <lb/>
     $30,000,000, and yet the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia will say that the Liberal 
     <lb/>
     party were always in favour of building the 
     <lb/>
     road. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:COCH1">Mr. COCHRANE</persName>. Did he say that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TAYL1">Mr. TAYLOR</persName>. He did say it this after<lb break="no"/>noon. He had the assumption to make a 
     <lb/>
     statement of that kind. There are many of 
     <lb/>
     us in the House to—day who know that the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. G. W. Ross, when the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man quoted against the Canadian Pacific 
     <lb/>
     Railway, was man enough to get up and 
     <lb/>
     say in recent years that he had opposed 
     <lb/>
     the Canadian Pacific Railway at every 
     <lb/>
     stage, but he regretted he had ever done so, 
     <lb/>
     and he withdrew every statement he ever 
     <lb/>
     made against it. It is not so with the 
     <lb/>
     other Liberals who opposed the construction 
     <lb/>
     of the Canadian Pacific Railway and who 
     <lb/>
     now try to get credit for building it and 
     <lb/>
     making that western country what it is. 
     <lb/>
     Why, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) would 
     <lb/>
     have no country were it not for the policy 
     <lb/>

     of the Conservative party in these days. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, it is evident that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite do not want to transact 
     <lb/>
     public business when one of them occupies 
     <lb/>
     two hours time talking about nothing. The 
     <lb/>
     opposition here were anxious to facilitate 
     <lb/>
     the despatch of business, but these gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite seem to want delay and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore move that the House adjourn so 
     <lb/>
     that we may get out of this heated atmos<lb break="no"/>phere.
