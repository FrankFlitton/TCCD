<!-- GL, 2018-04-11, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
 <!--<p>
     35 representatives; 14 of these come from 
     <lb/>
     Alberta and of these Alberta constituencies 
     <lb/>
     only three, and but a small portion of these 
     <lb/>
     three, run north of Edmonton, while 11 are 
     <lb/>
     south of Edmonton. I must ask the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister to again look at the map if the 
     <lb/>
     convenience of the people is being consulted. 
     <lb/>
     But, in conclusion, let me say that I desire 
     <lb/>
     to congratulate the government for being 
     <lb/>
     original for once, because surely if the con<lb break="no"/>venience of the people had been consulted 
     <lb/>
     in the choice of a site for the capital it 
     <lb/>
     would have been placed at the centre of 
     <lb/>
     population and trade. The  government's 
     <lb/>
     manner of selecting a central point is an 
     <lb/>
     original one. The method adopted in this 
     <lb/>
     case would not have led the people of On<lb break="no"/>tario to select Toronto instead of Whitefish 
     <lb/>
     or some other point on Lake Superior, the 
     <lb/>
     people of Quebec to select Quebec, the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Manitoba to select Winnipeg, or the 
     <lb/>
     people of British Columbia to select Vic<lb break="no"/>toria on Vancouver Island. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is but one other question on which 
     <lb/>
     I wish to touch, that is the financial terms. 
     <lb/>
     I am glad in that to be able to agree with 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver). 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me that in discussing these terms 
     <lb/>
     it is not fair to make comparisons with the 
     <lb/>
     terms of eastern provinces. The conditions 
     <lb/>
     are altogether different. In the west school 
     <lb/>
     houses and roads have to be provided, mat<lb break="no"/>ters which are done in Ontario and Quebec 
     <lb/>
     by local taxation which it is practically 
     <lb/>
     impossible to do in that country by reason 
     <lb/>
     of the great distances. The financial terms 
     <lb/>
     in comparison with those granted to the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces are none too generous, and 
     <lb/>
     the development of that country is proceed<lb break="no"/>ing at such a rate that it is impossible for 
     <lb/>
     us to sit here and calculate what its future 
     <lb/>
     needs will be.

     <persName ref="pers:GERV1">Mr. H. GERVAIS</persName> (Montreal, St. James)

     moved for leave to introduce Bill (No. 128) 
     <lb/>
     to amend the Canada Temperance Act. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Explain.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GERV1">Mr. GERVAIS</persName>. Mr. Speaker, the object 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill is very simple. As every one 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3360</fw>
        

     knows, in the Criminal Code of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     1892, it is provided that there shall be an 
     <lb/>
     appeal from any judgment or any verdict 
     <lb/>
     given by any court of criminal jurisdiction, 
     <lb/>
     whether this court has an inferior or a 
     <lb/>
     superior jurisdiction in criminal matters. 
     <lb/>
     If hon. gentlemen will look up articles 742, 
     <lb/>
     743 and 782, they will see that there is an 
     <lb/>
     appeal from any verdict or judgment given 
     <lb/>
     by a court having superior jurisdiction in 
     <lb/>
     criminal matters. There is an appeal in 
     <lb/>
     cases of jury trial, summary trial and 
     <lb/>
     speedy trial, whether the case is proceeded 
     <lb/>
     with under articles 742, 743 or 782, or under 
     <lb/>
     articles 659, 765, 782, 783 or 842 of the Crimi<lb break="no"/>nal Code. Then, in cases of summary con<lb break="no"/>viction, under article 879, there is an ap<lb break="no"/>peal under certain conditions and in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with certain formalities. All the liti<lb break="no"/>gants who have had anything to do with 
     <lb/>
     the application of the Canada Temperance 
     <lb/>
     Act have been complaining about the denial 
     <lb/>
     of an appeal. This feature of the law is 
     <lb/>
     enacted in section 119 of chapter 106 of the 
     <lb/>
     Revised Statutes of Canada as amended by 
     <lb/>
     the Act 51 Victoria, chapter 34. We 
     <lb/>
     think, and everybody thinks, that it is most 
     <lb/>
     unfair and unjust that the right of appeal 
     <lb/>
     which is given under the criminal law in 
     <lb/>
     any case should have been denied under 
     <lb/>
     section 119 of the Canada Temperance Act. 
     <lb/>
     Even in a case of summary conviction, in 
     <lb/>
     which the accused is condemned to pay a 
     <lb/>
     fine of $5 or go to jail for one day, he has 
     <lb/>
     the right of appeal, while, on the contrary, 
     <lb/>
     under section 119 he has no such right of 
     <lb/>
     appeal in most cases, though he may have 
     <lb/>
     been fined heavily or condemned to a long 
     <lb/>
     imprisonment. We desire this amendment 
     <lb/>
     so that the law giving the right of appeal 
     <lb/>
     in ordinary cases shall be made applicable 
     <lb/>
     to the Canada Temperance Act. Moreover, 
     <lb/>
     by this amendment, we wish that no liti<lb break="no"/>gant having to appear either before a 
     <lb/>
     criminal court or a civil court, be denied 
     <lb/>
     that useful remedy, the British writ of 
     <lb/>
     ' certiorari.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to, and Bill read the first 
     <lb/>
     time.

     PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT IN THE

     House resumed adjourned debate on the 
     <lb/>
    proposed motion of Sir Wilfrid Laurier for 
     <lb/>the second reading of Bill (No. 69), to estab<lb break="no"/>lish and provide for the government of the 
     <lb/>province of Alberta, and the amendment 
     <lb/>of Mr. R. L. Borden thereto. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Hon. GEORGE E. FOSTER</persName> (North To<lb break="no"/>ronto). Mr. Speaker, the proposition which 
     <lb/>
     is at present under the consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     House, and the discussion which has so far 
     <lb/>
     ensued upon it, have not lacked for variety 
     <lb/>
     and dramatic incident. No legislation in<lb break="no"/>troduced into this parliament in my time 
     <lb/>
     has been more prolific of change and of the 
     <lb/>
     unexpected. Changes in principle and in 
     <lb/>
     policy and in modes of thought may be 
     <lb/>
     discerned comparing the present with the 
     <lb/>
     past. Time was when gentlemen who with<lb break="no"/>in a few years made an entire change of 
     <lb/>
     front in regard to their method of thinking 
     <lb/>
     and acting upon any given subject, thought 
     <lb/>
     it was at least worth while and in a certain 
     <lb/>
     measure necessary that they should endeav<lb break="no"/>our to satisfy the desire of the House and 
     <lb/>
     of the country for reasonable explanation. 
     <lb/>
     In those days consistency was somewhat 
     <lb/>
     prized, but in the later days of the new 
     <lb/>
     Liberalism cabinet ministers have grown 
     <lb/>
     too practical for that consideration and do 
     <lb/>
     not even deign to give an explanation for 
     <lb/>
     a complete and entire change of front 
     <lb/>
     brought about within the space of a very 
     <lb/>
     few years. A time there was when prin<lb break="no"/>ciple was considered as something some<lb break="no"/>what precious and not to be repudiated ; 
     <lb/>
     a time there was when responsibility 
     <lb/>
     attached to principle was considered 
     <lb/>
     to be of weight and importance. But, this 
     <lb/>
     new Liberalism which is confronting us, 
     <lb/>
     seems, when it starts for parliament, to put 
     <lb/>
     into its valise every other thing necessary 
     <lb/>
     or utilizable, and the last thing thought of 
     <lb/>
     is principle. Party fealty and party at<lb break="no"/>tachments are carefully stowed therein, 
     <lb/>
     and these gentlemen think that these fill the 
     <lb/>
     bill—or at all events fill the valise. There 
     <lb/>
     was a time when the constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     country had something stable and sacred 
     <lb/>
     about it. The fathers of confederation who 
     <lb/>
     met in Quebec and modelled our consti<lb break="no"/>tution, the palladium of the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces and the Dominion alike ; they 
     <lb/>
     believed the constitution to be an important, 
     <lb/>
     a stable and sacred thing. But to-day the 
     <lb/>
     constitution is thrown idly aside, relegated 
     <lb/>
     to the garret of the archives, and min<lb break="no"/>isters are too practical to think of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution stopping them when 
     <lb/>
     they want to carry out their desires. 
     <lb/>
     And, although the Prime Minister had 
     <lb/>
     courage, and old-fashioned thought and 
     <lb/>
     method enough to bring it out and lift it 
     <lb/>
     to something of its old-time importance, the 
     <lb/>
     ministers who spoke after him kicked 
     <lb/>
     it as a football from floor to ceiling, 
     <lb/>
     and where we are to-day we scarcely know. 
     <lb/>

     Changes of principles once cherished are 
     <lb/>
     apparent to the most casual observer, but 
     <lb/>
     they are treated with so delightful a careless<lb break="no"/>ness as to consistency and consequence, 
     <lb/>
     that it makes it interesting to the mere spec<lb break="no"/>tator, even though it is somewhat painful 
     <lb/>
     to the man of thought. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let us take into consideration for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment the circumstances which have pre<lb break="no"/>ceded and up to this time have accompanied 
     <lb/>
     the introduction and discussion of this mat<lb break="no"/>ter in the House. Weighing these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, would not the unimpassioned spec<lb break="no"/>tator come to the hypothesis that some time 
     <lb/>
     ago the Prime Minister of Canada, smarting 
     <lb/>
     under events which took place in 1896 and 
     <lb/>
     since, had determined that with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the great Northwest the situation should 
     <lb/>
     be retrieved from a certain point of view, 
     <lb/>
     and that in the constitution which should 
     <lb/>
     be given to the new provinces the principle 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools should be embodied, cost 
     <lb/>
     what it might. Would that be a violent 
     <lb/>
     hypothesis ? Let us see how the circum<lb break="no"/>stances fit in with it. For two, or three, or 
     <lb/>
     four years previous to the election of 1904 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest, in this parliament, and to 
     <lb/>
     a certain extent in the whole Dom<lb break="no"/>inion, the question of autonomy for 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories was to the 
     <lb/>
     front. It was particularly to the front in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories; in 1901 a draft 
     <lb/>
     Bill was prepared and resolutions which 
     <lb/>
     met with the approval of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Legislature were adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Negotiations were undertaken ; the matter 
     <lb/>
     was pressed ; the matter was considered, as 
     <lb/>
     we know from the speech made here by the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior, and considered 
     <lb/>
     often, and to a certain extent carefully and 
     <lb/>
     on all sides. But the Prime Minister had 
     <lb/>
     determined that to that creative body whose 
     <lb/>
     duty it should be to give substance to the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the new provinces, no possible 
     <lb/>
     mandate should be given by the electorate 
     <lb/>
     of this country before they came to this 
     <lb/>
     parliament and were asked to consummate 
     <lb/>
     the creative Act. That is important to be 
     <lb/>
     remembered. The Prime Minister himself 
     <lb/>
     refused to undertake the erection of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces two years ago, although there cannot 
     <lb/>
     be any sufficient reason given as to why, if 
     <lb/>
     the Territories to-day are equal to the 
     <lb/>
     work and the duties that follow therefrom, 
     <lb/>
     they were not ready to an almost equal de<lb break="no"/>gree to be constituted two years ago, or one 
     <lb/>
     year previous to the elections of 1904. But 
     <lb/>
     it did not suit the purposes of the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister to undertake the erection of those 
     <lb/>
     provinces before the general election. Little 
     <lb/>
     less did it suit him to have the subject 
     <lb/>
     mooted during the time of the election of the 
     <lb/>
     responsible and representative body which 
     <lb/>
     was to be asked to consummate the Act of 
     <lb/>
     creation of the provinces. And so the word 
     <lb/>
     went forth. His own minister of the Inter<lb break="no"/>ior, long a resident of the country, one of the 
     <lb/>
     most prominent if not the most prominent 
     <lb/>
     men from that district, one who prob<lb break="no"/>

     ably knew more about the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     and the history of that country than any 
     <lb/>
     other man he had in his cabinet, and prob<lb break="no"/>ably than any other man in this country, 
     <lb/>
     went to the Northwest, if not under seal 
     <lb/>
     and pledge not to open his mouth with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the conditions of the creation of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces into an autonomy, yet cer<lb break="no"/>tainly practically carrying out such instruc<lb break="no"/>tions by absolutely refusing to be led into 
     <lb/>
     the utterance of a single word which would 
     <lb/>
     go to show the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     under what probable or possible conditions 
     <lb/>
     autonomy should be given. But it cannot 
     <lb/>
     be said that the question was not mooted. 
     <lb/>
     The premier of that country, speaking in 
     <lb/>
     Regina one week before the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior spoke there, challenged an expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion from the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior ; left a certain number of questions 
     <lb/>
     to be answered, if the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior would have the goodness to answer 
     <lb/>
     them, as to the information to be given to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest just then, when 
     <lb/>
     they were about to elect representatives who 
     <lb/>
     would be called upon to consummate the 
     <lb/>
     Act of formation into provinces, as to the 
     <lb/>
     conditions, with reference to territorial di<lb break="no"/>vision, lands, education and finances, under 
     <lb/>
     which the new provinces would be brought 
     <lb/>
     in. Was it not a subject which might well 
     <lb/>
     have engaged the attention of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior ? Were those points of in<lb break="no"/>formation which it would not have been 
     <lb/>
     right and proper for the minister to discuss 
     <lb/>
     before the people whose interests were 
     <lb/>
     chiefly to be affected ? But the min<lb break="no"/>ister's only reply was : You must trust the 
     <lb/>
     government ; and to the gentleman who put 
     <lb/>
     the question his only reply was, you are a 
     <lb/>
     mischief-maker, that is what you are. The 
     <lb/>
     question was also put to the candidates 
     <lb/>
     who were running in the Northwest. They 
     <lb/>
     were challenged. They had one reply- 
     <lb/>
     the reply of the drilled and the taught : 
     <lb/>
     You ask us what the probable conditions 
     <lb/>
     will be ; we trust the government ; we have 
     <lb/>
     faith in the government. The cry of the 
     <lb/>
     minister was : Trust the govermnent ; 
     <lb/>
     and the declaration of the candidates 
     <lb/>
     was : We have faith in the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. But from neither minister nor 
     <lb/>
     candidate was there a single intimation as 
     <lb/>
     to what would be the probable conditions. 
     <lb/>
     So much with reference to that. Carrying 
     <lb/>
     out my hypothesis, when the elections were 
     <lb/>
     over and the first of the probable five years 
     <lb/>
     of the government's term commenced, with 
     <lb/>
     those incidental advantages which every one 
     <lb/>
     knows quite well, immediately negotiations 
     <lb/>
     were taken up, immediately the government 
     <lb/>
     set to work, immediately the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     candidates who were elected were called 
     <lb/>
     into council, immediately the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the government of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were called to Ottawa. Negotiations 
     <lb/>
     were undertaken, conferences took place, 
     <lb/>
     and in the course of a few weeks or a few 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3366</fw>
   

     months parliament was called together and 
     <lb/>
     the Bill was introduced. The creative in<lb break="no"/>strument was formed, and it was presented 
     <lb/>
     to parliament. That creative instrument, 
     <lb/>
     as it was brought down on the 21st of 
     <lb/>
     February, was accompanied by a certificate 
     <lb/>
     of parentage given to it by the premier. He 
     <lb/>
     himself as premier, his united government, 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of the Northwest, on that 
     <lb/>
     side of the House at least, whose advice he 
     <lb/>
     had the advantage of, and the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the government of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories, all had had their part in consul<lb break="no"/>tation or information ; and this child was  
     <lb/>
     brought forward with the certificate of par<lb break="no"/>entage of a strong and united government, 
     <lb/>
     having had full consultation with the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the Territories to be affected. 
     <lb/>
     Shortly after that was brought down, some<lb break="no"/>thing occurred. A trouble arose, disruption 
     <lb/>
     took place, and within a few days one of the 
     <lb/>
     most considerable ministers of the cabinet 
     <lb/>
     handed in his resignation, and gave as his 
     <lb/>
     reason that he had not been consulted with 
     <lb/>
     reference to the educational clause, that he 
     <lb/>
     dissented from it on the record of his life, 
     <lb/>
     and on account of the principles so often 
     <lb/>
     and so loudly professed, and that on that 
     <lb/>
     account he could not remain longer a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the government. We immediately 
     <lb/>
     asked explanations and we soon found out 
     <lb/>
     that another minister of the government,— 
     <lb/>
     if not the most important at least one of the 
     <lb/>
     most important—had not been consulted 
     <lb/>
     upon the measure. Absent from the city 
     <lb/>
     and absent from the country, he had not 
     <lb/>
     been allowed an opportunity—why such 
     <lb/>
     haste ?—of reading the clause of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     before it was brought down to this House. 
     <lb/>
     There were then two facts of importance. 
     <lb/>
     There was the fact that the government, as 
     <lb/>
     a united body had not formed that measure 
     <lb/>
     and there was the additional fact that there 
     <lb/>
     was displayed a haste almost undignified to 
     <lb/>
     get the Bill before the House and the 
     <lb/>
     country before those two important mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the cabinet should have an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of being present in Council and ex<lb break="no"/>pressing their views. What was still more 
     <lb/>
     remarkable was this, that on the most 
     <lb/>
     important clauses of the Bill, two mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the cabinet, who had been the strong<lb break="no"/>est in their opposition to the principles em<lb break="no"/>bodied in that clause, were the very two 
     <lb/>
     members in whose temporary absence the 
     <lb/>
     Bill had been passed by the Council and 
     <lb/>
     submitted to parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Other facts came out. It became known 
     <lb/>
     in the course of time that if the members 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest supporting the govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been consulted and if they had 
     <lb/>
     been aware of the import of the clauses in 
     <lb/>
     question, they had not been careful enough 
     <lb/>
     or had been too indifferent to make their 
     <lb/>
     opinion felt. These hon. gentlemen, every 
     <lb/>
    one of them. so far as I know, 
     <lb/>expressed his dissent immediately after 
     <lb/>the Bill was brought down and the 
     <lb/>
    

            <pb n="3367" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-29_Page_3367.jpg"/>

     Minister of the Interior had returned, 
     <lb/>
     and went into, if not open yet secret 
     <lb/>
     revolt. Something else came out. It came 
     <lb/>
     out that the representatives of the only 
     <lb/>
     government which the Territories have— 
     <lb/>
     there are three members in that govern<lb break="no"/>ment—based on the agitation of the subject 
     <lb/>
     in their country and their legislature, based 
     <lb/>
     on a draft Bill which they themselves had 
     <lb/>
     drawn. based on a desire and agitation for 
     <lb/>
     autonomy—it came out that two of the 
     <lb/>
     three, backed and supported by the third 
     <lb/>
     member of the government, came down to 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa, as the authorized negotiators on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of the Territories, to confer with the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government. Was it not to be 
     <lb/>
     expected that these properly authenticated 
     <lb/>
     representatives of the legislature of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories and the people of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     would have been given an opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     say something in a matter which meant 
     <lb/>
     everything to their people, which meant 
     <lb/>
     everything to the country which they gov<lb break="no"/>erned, and governed under large representa<lb break="no"/>tive institutions ? Was it an unheard of 
     <lb/>
     thing or was it too bold a thing to ask that 
     <lb/>
     these representatives should have been loy<lb break="no"/>ally met and conferred with ? Yet what 
     <lb/>
     came out ? It came out that with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the most important clause of the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     the only clause which to-day, you may say, 
     <lb/>
     is claiming the attention of this House and 
     <lb/>
     the country—the representatives of that gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were casually informed about it 
     <lb/>
     on a Friday and were given an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     to confer and discuss just exactly three 
     <lb/>
     hours before that Bill with that clause was 
     <lb/>
     submitted to parliament. What reason was 
     <lb/>
     there that in the case of a territory con<lb break="no"/>taining half a million people, with immense 
     <lb/>
     interests at stake, represented by its own 
     <lb/>
     government, the choice of its own legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, the legislators in which were the 
     <lb/>
     choice of the constituents of that same 
     <lb/>
     broad territory—what reason was there that 
     <lb/>
     the representatives of these Territories 
     <lb/>
     should not have had some kind of determin<lb break="no"/>ing voice in what was to be their constitu<lb break="no"/>tion ? Was it not to be expected that they 
     <lb/>
     should at least have had the courtesy of 
     <lb/>
     constant and frequent and loyal and thor<lb break="no"/>ough conference ? Was there any reason 
     <lb/>
     why the First Minister, who in previous 
     <lb/>
     times has been always foremost and loud 
     <lb/>
     in his assertion of the rights and duties 
     <lb/>
     of provinces in these compacts that are 
     <lb/>
     made and are merged into a constitution, 
     <lb/>
     should have treated them so cavalierly as 
     <lb/>
     to have mentioned the subject on a certain 
     <lb/>
     Friday, and only within three hours before 
     <lb/>
     the Bill was introduced into parliament sent 
     <lb/>
     a sub-committee to talk over the matter with 
     <lb/>
     these representatives. Two excuses have 
     <lb/>
     been made, both by members of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The first was made by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Finance Minister (Mr. Fielding). 
     <lb/>
     What was it ? Oh, said he, Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     is only the premier of that province, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bulyea is a member of his government, 
     <lb/>
<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3368</fw>
     Mr. Bulyea has expressed his satisfaction 
     <lb/>
     with these clauses, and Mr. Haultain only 
     <lb/>
     represents his own opinion. Did I say a 
     <lb/>
     while ago that there used to be such a thing 
     <lb/>
     as a fair deference for constitutional me<lb break="no"/>thods ? That evidently does not exist in 
     <lb/>
     the mind of the Finance Minister to-day. 
     <lb/>
     That hon. gentleman thinks that when the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of a local government are 
     <lb/>
     accredited to carry on negotiations with 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government, and when one 
     <lb/>
     of these representatives is the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister of that local government and the other 
     <lb/>
     a member of its cabinet, if the one who is 
     <lb/>
     a sub-member, so to speak, signifies his ad<lb break="no"/>hesion to the measure, the other who is the 
     <lb/>
     First Minister, does not count. It is the 
     <lb/>
     tail that swings the body according to the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Minister. I wonder why the tail 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest, in the person of the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior, did not swing the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister ? But another member of 
     <lb/>
     the government had a still more ingenious 
     <lb/>
     excuse. He said that Mr. Haultain was a 
     <lb/>
     very estimable gentleman but only a Tory 
     <lb/>
     gentleman and it was his duty and purpose 
     <lb/>
     to oppose this government. Delightful con<lb break="no"/>stitutional doctrine, that is, especially com<lb break="no"/>ing from an almost member of the cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     the Solicitor General. If Mr. Bulyea has sig<lb break="no"/>nified—and I do not know that he has— 
     <lb/>
     his assent to that clause, it seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     the First Minister of the Territories is still 
     <lb/>
     left as a man to be accounted with and 
     <lb/>
     negotiated with. Is it true or is it not that 
     <lb/>
     during the course of these negotiations- 
     <lb/>
     if you can call them such—which took place 
     <lb/>
     before the 21st February, the First Minister 
     <lb/>
     had frequent conferences with Mr. Bulyea 
     <lb/>
     when Mr. Haultain was absent, and un<lb break="no"/>known to Mr. Haultain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Is it true that the Liberal members from 
     <lb/>the Northwest collogued with Mr. Bul<lb break="mo"/>yea and the Prime Minister unknown to 
     <lb/>Mr. Haultain and without any invitation to 
     <lb/>Mr. Haultain to be present ? That can 
     <lb/>be answered ; it is either true or not true. 
     <lb/>But, if it is not answered, and therefore 
     <lb/>we take it to be true, it is another odd il<lb break="no"/>lustration of the strange metamorphosis 
     <lb/>that has taken place in our constitutional 
     <lb/>methods. These things are a part of what 
     <lb/>has occurred. But something more strange 
     <lb/>and startling and dramatic even than all 
     <lb/>this has occurred. The Minister of the 
     <lb/>Interior (Mr. Sifton) stood in his place in 
     <lb/>this House and said that he had resigned 
     <lb/>because clause 16, introduced without his 
     <lb/>knowledge and without his consent, was in 
     <lb/>contravention of his principles and of his 
     <lb/>life-long political record, and consequently 
     <lb/>he had nothing to do but to resign from 
     <lb/>the cabinet. And, after three weeks of 
     <lb/>fightings within and rumours without, of 
     <lb/>multitudinous midnight parleys and count<lb break="no"/>less journeys by noonday, the Minister 
     <lb/>of the Interior came down and told 
     <lb/>us that at last he had been able to put 
     <lb/>the ring into the nose of the government 
     <lb/>

     and bring it to its knees. He had lassoed 
     <lb/>
     a wild steer of the prairies and brought 
     <lb/>
     it up to the ring-bolt. Now, a strange, 
     <lb/>
     a luminous, in some respects a lurid, light 
     <lb/>
     is thrown upon this whole transaction by 
     <lb/>
     this speech of the Minister of the Interior.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. We do not know. This 
     <lb/>
     may be the last day he will be out. What 
     <lb/>
     did the Minister of the Interior say ? He 
     <lb/>
    stated that he had dissented from clause 16 
     <lb/>because he was opposed to the principle of 
     <lb/>it. And what did the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>Interior (Mr. Sifton) say the other day ? 
     <lb/>He said that the moment he read that 
     <lb/>clause, he went to the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>discussed the matter with him and laid 
     <lb/>before him his objections to it. Did the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister meet him in any way ? We 
     <lb/>only know that the result of that confer<lb break="no"/>ence was that Mr. Sifton, the Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior, resigned because he could not 
     <lb/>accept clause 16. And, now, a strange 
     <lb/>thing happens, and one most difficult to re<lb break="no"/>concile with all that has gone before. The 
     <lb/>Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) him<lb break="no"/>self, in his place in parliament, declared : 
     <lb/>I never intended that in that legislation any 
     <lb/>more should be granted than is at present 
     <lb/>enjoyed under the ordinances of the North<lb break="no"/>west. And the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
     <lb/>Fitzpatrick) from his place in this House 
     <lb/>declared that it was never the intention of 
     <lb/>the government that anything more should 
     <lb/>be put into the constitution of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces than absolutely what was enjoyed 
     <lb/>under the ordinances I have spoken of. Now, 
     <lb/>it is to be presumed—at least, it ought to 
     <lb/>be presumable-that when the Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior, an intelligent man, went to the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister, another intelligent man and, 
     <lb/>as we suppose, told him that because of his 
     <lb/> reading of clause 16 he was obliged to dis<lb break="no"/>sent and leave the cabinet, it ought to be 
     <lb/>presumable in that case that the other in<lb break="no"/>telligent man the Prime Minister must have 
     <lb/>said to him : Mr. Sifton, I never meant 
     <lb/>what you read in that clause ; all that I 
     <lb/>meant, or mean to-day, is that the North<lb break="no"/>west shall enjoy, as to separate schools, 
     <lb/>only the privileges that it has at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time. Did that conversation take place? 
     <lb/>The moment it did, Mr. Sifton, and the 
     <lb/>Prime Minister were at one, and there 
     <lb/>was no cause for resignation. Did that 
     <lb/>conversation not take place, at least so 
     <lb/>far as the Prime Minister is concerned ? 
     <lb/>Then, if the Prime Minister's statement, 
     <lb/>made in this House, is correct and he never 
     <lb/>intended anything but what is in the pre<lb break="no"/>sent ordinances, it was clearly his duty to 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3370</fw>
         

     state that fact to his Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior and so make the resignation of that 
     <lb/>
     minister unnecessary. But the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter does not appear, so far as the records 
     <lb/>
     show, to have done either the one thing 
     <lb/>
     or the other—or else there is a mystery, a 
     <lb/>
     most mysterious mystery, as to why the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior resigned. Was it 
     <lb/>
     on the cards that he should resign anyway ? 
     <lb/>
     And was this misunderstanding allowed to 
     <lb/>
     continue in order to give him a chance to re<lb break="no"/>sign? For, what happens at the end of 
     <lb/>
     three weeks time ? The clause is brought 
     <lb/>
     down exactly to the liking of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior. If the Prime Minister did 
     <lb/>
     not wish to get rid of his Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, why did not he agree with him 
     <lb/>
     in the way and before the breaking out 
     <lb/>
     took place. Can there be any explanation 
     <lb/>
     of that mystery? I leave it to hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side of the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But, Sir, something else happens. The 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), the 
     <lb/>
     other day, gave us the reason why it was 
     <lb/>
     impossible for him to agree to clause 16. I 
     <lb/>
     am not going to make a scrap-book of myself 
     <lb/>
     in these remarks, because it is not plea<lb break="no"/>sant to the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier) to hear scrap-book quotations. 
     <lb/>
     But let me give, in effect, the reason why 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior could not as<lb break="no"/>sent to clause 16, as that reason was given 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) himself. 
     <lb/>
     He said, in the first place, that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister had been very ill-advised to bring 
     <lb/>
     down that clause without giving him a 
     <lb/>
     chance to impart his knowledge and opinions 
     <lb/>
     concerning it. It turns out that that was 
     <lb/>
     correct on the part of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior anyway. But the reason why 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior could not swal<lb break="no"/>low clause 16 was this—that in the verbiage, 
     <lb/>
     compact, well thought out, put together by 
     <lb/>
     the hand of a master, there was something 
     <lb/>
     concealed. Not altogether concealed from 
     <lb/>
     himself, the Minister of the Interior said— 
     <lb/>
     he knew too much for that. But what was 
     <lb/>
     concealed in that verbiage ? There was an 
     <lb/>
     irrevocable constitutional ear-mark upon 
     <lb/>
     the public funds devouring them for ever 
     <lb/>
     to a separate school minority in those 
     <lb/>
     Territories, an ear-mark which made one 
     <lb/>
     of the greatest endowments in the whole 
     <lb/>
     history of the world for sectarian in<lb break="no"/>stitutions and sectarian purposes, in the 
     <lb/>
     fifty million dollars' worth of Northwest 
     <lb/>
     lands. That is why the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior could not swallow clause 16. Now, 
     <lb/>
     it would be a pity if we could not take the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior at his own valua<lb break="no"/>tion.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But we have endorsements, for when the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior stated that in no 
     <lb/>
     unequivocal language, in face of his former 
     <lb/>
     leader, his former leader assented by utter 
     <lb/>
     silence, the Minister of Justice assented 
     <lb/>
     by utter silence, and the Postmaster General 
     <lb/>
     applauded to the echo, as did also the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Customs and the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>

     ance. Now the further question that arises 
     <lb/>
     is this: What potent and soporitic drug 
     <lb/>
     had been administered to the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General, that lynx- eyed man of business and 
     <lb/>
     reader of constitutional law, what strange 
     <lb/>
     mixture had been administered to the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance, generally clear-headed 
     <lb/>
     and long-sighted, and to our incomparable 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Customs—what had been admin<lb break="no"/>istered in order to put them into a sleep 
     <lb/>
     of months, whilst that aptly-worded, finely 
     <lb/>
     phrased clause concealed within its innocent 
     <lb/>
     outside the foundation and formation of an 
     <lb/>
     irrevocable constitutionally ear-marked sect<lb break="no"/>arian endowment, than which there has 
     <lb/>
     been none greater in the history of the 
     <lb/>
     world? The Postmaster General was a 
     <lb/>
     member of the sub-committee that fram<lb break="no"/>ed the Bill. The Postmaster General has 
     <lb/>
     only one of two alternatives: Either he 
     <lb/>
     did not know what was in that clause, and 
     <lb/>
     consequently he is unworthy of his posi<lb break="no"/>tion; or he did know it, and he assented 
     <lb/>
     to it ; and if it had not been for the super<lb break="no"/>ior nerve of the Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     this country would have been no wiser to 
     <lb/>
     this day, that clause might have gone 
     <lb/>
     through, and the Postmaster General would 
     <lb/>
     have had to father the responsibility of it 
     <lb/>
     Now has the Postmaster General any ex<lb break="no"/>cuse to offer? Was he on that sub-com<lb break="no"/>mittee? Did he help to frame that clause? 
     <lb/>
     Did he assent to what the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior said the other day? He ap<lb break="no"/>plauded his utterance, silent under the 
     <lb/>
     lash, but he assented to it. What excuse 
     <lb/>
     has he with his former record staring him 
     <lb/>
     in the face, read and known of all men 
     <lb/>
     in this country? What excuse had he for 
     <lb/>
     attempting to ear-mark with a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     and irrevocable ear-mark, such an endow<lb break="no"/>ment as that for sectarian purposes in the 
     <lb/>
     great Northwest ? That is a question which 
     <lb/>
     the Postmaster General must answer. The 
     <lb/>
     same question may be put to the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs and to the Minister of Finance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But I thought I noticed—am I wrong, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker ?—I thought I noticed that 
     <lb/>
     when the ex-Minister of the Interior was 
     <lb/>
     flourishing that lash, lead-loaded, and bring<lb break="no"/>ing it down on the backs of certain former 
     <lb/>
     colleagues, and when he mentioned casually 
     <lb/>
     the existence of a draftsman, he was most 
     <lb/>
     particularly - not with a tear in his eye, not 
     <lb/>
     with a mournful countenance but it seem<lb break="no"/>ed to me with something like a manly glee 
     <lb/>
     - watching the effect of the tip of the lash 
     <lb/>
     on the back of the Minister of Justice. 
     <lb/>
     May be I was wrong in my supposition. If 
     <lb/>
     so, I give it just for what it is worth. But 
     <lb/>
     other things aside, the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     I am sure, will not shelter himself behind 
     <lb/>
     the back of a draftsman, the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice will take the responsibility for that 
     <lb/>
     clause, and in common parlance it will be 
     <lb/>
     up to him to explain why, surreptitiously 
     <lb/>
     shall I say, concealed in fine legal phrase 
     <lb/>
     he got ahead of the Minister of Customs, 
     <lb/>
     got ahead of the lynx-eyed  Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3372</fw>
         

     eral, got ahead even of his premier. It may 
     <lb/>
     be, and concealed in that verbiage the pot<lb break="no"/>ency and power of a most wonderful, and 
     <lb/>
     remarkable, and enduring instrument. It 
     <lb/>
     is for the Minister of Justice to explain 
     <lb/>
     that matter.  
     <lb/>
       </p>

            <p>Now, either the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>is right or he is wrong. Why do I con<lb break="no"/>clude that he is right? Because he has 
     <lb/>absolutely forced the government, after 
     <lb/>he had gone out of the government. to 
     <lb/>come to his terms. and they had three weeks 
     <lb/>afterwards to employ another draftsman— 
     <lb/>I am glad to say they did not get another 
     <lb/>Minister of Justice—but certainly to employ 
     <lb/>another draftsman, and to take out the con<lb break="no"/>cealed virus that was in section 16, No. 1, 
     <lb/>and substitute for it the plain and easily 
     <lb/>read verbiage of section 16, No. 2. Now 
     <lb/>the Minister of the Interior made his pro<lb break="no"/>test on these grounds. Three weeks brought 
     <lb/>him back into this House triumphant, lead<lb break="no"/>ing the premier and his colleagues in 
     <lb/>leash, and administering the lash to those 
     <lb/>sleepy, or incompetent, or careless minnister 
     <lb/>who allowed such a thing to get into clause 
     <lb/>16, No. 1, and came near doing it to the 
     <lb/>everlasting death of the sturdy yoeman of 
     <lb/>the Northwest. This last incident is the 
     <lb/>most dramatic of any that has occurred 
     <lb/>so far. But we live in a time and we are 
     <lb/>in a House where we may expect almost 
     <lb/>anything. Does anybody suppose that this 
     <lb/>is the last dramatic incident that .will take 
     <lb/>place? To-morrow. may be, we will have the 
     <lb/>anonuncement that the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, formerly the victorious man in his 
     <lb/>three weeks contest, will be re-seated on 
     <lb/>the government benches and in possession of 
     <lb/>his old portfolio. It may be—the premier 
     <lb/>was not ready to answer the question today, 
     <lb/>but he thought that he might to-morrow. 
     <lb/>By the efflux of time I believe it will be a 
     <lb/>pretty near to-morrow if it is to be in the 
     <lb/>affirmative. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But here is another thought that comes 
     <lb/>up at the same time. All this, as I said at 
     <lb/>first. is in pursuance of an hypothesis that 
     <lb/>the Prime Minister had determined to put 
     <lb/>this thing through, cost what it might, and 
     <lb/>these are the methods he has taken to put 
     <lb/>it through—the autocratic methods. What 
     <lb/>is the inducement that brought back the 
     <lb/>Minister of the Interior and joined him 
     <lb/>again to his colleagues, his leader and his 
     <lb/>party, in the advocacy—no, not in the advo<lb break="no"/>cacy, but in the voting support of this 
     <lb/>measure that is now before the House? 
     <lb/>What was the inducement—because there 
     <lb/>were strong inducements on the other side. 
     <lb/>On the other side were his principles, on 
     <lb/>the other side was his record from the old 
     <lb/>Manitoba times up to the present; on the 
     <lb/>other side was his reputation before the 
     <lb/>country as an adherent of principle. What 
     <lb/>was on this side in order to induce 
     <lb/>the Minister of the Interior to come back 
     <lb/>and put himself en rapport with his 
     <lb/>leader and his party on a question and 
     <lb/>
         

            <pb n="3373" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-29_Page_3373.jpg"/>

     upon a clause to the principle of which he 
     <lb/>
     still declares he is opposed, and to which, 
     <lb/>
     his whole record is opposed ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Well, Sir, we have seen things. We have 
     <lb/>
     seen in this government three of its ablest 
     <lb/>
     ministers go out in the prime and vigour of 
     <lb/>
     their years. One, the former Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Railways and Canals, heralded, lauded, de<lb break="no"/>clared to be the strong man of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, took a stand upon principle upon a 
     <lb/>
     certain most important measure and handed 
     <lb/>
     in his resignation as a protest because he 
     <lb/>
     believed that the measure which was intro<lb break="no"/>duced would be a measure fraught with in<lb break="no"/>calculable injury to his country and he         
     <lb/>could not give his assent to it. The only           
     <lb/>logical course for a man who did that was         
     <lb/>to see that a measure so fraught with evil 
     <lb/>was fought to its latest and did not become 
     <lb/>part of the statutes of this country. But, 
     <lb/>Sir, the Prime Minister knows a thing or 
     <lb/>two. He approached the Minister of Rail<lb break="no"/>ways and Canals, pistol in one hand, so<lb break="no"/>porific in the other. It is not on record, 
     <lb/>because these negotiations were verbal lar<lb break="no"/>gely, as to whether the trigger of the pistol 
     <lb/>was pulled or not, but it is on record that 
     <lb/>the soporific was taken and taken effect<lb break="no"/>ually. With a fine disregard of the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of the hon. Postmaster General (Sir 
     <lb/>William Mulock) that public offices and 
     <lb/>public emoluments should not be used for 
     <lb/>purely and solely party interests the right 
     <lb/>hon. First Minister used the money and 
     <lb/>public offices of this country as a soporific 
     <lb/>to lull for the time being and until his pur<lb break="no"/>poses were accomplished the dissent and pro<lb break="no"/>test of one of his strongest ministers. To-day 
     <lb/>he meets his former Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>pistol in one hand and soporific in the other. 
     <lb/>Here again the communications are verbal, 
     <lb/>there is no written record, we do not know 
     <lb/>whether the pistol had to be drawn posi<lb break="no"/>tively or not, and we do not know yet 
     <lb/>what the soporific is, but it is to be powerful 
     <lb/>and effective. One other minister remain<lb break="no"/>ed, not by any means the least strong or 
     <lb/>the least active. On what principle he 
     <lb/>went out, or assumed to go out, I do not 
     <lb/>quite know nor do I quite know how he 
     <lb/>views it. The pistol was evidently applied 
     <lb/>but whether there is a compensating sopo<lb break="no"/>rific yet to come or not we shall have to 
     <lb/>wait for time to reveal. Let me hope and 
     <lb/>express some confidence in the hope that 
     <lb/>out of the three there will be at least one 
     <lb/>minister who will have the manliness to 
     <lb/>stand firm, and having gone out on principle 
     <lb/>will stay out on principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, Sir, having got that far, let me 
     <lb/>
     put a question to the Northwest members 
     <lb/>
     who are supporting the government in this 
     <lb/>
     House. They were like sheep without a 
     <lb/>
     shepherd. Their shepherd was sporting 
     <lb/>
     peacefully and pastorally in the far off south<lb break="no"/>ern hills and his sheep here were without 
     <lb/>
     an efficient shepherd, without what we call 
     <lb/>
     the leading one—I will not say the leading 
     <lb/>
     sheep, it is only a simile anyway. While 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3374</fw>
          

     the leading one was away the others<lb/>unled fell into an artful design, a trap, laid<lb/>—shall I say by the hon. Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice ?—No, not perhaps laid, but that faci<lb break="no"/>lity of verbiage, that savoir faire way of <lb/>putting a thing so that it shall be preserved<lb/>and yet not seen was too much for the<lb/>members from the Northwest in the ab<lb break="no"/>sence of their lynx-eyed, keen and well<lb/>informed leader. They all fell into the pit,<lb/>they groaned in the pit and tumbled about<lb/>in the pit until their leader came back and<lb/>gently led them by paths out of the wil<lb break="no"/>derness back to firmer and higher ground.<lb/>But, for ever and for ever, say what you<lb/>may, or think what you may, to the seven<lb/>members from the Northwest who were con<lb break="no"/>ferred with, who gave their advice to help 
     <lb/>to formulate this Bill, who knew what was 
     <lb/>in it–for ever and for ever have they to 
     <lb/>bear the onus either of ignorance of what 
     <lb/>was in the Bill, or of indifference as to 
     <lb/>what was in it or of complicity in what the 
     <lb/>hon. ex-Minister of the Interior declared 
     <lb/>was the purpose of the clause. Now, this 
     <lb/> ought to give food for thought not only to 
     <lb/>the people of the Northwest but to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country through and through. 
     <lb/>Then, I put this question to the right hon. 
     <lb/>Prime Minister : If, before the last elec<lb break="no"/>tion, he had made known his intention to 
     <lb/>develop two provinces out of the Territories 
     <lb/>and in giving them autonomy to withhold 
     <lb/>from them the power over their lands and 
     <lb/>the unlimited power to control their educa<lb break="no"/>tional interests, how many men would he 
     <lb/>have had back here from the Northwest ? 
     <lb/>I ask the right hon. gentleman what would 
     <lb/>have been his status in this country to-day ? 
     <lb/>Is it to his credit that he kept back from 
     <lb/>the people that information or even an in<lb break="no"/>timation of it and secured a following 
     <lb/>absolutely unpledged and without a man<lb break="no"/>date on this subject ? My hon. friend knows 
     <lb/>that there is only one answer to that. I will 
     <lb/>put another question to him. If the hon. ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Minister of the Interior had stood out on 
     <lb/>his principle as he called it, would one 
     <lb/>single member from the Northwest have 
     <lb/>dared to go against him ? If he had stood 
     <lb/>out and if the rest had stood out with him 
     <lb/>would the right hon. leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment have dared to have attempted to put 
     <lb/>through his Bill ? That is the question. 
     <lb/>Therefore, there was an incentive and a 
     <lb/>motive either for the use of the pistol or 
     <lb/>the soporific. One or the other has been 
     <lb/>used undoubtedly as no man would have 
     <lb/>repudiated his principles and the record of 
     <lb/>a lifetime on a most grave question, unless 
     <lb/>there had been some further inducement 
     <lb/>than the ex-Minister of the Interior de<lb break="no"/>clared before us here the other day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, sir, let us go a little further. We 
     <lb/>heard yesterday an interesting speech from 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). 
     <lb/>I do not propose to undertake the ungra<lb break="no"/>cious task of criticising that speech as

     own included, has its defects, I suppose, 
     <lb/>
     and this speech certainly had its defects 
     <lb/>
     as well as its beauties. As I listened to 
     <lb/>
     that speech, whilst many thoughts coursed 
     <lb/>
     through my brain, two or three might be 
     <lb/>
     mentioned this afternoon. The first one 
     <lb/>
     was this : what a mild and erudite and 
     <lb/>
     tactful pleader for toleration and national 
     <lb/>
     unity the hon. member proved himself yes<lb break="no"/>terday ! How helpful it is, when we come 
     <lb/>
     to the decision of a constitutional question 
     <lb/>
     in the twentieth century, to have a very 
     <lb/>
     fine, a very learned discourse offered to us 
     <lb/>
     as to the wonderful, enduring and preserva<lb break="no"/>tive power of the church in the far gone 
     <lb/>
     centuries in keeping the light of know<lb break="no"/>ledge and science burning ! But we 
     <lb/>
     live in the 20th century ; we cannot de<lb break="no"/>cide now as to the merits of a common 
     <lb/>
     school system on what were the excellen<lb break="no"/>cies of the repositories of learning two, or 
     <lb/>
     three, or four centuries ago; we have to 
     <lb/>
     take the conditions as they are to-day and 
     <lb/>
     by weighing these conditions come to our 
     <lb/>
     own best conclusion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One other thing came to my mind. I 
     <lb/>
     could not help but look alternately from 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) 
     <lb/>
     to the member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) ; 
     <lb/>
     the member for Labelle chock full of reli<lb break="no"/>gious fervour and enthusiasm, a fervour and 
     <lb/>
     enthusiasm that does him infinite credit, 
     <lb/>
     declaring, as the culmination of his argu<lb break="no"/>ment, that it was impossible for Catholics 
     <lb/>
     to thoroughly enjoy their religion unless 
     <lb/>
     they have complete control of their educa<lb break="no"/>tion. If that is the belief of the member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle, or of any other good Catholic, 
     <lb/>
     I quarrel with no man's belief. It has been 
     <lb/>
     the fashion during this debate, and it fol<lb break="no"/>lows from good feeling, to disclaim any 
     <lb/>
     personal bias when we speak of each other 
     <lb/>
     as Protestants or Catholics. I do not want 
     <lb/>
     to enter upon that apology, or to even affirm 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary, but I want to say this in jus<lb break="no"/>tice to myself. I have been in public life 
     <lb/>
     since 1882, I have been on the back benches 
     <lb/>
     and on the front benches, I have spoken 
     <lb/>
     considerably often in this House (gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite think quite too often), I have 
     <lb/>
     spoken a good deal through the country, and 
     <lb/>
     my speeches have been reported ; if any 
     <lb/>
     man can put his finger on one single sen<lb break="no"/>tence spoken here or spoken elsewhere in 
     <lb/>
     which I have uttered one illiberal or bigot<lb break="no"/>ed thought with reference to my Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic fellow-countrymen, I would be 
     <lb/>
     thankful for him to do it. I don't think any 
     <lb/>
     man can. There is one circle which en<lb break="no"/>velops every man that is sacred ground, 
     <lb/>
     it is the circle in which his God and his 
     <lb/>
     conscience meet. Against what occurs in 
     <lb/>
     that inner circle I have absolutely no right 
     <lb/>
     to intrude, and I claim the same treatment 
     <lb/>
     for myself. But this is what I mean : If 
     <lb/>
     these were the opinions of the member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle, and undoubtedly they were, 
     <lb/>
     what kind of education does he want in 
     <lb/>
     these provinces ? What else can he want 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3376</fw>
        

     but one that will do him good from his 
     <lb/>
     point of view, a thing that is absolutely 
     <lb/>
     essential if he is not going to have a mere 
     <lb/>
     sham. The half hour privilege at the end 
     <lb/>
     of the school day to permit a priest in the 
     <lb/>
     school room to teach the dogmas of the 
     <lb/>
     church—will that satisfy him ? Is that the 
     <lb/>
     culmination of his depth of belief and his 
     <lb/>
     power of argument all verging towards the 
     <lb/>
     one conclusion ? Evidently not. Beside the 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle sat the ex-Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior, who, the other day, whittled it 
     <lb/>
     all down to the one half hour of religious 
     <lb/>
     teaching ; whittled it down to only that 
     <lb/>
     and nothing more. There, near the member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle, sat the Prime Minister, who, in 
     <lb/>
     1896, had the opportunity to prevent what 
     <lb/>
     the member for Labelle deplored as the 
     <lb/>
     robbery of the rights of the minority in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Manitoba. Never before in the 
     <lb/>
     history of confederation had such an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity arrived ; it is very probable it will 
     <lb/>
     never arrive again. The Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     told us, with a convenient forgetfulness of 
     <lb/>
     the whole clause 93 : I was opposed to re<lb break="no"/>medial legislation in 1896, because the law 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Manitoba had been de<lb break="no"/>clared to be a valid law, and I was against 
     <lb/>
     forcing Manitoba to relinquish what Mani<lb break="no"/>toba had the right to enact. Is that the 
     <lb/>
     worship of the constitution that my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend has ; is that the only part of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution he reads ? There were 
     <lb/>
     two things in the Manitoba case in 1896. 
     <lb/>
     They had a right to their law and it was 
     <lb/>
     valid on one count, and that count was, that 
     <lb/>
     before Manitoba became a province there 
     <lb/>
     was no system of sectarian or denomina<lb break="no"/>tional schools by law or practice. But there 
     <lb/>
     was another point which was covered by 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act, and for 
     <lb/>
     which most especially the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act was framed to cover. When 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba became a province it enacted a 
     <lb/>
     separate school law, and in 1890 it repealed 
     <lb/>
     that separate school law, and, under such 
     <lb/>
     circumstances the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, section 93, came in, and it is the only 
     <lb/>
     way in which it possibly could come in. 
     <lb/>
     Does my right hon. friend deny the fact ; 
     <lb/>
     does he deny the constitution ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then. Sir, the Roman Catholic minority 
     <lb/>
     came to him in 1896 and said : True, we 
     <lb/>
     were thrown down on the bad drafting or 
     <lb/>
     the insufficiency of the law, whichever you 
     <lb/>
     choose, but the Privy Council have declared 
     <lb/>
     that we have the right to get to the federal 
     <lb/>
     parliament through the federal government 
     <lb/>
     and to appeal as a last resort, if parliament 
     <lb/>
     considers it best to give us remedial legisla<lb break="no"/>tion in order to restore, as far as possible, 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the minority. When that ap<lb break="no"/>peal was made to the hon. gentleman, could 
     <lb/>
     he take a part of section 93 and relieve 
     <lb/>
     himself from the duty, because that particu<lb break="no"/>lar part of the section did not apply, whilst 
     <lb/>
     right before him was the other and perti<lb break="no"/>nent part of the constitution which absolute<lb break="no"/>ly did apply ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

 <p>
     Now, Sir, I never was a separate school 
     <lb/>
     adherent, I never believed in separate 
     <lb/>
     schools as against national schools. In 
     <lb/>
     1896 I stated my belief, as I state it now; 
     <lb/>
     I knew it was not politically to my ad<lb break="no"/>vantage, I knew it was not politically to 
     <lb/>
     the advantage of the Liberal-Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party; but, Sir, without thinking of ul<lb break="no"/>terior things, I said to myself: There is 
     <lb/>
     the constitution. there is the pronounce<lb break="no"/>ment of the highest judicial tribunal in 
     <lb/>
     this empire, there is the minority coming 
     <lb/>
     with a grievance and having the right to 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the Dominion government and 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament, the only power 
     <lb/>
     that has jurisdiction to right their wrongs; 
     <lb/>
     I said to myself : I believe it is right, I 
     <lb/>
     believe in the policy of attempting to carry 
     <lb/>
     out the constitution. Let me ask this ques<lb break="no"/>tion: If my right hon. friend, in 1896, had 
     <lb/>
     thrown his forces with the forces that made 
     <lb/>
     for remedial legislation, who can doubt that 
     <lb/>
     we would have carried it in this parliament. 
     <lb/>
     No one can doubt it. And why was it not 
     <lb/>
     carried? The ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     told why when he said here the other day : 
     <lb/>
     The member for North Toronto wished to 
     <lb/>
     restore the schools, but he failed, and he 
     <lb/>
     failed because the right hon. the leader of 
     <lb/>
     this government threw himself across the 
     <lb/>
     way and prevented it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Why should not the member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     save some of his argument that he so gen<lb break="no"/>erously distributed yesterday, and apply it 
     <lb/>
     to his own chief, the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     who leads the government, and tax him for 
     <lb/>
     two things. When he said that they had 
     <lb/>
     been robbed of their rights in Manitoba and 
     <lb/>
     were suffering from injustice there to-day, 
     <lb/>
     why did he not add: and that, Sir, was 
     <lb/>
     due to the action of the present Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, my own leader. More than that: when 
     <lb/>
     in clause 16, as brought down on the 21 st of 
     <lb/>
     February, his leader had provided for sec<lb break="no"/>tarian education in these provinces for ever 
     <lb/>with an endowment from the fund, Why did 
     <lb/>he, at the beck and call of the Minister of 
     <lb/>the Interior, who was their enemy, looked 
     <lb/>upon in that light, who destroyed their 
     <lb/>schools system in Manitoba, who prevented 
     <lb/>them from obtaining and retaining their 
     <lb/>rights there—why did he take out the clause 
     <lb/>that gave them something, and substitute 
     <lb/>the clause that which according to the Fin<lb break="no"/>ance Minister. the Minister of Customs and 
     <lb/>the ex-Minister of the Interior, gives you 
     <lb/>absolutely notihing but the last weary half 
     <lb/>hour of instruction at the day's end 
     <lb/>and the name of a separate school. 
     <lb/>I am carrying out now strictly the 
     <lb/>argument of the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>Interior, acquiesced in by all the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government who have spoken; 
     <lb/>and no one who has not spoken has deemed 
     <lb/>it: necessary to rise and express his dissent 
     <lb/>from that argument. If his argument is 
     <lb/>correct and his facts are right and they 
     <lb/>are assented to by the members opposite— 
     <lb/>what. may I ask the member for Labelle.

     hierarchy. I do not think hierarchy is an 
     <lb/>
     objectionable name ; I think it is an honour<lb break="no"/>able name, and I am quite sure it is an 
     <lb/>
     honoured name, and I venture to use it, 
     <lb/>
     and to use it in that sense. The one the 
     <lb/>
     representative of the hierarchy, the other 
     <lb/>
     the representative of the bench, both of 
     <lb/>
     them strong Catholics, both speaking the 
     <lb/>
     French language, and both on the spot and 
     <lb/>
     able to speak from knowledge, thus ex<lb break="no"/>press themselves. Now, may I ask the 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle, if he is absolutely con<lb break="no"/>vinced of his theory and if he drives it to 
     <lb/>
     its logical conclusion, why did he sit 'still 
     <lb/>
     and not open his lips when the malign in<lb break="no"/>fluence of the Minister of the Interior and 
     <lb/>
     the ex-Minister of the Interior was dragging 
     <lb/>
     out of the Bill clause 16, No. 1, which gave 
     <lb/>
     to the Northwest minority that which they 
     <lb/>
     demand, and which was conclusively de<lb break="no"/>manded by the argument of the member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle ? Must we again and again come to 
     <lb/>
     the conclusion, that with the member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle it is the same as with the member 
     <lb/>
     for Brandon—they are both strong in the 
     <lb/>
     enunciation of their principles, but both 
     <lb/>
     very lax in carrying them out. On prin<lb break="no"/>ciple I am with Borden, but when it 
     <lb/>
     comes to a vote, I am with Laurier— 
     <lb/>
     that is the cynical and outspoken declar<lb break="no"/>ation of the ex-Minister of the Interior. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, let me come back to the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     case. I was finishing that by saying that 
     <lb/>
     section 93 has two parts, and that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister cannot get out of the obligation of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution by quoting only one part, 
     <lb/>
     in which he is relieved by a judgment of 
     <lb/>
     the Privy Council, and ignoring the other 
     <lb/>
     part, in which he is absolutely bound by 
     <lb/>
     the judgment of the Privy Council in so 
     <lb/>
     far as having a clear came for the action of 
     <lb/>
     this body under its jurisdiction. So much 
     <lb/>
     with reference to that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One other point might be brought up. 
     <lb/>
     The ex-Minister of the Interior, speaking 
     <lb/>
     of the Manitoba question in 1896, said from

     <lb/>
     —the prime actor in the one case, with 
     <lb/>
     his memory fresh, with all the scars 
     <lb/>
     and all the laurels from the conflict 
     <lb/>
     still fresh upon him, and the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of this country, who could not have 
     <lb/>
     gone through those negotiations and that 
     <lb/>
     contest of 1896 without having his memory 
     <lb/>
     also fresh with reference to what had hap<lb break="no"/>pened. There is what the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     says in December, 1896 ; here is what the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of the Interior says in March, 
     <lb/>
     1905 ; which is correct ? Did the theory 
     <lb/>
     that was put forth by the Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     exercise its malign influence then, and did 
     <lb/>
     a responsible government in Manitoba, with 
     <lb/>
     important interests and grave issues at stake 
     <lb/>
     deliberately make up its mind that it would 
     <lb/>
     not give to a Tory government what it 
     <lb/>
     was prepared to give to a Liberal govern<lb break="no"/>ment ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, look again at what takes place. 
     <lb/>
     The Prime Minister comes down and makes 
     <lb/>
     his argument absolutely on the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional phase of the question. He disclaims 
     <lb/>
     the breeding of strife, the letting loose of 
     <lb/>
     the demon of discord in this great parlia<lb break="no"/>ment where different races and religions are 
     <lb/>
     represented. He says: Though I believe 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3380</fw>
           

     in separate schools, yet I argue this out 
     <lb/>
     on the constitution. His statement, is in 
     <lb/>
     so many words, that the constitution binds 
     <lb/>
    us, compels us, to give to the minority in 
     <lb/>these provinces that we are forming in the 
     <lb/>Northwest the same rights that are given 
     <lb/>under the constitution to Quebec and Onta<lb break="no"/>rio minorities. That is his exact state<lb break="no"/>ment ; it is in the unrevised 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard ' ; it is in the revised ' Hansard '; 
     <lb/>it has been quoted before ; it has not 
     <lb/>been denied ; he will not deny it. 
     <lb/>Well, Sir, I do not commend that version 
     <lb/>of the compact of confederation to this 
     <lb/>House, and I do ask the House and the 
     <lb/>country to look into that for a little. So 
     <lb/>much has been said about toleration in Que<lb break="no"/>bec, so much has been said about the bind<lb break="no"/>ing power of the constitution, that, if my 
     <lb/>hon. friends opposite will allow me, I want 
     <lb/>to reason that out with them for a moment. 
     <lb/>I do it in the broadest and kindest spirit. 
     <lb/>You say you are tolerant to the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant minority in Quebec. I am glad 
     <lb/>to hear it. I am not going to stand here 
     <lb/>and deny it. But, when you say that 
     <lb/>you are tolerant to the minority, I ask 
     <lb/>you, ought not you so to be? They are your 
     <lb/>fellow-citizens. They are not your wards ; 
     <lb/>they contribute to your finances ; they build 
     <lb/>up your country ; they live side by side 
     <lb/>with your families ; the weal or woe of the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec must he shared equally 
     <lb/>by them and you. Ought you not to be 
     <lb/>tolerant toward them ? But, will the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) allow 
     <lb/>me one word to show why he should be a 
     <lb/>little self-contained when he makes this 
     <lb/>the plea for any extraordinary toleration 
     <lb/>for those of his own faith and race 
     <lb/>in other provinces. Here is a Pro<lb break="no"/>testant child in Quebec. He goes one morn<lb break="no"/>ing to what is called the Quebec school. You 
     <lb/>may call these your national schools if you 
     <lb/>like ; but am I wrong in saying that, from 
     <lb/>the time that child enters the school at nine 
     <lb/>o'clock in the morning until he leaves it at 
     <lb/>four o'clock in the afternoon, he is under 
     <lb/>the direct, impressive, constant, inculcatory 
     <lb/>spirit and teaching of the Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>church ? I am not mistating the facts in 
     <lb/>that. For, the hon. member for Labelle, 
     <lb/>speaking on behalf of his people, says : We 
     <lb/>believe we cannot properly exercise our re<lb break="no"/>ligion unless we have the right to teach our 
     <lb/>children our religion as and when we please 
     <lb/>So, does it not come to this, in all reason— 
     <lb/>that your schools in Quebec are not na<lb break="no"/>tional schools; they are Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>schools ? The influence of the church, in 
     <lb/>the books, in the teachers, in the adornments 
     <lb/>in the positive dogmatic teaching is there 
     <lb/>from nine o'clock in the morning until four 
     <lb/>o'clock in the afternoon. And the Protes<lb break="no"/>tant boy has no other school to go to, un<lb break="no"/>less you make provision for him. Is it ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary tolcration that, having no na<lb break="no"/>tional schools, no schools that are undog<lb break="no"/>matic and unsectarian. if there is a Pro<lb break="no"/>

     testant minority in the province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     you are bound, to make provision for the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant—who is just as honest in allegi<lb break="no"/>ance to his creed and maintenance of his 
     <lb/>
     religious belief as is the Catholic—to give to 
     <lb/>
     him a place where he will not be constantly 
     <lb/>
     under the watchful and persuasive power 
     <lb/>
    and teaching of the Catholic Church. I am 
     <lb/>not going outside of the record in saying 
     <lb/>that. When you talk of toleration, I want 
     <lb/>you to think of that. And, now take the 
     <lb/>other case. Here is a Protestant child in 
     <lb/>Ontario. He goes to the public school. From 
     <lb/>the time he enters the school at nine o'clock 
     <lb/>in the morning until he goes out of it at 
     <lb/>four o'clock in the afternoon, there is no 
     <lb/>vestige of denominational or clerical teach<lb break="no"/>ing [or] influence. The Catholic child comes 
     <lb/>from the bosom of a Catholic family and 
     <lb/>returns to the bosom of that family at night 
     <lb/>absolutely unassailed and uninfluenced by 
     <lb/>any dogma denominational or clerical which 
     <lb/>is against his belief or against the 
     <lb/>course of his religious training. That is 
     <lb/>to say, in Ontario there are national schools. 
     <lb/>Now, the only ground you have to stand 
     <lb/>upon in objecting to this system in Ontario, 
     <lb/>is that it is the very absence of dogmatical 
     <lb/>teaching that you object to. Then, if you 
     <lb/>object to that, but not to any direct 
     <lb/>teaching or persuasion, that is the limit of 
     <lb/>your plea. But you cannot say that the 
     <lb/>Catholic child is under perverting influence. 
     <lb/>In the province of Quebec it is absolutely 
     <lb/>different from what it is in Ontario ; do you 
     <lb/>not see that ?—and consequently you must 
     <lb/>not stretch this claim of your toleration too 
     <lb/>far. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Will the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man allow me a word ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Certainly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. I would like to impress 
     <lb/>
     upon the hon. gentleman's (Mr. Foster's) mind 
     <lb/>
     the point of view we take ;—we say that it 
     <lb/>
     is as unjust to compel a Catholic child to 
     <lb/>
     go to a non-sectarian school as it is to com<lb break="no"/>pel a Protestant child to go to a Catholic 
     <lb/>
     school. And that has been acknowledged 
     <lb/>
     by the highest Protestant authorities in 
     <lb/>
     England. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I do not dissent from the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's (Mr. Bourassa's) state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Catholic position. But what I 
     <lb/>
     answer is this : Is it as unjust to have a child 
     <lb/>
     forced by necessity, or by environment, to 
     <lb/>
     go to a national school in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario where he is not perverted, as it 
     <lb/>
     would be if these national schools taught 
     <lb/>
     Methodism or Presbyterianism from morn<lb break="no"/>ing until night and perverted your child ? 
     <lb/>
     We must take all these things into the con<lb break="no"/>sideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, we go back to the compact. And 
     <lb/>
     I may say that whatever may be the simi<lb break="no"/>larity of words, I see a difference between 
     <lb/>
     the compact of confederation and the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act. By whom was the 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3382</fw>
 

     compact made, and where ? The compact 
     <lb/>
     was made in 1864 by the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. These 
     <lb/>
     representatives met together to form 
     <lb/>
     a confederation. They made what we 
     <lb/>
     call the constitution. In that <choice><sic>consti<lb break="no"/>tuition</sic><corr>constitution</corr></choice> you find two divisions of powers. 
     <lb/>
     One division puts certain things ex<lb break="no"/>clusively under the control of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and the other puts certain things 
     <lb/>
     exclusively under the control of the Domi<lb break="no"/>nion. Now, read these over, and do you 
     <lb/>
     find anything in the list of powers given 
     <lb/>
     to the exclusive control of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     which has the remotest relation to or con<lb break="no"/>nection with education ? You cannot find 
     <lb/>
     it. What was the dominant idea in the minds 
     <lb/>
     of all the representatives ? The dominant 
     <lb/>
     idea was that education was a local con<lb break="no"/>cern, and the Dominion must keep its 
     <lb/>
     hands off. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And that was Mr. Oliver Mowat's original 
     <lb/>
     resolution, what was afterwards added was 
     <lb/>
     only an incident. Do not let us confuse the 
     <lb/>
     incidental with the essential. One is the 
     <lb/>
     powers themselves. The other comes from 
     <lb/>
     an after thought, viz: Granting those pow<lb break="no"/>ers, can they be used to prejudice the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minority? If so, let us put on a check.  
     <lb/>
     That is the incidental, but the other is 
     <lb/>
     the essential. Now the essential thing 
     <lb/>
     is that the province should have exclusive 
     <lb/>
     control of its education. But those wise 
     <lb/>
     men sitting there in Quebec city said : Here 
     <lb/>
    is Ontario and here is Quebec we have 
     <lb/>separate schools for Catholics in Ontario 
     <lb/>and for Protestants in Quebec, and a sug<lb break="no"/>gestion was made by Mr. McGee to this 
     <lb/>effect : Yes, we will give the exclusive pow<lb break="no"/>er, but we will add this rider to it, ' save 
     <lb/>and except the minority rights of the two 
     <lb/>Canadas.' That is all that was done at 
     <lb/>Quebec. That is all to the very letter, and 
     <lb/>that was passed by the legislature of 
     <lb/>Upper and Lower Canada. There were 
     <lb/>present representatives from the  mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces and also the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the two provinces of 
     <lb/>Upper and Lower Canada. That was their 
     <lb/>compact, and that was all of it. But this 
     <lb/>gave no right for anybody to say that, be<lb break="no"/>cause they saved by that compact the 
     <lb/>rights of the minorities in those two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, when forty or fifty years later you 
     <lb/>make provinces out of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, you are obliged on account of that 
     <lb/>compact, to establish separate schools for 
     <lb/>the minorities in those provinces. Not in 
     <lb/>the least. This compact in order to become 
     <lb/>law went to London. The Protestant min<lb break="no"/>ority, voiced by Mr. Galt, said : That com<lb break="no"/>pact does not suit the Protestants in Quebec; 
     <lb/>we are peculiarly situated ; we have been 
     <lb/>trying to get certain amendments to our 
     <lb/>Act to better protect us ; these have been 
     <lb/>promised us. but you have not been able 
     <lb/>to carry them out ; now we cannot 
     <lb/>willingly go into confederation unless we 
     <lb/>


            <pb n="3383" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-29_Page_3383.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3383</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
      


     get those. In the last analysis, it came to 
     <lb/>
     this: The Protestant minority could not get 
     <lb/>
     the legislation until after confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Then Mr. Galt said at London : Very well, 
     <lb/>
     then we must make that promise binding by 
     <lb/>
     the constitution ; we must add that other 
     <lb/>
     clause that not only if at the time of con<lb break="no"/>federation separate schools exist but if legis<lb break="no"/>lation is had after confederation giving 
     <lb/>
     separate school privileges and then that 
     <lb/>
     these should be taken away, and the rights 
     <lb/>
     of the minority thereby be prejudiced, there 
     <lb/>
     will be an appeal to the sovereign power, the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of the colonies. That is the his<lb break="no"/>tory of it and the whole history of it. You 
     <lb/>
     may search the whole history of it from 
     <lb/>
     first to last and that is a fair statement of 
     <lb/>
     the case. For New Brunswick and Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, not by compact, but in London, was 
     <lb/>
     this united Upper and Lower Canada saving 
     <lb/>
     clause extended into a saving clause which 
     <lb/>
     applied to all the provinces at the time of 
     <lb/>
     the union. It was generalized, it was the 
     <lb/>
     compact principle extended to the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. That is the Confederation Act. 
     <lb/>
     When you come to the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act, you can get all there is in that Act 
     <lb/>
     and you have a right to get it. But I say 
     <lb/>
     to the right hon. gentleman who contends 
     <lb/>
     that he is bound by the Confederation Act 
     <lb/>
     to give to these Northwest provinces the 
     <lb/>
     same rights that are possessed by Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec, that he has pushed the con<lb break="no"/>tract beyond its absolute and reasonable 
     <lb/>
     meaning, and in the opinion of lawyers 
     <lb/>
     equally as good as himself he has no war<lb break="no"/>rant for saying that he is compelled by the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act to place into the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     such a principle as he proposes to embalm 
     <lb/>
     in that constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     One point more with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba case. I have said that the Catho<lb break="no"/>lic or any minority in this Dominion never 
     <lb/>
     had a case so clear for remedial legislation 
     <lb/>
     as had the Manitoba minority in 1896. All 
     <lb/>
     the legal difficulties were out of the way, 
     <lb/>
     all the decisions were given, and the path 
     <lb/>
     was absolutely clear between that minority 
     <lb/>
     with its grievance and the power which 
     <lb/>
     had jurisdiction to remedy it, namely, this 
     <lb/>
     parliament. But the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     threw himself across the way and prevented 
     <lb/>
     it ; and if my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Bourassa) complains that the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     minority is suffering from injustice to<lb break="no"/>day, it is because his leader threw him<lb break="no"/>self across the path of the Remedial Bill 
     <lb/>
     and prevented its enactment. More has 
     <lb/>
     happened since that. I regret in no single 
     <lb/>
     jot or tittle my act in 1896. Under similar 
     <lb/>
     circumstances, I would do the same thing, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not at all say that I will ever do 
     <lb/>
     the same thing under the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     that may arise after this, Why ? Be<lb break="no"/>cause there is a power which after all is 
     <lb/>
     mightier than the constitution. We in<lb break="no"/>voked the constitution in 1896. We tried 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3384</fw>
       

     to give it its full force in a clear case 
     <lb/>
     and we were prevented by the leader of 
     <lb/>
     a great party. After we were prevented, 
     <lb/>
     that leader and his party went to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in 1896, 1900 and 1904, and the people 
     <lb/>
     declared that they did not want remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation. In the interests of the 41 per 
     <lb/>
     cent which has been talked about in this 
     <lb/>
     House, in the interests of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec which was specially interested, we 
     <lb/>
     on this side tried to get for the minority 
     <lb/>
     their rights in the only way we possibly 
     <lb/>
     could under the constitution. We were pre<lb break="no"/>vented from doing it by the Liberal party, 
     <lb/>
     and during three successive elections the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party have endorsed the conten<lb break="no"/>tion that no hands be laid on any province 
     <lb/>
     even though it deprives the minority of that 
     <lb/>
     province of the rights guaranteed it under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution. And I make hold to say 
     <lb/>
     that as long as grass grows and water runs, 
     <lb/>
     I shall not feel disposed to contravene that 
     <lb/>
     will three times expressed by the people of 
     <lb/>
     this country. Aye, Mr. Speaker, three times 
     <lb/>
     expressed, and expressed especially by that 
     <lb/>
     very 41 per cent we hear so much about, 
     <lb/>
     and in the province where it is strong set. 
     <lb/>
     To the man who says that this agitation is 
     <lb/>
     on to-day simply because we are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     a French premier—to the gentleman from 
     <lb/>
     Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) I have no answer to 
     <lb/>
     make. A statement of the case is quite suf<lb break="no"/>ficient. To the same gentleman who said in 
     <lb/>
     another part of his speech that this is on 
     <lb/>
     because it is a party agitation, I have no 
     <lb/>
     answer to make. His statement answers 
     <lb/>
     Itself. We read the newspapers. we scan the 
     <lb/>
     petitions, we know what is going on in this 
     <lb/>
     country, and if this is a party agitation 
     <lb/>
     very suddenly the Tory party must have 
     <lb/>
     greatly enlarged its sphere. Sir, I want 
     <lb/>
     to state one other thing. Whatever may 
     <lb/>
     have been said in 1896, I approached that 
     <lb/>
     question, and the government of which I 
     <lb/>
     was a member approached it, against the 
     <lb/>
     wishes of many of our best friends, not 
     <lb/>
     because we thought we had a political 
     <lb/>
     cinch in prospect, not at all ; but knowing 
     <lb/>
     that in all probability we were going down 
     <lb/>
     to our political death, and doing it because 
     <lb/>
     we thought we were under a constitutional 
     <lb/>
     obligation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I had intended to address an 
     <lb/>
     argument to the Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     but that hon. gentleman is not present ; 
     <lb/>
     perhaps it will be better to keep it for 
     <lb/>
     another time. But there is one point I can<lb break="no"/>not afford to let pass, because it is a point 
     <lb/>
     made by the Minister of Finance as well as 
     <lb/>
     by the ex-Minister of the Interior. It used 
     <lb/>
     to be good doctrine, good constitutional doc<lb break="no"/>trine, it is yet—it used to be good Liberal 
     <lb/>
     doctrine, I don't know that it is now—but 
     <lb/>
     it used to be, formerly they coincided,—that 
     <lb/>
     if there was a member of the government 
     <lb/>
     who, on a grave question of principle, did 
     <lb/>
     not agree with his party on a measure in<lb break="no"/>volving that principle, he had no other hon<lb break="no"/>

     ourable course than to go out from the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and voice his opposition to that 
     <lb/>
     measure. Is that a good Liberal principle 
     <lb/>
     to-day ? Is it, or is it not ? That is the 
     <lb/>
     only raison d'être that the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior had. He has not abjured his prin<lb break="no"/>ciples, he keeps them still. He declares that 
     <lb/>
     it is with reluctance that he will vote for 
     <lb/>
     the measure. He says, " section 1 is an in<lb break="no"/>terference, and he wishes it were not there ; 
     <lb/>
     but on one consideration he will vote for 
     <lb/>
     that interference. Why ? Because it is sup<lb break="no"/>plemented by a subsection which declares 
     <lb/>
     that money shall be put behind the inter<lb break="no"/>ference to make it effective. There is con<lb break="no"/>sistency for you. He hates the plague, he 
     <lb/>
     says it destroys the family, it decimates 
     <lb/>
     society, but if only you support it by a 
     <lb/>
     money vote by which you can scatter the 
     <lb/>
     plague far and wide, then he welcomes it. 
     <lb/>
     That is the argument, that is the reason<lb break="no"/>ing of the Minister of the Interior, if he 
     <lb/>
     has any left at all. He declares that his 
     <lb/>
     principles are not abjured, but he straight<lb break="no"/>way repudiates them by his vote. The man 
     <lb/>
     who cried for freedom from slavery, cried 
     <lb/>
     it from 1890 to 1896, through all the conces<lb break="no"/>sions and counties of the west, and of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, cried for unshackled limbs in the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, comes in to-day, and while declar<lb break="no"/>ing that he has not abjured his principles 
     <lb/>
     in the least, he votes to do what he declares 
     <lb/>
     himself shackles and creates an interference 
     <lb/>
     with the free life of two great provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the west, enduring and irrevocable. Time 
     <lb/>
     was when a man who held a principle 
     <lb/>
     as strong as that on so grave an 
     <lb/>
     issue, would not have dared to stand 
     <lb/>
     before the public an instant after hav<lb break="no"/>ing gone back upon his principles. Why 
     <lb/>
     does he do it ? Why ? I am not going to 
     <lb/>
     search for any reasons at all, I am going to 
     <lb/>
     give the reason that he gives—the King's 
     <lb/>
     government must go on. The Finance Min<lb break="no"/>ister says, the King's government must go 
     <lb/>
     on. Do they not mean in their heart of 
     <lb/>
     hearts that the Liberal government must 
     <lb/>
     go on ? It is the Liberal government which 
     <lb/>
     must go on, and principle, consistency, con<lb break="no"/>stitution, everything must be sacrificed, but 
     <lb/>
     the King's—to wit, the Liberal—government 
     <lb/>
     must go on. The Minister of Finance used 
     <lb/>
     it as a threat—I never heard a more un<lb break="no"/>worthy argument in this House, and hope 
     <lb/>
     never to hear such an argument again. If 
     <lb/>
     that principle and that method is adopted 
     <lb/>
     what government can be pure and well con<lb break="no"/>ducted ; for never, if not in this case, will 
     <lb/>
     men go out because they do not agree in 
     <lb/>
     principle with the legislation which is pro<lb break="no"/>posed. Yet the King's government must go 
     <lb/>
     on, that is to say, the party must be kept in 
     <lb/>
     power, principle and constitution may be 
     <lb/>
     thrown to the winds. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But the Minister of the Interior has 
     <lb/>
     wonderful knowledge from his acquaintance 
     <lb/>
     on the street. He has been too much on the 
     <lb/>
     street. Too close a connection with the man 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3386</fw>
      

     on the street is apt to becloud the moral 
     <lb/>
     sense, is apt to throw a pall over principle, 
     <lb/>
     it is not conducive to the highest and clearest 
     <lb/>
     thought. What is his argument ? The con<lb break="no"/>stitution orders this, says the right hon. pre<lb break="no"/>mier. The constitution does not compel it, 
     <lb/>
     says the leader of the opposition. So the 
     <lb/>
     ex-Minister of the Interior says that the 
     <lb/>
     man on the street gets confused. He hears 
     <lb/>
     both say that they are correct, sees both 
     <lb/>
     stand on the same rock. The man on the 
     <lb/>
     street says, he cannot understand the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, but wants to know what you are 
     <lb/>
     going to enact. But there are men on the 
     <lb/>
     street and men on the street. I can con<lb break="no"/>ceive of a man on the street who cultivates 
     <lb/>
     a very valuable farm out in Carleton county. 
     <lb/>
     I go to him and say : My good friend, you 
     <lb/>
     think you own that farm.—Yes.—Well, I 
     <lb/>
     think I own it. Let us sit down now and 
     <lb/>
     let us discuss what is the best method of 
     <lb/>
     cultivating that farm. What does the man 
     <lb/>
     on the street say to me ? The first thing 
     <lb/>
     he says is, Sir, don't you think I had better 
     <lb/>
     know first how the title reads ? If the title 
     <lb/>
     in in me. I wil take your advice, but I will 
     <lb/>
     not take your domination ; if the title is in 
     <lb/>
     you, I may give you advice, but I will not 
     <lb/>
     try to dominate you. My first duty is to as<lb break="no"/>certain the title of the property. I will dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the details of the business afterwards. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>So there are men on the street and men on 
     <lb/>the street, and it is not the better class of 
     <lb/>men on the street from whom the Minister 
     <lb/>of the Interior has received his inspiration. 
     <lb/>Forty-one per cent of the people of this 
     <lb/>country, the Minister of Finance says, bids 
     <lb/>us put this article into the constitution. 
     <lb/>Forty-one per cent of this country in 1896 
     <lb/>seemed to be up in arms against remedial 
     <lb/>legislation in the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>What right has the Minister of Finance to 
     <lb/> say that forty-one per cent of the people of 
     <lb/>this country demand it ? But does he pay 
     <lb/>a compliment to the forty-one per cent of 
     <lb/>the intelligent, educated, 1aw-abiding, pat<lb break="no"/>riotic Catholics in this country, if, when a 
     <lb/>question comes up and has been fought out 
     <lb/>in the high court of parliament, and the 
     <lb/>majority is against them, he makes them 
     <lb/>say that they will make government impos<lb break="no"/>sible in this country 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     What Catholic says that ? No intelli<lb break="no"/>gent, patriotic Catholic says it. Every 
     <lb/>
     patriotic and intelligent Catholic throws 
     <lb/>
     that back in the teeth both of the hon. ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior and the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance and that when they want 
     <lb/>
     an excuse for going back on their principles 
     <lb/>
     and their records they should get a better 
     <lb/>
     excuse than to say that 41 per cent of the 
     <lb/>
     citizens of this country, if they cannot get 
     <lb/>
     what they want, will cause anarchy and 
     <lb/>
     revolution. The Minister of Finance ven<lb break="no"/>tured something else, and I commend it to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for Labelle. He said : Oh 
     <lb/>
     yes, we can afford to be tolerant ; we must  
     <lb/>
     recollect that 41 per cent of the people are 
     <lb/>

     Catholics. They have some rights and we 
     <lb/>
     must not be too hard hearted. Let the 
     <lb/>
     constitution go ; let us he tolerant ; give 
     <lb/>
     them a large and tolerant measure, and 
     <lb/>
     what is the measure ? All they get up 
     <lb/>
     there is their half-hour of the spent day ; 
     <lb/>
     all they get up there is a decrease in their 
     <lb/>
     separate schools instead of an increase. 
     <lb/>
     Oh, the generosity, the lofty, wide tolera<lb break="no"/>tion of the Finance Minister ! I did not 
     <lb/>
     blame the hon. member for Labelle at all 
     <lb/>
     yesterday when he put that little quiet 
     <lb/>
     spoke in his wheel and said : Oh yes, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Finance Minister you are quite tolerant 
     <lb/>
     down there but you were not always so. 
     <lb/>
     You are so now because there is a very res<lb break="no"/>pectable number of Catholic votes in your 
     <lb/>
     province. What more right has this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to put separate schools under the con<lb break="no"/>stitution in these two great provinces 
     <lb/>
     out there in the interest of the minority 
     <lb/>
     than it has to bid the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, or the province of New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     or the province of Prince Edward Island 
     <lb/>
     to give separate schools to the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of those provinces ? 
     <lb/>
     When you come down to the essence of the 
     <lb/>
     thing and leave forms aside what more 
     <lb/>
     right has parliament to do it in one case 
     <lb/>
     than in the other ? Would even the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Labelle introduce a proposition 
     <lb/>
     looking to an interference with the province 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island or 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, or to force them to give a 
     <lb/>
     legal separate school system to the min<lb break="no"/>ority ? No, and why not ? It is more 
     <lb/>
     manly, Sir, to attack a full fledged province 
     <lb/>
     able to defend itself and say to it : We 
     <lb/>
     will make you respect law and justice ; we 
     <lb/>
     will make you respect the rights of the min<lb break="no"/>ority and we will put a law in force in your 
     <lb/>
     province which will compel you to do it 
     <lb/>
     under pains and penalties. You have a man 
     <lb/>
     to fight then. It is a fair battle, but in this 
     <lb/>
     case you take the child, your own ward, 
     <lb/>
     the infant in your arms growing up to his 
     <lb/>
     maturity who will by and by attain a mighty 
     <lb/>
     estate, with powerful, untold possibilities 
     <lb/>
     stretching out into the endless future and 
     <lb/>
     while he is a child in your lap you bind 
     <lb/>
     his limbs with an irrevocable bond, so that 
     <lb/>
     however strong he may grow he never can 
     <lb/>
     get rid of the bond or the badge that 
     <lb/>
     marks him as inferior. The plea for 
     <lb/>
     toleration is a good one, the argument 
     <lb/>
     for separate schools, as strong as it can be 
     <lb/>
     made, may be a good one, but you are 
     <lb/>
     in the wrong court when you come here. 
     <lb/>
     That is the only mistake. How did you get 
     <lb/>
     your separate school privileges in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Nova Scotia ? Not by the hard 
     <lb/>
     letter of the law. It was the good, toler<lb break="no"/>ant sense of the majority which gave you 
     <lb/>
     there all you asked. How did you get your 
     <lb/>
     privileges in the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick ? New Brunswick fought the min<lb break="no"/>ority, fought it out in the province, went 
     <lb/>
     to the elections on it, fought it out in the 
     <lb/>
     courts, made no change in jot or tittle, 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3387</fw>
       

     but when it had ascertained and maintain<lb break="no"/>ed its full rights the majority turned 
     <lb/>
     around and said to their brethren that lived 
     <lb/>
     in their midst : We are not so intolerant 
     <lb/>
     as you thought, we give you those privi<lb break="no"/>leges and to-day, in the city of St. John and 
     <lb/>
     in every portion of New Brunswick, you 
     <lb/>
     have practically better separate schools 
     <lb/>
     than you will have in the Northwest. Why 
     <lb/>
     cannot you trust the Northwest ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. Not the same kind.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Not the same kind? I do 
     <lb/>
     not respect very much that judgment, 
     <lb/>
     which, standing on the small pivot of the 
     <lb/>
     present, cannot look out into the future with 
     <lb/>
     its progress, its advancement, its increasing 
     <lb/>
     light and knowledge and its ever growing 
     <lb/>
     generosity and tolerance and be broad 
     <lb/>
     enough to say : Men will be men when I 
     <lb/>
     am dead and gone, with the same generous 
     <lb/>
     impulses in their hearts as those which they 
     <lb/>
     have to-day. Men will treat their brethren 
     <lb/>
     as brethren then as they treat them now. 
     <lb/>
     The argument of the hon. gentleman carried 
     <lb/>
     to its full extent is an argument for tyranny, 
     <lb/>
     and a bondage complete and enduring. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, let me reason for a moment with 
     <lb/>
     my friends. You say : We want a separ<lb break="no"/>ate school system ; we believe in it. Will 
     <lb/>
     you look for a moment at the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     view ? I do not know whether I am able 
     <lb/>
     to speak for all Protestantism or not, but I 
     <lb/>
     think I can fairly and reasonably outline 
     <lb/>
     the view of that Protestantism which stands 
     <lb/>
     behind the national schools. What it it? That 
     <lb/>
     the schools shall be national, shall be free, 
     <lb/>
     shall he non-sectarian, busying themselves 
     <lb/>
     with education alone, not leaving out educa<lb break="no"/>tion in morals and on the general lines of 
     <lb/>
     right and religious conduct, but absolutely 
     <lb/>
     free from all sectarianism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOUR2">Mr. BOURASSA</persName>. That is the American 
     <lb/>
     system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. It is not the American 
     <lb/>
     system alone, it is the Canadian system in 
     <lb/>
     every province except Quebec. Where 
     <lb/>
     did the right hon. leader of the government 
     <lb/>
     get his information when he stated in par<lb break="no"/>liament here the other day that in the 
     <lb/>
     schools of Canada religion and reli<lb break="no"/>gious dogmas were taught from morning 
     <lb/>
     till night ? Has the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     ever looked into our school systems ? Go 
     <lb/>
     to the province of Ontario, go to the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba, go to the province of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, go to all of them and that is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely the wrong explanation and the 
     <lb/>
     wrong interpretation. These schools are 
     <lb/>
     free, non-sectarian and consequently nation<lb break="no"/>al. They do not allow dogma to be taught 
     <lb/>
     whether it is dogma of the Methodist, the 
     <lb/>
     Presbyterian, the Anglican or the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic. All are treated alike. Is there 
     <lb/>
     no reasonableness in the proposition, that, 
     <lb/>
     if the great majority of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     country feel that the best kind of a 
     <lb/>system is a system as that, so<lb/>

     long as it in no way offends against the 
     <lb/>
     religious belief, the teachings and the dog<lb break="no"/>ma of any class or creed, it shall be a na<lb break="no"/>tional system to which we shall all contri<lb break="no"/>bute ? In that way they declare that the 
     <lb/>
     children meet together and that there are 
     <lb/>
     no distinctions between them. In their 
     <lb/>
     sports, in their studies, in their social growth 
     <lb/>
     they mingle and commingle, they learn to 
     <lb/>
     know each other, they grow up with a com<lb break="no"/>mon bond and a common interest in their 
     <lb/>
     country and the affairs of their country. 
     <lb/>
     That is their view. It may be wrong or it 
     <lb/>
     may be right. Then they say that by that 
     <lb/>
     system we avoid the divisions into separate 
     <lb/>
     districts with their consequent inefficiency, 
     <lb/>
     and increased cost. Therefore, they say, 
     <lb/>
     we have a more efficient system and we 
     <lb/>
     have also a less costly system. That is 
     <lb/>
     their point of view. Let manners and 
     <lb/>
     morals, let the bases of right con<lb break="no"/>duct be taught in the schools, let those be 
     <lb/>
     inculcated, but no dogma of any sect. Let 
     <lb/>
     each class teach their dogma where they 
     <lb/>
     please ; it may be in the Sunday school, or 
     <lb/>
     in the church, or in some other place, but if 
     <lb/>
     there is any sect, Presbyterian, Methodist, 
     <lb/>
     Church of England or Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     which wishes to teach their own belief and 
     <lb/>
     their own religion in any institution gov<lb break="no"/>erned by themselves, there is no law which 
     <lb/>
     forbids them to do it in this country. There 
     <lb/>
     is no prohibition. These are in broad terms 
     <lb/>
     the distinctive characteristics of the national 
     <lb/>
     school system. Suppose the Presbyterians 
     <lb/>
     were to say : We want dogmatic teaching. 
     <lb/>
     the answer to them would be : Provide for 
     <lb/>
     it as best you may : you have your churches, 
     <lb/>
     you have your Sunday schools, teach reli<lb break="no"/>gion in them : you can have your colleges 
     <lb/>
     and your seminaries and your institutions 
     <lb/>
      which are entirely under your religious dom<lb break="no"/>ination, teach religion in them. And the 
     <lb/>same answer is given to every body, Prot<lb break="no"/>estant sect, Catholic sect, any sect. Where 
     <lb/>is the tyranny in that ?

     the argument presented by the government

     of Manitoba on the second appeal in the

     schools was a glaring injustice to the Roman 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     the Manitoba legislature had revoked these

     <lb/>
     taken back that the question came before

     <lb/>
     I wish to take my last point, not to treat 
     <lb/>
     it as fully as it deserves, but simply to 
     <lb/>
     throw out a few thoughts by way of sug<lb break="no"/>gestion. I want to ask in the first place 
     <lb/>
     why there should be any attempt to inject 
     <lb/>
     into the constitution of these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     the principle of separate schools, without 
     <lb/>
     authority from them, against the disposi<lb break="no"/>tion and against the feelings of the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest so far as we can judge ? 
     <lb/>
     Why is this attempt made to cripple 
     <lb/>
     these great provinces? Each of the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, is absolutely free and sovereign 
     <lb/>
     in so far as such legislation is concerned. 
     <lb/>
     Each one of these provinces of her own good 
     <lb/>
     will may enact a separate school system 
     <lb/>
     and it may also abrogate that law, but if it 
     <lb/>
     does abrogate it it has to show cause before 
     <lb/>
     the jurisdiction of the federal parliament 
     <lb/>
     and with the possible consequence of re<lb break="no"/>medial legislation. And if we can trust all 
     <lb/>
     these other provinces what reason in the 
     <lb/>
     world is there that we should for ever tag 
     <lb/>
     with a badge of inferiority these two great 
     <lb/>
     coming provinces of the Northwest? When 
     <lb/>
     every other province stands clothed in the 
     <lb/>
     majesty of provincial rights, why should we 
     <lb/>
     single out Saskatchewan and Alberta, and 
     <lb/>
     because we happen to be the guardian of 
     <lb/>
     the children put upon them for ever a badge 
     <lb/>
     of inferiority ? Is it not a retrograde 
     <lb/>
     step in thought and in practice to stand 
     <lb/>
     on our small platform of 1905 and to hold 
     <lb/>
     up a statute of limitations for ever in the 
     <lb/>
     face of two provinces, in which, as the cen<lb break="no"/>turies roll on changes must inevitably come, 
     <lb/>
     systems come and systems go, new methods 
     <lb/>
     take the place of old. But the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman stands up here with his small 
     <lb/>
     statute of limitation and he declares against 
     <lb/>
     the whole possible progress of these great 
     <lb/>

     parts of Canada with their coming millions 
     <lb/>
     of population, and their conditions in years 
     <lb/>
     and centuries to come, as diverse from this 
     <lb/>
     year and this century as the human mind 
     <lb/>
     can imagine. It is a task which is unwise to 
     <lb/>
     essay ; it is absolutely impossible of success<lb break="no"/>ful accomplishment. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man may tag on this badge of bondage; he 
     <lb/>may put on his restrictions; he may utter 
     <lb/>an irrevocable decree of tutelage, but I 
     <lb/>tell him that against the free thought and 
     <lb/>free will of these two provinces with their 
     <lb/>coming millions of people, his statute of 
     <lb/>limitation will be as waste paper and his 
     <lb/>chains of bondage as weak as thread of 
     <lb/>fibre. There is no hand which can fashion 
     <lb/>the chain and drive the rivet that will en<lb break="no"/>compass and restrict these young giants of 
     <lb/>the Northwest in years to come. You may 
     <lb/>carry your project through and the Finance 
     <lb/>Minister may cry peace, peace, but the 
     <lb/>moment it is carried through and made ir<lb break="no"/>revocable, that moment begins against it 
     <lb/>the warfare of an unwilling people. The 
     <lb/>feelings of free men that their right to free<lb break="no"/>dom has been outraged and denied will not 
     <lb/>long lie dormant. Tolerant, if you appeal 
     <lb/>to his love of tolerance, the free man will 
     <lb/>forswear tolerance if you attempt to force 
     <lb/>upon him by superior and to a certain ex<lb break="no"/>tent foreign and outside force, a measure 
     <lb/>which he believes restricts his freedom. 
     <lb/>Do not run away with the conclusion that 
     <lb/>we here are able to shackle the millions of 
     <lb/>the future in the Northwest.

            <p>
     What answer have you in face of the 
     <lb/>
     fact that every other province has this 
     <lb/>
     liberty, and has treated with remarkable 
     <lb/>
     toleration the minority within its bounda<lb break="no"/>ries—vaunted and boasted in every part of 
     <lb/>
     this House ? What right have you to say 
     <lb/>
     to the people of the Northwest : We can 
     <lb/>
     trust our fellow-citizens in the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but we cannot trust you. More illo<lb break="no"/>gical still, the member for Labelle said : We 
     <lb/>
     could trust the people who are there now. 
     <lb/>
     Trust the member for Edmonton (Mr. Oli<lb break="no"/>ver), who voted over and over again for 
     <lb/>
     resolutions to destroy the rights of the mi<lb break="no"/>nority in the Northwest? Trust the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon, who has abandoned his 
     <lb/>
     principles for the sake of his party's suc<lb break="no"/>cess, but who, in the very moment that 
     <lb/>
     he abandons them, still plucks up courage 
     <lb/>
     to say, I believe in them still, I am proud 
     <lb/>
     of my allegiance to them ? You can trust 
     <lb/>
     these, but you cannot trust the coming peo<lb break="no"/>ples of the Northwest. Never was there a 
     <lb/>
     more retrograde doctrine taught by the 
     <lb/>
     greatest Tory of the ages than is taught 
     <lb/>
     in that sentence by the hon. member for

     west, no one could tell what would happen 
     <lb/>
     in the future, when large numbers of peo<lb break="no"/>ple from the United States and other coun<lb break="no"/>tries settled there ; and, so far as the pre<lb break="no"/>sent rulers of the Northwest were con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I said I could not trust them in the 
     <lb/>
     light of their past legislation, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. If the member for La<lb break="no"/>belle said that, then I misunderstood him, 
     <lb/>
     and my argument does not apply to him. 
     <lb/>
     I want only fair argument. There was an 
     <lb/>
     argument which somewhat cut the ground 
     <lb/>
     from under the feet of the member for La<lb break="no"/>belle. He said : Put separate schools into 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest and treat the French people 
     <lb/>
     well and the French people will flow into 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest and become your most stable 
     <lb/>
     settlers, lovers of the soil, as the French 
     <lb/>
     people always are, lovers of their home, as 
     <lb/>
     they are wherever they settle. But does the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member recollect that into the coun<lb break="no"/>try to the south of us, with its Godless 
     <lb/>
     schools, its secular schools, its denial of 
     <lb/>
     the French language and all other rights of 
     <lb/>
     the minority, hundreds of thousands of the 
     <lb/>
     choice youth of the province of Quebec have 
     <lb/>
     gone and go from year to year to make their 
     <lb/>
     homes ? Will the restriction, if you put it 
     <lb/>
     upon the Northwest, in principle unjust 
     <lb/>
     and in practice irksome, be worth the paper 
     <lb/>
     it is written upon ? Under the ordinances 
     <lb/>
     as they are to-day rules are made by the 
     <lb/>
     commissioners. You do not crystallize one 
     <lb/>
     of those regulations into law. You simply 
     <lb/>
     provide that the ordinance shall stand, and 
     <lb/>
     the ordinance with reference to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools is absolutely the same as the provi<lb break="no"/>sion in the law of 1875. Why is it that to<lb break="no"/>day those schools are not the same as they 
     <lb/>were twenty years ago ? Because with the 
     <lb/>power to make regulations which the com<lb break="no"/>missioner has under these ordinances, regula<lb break="no"/>tions have been made which have trans<lb break="no"/>formed those schools into what they are to<lb break="no"/>day. Pass your ordinance and put it into 
     <lb/>the constitution, and if the people of the 
     <lb/>Northwest, in their provincial assemblies, 
     <lb/>are opposed to the principle, are opposed to 
     <lb/>reverting to the old form, they will make 
     <lb/>their regulations as they please, and I would 
     <lb/>like to know how you propose to stop them. 
     <lb/>It is absolutely impossible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     All this discussion, Mr. Speaker, if I may 
     <lb/>
     be allowed to say so, seems out of place in 
     <lb/>
     this House. To discuss the school systems 
     <lb/>
     of the United States, of Spain, of Germany, 
     <lb/>
     of France, of these provinces, to try to 
     <lb/>
     settle which has the greatest merits in all its 
     <lb/>
     principles and details, is something that is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely foreign to this House, and that 
     <lb/>
     never should be brought here—has no place 
     <lb/>
     here legitimately. As I said before, the 
     <lb/>
     plea may be good, but you are in the wrong 
     <lb/>
     court. To the province you should go for 
     <lb/>
     these tolerant privileges, these rights which 
     <lb/>
     you wish to have by law. The province 
     <lb/>
     alone can give them, and, as the ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior said the other day : ' I 
     <lb/>

     am still strongly of opinion that if the Ca<lb break="no"/>tholic minority will trust to the legislatures 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest, in the end they will be 
     <lb/>
     better off thereby.' If that is done, we can 
     <lb/>
     bid farewell to these discussions in this 
     <lb/>
     House, where different races and creeds are 
     <lb/>
     represented, and where the active passions, 
     <lb/>
     good or bad, are always aroused when you 
     <lb/>
     come to questions of religious belief and 
     <lb/>
     dogma. These questions will then no longer 
     <lb/>
     intervene to disquiet and paralyze the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of this country. Let these questions 
     <lb/>
     be fought out in the province, which is the 
     <lb/>
     ultimate tribunal ; and again I plead for 
     <lb/>
     absolute, unrestricted freedom and confi<lb break="no"/>dence in the tolerance of the Northwest peo<lb break="no"/>ple, now and in the future, for fair treat<lb break="no"/>ment to all their fellow-citizens.

     I desire merely to say a few words. The 
     <lb/>
     other day a statement was made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) to 
     <lb/>
     the effect that the city of Ottawa had vio<lb break="no"/>lated its contract with the Ottawa Electric 
     <lb/>
     Company. In making this statement, I pre<lb break="no"/>sume the hon. gentleman had in his mind 
     <lb/>
     the resolution passed by the city council of 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa some years ago. A motion was 
     <lb/>
     then presented in the council asking that a 
     <lb/>
     monopoly be given the Ottawa Electric 
     <lb/>
     Company, and that motion was carried. 
     <lb/>
     But, of course, in order to become effective, 
     <lb/>
     it was necessary that it should be put in 
     <lb/>
     the form of an agreement and that a by<lb break="no"/>law should be adopted by the council rati<lb break="no"/>fying that agreement. This was never done. 
     <lb/>
     There was considerable feeling at the time, 
     <lb/>
     and no sooner was the motion carried than 
     <lb/>
     a notice of reconsideration was given. The 
     <lb/>
     following day it was pointed out by the 
     <lb/>
     city solicitor that it would be a violation of 
     <lb/>
     the common law to carry through any ar<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3394</fw>
         
rangement of that kind. Of course, the 
     <lb/>
     mere adopting of the motion by the council 
     <lb/>
     could have no more effect than the first 
     <lb/>
     reading of a Bill by this House. There was 
     <lb/>
     simply a resolution passed by the council, 
     <lb/>
     but that resolution was never put into the 
     <lb/>
     form of an agreement, and it was pointed 
     <lb/>
     out by the city solicitor that no corpora<lb break="no"/>tion could have any power to enter into any 
     <lb/>
     such agreement. No contract having been 
     <lb/>
     made, it is not correct to say that the city 
     <lb/>
     has violated any agreement it has with the 
     <lb/>
     company. I think it is only due to the 
     <lb/>
     city that I should make this correction of 
     <lb/>
     the statement of my hon. friend, who, I 
     <lb/>
     am sure, would not willingly do any in<lb break="no"/>justice to the Ottawa city council. Another 
     <lb/>
     statement to which I wish to draw attention 
     <lb/>
     is that made by the Minister of Justice to 
     <lb/>
     the effect that the city of Ottawa was en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to trespass on the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa Electric Company. I wish to give 
     <lb/>
     that statement a positive contradiction. 
     <lb/>
     The city council of Ottawa are not en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to trespass on any vested rights. 
     <lb/>
     It is the Ottawa Electric Company which 
     <lb/>
     is asking for this legislation, and the city 
     <lb/>
     council are simply asking to be guarded 
     <lb/>
     against any injustice. The feeling in this 
     <lb/>
     city is very strong against the passage of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. We consider it to be an invasion 
     <lb/>
     of our municipal rights. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) evidently 
     <lb/>
     misunderstood another statement which I 
     <lb/>
     made. I was pointing out that members of 
     <lb/>
     this House, who are not residents of the 
     <lb/>
     city of Ottawa, cannot have the same in<lb break="no"/>terest in this matter as the city representa<lb break="no"/>tives. We do not dispute the right of any 
     <lb/>
     member to make up his mind as to how 
     <lb/>
     he will vote on the Bill, but it is only fair 
     <lb/>
     that the members from outside the city 
     <lb/>
     should pause and consider the effect which 
     <lb/>
     this Bill will have on the rights of the muni<lb break="no"/>cipality. I have nothing more to say on this 
     <lb/>
     question. The arguments are before the 
     <lb/>
     House. The people of this city consider that 
     <lb/>
     it would be an injustice to them to pass 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, and I appeal to members on both 
     <lb/>
     sides to vote against it.

     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName> (South York). I 
     <lb/>
     think that my hon. friend from Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Stewart) has made out a very good 
     <lb/>
     case. The more we discuss this measure, 
     <lb/>
     the more it becomes evident that it is a 
     <lb/>
     raid on the revenues of the people of Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa, and that this parliament ought to 
     <lb/>
     refuse to pass it. This parliament has no 
     <lb/>
     reason to occupy itself with the domestic 
     <lb/>
     affairs of the city of Ottawa, especially in 
     <lb/>
     a matter so extremely local. The question 
     <lb/>
     never should have come to this House, and 
     <lb/>
     the Bill is evidently an invasion of the 
     <lb/>
     municipal rights of the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario. The matter should really be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with in the Ontario legislature. In Toronto

     this Bill is regarded as an invasion of muni<lb break="no"/>cipal rights. We have had produced here

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. CAMPBELL. This Gold Medal Man<lb break="no"/>ufacturing Company acquired this patent 
     <lb/>
     some time ago, but through an oversight 
     <lb/>
     they allowed it to lapse, without paying 
     <lb/>
     the fees to renew the patent as they had a 
     <lb/>
     right to do. This was done through some 
     <lb/>
     oversight, I do not know whether it was 
     <lb/>
     their own fault or the fault of their soli<lb break="no"/>citor, at all events it was done ; and they 
     <lb/>
     ask this parliament to allow them to renew 
     <lb/>
     the patent.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I think there should be 
     <lb/>
     some provision in this Bill for companies or 
     <lb/>
     individuals who may have commenced man<lb break="no"/>ufacturing in the meantime. I see no pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the Bill before me for any such 
     <lb/>
     case. We have made that a rule for a good 
     <lb/>
     many years, and I see no reason why it 
     <lb/>
     should be departed from in this instance. 
     <lb/>
     There may or may not have been any par<lb break="no"/>ties starting manufacturing in the mean<lb break="no"/>time, but if so, their acquired rights should 
     <lb/>
     be protected.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEME3">Mr. L. P. DEMERS</persName>. These parties rep<lb break="no"/>resented to the committee that they had 
     <lb/>
     invested a large amount of money in that 
     <lb/>
     business, and that their time was going to 
     <lb/>
     expire, that they have only one year more. 
     <lb/>
     Since that patent was obtained, in 1891, I 
     <lb/>
     think it was, the law has been changed, and 
     <lb/>
     instead of giving fifteen years for the pa<lb break="no"/>tent to run, now it is eighteen years. They 
     <lb/>
     represented to us that under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances they had incurred great cost, and 
     <lb/>
     that having received only a poor return it 
     <lb/>
     would be only fair to give them an exten<lb break="no"/>sion of six years. The objection was made 
     <lb/>
     that they should get only three years in 
     <lb/>
     order to put them on the same footing as 
     <lb/>
     a new patentee, but it has been represented 
     <lb/>
     by the department that the fees were usual<lb break="no"/>ly paid for six years. It is under these

     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Hon. Sir WILLIAM MULOCK</persName> (Postmas<lb break="no"/>ter General). Mr. Speaker, for three hours 
     <lb/>
     this afternoon the House had the advantage 
     <lb/>
     of hearing the views of the hon. gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     not upon the subject under discussion, but 
     <lb/>
     upon many matters totally foreign to the 
     <lb/>
     measure that the House is now consider<lb break="no"/>ing. If, this afternoon, a stranger had been 
     <lb/>
     in our galleries, and many there were, and 
     <lb/>
     had not in advance been informed of the 
     <lb/>
     subject under debate, it would have been 
     <lb/>
     impossible for him to have known what the 
     <lb/>
     subject was that was properly in order be<lb break="no"/>fore the House. For three hours this after<lb break="no"/>noon the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster) occupied the attention of the 
     <lb/>
     House ostensibly in order to aid by some 
     <lb/>
     useful contribution in the solution of a 
     <lb/>
     very important public question, but instead 
     <lb/>
     of bringing to the aid of his country his 
     <lb/>
     great talents, I think it will be found on a 
     <lb/>
     careful perusal of his words that his efforts 
     <lb/>
     were rather to sow the seeds of discord to 
     <lb/>
     the injury of his country. He began by 
     <lb/>
     giving us, as he has on many occasions and 
     <lb/>
     as he also has given to the public, his views 
     <lb/>
     on the question of political principles and 
     <lb/>
     political morality. It must be extremely 
     <lb/>
     elevating to the people of Canada to take 
     <lb/>
     their inspiration of political morality from 
     <lb/>
     such a source. He entered politics with 
     <lb/>
     principles. He describes the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     as conveniently packing their principles in 
     <lb/>
     a remote corner of a small valise, and he 
     <lb/>
     states that they are able to get rid of them 
     <lb/>
     as conveniently as they can put them in or 
     <lb/>
     take them out of the valise. What about 
     <lb/>
     the principles of the hon. gentleman ? I 
     <lb/>
     can recall many of his professed principles, 
     <lb/>
     for perhaps his principles are not very deep- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     seated, and, like old garments, they are 
     <lb/>

            <fw type="num">3401</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 29, 1905</fw> 
      

     easily disposed of in favour of new ones. 
     <lb/>
     I remember the first principle be advocated 
     <lb/>
     when he entered public life. He came here 
     <lb/>
     with a valise, and I suppose he had his 
     <lb/>
     political principles in the valise. What was 
     <lb/>
     the first principle he had in his valise ? 
     <lb/>
     It was a principle which served a useful 
     <lb/>
     purpose. His great political principle, and 
     <lb/>
     before it all other great questions faded 
     <lb/>
     into insignificance, was prohibition.  The 
     <lb/>
     welfare of the country demanded that the 
     <lb/>
     first consideration, higher than that of party, 
     <lb/>
     should be given to the question of prohibi<lb break="no"/>tion. That was his political capital for 
     <lb/>
     many a year ; that was the only article in 
     <lb/>
     his political valise. He arrived in Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     with his political valise. Perhaps I am 
     <lb/>
     wrong in saying that he had only one prin<lb break="no"/>ciple. He had another stowed away which 
     <lb/>
     did not take up much room and did not 
     <lb/>
     occupy a very long time in that valise, but 
     <lb/>
     he entered this House pledged as an inde<lb break="no"/>pendent Conservative to stand up for all 
     <lb/>
     good measures. Party was a secondary 
     <lb/>
     consideration for him ; his country de<lb break="no"/>manded his first attention. He had these 
     <lb/>
     two principles when he entered public life. 
     <lb/>
     What became of them ? The independent 
     <lb/>
     Conservative principle could not be allowed 
     <lb/>
     to stand, because it stood in the way of pre<lb break="no"/>ferment, and so the first thing that happen<lb break="no"/>ed his little valise was to deprive it of the 
     <lb/>
     presence in it of his principle of political 
     <lb/>
     independence. It stood in the way of his 
     <lb/>
     entering the cabinet. It was thrown over<lb break="no"/>board and he got a portfolio. But it was 
     <lb/>
     not enough to get a portfolio. It is one 
     <lb/>
     thing to get a portfolio ; it is another thing 
     <lb/>
     to retain a portfolio. He has had some ex<lb break="no"/>perience in both of these. He had to get rid 
     <lb/>
     of his other principle, and prohibition was 
     <lb/>
     thrown overboard, and with it his little 
     <lb/>
     valise. As time advanced be deemed it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to avow his being devoutly pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of another principle. What was that 
     <lb/>
     principle ? He had taken office. He had 
     <lb/>
     become a strict party man. It was essential 
     <lb/>
     to him an apostate now but then a party 
     <lb/>
     man, that he should stand by his party, that 
     <lb/>
     he should be true to the government of 
     <lb/>
     which he was a member and true to the 
     <lb/>
     premier under whom he enlisted. His prin<lb break="no"/>ciple was—and it was a right one ; it was 
     <lb/>
     a principle that he was bound to live up to 
     <lb/>
     —that he should be true and loyal to his 
     <lb/>
     chief. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     That is one of the principles he made pro<lb break="no"/>fession of, but how long did that principle 
     <lb/>
     remain in his valise? It was there until it 
     <lb/>
     suited his purpose to dispose of it, and when 
     <lb/>
     was that? Sir John Macdonald, who first 
     <lb/>
     took him into office, had disappeared, others 
     <lb/>
     had been his chiefs and had disappeared 
     <lb/>
     also, and at last he enlisted under the ban<lb break="no"/>ner of Sir Mackenzie Bowell. The history 
     <lb/>
     of Canada tells what then became of his 
     <lb/>
     principle of loyalty to his chief; the scenes 
     <lb/>
     that took place in this chamber and in the 
     <lb/>
     ante-rooms and lobbies of this House tell 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3402</fw>
      

     what he did with that principle. Lastly, 
     <lb/>
     in 1896, on the eve of an election, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman evidently believing that it was 
     <lb/>
     good politics to stand by the minority, de<lb break="no"/>clared his undying allegiance to the cause 
     <lb/>
     of minorities. In 1896 he advocated the 
     <lb/>
     cause of minorities, he talked of respect for 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, but he found it didn't pay 
     <lb/>
     and to-day he seizes the opportunity to 
     <lb/>
     sever himself from the last of his political 
     <lb/>
     principles. No longer has the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man any use for a political valise; hereafter 
     <lb/>
     a carpet bag will take its place.

     ministers and ex-ministers and in one of his 
     <lb/>
     outbursts he said that he hoped for once 
     <lb/>
     some minister would go out of office for the 
     <lb/>
     sake of principle and would remain out of 
     <lb/>
     office for the sake of principle. The thought 
     <lb/>
     of going out of office and remaining out of 
     <lb/>
     office is a disturbing dream to the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Foster). He cannot address a 
     <lb/>
     public meeting nor can he speak in parlia<lb break="no"/>ment without talking of ministerial expla<lb break="no"/>nations and the principles of public men. 
     <lb/>
     Let the hon. gentleman be frank and tell 
     <lb/>
     us if he resigned on principle. A few months 
     <lb/>
     ago he told the electors of North Toronto, 
     <lb/>
     if he is reported correctly in his own organs, 
     <lb/>
     that he resigned office on a question of 
     <lb/>
     policy. I was present in this chamber when 
     <lb/>
     he stated to this House the reasons why he 
     <lb/>
     resigned office, and in those reasons there 
     <lb/>
     was no question of principle involved. He 
     <lb/>
     then declared that there was no difference 
     <lb/>
     between himself and his leader on any 
     <lb/>
     question of principle or of policy, but what 
     <lb/>
     is the sequel? That has been told us of 
     <lb/>
     late, and it is an extraordinary explanation. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. gentleman (Mr. Foster) told us in 
     <lb/>
     1896 that he had resigned not from personal 
     <lb/>
     ambition of any kind, but for the good of 
     <lb/>
     the party and of the country. But, a few 
     <lb/>
     weeks ago, the Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell, 
     <lb/>
     his late chief and leader, speaking in an<lb break="no"/>other chamber, told us why he had resigned. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps he will now admit or deny the ac<lb break="no"/>curacy of Sir Mackenzie Bowell's assertion. 
     <lb/>
     Sir Mackenze Bowell declared that the resig<lb break="no"/>nation of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Foster) 
     <lb/>
     was not on account of any difference of 
     <lb/>
     policy or principle, but because of the over<lb break="no"/>weening ambition of the hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>
    become Prime Minister of Canada. The 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman (Mr. Foster) smiles. I will 
     <lb/>make it clear to him. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>is setting himself up as a standard for the 
     <lb/>guidance of the public men of this country. 
     <lb/>but let us see whether he is a safe guide. 
     <lb/>Sir Mackenzie Bowell said (I quote from 
     <lb/>Senate ' Hansard,' 1st March, 1905) :

     But added that on all points of importance 
     <lb/>
     they must have a union of ideas and that any 
     <lb/>
     one disagreeing must resign. That, he said, was 
     <lb/>
     all they had done. Continuing, he said, ' When 
     <lb/>
     a member of the cabinet or members disagreed 
     <lb/>
     with their leader they had done as they were 
     <lb/>
     bound on their honour to do—resigned.' In 
     <lb/>
     another speech he said : ' The Governor had 
     <lb/>
     been quite satisfied with the reasons for the 
     <lb/>
     resignation of six ministers on a question of 
     <lb/>
     policy, and had shown his confidence in them 
     <lb/>
     by reappointing them later.' That did not 
     <lb/>
     satisfy his hearers, one of whom exclaimed : 
     <lb/>
     ' That still leaves the question unanswered. 
     <lb/>
     Why did you resign ? ' To which Mr. Foster 
     <lb/>
     replied ' I don't intend to answer. I am not at 
     <lb/>
     liberty to reveal the secrets of the Privy Coun<lb break="no"/>cil.' An ingenious way of evading an answer. 
     <lb/>
     The fact is, the reasons given in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons for his resigning were never dis<lb break="no"/>cussed in the Privy Council before he resigned, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, he had no oath to respect in that par<lb break="no"/>ticular.

     Again, speaking in this chamber not very

     That was the statement of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in this House during the present ses<lb break="no"/>sion, but how does that fit in with the state<lb break="no"/>ment he made on the very occasion of his 
     <lb/>
     resignation when he was probably most 
     <lb/>
     likely to give an accurate account. Speak<lb break="no"/>ing from his seat in 1896 he said:

            <p>
     I leave my hon. friend to struggle with 
     <lb/>
     these two conflicting statements. He goes 
     <lb/>
     on to give what he deems to be the reason, 
     <lb/>
     namely, the desire to serve under a gentle<lb break="no"/>man of perhaps greater power. In fact he 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3404</fw>
           

     describes the cabinet as beyond the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the First Minister. He was unable 
     <lb/>
     to keep those unruly members in order. 
     <lb/>
     There was disorder in the cabinet, and the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Toronto added to 
     <lb/>
     the disorder by trying to break up the cab<lb break="no"/>inet. Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     seems to be troubled when any retiring min<lb break="no"/>ister returns to the cabinet, and he seems 
     <lb/>
     to be troubled when any retiring minister 
     <lb/>
     remains without the cabinet. He takes ex<lb break="no"/>ception to Mr. Blair not having returned. 
     <lb/>
     No person can take exception to his con<lb break="no"/>duct in that respect. But when the honour<lb break="no"/>able member for North Toronto went out of 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet, he took precious good care that 
     <lb/>
     no one should get into his place. He ren<lb break="no"/>dered the reconstruction impossible except 
     <lb/>
     by his readmission to the cabinet. Does 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman set up that method as 
     <lb/>
     a standard ? Is that his idea of political 
     <lb/>
     morality ? Is that his conception of what 
     <lb/>
     should be the conduct of hon. gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     take office to serve their country ? Surely 
     <lb/>
     it is time for him to throw off this hypocri<lb break="no"/>tical garb in which he seeks to give moral 
     <lb/>
     lectures as to how public men should be 
     <lb/>
     loyal to their principles. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To-day, running through the whole of 
     <lb/>
     his speech, I thought I was able to dis<lb break="no"/>cover one distinct line of policy. The Bill 
     <lb/>
     before the House is one to deal with a 
     <lb/>
     very important question concerning the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. It is a question upon which 
     <lb/>
     the people may he honestly divided in opin<lb break="no"/>ion; but it is the bounden duty of every 
     <lb/>
     loyal citizen and of every member of this 
     <lb/>
     House to render such assistance as he can 
     <lb/>
     to bring about a satisfactory settlement of 
     <lb/>
     this question. What was the action of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman ? If I have correctly read 
     <lb/>
     his policy, if I have discovered the object 
     <lb/>
     he had in his speech, it was not to be a 
     <lb/>
     messenger of peace and harmony, but if 
     <lb/>
     possible to light the incendiary fires of reli<lb break="no"/>gious and racial discord from one end of 
     <lb/>
     this Dominion to the other. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman represents North Toronto. In olden 
     <lb/>
     days he came from the east. He stayed 
     <lb/>
     there as long as the people would keep him. 
     <lb/>
     In olden days, Mr. Speaker, I doubt if he 
     <lb/>
     would have professed the principles that 
     <lb/>
     he has professed to-day. But, Sir, he has 
     <lb/>
     rested in another place, and his new prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of to-day are appropriate and fash<lb break="no"/>ionable in North Toronto, and he put them 
     <lb/>
     on, and with a great deal of force throws 
     <lb/>
     off the old discarded ones. What object 
     <lb/>
     had the hon. gentleman in asking the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) whether or 
     <lb/>
     not he was content with the amendments 
     <lb/>
     of the government ? The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     North Toronto, holding up these amend<lb break="no"/>ments to the member for Labelle, who is as 
     <lb/>
     we all know a devout son of his church, 
     <lb/>
     said to him in triumph: All the comfort and 
     <lb/>
     consolation you can get from these amend<lb break="no"/>ments is that at half-past three o'clock in 
     <lb/>

     the afternoon, when practically the school 
     <lb/>
     day is over, a half-hour of religious train<lb break="no"/>ing will be allowed ; and he asked 
     <lb/>
     the member for Labelle if he was content 
     <lb/>
     with such a meagre provision as that. What 
     <lb/>
     was the object of that ? It was too trans<lb break="no"/>parent—perhaps the hon. gentleman thought 
     <lb/>
     no one could see it. The object of that 
     <lb/>
     was to tell the people of Quebec : Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier is giving you, not bread, but 
     <lb/>
     a stone ; he is not giving you any measure 
     <lb/>
     that will meet the views and feelings and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the prejudices of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ; he is deceiving you, and I want to 
     <lb/>
     convince the member for Labelle of that 
     <lb/>
     fact, and I trust to his being a missionary 
     <lb/>
     to disseminate that doctrine in Quebec, and 
     <lb/>
     to stir up the good people of the province 
     <lb/>
     to demand more from Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 
     <lb/>
     and perhaps to embarrass his policy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     When the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     comes to deal with - the Territories, what 
     <lb/>
     does he say ?   In loud language and in vio<lb break="no"/>lent terms he says, why bind these young 
     <lb/>
     giants in this way ? And he goes on to 
     <lb/>
     say : If you give this measure to the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, Nova Scotia is entitled to the same, 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia is entitled to it, all the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces that do not enjoy it are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to it. He appeals to the Territories 
     <lb/>
     practically to rise in revolt against this 
     <lb/>
     measure if it becomes law, and, if possible 
     <lb/>
     to make it a great political question ; and 
     <lb/>
     at the same time he appeals to the minori<lb break="no"/>ties in the other provinces, saying to them : 
     <lb/>
     The minority in the new provinces have got 
     <lb/>
     something—you demand it too. He thus 
     <lb/>
     appeals to one class and another—to the 
     <lb/>
     French Catholics of Quebec, to the Irish 
     <lb/>
     Catholics in another province, to the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants in another, trusting that by raising 
     <lb/>
     these fires in each of these provinces, he 
     <lb/>
     may at last involve this whole Dominion in 
     <lb/>
     one huge, far-reaching religious conflagra<lb break="no"/>tion. Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is here to voice the sentiments 
     <lb/>
     of his constituents. But, Sir, I regard them 
     <lb/>
     as taking a higher view of the duties of 
     <lb/>
     their representative than to demand of him 
     <lb/>
     that he shall play the role of the political 
     <lb/>
     incendiary on the floor of this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. gentleman assailed the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. Whenever, for a mo<lb break="no"/>ment, any other line of thought failed him, 
     <lb/>
     he turned to the ex-minister, who seemed 
     <lb/>
     to be the special object of his poisoned 
     <lb/>
     shafts. Mr. Speaker, I have had an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of judging of the services rendered 
     <lb/>
     to this country by the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior for the last eight years. He as<lb break="no"/>sumed the most important portfolio having 
     <lb/>
     regard to the needs of this country, that 
     <lb/>
     we have. Other men before him had held 
     <lb/>
     it. and had failed. For years our great 
     <lb/>
     prairies had remained almost a solitude. 
     <lb/>
     The late government had an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     for eighteen years to make an impression 
     <lb/>
     there, and failed; and when the member for 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3406</fw>
     

     Brandon (Mr. Sifton) assumed that port<lb break="no"/>folio, and the Manitoba school question dis<lb break="no"/>appeared from the vexed question of the 
     <lb/>
     day, a complete change came over the con<lb break="no"/>ditions of this country. I venture to say, 
     <lb/>
     what I have said before—and I say it with<lb break="no"/>out seeking to discredit any person—that of 
     <lb/>
     all the ministers who have held portfolios 
     <lb/>
     since confederation, none has rendered as 
     <lb/>
     valuable services to Canada as the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior, and his withdrawal 
     <lb/>
     from our cabinet is a national loss. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for North Toronto asked me 
     <lb/>
     if I was a member of the sub-committee 
     <lb/>
     that had had to do with considering the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the constitution of these Territo<lb break="no"/>ries. I was. He asked me if I had discov<lb break="no"/>ered the meaning of section 16, containing 
     <lb/>
     the educational clauses, which he has des<lb break="no"/>cribed as worded in such a subtle way as 
     <lb/>
     really to conceal their true object. Had it 
     <lb/>
     not been, he said. for the disclosure made 
     <lb/>
     by the member for Brandon of the mean<lb break="no"/>ing of those clauses. they would have pass<lb break="no"/>ed into law, and then this country would 
     <lb/>
     have been for ever under the obligation of 
     <lb/>
     maintaining an enormous endowment for 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic church. I do not admit, nor 
     <lb/>
     does the government, the correctness of the 
     <lb/>
     construction placed upon the original clause 
     <lb/>
     16 by the ex-Minister of the Interior. Law<lb break="no"/>yers may differ, and according to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) 213 
     <lb/>
     members of this House would have been de<lb break="no"/>ceived but for the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior. Does the hon. gentleman think that 
     <lb/>
     I am more astute to discover the weak points 
     <lb/>
     of the clause than the other 212 men? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. As a matter of fact, I did 
     <lb/>
     not say that. I said that the clause was so 
     <lb/>
     worded that had it not been for the dis<lb break="no"/>closure given of its meaning by the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of'the Interior, it doubtless would 
     <lb/>
     have passed through this House and its 
     <lb/>
     true meaning would have been undetected. 
     <lb/>
     That is what I said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Sir WILLIAM MULOCK</persName>. Well, I do not 
     <lb/>
     pretend to be more astute than, or even as 
     <lb/>
     astute as a very large number of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, but when the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman admits himself that he would not 
     <lb/>
     have discovered the hidden meaning in this 
     <lb/>
     clause and that all those around him would 
     <lb/>
     not have discovered it, surely he will be 
     <lb/>
     charitable to another weak member of hu<lb break="no"/>manity who was likewise not able to dis<lb break="no"/>cover it.

 <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Sir WILLIAM MULOCK</persName>. Yes ; it is 
     <lb/>sometimes necessary to go outside the re<lb break="no"/>cord, but I would ask the House to allow<lb/>me to return to the real issue. The hon.<lb/>gentleman from North Toronto (Mr. Foster)<lb/>spoke of the Quebec compact, which is to<lb/>be found in the British North America Act,<lb/>and declared that that compact, crys<lb break="no"/>tallized into the Confederation Act, did<lb/>no more than secure separate schools<lb/>to the minorities in the provinces of <lb/>Quebec and Ontario. He denied that any<lb/>other part of this Dominion was entitled to<lb/>separate schools under that Act. Let me <lb/>remind him that he gave the contrary view<lb/>to this House nine years ago. Then he was <lb/>arguing in favour of the constitution. Then<lb/>everything outside the constitutional argu<lb break="no"/>ment was, in his judgement, out of order.<lb/>When the hon. member for Wast Grey (Mr.<lb/>Sproule) ventured to interject something<lb/>that did not appear to have any strict bear<lb break="no"/>ing on the constitution, he was immediate<lb break="no"/>ly rebuked by his colleague from North<lb/>Toronto. He was immediately told by him<lb/>that the subject was one solely of the true<lb/>construction of the constitution. To-day he<lb/>tells us that under the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act, and the compact out of which it<lb/>grew, no province, except the provinces of<lb/>Quebec and Ontario, is entitled to the bene<lb break="no"/>fit of the 93rd section of that Act. Speak<lb break="no"/>ing on the 13th March, 1896, in this House,<lb/>as reported in 'Hansard,' page 3476, he<lb/>made use of the following language:<lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>The first question then for me to solve when<lb/>I approach the consideration of this subject is<lb/>this : Is there any compact or agreement ar<lb break="no"/>rived at in this country and embodied in the<lb/>constitution under which we live which has<lb/>first to be considered before we can give our<lb/>decision upon this question ? the answer is<lb/>plain and definite. There is a compact in the<lb/>constitution of the confederation ; there is a<lb/>second compact in the constitution of Manitoba,<lb/>ratified by the British parliament, and under<lb/>which she became a part of the Dominion<lb/>

            <p>If the hon. gentlemen will allow me to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed I will answer that question in due course,<lb/>and I will answer it thoroughly.

And it is argued by some <lb/>gentlemen that the proposed legislation<lb/>would be a violation of provincial rights.<lb/>But there can be no violation of a right<lb/>until that right is created.

     says, whether it works well or ill ; I care 
     <lb/>
     not whether it is to the public good or the 
     <lb/>
     public injury—every province has the same 
     <lb/>
     constitutional charter the moment it be<lb break="no"/>comes a province. The opposite view is that 
     <lb/>
     the province does not derive its charter 
     <lb/>
     automatically from the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act, but that the spirit of the British 
     <lb/>
    North America Act must be considered, 
     <lb/>and so much of its provisions as may 
     <lb/>be reasonably adapted to the provincial 
     <lb/>status is given to the new province. The 
     <lb/>British North America Act, in conferring 
     <lb/>upon the people of Canada certain legis<lb break="no"/>lative powers, has set forth in a gen<lb break="no"/>eral way a scheme for the distribution of 
     <lb/>legislative powers to be exercised by the 
     <lb/>Dominion or the provinces. It suggests in 
     <lb/>a general way that some of these powers, 
     <lb/>of which it gives a list, may properly be 
     <lb/>given to a province, and the others may 
     <lb/>properly be left to the Dominion. But the 
     <lb/>British North America Act, according to 
     <lb/>those who look at its spirit rather than its 
     <lb/>letter, does not in itself contain a model 
     <lb/>constitution that automatically attaches, 
     <lb/>without the variation of a word or a letter, 
     <lb/>to every province the moment it becomes the 
     <lb/>province. If the reasoning of the leader of 
     <lb/>the opposition is right, there is no reason 
     <lb/>why, when a province is establishcd, par<lb break="no"/>liament should trouble itself to declare any 
     <lb/>of these powers. And yet, if you trace the 
     <lb/>history of the several provinces of Canada 
     <lb/>from their creation up to the present, you 
     <lb/>will find that, in every instance, the parlia<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, or the government of Can<lb break="no"/>ada, or the imperial parliament, has con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon each province powers somewhat 
     <lb/>different from those that the Confederation 
     <lb/>Act would suggest. If each province gets 
     <lb/>its constitution automatically from the 
     <lb/>British North America Act, we in this House 
     <lb/>cannot in any way frame or limit the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the new provinces. But if we 
     <lb/>interpret the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>not by its letter, but by its spirit and by the 
     <lb/>manner in which it has been applied in 
     <lb/>the creation of every one of the provinces 
     <lb/>from confederation down to the present 
     <lb/>time. we fail to find a single instance where 
     <lb/>the doctrine of the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>has been adopted, where any province has 
     <lb/>been given a constitution exactly in har<lb break="no"/>mony with the general scheme of the British 
     <lb/>North America Act. There are no two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces whose constitutions are the same, 
     <lb/>though all derive their constitutions from 
     <lb/>the British North America Act. It is 
     <lb/>the spirit that suggests how the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion shall be framed. So, where is the 
     <lb/>model ? And how can it be argued that 
     <lb/>when a province acquires the provincial 
     <lb/>status it acquires immediately certain rights 
     <lb/>and powers without any intervention or 
     <lb/>exercise of discretion on the part of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament or any other legislative 
     <lb/>body? To illustrate what I mean, con<lb break="no"/>sider the character of the British North 
     <lb/>America Act. Sections 91, 92 and 93 cover 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3410</fw>
         

     the distribution of powers, some powers to 
     <lb/>
     be exercised by the central parliament and 
     <lb/>
     others by the provincial parliament. Take, 
     <lb/>
     for instance, the important subject of di<lb break="no"/>vorce. Under the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, divorce is assigned to the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament. 
     <lb/>
     If the literal wording of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act is adopted in giving a consti<lb break="no"/>tution to another province, you would not 
     <lb/>
     find any province entitled to maintain a 
     <lb/>
     divorce court unless it was so authorized 
     <lb/>
     by this parliament. This parliament has 
     <lb/>
     never established a divorce court in any 
     <lb/>
     province. And yet to-day there are divorce 
     <lb/>
     courts in several provinces—in Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick and, I think, in British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia. How comes it that the subject 
     <lb/>
     of divorce, which, under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. is assigned to the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament, is 
     <lb/>
     dealt with by several provinces? Simply 
     <lb/>
     because, when it came to the creation of 
     <lb/>
     confederation, certain provinces had at that 
     <lb/>
     time this institution. Nova Scotia had a 
     <lb/>
     divorce court and desired to retain it. The 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act allowed it to be 
     <lb/>
     retained in that province. In that respect 
     <lb/>
     it allowed a departure from the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. The province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec had no divorce court, and no divorce 
     <lb/>
     court was given it under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act—the Act recognized the status 
     <lb/>
     quo as respects that subject in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. New Brunswick had a divorce 
     <lb/>
     court and wished to retain it, and the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act recognized the wish of 
     <lb/>
     that province and allowed it to retain the 
     <lb/>
     divorce court, thus making an exception 
     <lb/>
     from the letter of the Act. Ontario had no 
     <lb/>
     divorce court and was given no divorce court 
     <lb/>
     by the Act. Later on British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     came into confederation. As I understand 
     <lb/>
     it, British Columbia had a divorce court 
     <lb/>
     then, and it was left in the employment of 
     <lb/>
     that institution—the letter of the law was 
     <lb/>
     departed from, but the spirit was observed ; 
     <lb/>
     the general scheme of confederation was 
     <lb/>
     made applicable, but, with exceptions, re<lb break="no"/>cognizing local peculiarities and local insti<lb break="no"/>tutions. Then—going rapidly over the sub<lb break="no"/>jects of special importance to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     —take the subject of languages. This is 
     <lb/>
     an English-speaking country ; and it was 
     <lb/>
     assumed, doubtless, that English would be 
     <lb/>
     the prevailing language throughout the 
     <lb/>
     country. The use of language in the courts 
     <lb/>
     and legislatures of the provinces is a civil 
     <lb/>
     right, and, as such, is under the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the province. Yet, turning 
     <lb/>
     to the constitution as affecting the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, you will find that, unlike the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, Quebec was not left to 
     <lb/>
     determine what languages shall or shall 
     <lb/>
     not be used in its courts and legislature, 
     <lb/>
     but the British North America Act declares 
     <lb/>
     that the English language, along with the 
     <lb/>
     French, shall be lawful in the courts and 
     <lb/>
     legislature of that province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     The letter of the constitution was depart<lb break="no"/>ed from as to the subject of language in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec, and was made suit<lb break="no"/>able to the local conditions, needs and in<lb break="no"/>terests of that province. Yet if the letter 
     <lb/>
     of the law is to be regarded, you have no 
     <lb/>
     justification for this departure from the con<lb break="no"/>stitution which is to be found in the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. Take the subject of 
     <lb/>
     education. At the time of confederation it 
     <lb/>
     was found that the minority in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec had separate schools. the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act preserved- separate 
     <lb/>
     schools to them; it was found that there 
     <lb/>
     were separate schools in Ontario, and the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act retained separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools in Ontario; there were no sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools in Nova Scotia, and the status 
     <lb/>
     quo was recognized there; there were no 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in New Brunswick, the 
     <lb/>
     status quo was recognized there. But al<lb break="no"/>though the British North America Act in its 
     <lb/>
     general scheme declared that the subject of 
     <lb/>
     education should be under the exclusive 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction of the provinces, it made two 
     <lb/>
     exceptions in the case of Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec, as my hon. friend admits to-day, and 
     <lb/>
     that exception extends to other provinces as 
     <lb/>
     well. Yet, if you were to adopt the strict 
     <lb/>
     letter of the law, you have no right in a 
     <lb/>
     constitution resting on the bed rock of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act to make these 
     <lb/>
     exceptions in the constitution of any prov<lb break="no"/>ince. Take the subject of finance. Although 
     <lb/>
     this is not strictly a constitutional subject, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that whilst the general scheme 
     <lb/>
     is to treat all the provinces alike financially, 
     <lb/>
     in the case of Prince Edward Island there 
     <lb/>
     was a material departure made from the 
     <lb/>
     general scheme of finance. In fact, you do 
     <lb/>
     not find the same corresponding financial 
     <lb/>
     arrangements made in any two provinces. 
     <lb/>
     In fact, there are just two ways of looking 
     <lb/>
     at the British North America Act; you may 
     <lb/>
     look at it from the standpoint of a lawyer, 
     <lb/>
     or you may look at it from the standpoint 
     <lb/>
     of a statesman. It' you look at it from the 
     <lb/>
     standpoint of a lawyer—and I submit that 
     <lb/>
     is the standpoint of the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion—you take the letter of the constitution 
     <lb/>
     without regard to its bearings and its ap<lb break="no"/>plication to the time being, and apply it 
     <lb/>
     literally, whether the application tits the 
     <lb/>
     time and occasion or not. But taking the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the Act on each occasion of creat<lb break="no"/>ing a new province, you adopt the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. as far as possible, to the new province, 
     <lb/>
     having due regard to the conditions then 
     <lb/>
     prevailing. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Take the case of Manitoba to which my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend has referred. The province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba was established in 1870, prior to 
     <lb/>
     that it had been under the jurisdiction of 
     <lb/>
     the Hudson Bay Company. There were no 
     <lb/>
     laws there except the old common law of 
     <lb/>
     England. There were no schools establish<lb break="no"/>ed by law, but it was thought that there 
     <lb/>
     were some schools established by practice, 
     <lb/>

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3412</fw>
   
      

     and, therefore, when it came to creating the 
     <lb/>
     province'of Manitoba the educational ques<lb break="no"/>tion arose. What was done? They did not 
     <lb/>
     even adhere on that occasion to the langu<lb break="no"/>age and t0 the provisions of section 93 0f 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the subject of legislation. The langu<lb break="no"/>age of the British North America Act deal<lb break="no"/>ing with education reads as follows:

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     'Have by law.' The British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act only protected the rights of minori<lb break="no"/>ties which they have by law. When it came 
     <lb/>
     to creating a province out of Rupert's Land, 
     <lb/>
     the words 'by law' would have afforded no 
     <lb/>
     protection to the minority, and accordingly 
     <lb/>
     those who were engaged in framing this 
     <lb/>
     legislation sought in some other way to 
     <lb/>
     secure to the minority in Manitoba their 
     <lb/>
     right to whatever schools they alight then 
     <lb/>
     have; and so the words 'by practice' were 
     <lb/>
     introduced, and the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     was secured in its separate schools in these 
     <lb/>

     Now, the words 'by practice' are a radi<lb break="no"/>cal departure from the letter of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. Why was that depar<lb break="no"/>ture ? How do we account for that depar<lb break="no"/>ture ? Simply because the strict letter of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act would not 
     <lb/>
     have met the case of Manitoba, and it was 
     <lb/>
     necessary to apply it in spirit, and in that 
     <lb/>
     way the legislators of those days felt jus<lb break="no"/>tified, within the constitution, in so modify<lb break="no"/>ing section 93. Now, what happened after 
     <lb/>
     that? Manitoba was carved out of Rupert's 
     <lb/>
     Land, the Territories we are about to raise 
     <lb/>
     into provinces are part of the remainder of 
     <lb/>
     Rupert's Land. The Manitoba Act was 
     <lb/>
     confirmed by imperial legislation, and that 
     <lb/>
     same imperial legislation which confirmed 
     <lb/>
     the Act creating the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     proceeded to confer upon the Dominion par<lb break="no"/>liament power to grant a constitution to 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. Section 2 of the amendment

     The very same Imperial Act that re<lb break="no"/>cognized the change in the words from the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act to the words 
     <lb/>
     used in the Manitoba Act, gave to this par<lb break="no"/>liament for the first time the power to give 
     <lb/>
     a constitution to new provinces. Now, what 
     <lb/>
     is the meaning of section 2 of this Act if it 
     <lb/>
     is not to give to this parliament discretion<lb break="no"/>ary power as to the kind of a constitution 
     <lb/>
     we may give to a province? If it was in<lb break="no"/>tended that this parliament should do no 
     <lb/>
     more than mark out the limits of a province 
     <lb/>
     and declare that it was made a province, 
     <lb/>
     the Act would have said so; but instead of 
     <lb/>
     that the Act proceeds to say that we may 
     <lb/>
     establish a province and make provision for 
     <lb/>
     its constitutional administration, for the 
     <lb/>
     passing of laws, for the peace, order and 
     <lb/>
     good government of such province and its 
     <lb/>
     representation in this parliament.

            <p>
     In mentioning these exceptions to the 
     <lb/>
     general scheme of confederation another in<lb break="no"/>stance occurs to my mind, the case of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia. Under the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, representation by population 
     <lb/>
     in this parliament is the general scheme. 
     <lb/>
     The provinces may lose representation if 
     <lb/>
     their population falls, but as far as British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia is concerned its minimum repre<lb break="no"/>sentation is guaranteed by the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. No matter what the popula<lb break="no"/>tion of British Columbia may be, its repre<lb break="no"/>sentation here cannot go below a certain 
     <lb/>
     minimum—another departure from the let<lb break="no"/>ter of the Confederation Act. Under the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act each province 
     <lb/>
     is given a legislature, but as regards the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec it is not permitted to 
     <lb/>
     control its own local provincial constitu<lb break="no"/>tion as far as its parliament is concerned, 
     <lb/>
     for the British North America Act declares 
     <lb/>
     that there shall be two houses and it does not 
     <lb/>
     leave it in the power of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec to alter that portion of its constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. It does more. Take the matter of 
     <lb/>
     representation of the house of assembly 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec. All the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces have the power themselves to 
     <lb/>
     alter their electoral districts, making bound<lb break="no"/>aries as they see fit, but in the case of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec it is entirely different. 
     <lb/>
     There are twelve constituencies in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Quebec that the legislature cannot 
     <lb/>
     interfere with. In the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     our legislature can, if it sees fit, alter the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries of all the electoral districts, and 
     <lb/>
     so it is in all the other provinces of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, Quebec alone excepted. Why 
     <lb/>
     was the exception made in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ?—simply to meet local conditions 
     <lb/>
     and thus we have from ocean to ocean all 
     <lb/>
     these provinces, deriving their constitutions 
     <lb/>
     from the British North America Act, but not 
     <lb/>
     one of them having the same constitution, 
     <lb/>
     all varying in some respects and yet all in 
     <lb/>
     substance formulated in accordance with 
     <lb/>

     the true spirit of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica Act. There are seven provinces in<lb/>this Dominion. Four of these provinces<lb/>were created at the same time and created<lb/>
     by the same instrument, the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, which declared the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of all the provinces. But that very 
     <lb/>
     same instrument, that very same Act of 
     <lb/>
     legislation that gave life to our British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act gave four distinct kinds 
     <lb/>
     of constitution to the four different provinces 
     <lb/>
     that formed the original confederation of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Yet, we are told that there is 
     <lb/>
     a model to be found within the four corners 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act, or in the 
     <lb/>
     constitutions of the different provinces 
     <lb/>
     created under the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, which furnishes to us full information 
     <lb/>
     as to what are to be the powers of each 
     <lb/>
     province when it becomes a province. For 
     <lb/>
     forty years parliament has been interpreting 
     <lb/>
     the meaning of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act and in no one instance has parliament 
     <lb/>
     taken the view that the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition now presents to this House. In 
     <lb/>
     no one instance has parliament up to this 
     <lb/>
     moment felt that it was bound by the letter 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution, or that it was at no time 
     <lb/>
     to modify according to the local conditions 
     <lb/>
     the general scheme of confederation in ap<lb break="no"/>plying that constitution to a particular pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I ask you then, if, up to this present 
     <lb/>
     moment, all who have been engaged in 
     <lb/>
     creating these seven provinces, if all the par<lb break="no"/>liaments either here or in England have 
     <lb/>
     been disposed to look not to the letter but 
     <lb/>
     to the spirit of the law, do you not think 
     <lb/>
     that the bed rock of our constitution is 
     <lb/>
     the spirit and not the mere letter of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. Why, Sir, is it 
     <lb/>
     common sense to suppose that when the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act was passed forty 
     <lb/>
     years ago the parliament of that day in<lb break="no"/>tended that that instrument which for all 
     <lb/>
     time was to form the constitution of this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, with its changes and with its 
     <lb/>
     future, was literally to be applied, not 
     <lb/>
     having regard to the conditions of new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces when its application was to be made 
     <lb/>
     but having regard to the dead past ? I can 
     <lb/>
     imagine a hundred years hence some ques<lb break="no"/>tion arising in this country ; perhaps it may 
     <lb/>
     be the question of taking away from a pro<lb break="no"/>vince some of its powers, or it may be a 
     <lb/>
     question of taking away from the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     some of its powers, or it may be a question 
     <lb/>
     in some way or other of rearranging legis<lb break="no"/>lative powers, and I can understand that it 
     <lb/>
     might be thought of vital importance to the 
     <lb/>
     safety of the country that some change 
     <lb/>
     should be made. Under these circumstances 
     <lb/>
     I can almost anticipate a lawyer of that day 
     <lb/>
     rising in his place in parliament and saying : 
     <lb/>
     You propose to alter the constitution for 
     <lb/>
     the public welfare. I admit that the public 
     <lb/>
     welfare may call for a change of the consti<lb break="no"/>tution, but I take my stand on the letter of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution and I interpret it in the light 
     <lb/>
     of 150 or 200 years ago. Is that the spirit 
     <lb/>

     in which laws are to be construed, or should 
     <lb/>
     they be construed as living and moving laws 
     <lb/>
     to be construed so as at all times to meet the  
     <lb/>
     altered conditions of the occasion ? I sympa<lb break="no"/>thize with the view of the premier and I 
     <lb/>
     put him in contrast on this occasion with the 
     <lb/>
     attitude of the leader of the opposition. In 
     <lb/>
     one case, you have an interpretation of 
     <lb/>
     the constitution by a lawyer ; in the 
     <lb/>
     other case, may I be permitted to say, by a 
     <lb/>
     statesman ? Which view is the more likely   
     <lb/>
     to be correct? Which view is the more 
     <lb/>
     likely to be in the best interests of the 
     <lb/>
     country? I take this view of it then; I 
     <lb/>
     began by arguing that there could be no in<lb break="no"/>fringement of a right until it has been 
     <lb/>
     created. A province possesses no rights 
     <lb/>
     until this parliament has declared what its 
     <lb/>
     rights are. According to the spirit of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act and according 
     <lb/>
     to the letter of the amending Act of 1871, it 
     <lb/>
     is in the discretion of this parliament to-day 
     <lb/>
     to say what constitution we shall give to 
     <lb/>
     these two new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     How have we dealt with ediication in the 
     <lb/>
     seven provinces of this Dominion ? We 
     <lb/>
     have left education as we found it when we 
     <lb/>
     came to legislate. Nova Scotia had no 
     <lb/>
     separate schools ; the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act gave them no separate schools. In New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick there were no separate schools; 
     <lb/>
     when they joined confederation the Con<lb break="no"/>federation Act gave them no separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. In Quebec at the time of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation there were separate schools ; the 
     <lb/>
     Confederation Act recognized that condition 
     <lb/>
     of affairs and left them in the enjoyment 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools. In Ontario when it 
     <lb/>
     entered confederation there were separate 
     <lb/>
     schools; the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     lecognized local conditions and left Ontario 
     <lb/>
     in the enjoyment of her separate schools. 
     <lb/>At the time Prince Edward island joined<lb/>
    the union there were no separate schools; 
     <lb/>the Orders in Council, ratified by the imperial 
     <lb/>government, left Prince Edward Island in 
     <lb/>the condition it was in when it entered con<lb break="no"/>federation, without separate schools. When 
     <lb/>we came to carve a new province out of the 
     <lb/>territory of Ruperts Land, when we came to 
     <lb/>establish Manitoba we found a peculiar con<lb break="no"/>dition there. They had separate schools but 
     <lb/>these schools did not fall within the language 
     <lb/>of the British North America Act. They were 
     <lb/>not there by right or law because there were 
     <lb/>no laws. The country was almost unin<lb break="no"/>habited, no constitution had been declared, 
     <lb/>it was working under the old law of England, 
     <lb/>and the legislators of that day, endeavouring 
     <lb/>to recognize the condition of affairs as they 
     <lb/>found it, when they were going to make 
     <lb/>Manitoba into a province said that although 
     <lb/>there are no schools in Manitoba by law 
     <lb/>there are some by practice and we will give 
     <lb/>you a constitution and allow you to retain 
     <lb/>whatever you had by law or practice. So, 
     <lb/>they departed from the letter of the law in 
     <lb/>the case of Manitoba. In British Columbia 
     <lb/>it is the same. There were no separate 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3416</fw>
      

     schools in British Columbia, but when 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia came into the confeder<lb break="no"/>ation the Confederation Act recognized the 
     <lb/>
     status quo and did not establish separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Thus, in the case of the whole seven pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that 110w constitute this Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     each province was left either with or with<lb break="no"/>out separate schools just as the condition 
     <lb/>
     was at the time of its entering into the 
     <lb/>
     union. But what do we find in the case 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories ? In 1875, thirty years 
     <lb/>
     ago, this parliament passed an Act author<lb break="no"/>izing the legislature of the Territories to 
     <lb/>
     establish separate schools. The Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     did not declare the character of these 
     <lb/>
     schools; they might be under church con<lb break="no"/>trol or they might be under state control. 
     <lb/>
     I frankly confess that I disapprove of sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools under church control, and on 
     <lb/>
     one occasion when I had the opportunity 
     <lb/>
     I recorded my vote against the maintenance 
     <lb/>
     of the status quo of 1875. I object to that 
     <lb/>
     feature of it which admits of a school under 
     <lb/>
     church control, but the Act remained on the 
     <lb/>
     statute-book and it is on the statute-book 
     <lb/>
     today. It is quite common practice in this 
     <lb/>
     House to belittle the jurisdiction of the, 
     <lb/>
     territorial legislature, but within its limits 
     <lb/>
     and as to be subjects in respect of which it 
     <lb/>
     can legislate the territorial legislature is as 
     <lb/>
     supreme as is the legislature of any pro<lb break="no"/>vince. For thirty years the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories have been in the enjoyment of 
     <lb/>
     rights under the Act of 1875, and they have 
     <lb/>
     made clear their views on their educational 
     <lb/>
     system in the form of laws passed by their 
     <lb/>
     legislature. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     correctly described the educational laws of 
     <lb/>
     the Territories. He pointed out that under 
     <lb/>
     the ordinance, chapter 29, which we pro<lb break="no"/>pose to accept as the standard, the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools as they are to-day are really na<lb break="no"/>tional schools; that the teachers must be 
     <lb/>
     qualified equally with the teachers in the 
     <lb/>
     public schools, that the schools must be 
     <lb/>
     organized under the state and not under 
     <lb/>
     the church, that the text books are pres 
     <lb/>
     cribed by the state, that the inspection. 
     <lb/>
     the examination and the whole control of 
     <lb/>
     these schools called separate schools, is 
     <lb/>
     with the state. We have been assailed in<lb break="no"/>deed by people opposed to us because these 
     <lb/>
     schools are not sufficiently under church 
     <lb/>
     control. The existing school system in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories is the outcome of thirty years 
     <lb/>
     of legislation by the people of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Their educational laws have reached 
     <lb/>
     the present status, and they give supreme 
     <lb/>
     satisfaction I understand throughout the 
     <lb/>
     Territories. Although some gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the other side of the House are endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to induce the people to rise in revolt, 
     <lb/>
     we do not find any such hysterical appeals 
     <lb/>
     made by the people of the Territories who 
     <lb/>
     are most directly concerned. I see before 
     <lb/>
     me the minister—I beg his pardon I was 
     <lb/>
     only anticipating a little perhaps—I see be<lb break="no"/>fore me the member for East Grey (Mr.

     Sproule). He is deeply interested in this 
     <lb/>
     question and from one standpoint is an 
     <lb/>
     authority upon it. I have something here 
     <lb/>
     which may interest him. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule) went to Montreal a year 
     <lb/>
     ago and he was entertained by the Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier Club of which we have heard a 
     <lb/>
     good deal of late in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     sending of petitions gotten up in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. I do not know how inti<lb break="no"/>mate are the relations between my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from East Grey and the Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier Club, but let me remind him of a 
     <lb/>
     pleasing incident: a banquet to his leader 
     <lb/>
     and himself. The day after the banquet, 
     <lb/>
     the'Montreal 'Gazette' did itself the honour 
     <lb/>
     of reporting the hon. gentleman's speech, 
     <lb/>
     and I will do him the further honour of 
     <lb/>
     reading the report to the House. I may 
     <lb/>
     observe that on this occasion the member 
     <lb/>
     for East Grey was accompanied by his 
     <lb/>
     leader the member for Carleton. The Mon<lb break="no"/>treal 'Gazette' of the 20th of June, 1904,

     this House is being favoured with peti<lb break="no"/>tions. The hon. gentleman says that the

     Orange and the Green are working together 
     <lb/>
     for the good of the Conservative party. He 
     <lb/>
     is doing his share in one way, and the Jac<lb break="no"/>ques Cartier Club, his host, appears to be 
     <lb/>
     doing its share in another way ; and thus 
     <lb/>
     the Orange and the Green are getting in 
     <lb/>
     their work. I hold in my hand a copy of a 
     <lb/>
     communication signed by Elie Maurault, 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of the Jacques Cartier Club. I 
     <lb/>
     do not know the gentleman ; but the writer 
     <lb/>
     of this communication does not appear to 
     <lb/>
     share the sentiments of the member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey. The member for East Grey has 
     <lb/>
     been promoting one line of campaign, while 
     <lb/>
     his club in Quebec has been promoting an<lb break="no"/>other line. It is all right if it stirs up strife, 
     <lb/>
     so long as both get in their work for the 
     <lb/>
     good of the Conservative party ; the Orange 
     <lb/>
     and the Green, as he says, working toge<lb break="no"/>ther ; two fishermen out, he with his hook 
     <lb/>
     baited with the orange, and some one else 
     <lb/>
     with the green. May I ask the member for 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     communication and these petitions from the

     We have in the province of Ontario a

     campaign denouncing these amendments as

     being concessions to the hierarchy. 0n the

     other hand, in the province of Quebec, the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party is attacked by the Tory news<lb break="no"/>papers because the government are doing 
     <lb/>
     nothing for the Roman Catholics. Surely 
     <lb/>
     both these contentions cannot be well found<lb break="no"/>ed. Let me read from a couple of the lead<lb break="no"/>ing Tory papers published in the city of

     they declare to be a surrender of the rights

            <p>
     In our article of last week we qualified as 
     <lb/>
     truly deplorable the letter of Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier to an old friend of George Brown, the 
     <lb/>
     full text of which we published at the time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This letter is trebly deplorable. disastrous, 
     <lb/>
     heart-rending, we say, after having re-read this 
     <lb/>
     document calmly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     From a political point of view, a national 
     <lb/>
     point of view, from a religious point 0f view, 
     <lb/>
     it is all that; and it is inconceivable that a. 
     <lb/>
     chief of a party, a. French Canadian and a Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic could have made up his mind to 
     <lb/>
     make public such a document.

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     By his cowardice and blindness. Mr. Laurier 
     <lb/>
     is on the way to depriving for ever his co-re<lb break="no"/>ligionists in the west, of separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     thoroughly Catholic. No, there is no possible 
     <lb/>
     comparison between the work of George Brown 
     <lb/>
     and that of Wilfrid Laurier, as political men 
     <lb/>
     on the educational question. The former has 
     <lb/>
     done for his people a work as durable as gran<lb break="no"/>ite. The latter, of his own free will, places his 
     <lb/>
     co-religionists in a position of manifest inferi<lb break="no"/>ority. Such was the work of both men from a

            <p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>

            <p>
     Lastly, a word as to the religious aspect of 
     <lb/>
     the question; it is clear that Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier, as a Catholic statesman, is perfectly 
     <lb/>
     satisfied of practically neutral schools for his 
     <lb/>
     co-religionists. Read over again attentively 
     <lb/>
     the discription which he makes of the so-called 
     <lb/>
     separate schools which exist in the west, which 
     <lb/>
     his Bill proposes to maintain, which our people 
     <lb/>
     must accept, and which the Protestants are 
     <lb/>
     humbly requested to tolerate, and you will see 
     <lb/>
     that they are really neutral or national schools, 
     <lb/>
     because, in the mind of Sir Wilfrid Laurier the 
     <lb/>
     two terms are synonymous. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Where is the separation in these schools from 
     <lb/>
     a religious point of view ? It does not exist 
     <lb/>
     more than it does from the national point at 
     <lb/>
     view. They are institutions which are neutral, 
     <lb/>
     neutral, absolutely neutral. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The famous half hour of religious teaching at 
     <lb/>
     the closing of each class does not change the 
     <lb/>
     essentially national and neutral character of 
     <lb/>
     the class itself. Mr. Laurier proclaims this 
     <lb/>
     with persistency, and he is perfectly right.

            <p>
     Instead of this measure being a surrender 
     <lb/>
     to the Roman Catholic Church, which is the 
     <lb/>
     charge made against it in the west, it is 
     <lb/>
     denounced in the province of Quebec by our 
     <lb/>
     opponents because it simply allows the min<lb break="no"/>ority to enjoy what we call national schools. 
     <lb/>
     Both these contentions cannot be true. 
     <lb/>
     Either the contention of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
    from East Grey (Mr. Sproule), that we are 
     <lb/>surrendering to the Roman Catholic minor<lb break="no"/>ity, is wrong, or the contention of his allies 
     <lb/>in Quebec that we are not doing justice to 
     <lb/>

     the Roman Catholic minority is unfounded. 
     <lb/>
     Both cannot be correct. Perhaps my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from East Grey. in his supreme de<lb break="no"/>sire to do justice, will, in talking the matter 
     <lb/>
     over with his western friends, point out to 
     <lb/>
     them the view which the Quebec Tories take 
     <lb/>
     of this measure as compared with that 
     <lb/>
     which he and his friends take. But what is 
     <lb/>
     the attitude of my hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition? He simply takes his stand 
     <lb/>
     on provincial rights. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey does the passion part of the play. 
     <lb/>
     He acts the tragic role and appeals to pas<lb break="no"/>sion; other members of the party opposite 
     <lb/>
     indulge in melodramatic appeals to senti<lb break="no"/>ment; others attempt more or less skilfully 
     <lb/>
     to excite prejudice, but one and all they 
     <lb/>
     are working to the same end, and that is the 
     <lb/>
     success and glory of the Conservative party, 
     <lb/>
     no matter by what means that may be 
     <lb/>
     secured. But there is one thing which these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen might well bear in mind. It is 
     <lb/>
     that the welfare of this country depends on 
     <lb/>
     our people living in harmony; and let this 
     <lb/>
     question he once settled in a broad spirit 
     <lb/>
     of tolerant justice and we will continue in 
     <lb/>
     that career of progress in which we have 
     <lb/>
     been advancing for the last eight years. 
     <lb/>
     For several years during the agitation ac<lb break="no"/>companying the Manitoba school question, 
     <lb/>
     the progress of this country was stopped, 
     <lb/>
     and stopped it would be again if the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion could have their way and succeed in 
     <lb/>
     throwing this question into the arena of 
     <lb/>
     political strife. But the good sense of par<lb break="no"/>liament, I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, will 
     <lb/>
     prevail, and the country will breathe a 
     <lb/>
     sigh of relief when this question is settled 
     <lb/>
     for all time, without any sacrifice of princi<lb break="no"/>ple on either side and in a manner which 
     <lb/>
     will enable all classes to live in harmony. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     said that because the Act of 1875 was pass<lb break="no"/>ed When there were only 500 people in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest it should now be done away 
     <lb/>
     with when there are 500,000 people in that 
     <lb/>
     country. But it seems to me that if 500,000 
     <lb/>
     people have gone into that country, know<lb break="no"/>ing the law and the conditions which pre<lb break="no"/>vailed, they furnish us, with 500,000 argu 
     <lb/>
     ments in favour of the maintenance of the 
     <lb/>
     status quo. Why should we deal with the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Territories when we make 
     <lb/>
     them a province in a different manner from 
     <lb/>
     that in which we deal with the people in 
     <lb/>
     other provinces when they were brought 
     <lb/>
     into confederation? What we propose now 
     <lb/>
     is in harmony with the unbroken practice 
     <lb/>
     in similar cases, respected in every part of 
     <lb/>
     this broad Dominion. Therefore, I am un<lb break="no"/>able to understand why, when we are rais<lb break="no"/>ing these two Territories to the dignity of 
     <lb/>
     provinces this agitation should be excited. 
     <lb/>
     Some time ago, in reading a history of India, 
     <lb/>
     I came across a passage which might 
     <lb/>
     very well be brought to the attention 
     <lb/>
     of this House. Speaking of the treatment 
     <lb/>
     by Great Britain of the many nationalities 
     <lb/>
     throughout her broad empire—races with<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3424</fw>
          

     out number and creeds without number— 
     <lb/>
     the writer said that he had yet to find an 
     <lb/>
     instance of the mother country haVing ever 
     <lb/>
     oppressed a minority or failed to recognize 
     <lb/>
     the beliefs and feelings and sentiments and 
     <lb/>
     even the prejudices of that minority. And 
     <lb/>
     when at the close of the great mutiny in 
     <lb/>
     India, it was said that the imperial govern<lb break="no"/>ment might interfere with the religious 
     <lb/>
     views of the people, Her Majesty herself 
     <lb/>
     caused a proclamation to be issued to the 
     <lb/>
     people of India in which she pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that she had derived so much comfort and 
     <lb/>
     consolation from her own religion that she 
     <lb/>
     would never allow hands to be laid 011 the 
     <lb/>
     religions or creeds of the various great 
     <lb/>
     tribes that composed her loyal citizens 
     <lb/>
     throughout India. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And, go where you will throughout this 
     <lb/>
     broad empire, with its. four hundred mil<lb break="no"/>lions of people of different races and differ<lb break="no"/>ent creeds, you find all left in the enjoy<lb break="no"/>ment of those things that they regard as 
     <lb/>
     sacred. It is that policy, that method of 
     <lb/>
     treating the people, that has made Great 
     <lb/>
     Britain's empire, what it is to-day—wide<lb break="no"/>spread, powerful and stable, resting upon 
     <lb/>
     the affections of the whole people and hold<lb break="no"/>ing the people together by the bonds of 
     <lb/>
     affection and not by force 01' coercion. If 
     <lb/>
     our own Dominion is to be held together we 
     <lb/>
     cannot do better than follow the example 
     <lb/>
     of the mother of nations and yield, if need 
     <lb/>
     be, occasionally to prejudices or sentiments 
     <lb/>
     involving no sacrifice of principle in order 
     <lb/>
     to enable the different classes that are com<lb break="no"/>ing to our shores to live in peace, in har<lb break="no"/>mony and in the enjoyment of those insti<lb break="no"/>tutions to which they attach great impor<lb break="no"/>tance and the enjoyment of which by them 
     <lb/>

     to apologize, unless I do—for I suppose the

     <lb/>

     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     supposed to be supporting, the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General who have been brought back this

     evening to hear, as they supposed, a reply

     to the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr.

     the Chamber because they could not under-r

     or what subject he was dealing with. I

     blame them for thinking the Postmaster

     General would give them some information

     or some light—something which they could

master General done ? He has occupied 
     <lb/>the time of this House from nine o'clock 
     <lb/>until twenty minutes to eleven. And evi<lb break="no"/>dently he has tried to say something. Sev<lb break="no"/>eral times he has said : ' What is the ques<lb break="no"/>tion before the House ?  ' But he never told 
     <lb/>us what that question was. I do not know 
     <lb/>whether he was'discussing the Manitoba

     <lb/>was dreaming that he was out in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario abusing Sir Charles Tup<lb break="no"/>per for granting that remedial legislation,— 
     <lb/>or whether he was trying to offer some plea

     <lb/>minutes—I say this with all deference; but 
     <lb/>I have as much respect for the members of 
     <lb/>this House as I have for the Postmaster 
     <lb/>General, and I think that some one ought 
     <lb/>to apologize. So, as one of the members 
     <lb/>constituting this House, as the Postmaster 
     <lb/>General does not apologize for wasting our 
     <lb/>time, I can only hope that the House will 
     <lb/>accept the apology I offer. The House has 
     <lb/>asmuch right to accept my apology as the 
     <lb/>Postmaster General has to propose, in the 
     <lb/>name of autonomy, a throttling piece of legis<lb break="no"/>lation for the Northwest Territories. This 
     <lb/>House has as much and more right to say 
     <lb/>that the member for Lincoln and Niagara 
     <lb/>(Mr. Lancaster) should apologize for the 
     <lb/>Postmaster General as to say that the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial parliament of the Northwest shall 
     <lb/>not control its own affairs. At nine o'clock 
     <lb/>the Postmaster General began to address 
     <lb/>this House. I have kept track, as well as I 
     <lb/>could, of his wanderings about the question 
     <lb/>—if it can be said he was so near the ques<lb break="no"/>tion as to be wandering about it—and the 
     <lb/>discussion—if you can call it discussion— 
     <lb/>that he has inflicted upon the House. He 
     <lb/>spent half an hour in abusing the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for North Toronto (Mr. Foster.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. He apologized. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. LANCASTER</persName>. I have no doubt he 
     <lb/>
     will apologize if somebody makes him do 
     <lb/>
     so, but he Will not apologize out of the good<lb break="no"/>ness of his heart ;—he might to save a libel 
     <lb/>
     suit if a libel suit could be taken against 
     <lb/>
     him. Then for forty minutes he was sup<lb break="no"/>posed to discuss this Bill, if you can call it 
     <lb/>
     a discussion of the Bill to tell us over and 
     <lb/>
     over again that the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act had dealt differently with different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces—and I am in the judgment of the 
     <lb/>
     House when I say that that is all this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion amounted to. Then, for the next 
     <lb/>
     thirty minutes he gave kind advice to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3426</fw>
          

     about his duty in regard to toleration. He 
     <lb/>
     talked about intolerant speeches in this 
     <lb/>
     House and about vehemence. And what 
     <lb/>
     was the other word he used ?—I have a note 
     <lb/>
     of it here ;—some word that, I think, we 
     <lb/>
     hardly understand as coming from the Post<lb break="no"/>master General. He spoke once of brotherly 
     <lb/>
     love. He spoke also of inflammatory and im<lb break="no"/>passioned speeches—but he did not tell us 
     <lb/>
     at which side of the House he was direct<lb break="no"/>ing his lecture. I have been in this House 
     <lb/>
     throughout this debate, and I am not in the 
     <lb/>
     habit of sitting here and not listening. I 
     <lb/>
     have not heard one impassioned sentence in 
     <lb/>
     this debate coming from this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, and neither has any other hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber. The Postmaster General seems to 
     <lb/>
     think he has heard that kind of thing from 
     <lb/>
     this side. I heard the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Fitzpatrick), before the Bill was read 
     <lb/>
     the second time, make what I suppose the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General would call a speech of 
     <lb/>
     brotherly love. The Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     said in effect : If my brothers of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion of Canada will not give me some<lb break="no"/>thing to which I have no constitutional 
     <lb/>
     right ; if they will not give me justice and 
     <lb/>
     let me be the judge of what is to be con<lb break="no"/>sidered justice, there shall be no peace in 
     <lb/>
     this country. That is the style of speech 
     <lb/>
     we get from the King's chosen representa<lb break="no"/>tive of justice in this House, the occupant 
     <lb/>
     of what ought to be the highest and grand<lb break="no"/>est of cabinet positions. He told us that 
     <lb/>
     forty-one per cent of our people demanded 
     <lb/>
     this legislation. I take issue with him there. 
     <lb/>
     All the Roman Catholics in this country 
     <lb/>
     are not in favour of this legislation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. LANCASTER</persName>. But I tell my young 
     <lb/>
     friend from Montmaguy (Mr. A. Lavergne), 
     <lb/>
     who has interrupted every speaker in this 
     <lb/>
     House since this question began, that he 
     <lb/>
     has got a lot of things to learn yet, and 
     <lb/>
     some things to learn about his own race in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. I will tell my 
     <lb/>
     young friend that if he wants to get any 
     <lb/>
     standing in this House, if he wants any<lb break="no"/>body to listen to him, he must be more 
     <lb/>
     tolerant, he must not take his lessons of 
     <lb/>
     tolerance from the Postmaster General and 
     <lb/>
     he must make less inflammatory speeches, 
     <lb/>
     and exercise more courtesy to hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men who have just as much right to their 
     <lb/>
     opinions as he has. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Sir, I say to all these gentlemen that 
     <lb/>
     in the county of Lincoln, which I have the 
     <lb/>
     honour to represent, I do not believe there 
     <lb/>
     is a single Roman Catholic who wants any 
     <lb/>
     thing done that is unconstitutional or con<lb break="no"/>trary to the spirit of the constitution. When 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance spoke on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion he sneered at the constitution. The 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance, acknowledging, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose, that the constitution was dead against 
     <lb/>
     him, tried to make out that the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional aspect of this legislation was of no 
     <lb/>

     Now, on behalf of the Catholic citizens of 
     <lb/>
     the garden county of Lincoln. I tell the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance, who is now in his place, 
     <lb/>
     that they will resent as much as the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants will resent any such imputation on 
     <lb/>
     their fairness. They do not want things to 
     <lb/>
     be done that-are unconstitutional. No true 
     <lb/>
     citizen of this country, be he Catholic or 
     <lb/>
     Protestant, wants legislation to be put 
     <lb/>
     through this House on the ground that it 
     <lb/>
     may be wise and practical, if it is not con<lb break="no"/>stitutional. If it is not constitutional, it 
     <lb/>
     cannot be either wise or practical. In say<lb break="no"/>ing this, I speak for three or four thousand 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic inhabitants in the fair 
     <lb/>
     county of Lincoln, and I speak for the Pro<lb break="no"/>testants as well. The Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     thinks that this educational section of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill cannot be supported on constitutional 
     <lb/>
     ground. He thinks, according to his speech, 
     <lb/>
     that the law is also against the government 
     <lb/>
     if they undertake to force this legislation 
     <lb/>
     through, for he says: I will not discuss it, 
     <lb/>
     I will let the lawyers discuss it. But does 
     <lb/>
     he say he will leave it to the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     to do as they like ? Oh, no ; but he says: 
     <lb/>
     I will butt in and take the provinces by the 
     <lb/>
     throat, while the lawyers may study the 
     <lb/>
     legal question. I think he ought to wait 
     <lb/>
     until the jury comes in; I think he ought 
     <lb/>
     to keep his hands off these provinces until 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3428</fw>
          

     he finds out whether he had a right to put 
     <lb/>
     his hands on them. Now, let me suggest 
     <lb/>
     to the Minister of Finance, to the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs, and to all those gentlemen who 
     <lb/>
     have spoken on this question: Supposing 
     <lb/>
     you do not interfere with the power of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces to deal with the educational ques<lb break="no"/>tion, are you doing a wrong thing or not? 
     <lb/>
     The lawyers say there is a doubt whether 
     <lb/>
     we have a right to interfere with the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but nobody says there is a doubt 
     <lb/>
     about the provinces having a right to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question of separate schools. Now. 
     <lb/>
     if separate schools can be dealt with. as it 
     <lb/>
     is admitted they can be, by the provinces, 
     <lb/>
     why not let them deal with it? Nobody 
     <lb/>
     suggests on either side of this House that 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces of Alberta and Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan cannot deal with the question of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools as soon as this Act is pass<lb break="no"/>ed in any way that they like; the whole 
     <lb/>
     dispute is as to whether there is power in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament to deal with the 
     <lb/>
     subject. But there is no question about the 
     <lb/>
     fact that the provinces can do it if the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament does not interfere. Now, 
     <lb/>
     have hon. gentlemen made a good case for 
     <lb/>
     separate schools or have they not? I am 
     <lb/>
     not going to discuss that question. I believe 
     <lb/>
     in provincial rights. If this question was 
     <lb/>
     up in the province of Ontario I would claim 
     <lb/>
     the right to record my vote upon it. and in 
     <lb/>
     the same manner I do not wish to take 
     <lb/>
     away the right of the people of the North 
     <lb/>
     west Territories to record their votes on the 
     <lb/>
     subject if they want to. I am willing to give 
     <lb/>
     my fellow-countrymen in the Northwest Ter 
     <lb/>
     ritories the same right to do their own vot<lb break="no"/>ing on this school question that I claim for 
     <lb/>
     myself. So in regard to every other ques<lb break="no"/>tion, they should be treated in the same 
     <lb/>
     way. Can it be suggested that if this was 
     <lb/>
     not an educational and, incidentally, a re<lb break="no"/>ligions question, there would be any wrench<lb break="no"/>ing of the constitution to interfere with the 
     <lb/>
     provinces ? Everybody knows the answer. 
     <lb/>
     Everybody knows that if this was not a ques<lb break="no"/>tion that affected education and, incident<lb break="no"/>ally, religion, nobody would dare to suggest 
     <lb/>
     that we should wrench the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     those provinces, that we should undertake to 
     <lb/>
     throttle them in regard to their right to say 
     <lb/>
     What system of education they shall have. 
     <lb/>
     Of course, if we are going to give provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy to the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     let us give them something that will be 
     <lb/>
     autonomy, and not a mere pretense. 
     <lb/>
     Why are the government dealing with this 
     <lb/>
     question of provincial autonomy ? Does the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister believe that these provinces 
     <lb/>
     have reached the stage where they are en<lb break="no"/>titled to have autonomy? If he says they 
     <lb/>
     are entitled now to have autonomy on all 
     <lb/>
     the subjects mentioned in the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, then are they not entitled to 
     <lb/>
     exercise the same judgment with regard to 
     <lb/>
     education ? If they have brains and in<lb break="no"/>telligence enough, if they are far enough 
     <lb/>
     advanced to deal with all the other subjects 
     <lb/>

     that are assigned to the provincial legisla<lb break="no"/>tures under section 92 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, surely they are intelligent 
     <lb/>
     enough and far enough advanced to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the subject of education? That section 
     <lb/>
     gives the provincial legislature exclusive 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction to deal with the subjects of 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation, borrowing money on the 
     <lb/>
     credit of the province, management and 
     <lb/>
     sale of public lands, the establishment, main<lb break="no"/>tenance and management of reformatories 
     <lb/>
     and prisons. establishment and mainten<lb break="no"/>ance of hospitals and asylums, licenses, local 
     <lb/>
     public works, marriage, property and civil 
     <lb/>
     rights, administration of justice, and gen<lb break="no"/>erally all matters of a merely local nature 
     <lb/>
     in the province. Now. if the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister thinks that the people of those Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories are sufliciently advanced to deal 
     <lb/>
     with all these subjects I have mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     surely he must believe that they are suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently advanced to deal with the subject 
     <lb/>
     of education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is idle for the right hon. Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     or any person else to pretend that there 
     <lb/>
     is any other reason for excluding education 
     <lb/>
     from the operation of this Act or taking 
     <lb/>
     the question of education away from these 
     <lb/>
     provinces except it be on the religious 
     <lb/>
     ground. I say this and 1 say it forcibly be<lb break="no"/>cause it is necessary as we are drifting away 
     <lb/>
     back into the dark ages. When we are 
     <lb/>
     dealing with this Bill this question ought to 
     <lb/>
     be dealt with exactly on its merits, the same 
     <lb/>
     as any other question would be, and if there 
     <lb/>
     is no meritorious reason for butting in the 
     <lb/>
     question of religion, or for sticking it in 
     <lb/>
     the Bill at all, if there is no logical, sound, 
     <lb/>
     businesslike reason for putting it in, there 
     <lb/>
     is no excuse for putting it there any more 
     <lb/>
     than there would be for putting in any other 
     <lb/>
     question that had no business to be there ? 
     <lb/>
     Are we not sufiiciently intelligent to deal 
     <lb/>
     with this question of education calmly, de<lb break="no"/>liberately and as business men? Can we not 
     <lb/>
     ask ourselves the same question in regard 
     <lb/>
     to this question as in regard to any othe'r 
     <lb/>
     question? Cannot we say: Does this pro<lb break="no"/>perly come within the subject of this Bill, is 
     <lb/>
     it proper that we should deal with this ques<lb break="no"/>tion any more than that we should deal with 
     <lb/>
     any other question ? There is not an hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman on the other side of the House 
     <lb/>
     who has made up his mind to record his vote 
     <lb/>
     for the government on this question. but will 
     <lb/>
     admit or will conscientiously say to himself 
     <lb/>
     that a judgment of this kind should not be 
     <lb/>
     forced upon him more in respect to the re<lb break="no"/>ligious question than it would be in regard 
     <lb/>
     to any other question. I venture to say 
     <lb/>
     that if the British North America Act were 
     <lb/>
     attacked in regard to some other of its 
     <lb/>
     features. if it were proposed, for instance, 
     <lb/>
     to give the Northwest Territories control of 
     <lb/>
     post oihces instead of leaving it to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion parliament the hon. Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral would say : No. that is unconstitution<lb break="no"/>al: that is one of the subjects that the

     British North America Act exclusively

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3430</fw>
        

     leaves to the Dominion parliament to deal 
     <lb/>
     with. and you cannot change the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act in that respect. But. 
     <lb/>
     the Postmaster General does not mind tak<lb break="no"/>ing from the provinces the right to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the subject of education although it is ex<lb break="no"/>clusively assigned to the provinces except in 
     <lb/>
     the cases that he has mentioned to-night. 
     <lb/>
     If a province after it was a provinée, being 
     <lb/>
     of age and able to do it. deliberately know<lb break="no"/>ing what it was doing, inflicted upon itself 
     <lb/>
     a system of separate schools it could not 
     <lb/>
     abolish that system upon joining the union. 
     <lb/>
     There is no warrant whatever for dealing 
     <lb/>
     with this question except upon the lines of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act. And section 
     <lb/>
     92. containing an enumeration of the differ<lb break="no"/>ent classes of cases which I have mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     lays it down that these cases are to be dealt 
     <lb/>
     with exclusively by the provinces.

<p>And so on. Section 93 says that the<lb/>

these two sections. Section 92 dealing with<lb/>

which are subjects which are admitted to be<lb/> exclusively within the jurisdiction of the<lb/>
province and which are always to be dealt<lb/>

same phraseology as section 93 does in re<lb break="no"/>gard to education:</p>

<p>
     In the province at the union ! In the pro<lb break="no"/>vince at the time that it joined the union, as 
     <lb/>
     for instance, Ontario and Quebec as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General admitted to-night. He 
     <lb/>
     said we have these schools here because we 
     <lb/>
     had them when we came into the union, and 
     <lb/>
     he then proves our case further by saying 
     <lb/>
     that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick do not 
     <lb/>
     have these schools because they did not 
     <lb/>
     have them when they came into the union, 
     <lb/>
     and that British Columbia did not have them 
     <lb/>
     when they came into the union. That was 
     <lb/>
     the reason why they did not have them. 
     <lb/>
     Now, here is where I begin to disagree with 
     <lb/>
     him. He says it is fair to say to the people 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest : You are not a province, 
     <lb/>
     we are about to make you a province for the 
     <lb/>
     first time, we do not know whether you will 
     <lb/>
     establish separate schools or not but we will 
     <lb/>
     take you by the throat and make you do it. 
     <lb/>
     That is great logic. That is a wonderful 
     <lb/>
     argument to come from a statesman like the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Postmaster General, as he called him<lb break="no"/>self two or three times to-night, although no<lb break="no"/>body applauded him when he did it. That 
     <lb/>
     was the logic that came from this would be 
     <lb/>
     statesman. If we apply his logic it means 
     <lb/>
     this : Here are people twenty-one years of 
     <lb/>
     age having the right to vote who have voted 
     <lb/>
     for a certain thing, being fully enfranchised 
     <lb/>
     and entitled to vote on the question, while 
     <lb/>
     on the other hand we are going to enfran<lb break="no"/>chise another man who has not now a vote 
     <lb/>
     and make him vote what we direct all his 
     <lb/>
     life. That is a fair interpretation of the 
     <lb/>
     argument which the Postmaster General has 
     <lb/>
     made. We are going to say because we are 
     <lb/>
     creating a province that you shall do exactly 
     <lb/>
     what Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island and British Columbia did 
     <lb/>
     not have to do. Although British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     did not have to adopt a separate school sys<lb break="no"/>tem we say to these new provinces that if 
     <lb/>
     you come in you must establish a separate 
     <lb/>
     school system because they have one in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec. No such thing was 
     <lb/>
     said to British Columbia. Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island did not have to adopt the separate 
     <lb/>
     school system, but in regard to these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces we say : You have not a system 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools but we are going to 
     <lb/>
     make it certain you must have one because  
     <lb/>
     you cannot come into the union if you do not 
     <lb/>
     have separate schools as they have them in  
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec. These other provinces 
     <lb/>
     were allowed to do as they liked. They were 
     <lb/>
     provinces that were fully enfranchised and 
     <lb/>
     entitled to make their own bargains. The 
     <lb/>
     hon. Postmaster General, the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance and the hon. Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms cannot see any distinction between en<lb break="no"/>franchising a man and letting him do as he 
     <lb/>
     likes after you have enfranchised him and 
     <lb/>
     taking a man by the throat and saying : 
     <lb/>
     You must do so and so or we will not en<lb break="no"/>franchise you at all. Both of these hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who are sitting beside each other 
     <lb/>
     at this moment and who spoke upon this 
     <lb/>
     question said that in effect. They did not 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3432</fw>
         

     want to bother with the legal aspect of this 
     <lb/>
     question. The hon. Minister of Customs 
     <lb/>
     was very anxious to get away from the legal 
     <lb/>
     question. He said that Christopher Robin<lb break="no"/>son's opinion was not quite the same as that 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. leader of the oppostion, that they 
     <lb/>
     were both excellent lawyers—he spoke cor<lb break="no"/>rectly about that—that the hon. the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice disagreed with the legal opinion 
     <lb/>
     of these gentlemen and that he was a good 
     <lb/>
     lawyer. But I have not seen the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Justice yet. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Customs may know quietly, or 
     <lb/>
     through some secret channel of the cabinet, 
     <lb/>
     what the opinion of the hon. Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice is, but I do not know what it is. 
     <lb/>
     But, we will assume that it was contradic<lb break="no"/>tory of and different from the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
     What was the wise solution of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs ? What was the advice that he 
     <lb/>
     gave us in his great wisdom ? He says that 
     <lb/>
     as these lawyers differ about the question as 
     <lb/>
     to whether the Dominion of Canada has the 
     <lb/>
     power to go on and settle that question we 
     <lb/>
     should take the power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The argument of the Minister of Customs 
     <lb/>
     was, that as the lawyers differed as to 
     <lb/>
     whether Canada has the power to enact 
     <lb/>
     this legislation, the wise thing to do to 
     <lb/>
     settle the question was for this parliament 
     <lb/>
     to take the power. It is an easy thing for 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Customs to get away from 
     <lb/>
     the legal and constitutional aspect of the 
     <lb/>
     question, but it never occurred to him that 
     <lb/>
     there was a still more common sense solu<lb break="no"/>tion, and that is that provinces could grant 
     <lb/>
     separate schools if they wanted to and no<lb break="no"/>body disputes that the provinces have the 
     <lb/>
     power—and that being so, it would be a 
     <lb/>
     wise thing to let the new provinces do as 
     <lb/>
     they like on the question of education. 
     <lb/>
     There is no dispute that the provinces have 
     <lb/>
     the power to legislate on education the 
     <lb/>
     whole dispute is whether the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government has the right to force a par<lb break="no"/>ticular system of education upon them. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of Customs could not see that 
     <lb/>
     the easiest solution of the difficulty was for 
     <lb/>
     us to say : as there is a great difference of 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to whether we have the right 
     <lb/>
     to do this or not, and as there is no differ<lb break="no"/>ence as to the right of the province to do 
     <lb/>
     it, then let us trust the province. And so 
     <lb/>
     these gentlemen opposite believing they have 
     <lb/>
     a good case for separate schools on the 
     <lb/>
     merits, should have no reason to fear. But 
     <lb/>
     that solution did not occur to the cham<lb break="no"/>pions of provincial rights. Sir, in that 
     <lb/>
     beautiful garden city of St. Catharines in 
     <lb/>
     my fair county, early in the month of June, 
     <lb/>
     1896, I heard the Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier appeal to return Mr. Gibson (now 
     <lb/>
     Senator Gibson) to this House, and Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gibson was returned by a majority of nearly 
     <lb/>
     500. On that occasion I heard the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Canada declare, that when it came 
     <lb/>
     to the question of coercing a province even 
     <lb/>
     at the instance of people who belonged to 
     <lb/>
      

            <pb n="3433" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-29_Page_3433.jpg"/>

     his own religion, he was a Canadian and a 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights man first and he would 
     <lb/>
     not interfere with the province even at the 
     <lb/>
     risk of being accused of disloyalty to his 
     <lb/>
     own religion. That argument prevailed 
     <lb/>
     with the people of the county I have the 
     <lb/>
     honour to represent, but the people soon 
     <lb/>
     discovered their mistake. Mr. Gibson who 
     <lb/>
     came to this House backed up by that 
     <lb/>
     pledge of his leader, four years afterwards 
     <lb/>
     in the same constituency was defeated by 
     <lb/>
     so weak and humble an individual as myself 
     <lb/>
     by a majority which represented a change 
     <lb/>
     of several hundred votes compared with 
     <lb/>
     the previous election. The people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada want public men to keep their poli<lb break="no"/>tical pledges. They do not want the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister to be in favour of provincial rights 
     <lb/>
     one day and against provincial rights an<lb break="no"/>other day when it suits his purpose. They 
     <lb/>
     want public questions to be dealt with on 
     <lb/>
     their merits whether these be religious ques<lb break="no"/>tions or any other questions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, Mr. Speaker, I shall not do as the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General did and talk for two 
     <lb/>
     hours without dealing with the legal and 
     <lb/>
     constitutional aspect of the question except 
     <lb/>
     in so far as mere personal assertion is con<lb break="no"/>cerned. I shall quote the rest of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act which deals with the 
     <lb/>
     question, and leave it to the common sense 
     <lb/>
     of the members of this House and the com<lb break="no"/>mon sense of the people of Canada to say 
     <lb/>
     Whether the policy of the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition as announced in his amendment, 
     <lb/>
     or the policy laid down in the redrafted Bill, 
     <lb/>
     is the correct one for us to pursue. The 
     <lb/>
     Bill undertakes to do something that is con<lb break="no"/>sidered to be statesmanlike by the Post<lb break="no"/>master General, but which unfortunately 
     <lb/>
     is not sufliciently statesmanlike to be con<lb break="no"/>stitutional. In the clause relating to edu<lb break="no"/>cation the Bill undertakes practically to 
     <lb/>
     amend the British North America Act, for 
     <lb/>
     it says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Where the expression ' by law ' is employed 
     <lb/>
     in subsection 3 of the said section 93 it shall

            </p></quote>

    
   
            <p>
     Now, the British North America says 
     <lb/>
     exactly the contrary to this, and we have 
     <lb/>
     therefore the sad spectacle that these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite who were once so loud in 
     <lb/>
     their pledges to protect provincial rights, 
     <lb/>
     now in their efforts to assail provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights not only jump clean over the auton<lb break="no"/>omy of the provinces. but undertake to 
     <lb/>
     amend a law of the imperial parliament into 
     <lb/>
     the bargain. Well, I suppose they have just 
     <lb/>
     as much right to do one thing as the other ; 
     <lb/>
     they have just as much right to amend an 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Act as to deprive the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada of their constitutional powers. 
     <lb/>
     To listen to these gentlemen opposite one 
     <lb/>would sometimes think we were in the<lb/>imperial House of Commons creating a new<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3434</fw>
      

     British North America Act, and at another 
     <lb/>
     time that we were assembled in the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the new provinces debating as to 
     <lb/>
     whether the provinces should have separate 
     <lb/>
     schools or not. I notice that every gentle<lb break="no"/>man on the other side of the House who 
     <lb/>
     spoke in this debate took good care to stop 
     <lb/>
     short of discussing the question as to whe<lb break="no"/>ther the Dominion or the province should 
     <lb/>
     pass educational laws. Some of them ven<lb break="no"/>tured to deal with the question whether or 
     <lb/>
     not we have the power, but none of them 
     <lb/>
     attempted to give a reason why, even if 
     <lb/>
     we had that power, we could exercise it any 
     <lb/>
     more sensibly than could the provinces 
     <lb/>
     themselves. They tell us that separate 
     <lb/>
     schools are good here and good there 
     <lb/>
     and good somewhere else, but they 
     <lb/>
     have no business to draw the de<lb break="no"/>duction that separate schools would be 
     <lb/>
     good in Alberta and Saskatchewan. If this 
     <lb/>
     parliament is going to decide whether sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools should or should not exist in 
     <lb/>
     Alberta, then we are going to do exactly 
     <lb/>
     the opposite to what occurred in relation 
     <lb/>
     to the same matter in the case of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec. Separate 
     <lb/>
     schools exist to-day in Ontario and Quebec 
     <lb/>
     because the people of these provinces ad<lb break="no"/>ministering their own local affairs, deem 
     <lb/>
     it wise that they should have separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. We are here dictating to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta what 
     <lb/>
     they shall do in this regard, but the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament never inflicted separate 
     <lb/>
     schools on Ontario or on Quebec or on British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia or on Nova Scotia or on Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island. The hon. gentleman who for 
     <lb/>
     the time being is Postmaster General of 
     <lb/>
     Canada—we do not know how soon he will 
     <lb/>
     resign when he gets to understand this 
     <lb/>
     educational clause ; he does not understand 
     <lb/>
     it yet. The Postmaster General told us 
     <lb/>
     that none of the statutes admitting new 
     <lb/>
     provinces into the confederation were alike. 
     <lb/>
     He told us that Ontario and Quebec had 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, but that in the case of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island and British Columbia separate schools 
     <lb/>
     were not established by law. I have here 
     <lb/>
     the statute under which Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island was admitted into the Dominion, and 
     <lb/>
     that statute is silent on the question of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. But the Postmaster General 
     <lb/>
     did not tell us why it is silent. If there is 
     <lb/>
     anything in the argument of the government 
     <lb/>
    it must be : that the province of Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island was not entitled to 
     <lb/>have separate schools unless the Act 
     <lb/>gave power to establish such schools in that 
     <lb/>province. The logical result of the argu<lb break="no"/>ment of the government is, that the Prince 
     <lb/>Edward Island Act being silent on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of separate schools the question can 
     <lb/>not be dealt with at all in the case of that 
     <lb/>province.

            <p>
     They argue that the Bill now before us 
     <lb/>
    would be incomplete if section 16 were not 
     <lb/>there. It has never occurred to any of them 
     <lb/>

     that you could leave out the whole of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16 and the result would be that section 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act would 
     <lb/>
     apply, and the power of the province to 
     <lb/>
     deal with the question of schools would be 
     <lb/>
     absolute. It is so in the provinces of British 
     <lb/>
     Columbia and Prince Edward Island. In 
     <lb/>
     the constitutions of these provinces there 
     <lb/>
     is not a word about education or separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, and therefore, according to the ar<lb break="no"/>gument of these hon. gentlemen, the logical 
     <lb/>
     conclusion would be that these provinces 
     <lb/>
     could not deal with education at all. That 
     <lb/>
     is where their argument would land them. 
     <lb/>
     Now, what does it all mean? It means 
     <lb/>
     simply this—and everybody of common 
     <lb/>
     sense can see it—that if the Dominion par<lb break="no"/>liament, in constituting a province, does 
     <lb/>
     not deal with the question of education, 
     <lb/>
     then the question can be dealt with by the 
     <lb/>
     province. Nobody can get away from that 
     <lb/>
     conclusion with the intelligent electorate 
     <lb/>
     of any province of this Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     They will say: Why did you not, as a 
     <lb/>
     government of the Dominion. leave that 
     <lb/>
     matter in the hands of these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces as you did all other local ques<lb break="no"/>tions, giving them provincial autonomy in 
     <lb/>
     every respect? Is the case for separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in those provincse good or not? If 
     <lb/>
     I were going to-morrow to live in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince of Alberta, and made up my mind that 
     <lb/>
     I wanted separate schools there, I would 
     <lb/>
     condemn the leader of this government for 
     <lb/>
     the manner in which he brought this ques<lb break="no"/>tion into this House and spoiled my chance 
     <lb/>
     of getting them. If he is honestly in favour 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools, and is not simply play<lb break="no"/>ing the game of politics, if he is really sin<lb break="no"/>cere in his appeals to keep racial and re<lb break="no"/>ligious questions out of this House, why 
     <lb/>
     does he bring them in? If this Bill were 
     <lb/>
     passed without section 16, everybody knows 
     <lb/>
     that the provinces would have the power to 
     <lb/>
     deal with education, and this question would 
     <lb/>
     not have been brought into this House. 
     <lb/>
     Does the premier understand that the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces are not going to give separate 
     <lb/>
     schools? Then, if he thinks they are wrong 
     <lb/>
     on that question he should not give them 
     <lb/>
     autonomy. But if he thinks the provinces 
     <lb/>
     have a right to decide the question, then he 
     <lb/>
     should leave clause 16 out of the Bill, be 
     <lb/>
     cause they have the power-without men<lb break="no"/>tioning it in the Bill. Does he think, on the 
     <lb/>
     merits of the question, having in view the 
     <lb/>
     future welfare of those provinces, that the 
     <lb/>
     majority will not be in favour of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools? If he thinks they have no right 
     <lb/>
     to that opinion, then, as an honest man, he 
     <lb/>
     should say, I will not give them autonomy 
     <lb/>
     for ten years yet, because I do not think 
     <lb/>
     they are sufficiently educated to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the subject of education. But that is not his 
     <lb/>
     position. He knows that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest are entitled to autonomy. and he 
     <lb/>
     practically says, I am afraid that in ex<lb break="no"/>ercising their right they will or may not 
     <lb/>

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3436</fw>

     establish separate schools, and, therefore, 
     <lb/>
     I will not leave them free to decide the 
     <lb/>
     question. No sensible man, applying his 
     <lb/>
     common sense to this question as would a 
     <lb/>
     jury, no matter how he votes, can easily feel 
     <lb/>
     in his heart of hearts that the premier really 
     <lb/>
     wants separate schools out there peaceably 
     <lb/>
     or else he would leave the provinces to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the question. I am not saying that I 
     <lb/>
     would or would not be in favour of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools if I lived in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Alberta. Without living there for two 
     <lb/>
     or three years I could not say whe<lb break="no"/>ther I would be in favour of them or 
     <lb/>
     not. For that same reason I ought not to 
     <lb/>
     be asked to vote upon this question; for that 
     <lb/>
     same reason the supporters of hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite ought not to be asked to vote 
     <lb/>
     upon this question; for that same reason 
     <lb/>
     the premier ought not to have brought this 
     <lb/>
     question into the House; for that same rea<lb break="no"/>son every man of us, whether he is in fav<lb break="no"/>our of separate schools or not, ought to vote 
     <lb/>
     against the Bill. It is a matter entirely of 
     <lb/>
     local concern which you are only in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to decide after you have lived out 
     <lb/>
     there and understand all the conditions. You 
     <lb/>
     do not want to take newspaper reports, let<lb break="no"/>ters from friends, sketches or literature of 
     <lb/>
     any kind; you have actually to live in a 
     <lb/>
     community before you know how to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the educational system in that com<lb break="no"/>munity. It may be that if I lived in Al<lb break="no"/>berta two or three years, I would be a 
     <lb/>
     strong advocate of separate schools there, 
     <lb/>
     or it may be that I would think separate 
     <lb/>
     schools were not good things for that prov<lb break="no"/>ince; but for that very reason every hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of this House should vote against 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, except perhaps the premier, who 
     <lb/>
     introduced it, and who, perhaps as a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of consistency, should stick to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. Postmaster General, in the 
     <lb/>
     course of his remarks, said that if you trace 
     <lb/>
     the history of the constitutions of other 
     <lb/>
     provinces and the various changes in them, 
     <lb/>
     you will find that no two of them are exact<lb break="no"/>ly alike, and he instanced the divorce courts 
     <lb/>
     which he seemed to think were a wonder<lb break="no"/>ful instance of that fact. But he gave the 
     <lb/>
     whole thing away by saying that it was be<lb break="no"/>cause the provinces with divorce courts had 
     <lb/>
     established them before those provinces 
     <lb/>
     came into the union. Although the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act assigned divorce to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, yet it provided that those prov<lb break="no"/>inces should continue to have them. That 
     <lb/>
     is the constitution, and therefore there is 
     <lb/>
     no straining of the constitution in that pro<lb break="no"/>vision. Yet here is the Postmaster General, 
     <lb/>
     a self-styled statesman, objecting to this be<lb break="no"/>ing done on legal grounds. If I did not 
     <lb/>
     know otherwise. I might suppose that the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General had never been near a 
     <lb/>
     law office or had never seen a statute. I 
     <lb/>
     am told that he is a lawyer, though he does 
     <lb/>
     not want to be called a lawyer, and I under<lb break="no"/>stand why. Because lawyers are men of 
     <lb/>

     common sense, if you leave them alone and 
     <lb/>
     do not put them into grit cabinets or on 
     <lb/>
     pedestals where no one can reach them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Minister of Finance wants it to be 
     <lb/>
     known that when he talks about this mat<lb break="no"/>ter he discusses it from the point of view 
     <lb/>
     of common sense. But the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral takes a higher ground. He sets him<lb break="no"/>self up on the pedestal of a statesman and 
     <lb/>
     tells us that he looks at this matter from 
     <lb/>
     a statesmanlike point of view and wants 
     <lb/>
     to have the question settled in a statesman<lb break="no"/>like way and not in a legal way. He evi<lb break="no"/>dently does not believe that legality and 
     <lb/>
     statesmanship ought to go hand in hand in 
     <lb/>
     any properly constituted country, but he 
     <lb/>
     will no doubt find that if the people can 
     <lb/>
     only have a chance to see that their wishes 
     <lb/>
     are fulfilled, these two essentials will be 
     <lb/>
     joined together and not divorced from one 
     <lb/>
     another as the Postmaster General thinks 
     <lb/>
     they ought to be. Well, this statesmanlike 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General or postmaster-general- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     like statesman—you can put it either way 
     <lb/>
     you like—says that because the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, which is our constitution 
     <lb/>
     —but which he does not seem to understand 
     <lb/>
     is our constitution—makes a difference be<lb break="no"/>tween different provinces, therefore the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion parliament has the right to 
     <lb/>
     change that Act as it pleases. I am not 
     <lb/>
     quite sure whether the Postmaster General 
     <lb/>
     is not labouring under the delusion that he 
     <lb/>
     is really in London, England, to-day, and 
     <lb/>
     not in Ottawa, because he does not seem 
     <lb/>
     able to distinguish between the powers of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament and the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament. But he cannot produce, nor 
     <lb/>
     can the Prime Minister nor the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice, nor the Solicitor General—lawyers 
     <lb/>
     though they be—produce any Act of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion which has ever undertaken to say 
     <lb/>
     that the British North America Act shall 
     <lb/>
     mean something different to what it really 
     <lb/>
     does say in its own language. No, this 
     <lb/>
     Bill new before us is the first measure in 
     <lb/>
     which any attempt was ever made 
     <lb/>
     by the Dominion parliament to change 
     <lb/>
     the wording and the meaning of an Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Act. Not a single Act of a Dominion 
     <lb/>
     parliament has even been drawn which. has 
     <lb/>
     undertaken to say that the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act shall be read as containing 
     <lb/>
     language different from what it really does 
     <lb/>
     contain. Surely the First Minister must 
     <lb/>
     have known that the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica Act did not give him the right to impose 
     <lb/>
     these restrictions on these provinces about 
     <lb/>
     to be created, or else he would never have 
     <lb/>
     undertaken by this measure to amend the 
     <lb/>
     Act of Confederation. No hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     will pretend to say that anybody ever be<lb break="no"/>fore undertook to resort to the very doubt<lb break="no"/>ful and suspicious expedient of having this 
     <lb/>
     tribunal alter the Act of another tribunal, 
     <lb/>
     or having this parliament declaring that an 
     <lb/>
     Act passed by the British parliament shall 
     <lb/>
     be taken to contain a different wording to 
     <lb/>
     what it really does contain.

     expression in that Act or no expression that

     could be taken to mean the same thing. He

     Chapters 29 and 30 are ordinances of the

     Northwest Territories, which did not come 
     <lb/>
     into existence until years after the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act was passed. And it 
     <lb/>
     will hardly be contended that that Act could

     exist until years after it itself had come

     for a gentleman addressing you, Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, to be interrupted even by an hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from the Northwest Territories, as I 
     <lb/>
     have been interrupted. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) had better have the local re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility in this matter—for he is not 
     <lb/>
     yet elected for the provincial legislature— 
     <lb/>
     before he undertakes to have an opinion 
     <lb/>
     about it. Even a gentleman with cabinet 
     <lb/>
     aspirations ought not to stand up in this 
     <lb/>
     House, after the exhibition the Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General (Sir William Mulock) made of him<lb break="no"/>self, and undertake to tell an hon. member 
     <lb/>
     reading plain English that there was the 
     <lb/>
     same provision in the law relating to Mani<lb break="no"/>toba schools, and, when it was proved up to 
     <lb/>
     the hilt that he was mistaken, explain that 
     <lb/>
     that is not what he meant. It is wasting the 
     <lb/>
     time of the House as the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral wasted it—not quite so completely. 
     <lb/>
     perhaps, but very near even that limit. I 
     <lb/>
     have been wondering, Mr. Speaker—and I 
     <lb/>
     am sorry that your mouth is closed and that 
     <lb/>
     you cannot give me the information—having 
     <lb/>
     seen what I have since eight o'clock, I have 
     <lb/>
     been wondering whether there is another 
     <lb/>
     cabinet crisis, and whether that is the rea<lb break="no"/>son why thc cabinet is wasting the time of 
     <lb/>
     the House. The Postmaster General took 
     <lb/>
     up nearly two hours, and proved only one 
     <lb/>
     thing, and that is that a man could talk that 
     <lb/>
     long and say nothing. And now an aspirant 
     <lb/>
     to the cabinet takes up more time in the 
     <lb/>
     fashion I have shown. Now, the Solicitor 
     <lb/>
     General wished to ask me a question.

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     Canada shall be divided into four provinces,

            <p>
     As my hon. friend knows, Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and New Brunswick took exception to the 
     <lb/>
     representation of these provinces as had 
     <lb/>
     been fixed by parliament and contended, 
     <lb/>
     with some appearance of reason, that the 
     <lb/>
     aggregate population of Canada as men<lb break="no"/>tioned in section 51 was the population of 
     <lb/>
     the four original provinces. But the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council decided that the word 'Canada' 
     <lb/>
     mentioned in section 5 was a variable term, 
     <lb/>
     which, at the beginning of our history, 
     <lb/>
     meant four provinces, but later meant five, 
     <lb/>
     six and seven provinces, thus explaining that 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act was quite an 
     <lb/>
     elastic instrument, which should be inter<lb break="no"/>preted according to the sound principles of

     <persName ref="pers:LANC1">Mr. LANCASTER</persName>. The Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lemieux) does not seem to realize that 
     <lb/>
     there is a difference between the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act being construed by the 
     <lb/>
     courts and this parliament undertaking to 
     <lb/>
     throttle the construction by an Act of its 
     <lb/>
     own. With all his legal knowledge, he can<lb break="no"/>not understand the common sense difference 
     <lb/>
     between a judge construing the language of 
     <lb/>
     this Act of the British parliament and this 
     <lb/>
     parliament undertaking to throttle the court 
     <lb/>
     and prevent any interpretation except that 
     <lb/>
     which the Prime Minister sees fit to give. 
     <lb/>
     I do not wonder that the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance (Mr. Fielding) wanted common sense 
     <lb/>
     in this matter. I do not wonder that the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General has assumed so much 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the law. I do not wonder 
     <lb/>
     that the Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson), 
     <lb/>
     having in view the advice that the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) would give on 
     <lb/>
     this question, desired to look at it in a 
     <lb/>
     common sense way. I am glad that I am 
     <lb/>
     a man of common sense, and not down in 
     <lb/>
     the cellar of the law, where I cannot see the 
     <lb/>
     daylight. I am willing to leave the matter 
     <lb/>
     to the common sense of the common people 
     <lb/>
     of this country. The ordinary man whom 
     <lb/>
     you meet on the streets, or on the farm, and 
     <lb/>
     who needs no lawyer to tell him what the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of Canada is, but knows it as 
     <lb/>
     well as we do ; he will say : Do not talk 
     <lb/>
     to me only of law or of what the judges 
     <lb/>
     have said ; the constitution of Canada was 
     <lb/>
     made in Britain, and the courts have decided 
     <lb/>
     that it means something. If the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister of this country thinks it should be 
     <lb/>
     decided to mean something else, why not 
     <lb/>
     let them decide it and not throttle the courts

            <p>
     Now, a great deal was said by the Post<lb break="no"/>master General (Sir William Mulock) with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the petitions sent him through the 
     <lb/>
     action of the hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule). The Postmaster General in<lb break="no"/>sinuated that the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey was getting up petitions on the one 
     <lb/>
     side for the other of this question. He 
     <lb/>
     undertook to say the petitions had been 
     <lb/>
     sent in here from Orange lodges. Now, let 
     <lb/>
     me be understood. I am not an Orangeman. 
     <lb/>
     I am not a Roman Catholic. But I am a 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, British born ; and I believe that 
     <lb/>
     the Orangemen and the Roman Catholics, 
     <lb/>
     taken one with another, are equally good 
     <lb/>
     citizens and equally loyal to the country. 
     <lb/>
     The petition the hon. member for Grey is 
     <lb/>
     sneered at for bringing into this House is 
     <lb/>
     a petition that every Roman Catholic could 
     <lb/>
     sign, and the signing of which he could 
     <lb/>
     justify to his priest. That petition is as 
     <lb/>
     follows :  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     This is spoken of as a partisan petition. 
     <lb/>
     Yet it is a petition that every citizen could 
     <lb/>
     properly sign. It says in effect : Render to 
     <lb/>
     Caesar the things that are Caesar's; render 
     <lb/>
     to Alberta the things that are Alberta's, 
     <lb/>
     and don't take away from the little fellow 
     <lb/>
     what belongs to him at the dictation of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, which has no right to butt in at 
     <lb/>
     all. There is nothing here either in favour 
     <lb/>
     of or against the principle of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools ; it is simply an humble request, 
     <lb/>
     put in perfectly constitutional form. It is 
     <lb/>
     such a petition as we were asked to vote 
     <lb/>
     for four years ago by the Prime Minister, 
     <lb/>
     at the instigation originally of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Victoria, N.B. (Mr. Costigan). 
     <lb/>
     It was moved that this parliament should 
     <lb/>
     exercise its right of petition, should go to 
     <lb/>
     the foot of the throne and ask that the 
     <lb/>
     Coronation Declaration made by the King 
     <lb/>
     should be amended so that it would not be 
     <lb/>
     offensive to His Majesty's Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     liege subjects in the country and throughout 
     <lb/>
     the empire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     These people, I care not whether they be 
     <lb/>
     Orange lodges or Roman Catholics, have 
     <lb/>
     the same right to petition, and their petition 
     <lb/>
     is equally sensible, equally just, equally cor<lb break="no"/>rect, equally constitutional, and that is the 
     <lb/>
     petition that my hon. friend from East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. 'Sproule) is sneered at for bringing in 
     <lb/>
     here. I presented a lot of them myself, they 
     <lb/>
     were sent to me and I presented them ; and 
     <lb/>
     it they petitioned this parliament against 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy to the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, I would present the petition, though 
     <lb/>

     I would vote against the prayer of the peti<lb break="no"/>tion, because I would think it was not right, 
     <lb/>
     and the people could turn me out when l 
     <lb/>
     sought re-election at their hands. That is the 
     <lb/>
     petition that so much has been said about, 
     <lb/>
     and I thought it wise to put that petition 
     <lb/>
     upon record. That is the petition that is 
     <lb/>
     called by the Postmaster General, one side 
     <lb/>
     of the question; a petition that asks separate 
     <lb/>
     schools to be established is called the other 
     <lb/>
     side of the question. Could anything be 
     <lb/>
     more unfair? There are no petitions com<lb break="no"/>ing from Orange lodges asking us to throttle 
     <lb/>
     the little province and prevent it from 
     <lb/>
     establishing separate schools. I call the

     attention of the statesmanlike Postmaster 
     <lb/>
     General—I will assume that he is a states<lb break="no"/>man, although he is self-appointed, self-

     <lb/>a petition which asks this House to 
     <lb/>throttle a province is the other side

     <lb/>a gentleman from Quebec who advocates 
     <lb/>separate schools in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, say if we attempted in this House, 
     <lb/>ten years or five years from now, supposing 
     <lb/>the country got incensed at Quebec butting 
     <lb/>in on these matters concerning the North<lb break="no"/>west, supposing the country got aggravated,

     <lb/>insist for a certain term in doing what the 
     <lb/>Finance Minister says is so deplorable, we 
     <lb/>will put some people in power who will 
     <lb/>settle this school question for ever in Quebec, 
     <lb/>just as these gentlemen want this govern<lb break="no"/>ment to settle the school question in the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories, and we will abolish 
     <lb/>separate schools in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>and Ontario. Now what would they say to 
     <lb/>that ? In principle what is the difference ? 
     <lb/>What is the difference between taking away 
     <lb/>a man's right and preventing him from 
     <lb/>exercising the right ? In common sense, what 
     <lb/>is the difference between the two proposi<lb break="no"/>tions? Am I doing a greater wrong if I 
     <lb/>go into a man's barnyard and steal his horse 
     <lb/>than if I said to him, although you have got 
     <lb/>a horse I will not allow you to use it, I 
     <lb/>will control it so that you shall never have 
     <lb/>the use of it? To be practical, what is 
     <lb/>the difierence '? He cannot use that which 
     <lb/>is his own in either case. He cannot deal 
     <lb/>with that which is his own, and which he 
     <lb/>has a right to deal with. There may be a 
     <lb/>difference in the way it may strike one man 
     <lb/>or another in the application, but on the 
     <lb/>moral principle—and we heard something 
     <lb/>even from the Postmaster General about

     morals to-night—on the moral principle what 
     <lb/>
     is the difference between your saying to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec ; although you have 
     <lb/>
     yourselves established a right to your 
     <lb/>
     schools in the provinces of Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario ; you shall not have them any longer, 
     <lb/>
     because we think it was a mistake when you 
     <lb/>
     established them—what would be the differ<lb break="no"/>ence between saying that and saying to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest provinces, you shall not exercise 
     <lb/>
     your right to declare whether you want 
     <lb/>
     separate schools or not, we will tie you up 
     <lb/>
     so that you shall never make a declaration 
     <lb/>
     either way ? There is no difference in prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, no man can pretend there is.

     Now I want to put on record the state<lb break="no"/>ments of some of the friends of hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite. In 1891 Sir Louis Davies 
     <lb/>
     spoke on this question of education in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. That gentleman is 
     <lb/>
     now a judge of the Supreme Court. He was 
     <lb/>
     one of. the gentlemen who came into power 
     <lb/>
     on the cry that we should not coerce Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. This is what Sir Louis Davies said 
     <lb/>
     in 1891 :

     My opinion is now, and has been for years, 
     <lb/>
     that when that time comes (the time to erect 
     <lb/>
     the Territories into provinces) you cannot with<lb break="no"/>hold from the provinces so erected the right 
     <lb/>
     to determine for themselves the question of 
     <lb/>
     education in one way or the other. I would

     be the last to favour this parliament imposing

     a. Bill is introduced to erect those Territories

     The Hon. David Mills, in the same year, 
     <lb/>
     spoke, not about separate schools in Quebec 
     <lb/>
     or Ontario, not about the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, but in regard to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, the very part of this Do<lb break="no"/>minion which this parliament is now dealing 
     <lb/>
     with. The Hon. David Mills was recognized 
     <lb/>
     as an authority on constitutional law by 
     <lb/>
     the Reformers of this country, and I think 
     <lb/>
     by a good many Conservatives. In fact, he 
     <lb/>
     was held up by hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     as the great constitutional model of this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion, and this is what he says :

      It was necessary for the ' Globe ' news<lb break="no"/>paper to tell the premier of this country

     for the ' Globe ' to try and pull a line on 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister as the organ of the 
     <lb/>
     party in the city of Toronto. I presume 
     <lb/>
     that the ' Globe ' would say that it was the 
     <lb/>
     chief organ of the party in the whole Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. I cannot pronounce upon that point, 
     <lb/>
     but certainly it is one of the principal organs 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion, and before this Bill could 
     <lb/>
     be read a second time, in the hope that some 
     <lb/>
     other policy would be adopted, the ' Globe ' 
     <lb/>
     gave the advice that provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     under the constitution means autonomy in 
     <lb/>
     education. Is it any wonder that my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend who leads the opposition here is 
     <lb/>
     obliged to put on record an amendment to 
     <lb/>
     this Bill to say so ? The ' Globe ' said that 
     <lb/>
     it was necessary to tell the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter that autonomy meant autonomy in edu<lb break="no"/>cation as well as in anything else, and for 
     <lb/>
     fear that some people would think that the 
     <lb/>
     government could say that my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition did not agree 
     <lb/>
     with the ' Globe ' I would point out that, as 
     <lb/>
     it happened on these two occasions these 
     <lb/>
     two gentlemen—I think the gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     wrote this article was an honest man, and I 
     <lb/>
     know there is no more honourable man in the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada than my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition—came forward 
     <lb/>
     and took the same view as the whole Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada will if it gets a chance. If 
     <lb/>
     the government went to the country upon 
     <lb/>
     this question to-day, the government know 
     <lb/>
     very well that the whole Dominion, whe<lb break="no"/>ther Grits or Tories heretofore, would unite 
     <lb/>
     by their votes in saying that the ' Globe ' 
     <lb/>
     was right on this occasion. Then, the

     Who has put the root of bitterness into 
     <lb/>
     the fertile soil of our national life ?—The 
     <lb/>
     right hon. Prime Minister who cannot pass 
     <lb/>
     his Autonomy Bill without dragging that 
     <lb/>
     question into parliament that the 'Globe' 
     <lb/>
     tells him should be left to the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     The ' Globe' has evidently been found 
     <lb/>
     fault with by somebody, some man on the 
     <lb/>
     street that we have heard about, has been 
     <lb/>
     to see the ' Globe,' but the ' Globe' thinks 
     <lb/>
     it has done right to have its own opinion. 
     <lb/>
     The 'Globe' on March 11 said what I have 
     <lb/>
     just read, but I have also here the 'Globe' 
     <lb/>
    of March 21, just ten days later. Somebody 
     <lb/>has been after the ' Globe ' in the meantime 
     <lb/>with this result that the ' Globe' says that 
     <lb/>what we said before we believe and we are 
     <lb/>still more of that opinion than we were at 
     <lb/>the time you found fault with us. That is 
     <lb/>our argument, and the more hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>opposite argue, the more we are satisfied 
     <lb/>they are all wrong. The more they are 
     <lb/>finding fault with the 'Globe' the more 
     <lb/>the ' Globe ' feels convinced that it is right 
     <lb/>and it repeats what it said before only that 
     <lb/>it says it in stronger terms : This is what 
     <lb/>the ' Globe ' says on March 21 : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     1. The 'Globe' stands for the provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights of Saskatchewan and Alberta. Those 
     <lb/>
     rights are created and secured by and under 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act. The 'terms 
     <lb/>
     and conditions' of their provincial autonomy 
     <lb/>
     must be ' subject to the provisions of this Act.' 
     <lb/>
     They can have no rights as provinces that are 
     <lb/>
     not expressed or implied in the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, 1867 to 1886. They can be de<lb break="no"/>prived of no rights to which they are entitled 
     <lb/>
     under that constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     2. The ' Globe ' holds, as has been argued in 
     <lb/>
     these columns again and again, that the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces now to be created do not come under 
     <lb/>
     the separate school obligation of section 93, 
     <lb/>
     clause 1, of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     and, therefore, they are free under the con<lb break="no"/>stitution exclusively to make laws in relation 
     <lb/>
     to education, to continue their present system, 
     <lb/>
     to modify it or to substitute another for it, 
     <lb/>
     as their legislatures shall decide. Our reasons 
     <lb/>
     for holding to this view were stated yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     and in several earlier articles, and at the very 
     <lb/>
     opening of the discussion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     3. The ' Globe ' is persuaded, by its first-hand 
     <lb/>
     knowledge of western conditions and by the 
     <lb/>
    assurances of representative western men, that 
     <lb/>had the education question been left without

     4. The 'Globe' holds that the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses in the first draft of the Autonomy Bills 
     <lb/>
     are ultra vires of the federal parliament, 
     <lb/>
     especially the third clause which is held to 
     <lb/>
     contravene the Dominion Lands Act and to 
     <lb/>
     interfere with the provincial control of the 
     <lb/>
     details of school administration.

            <p>
     5. The 'Globe,' as a logical consequence of 
     <lb/>
     the foregoing, holds to be ultra vires of par<lb break="no"/>liament and an infringement, in theory if not 
     <lb/>
     in practice, of the rights of the provinces under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution, any legislation based on 
     <lb/>
     the assumption that in the meaning of 
     <lb/>
    the British North America Act there is 
     <lb/>no difference between the creation of a 
     <lb/>province out of territory for thirty-five 
     <lb/>years a part of Canada and under federal 
     <lb/>supervision, and the union to the Canadian 
     <lb/>confederation of an independent, self-gov<lb break="no"/>erning, autonymous province or colony such as 
     <lb/>British Columbia was prior to 1871 or as New<lb break="no"/>foundland is to-day. A territory is not a 
     <lb/>province, and the constitutional obligations of 
     <lb/>a province cannot rest upon a territory until it 
     <lb/>becomes a province.

     That is the 'Globe's' statement and that 
     <lb/>
     is my idea of what is right. I do not say it 
     <lb/>
     is right because the 'Globe' says so, but I 
     <lb/>
     do say that when the 'Globe,'which is not 
     <lb/>
     going out of its way to injure the govern<lb break="no"/>ment says so, it means a great majority of 
     <lb/>
     the people of this country, Liberals as well 
     <lb/>
     as Conservatives, the independent thinking 
     <lb/>
     people on both sides of politics, are of the 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the government is doing wrong. 
     <lb/>
     But, says the government, we are in for five 
     <lb/>
     years anyway and what matters it ? Well, 
     <lb/>
     I say to them that the five years will go by. 
     <lb/>
     They may hold themselves in power for five 
     <lb/>
     years, but when the election comes the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Canada will do as the people of Lin<lb break="no"/>coln county did four years after the 
     <lb/>
     pledge of the Prime Minister was broken 
     <lb/>
     and on which pledge they returned a sup<lb break="no"/>porter of his to this House. The chief whip 
     <lb/>
     of the Reform party held the constituency 
     <lb/>
     of Lincoln by a majority of nearly 500, but 
     <lb/>
     the government broke its pledges as to pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, as on every other question, 
     <lb/>
     and the people of the county of Lincoln 
     <lb/>
     punished the government because of its 
     <lb/>
     broken pledges, and a man of no greater 
     <lb/>
     ability than your humble servant was elect<lb break="no"/>ed and the chief whip of the Reform party 
     <lb/>
     was left at home. As the people of Lincoln 
     <lb/>
     county did in that instance, so shall the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Dominion do when they get 
     <lb/>
     the opportunity. It may be that the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister will retire from office before an 
     <lb/>
     appeal is again made to the electorate; it 
     <lb/>
     may be that the Minister of Finance or the 
     <lb/>
     statesmanlike Postmaster General will make 
     <lb/>
     himself or get some one to make him Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister, but whoever be the Liberal Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister who appeals to the people of Can<lb break="no"/>

     ada he will find that the people of this Do<lb break="no"/>minion will not stand for interference with 
     <lb/>
     the autonomy of the provinces, will not 
     <lb/>
     stand for broken pledges, will not stand for 
     <lb/>
     the shackling of these great provinces of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest with onerous restrictions as 
     <lb/>
     to education and the administration of their 
     <lb/>
     public lands. Why have we no Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior to-day? Why is the govern<lb break="no"/>ment afraid to appoint a Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior and send him for election to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west? I have not the assur<lb break="no"/>ance which some gentlemen on the other 
     <lb/>
     side have to say that they speak for the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories when 
     <lb/>
     they have no mandate to speak on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; I do not pretend to speak for the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories except to 
     <lb/>
     say that they want to be left alone to at<lb break="no"/>tend to their own business, but I do believe 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     will treat this government as it deserves to 
     <lb/>
     be treated for interfering with their pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. The government does not 
     <lb/>
     dare to appoint a Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     because they know that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest would reject him by an over<lb break="no"/>whelming vote. The Prime Minister is not 
     <lb/>
     here to-night, but in times past he has 
     <lb/>
     learned something from this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, and I invite the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms and the Minister of Finance who are 
     <lb/>
     now present to tell the Prime Minister that 
     <lb/>
     it is his duty to appoint a Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior and to test the feelings of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west on this question. That is 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional way to proceed, but these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen do not want things done con<lb break="no"/>stitutionally. They had not much respect for 
     <lb/>
     the constitution when, the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance being absent in England, they intro<lb break="no"/>duced without his knowledge this Bill which 
     <lb/>
     deals with great financial issues seriously 
     <lb/>
     affecting the Dominion. They had not much 
     <lb/>
     respect for the constitution when in the 
     <lb/>
     absence of their Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     who is specially charged with matters per<lb break="no"/>taining to the west, they drafted and pro<lb break="no"/>posed in parliament this measure which 
     <lb/>
     vitally concerns the people whose interest 
     <lb/>
     he was specially charged to guard. Let 
     <lb/>
     them appoint their Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     and they can soon find out whether we are 
     <lb/>
     right or they are right. Sir, as a man try<lb break="no"/>ing to do the honourable thing and repre<lb break="no"/>senting an honourable constituency, I have 
     <lb/>
     no course left to me but to vote for the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of the leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
     In doing so, I believe I am voicing the opin<lb break="no"/>ions of the Reformers as well as the Con<lb break="no"/>servatives, of the respectable Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics as well as the respectable Protestants 
     <lb/>
     of my county. If I do that I am doing my 
     <lb/>
    whole duty, and, Sir, if the members of this 
     <lb/>cabinet would study more what the people 
     <lb/>want and not what may suit the political 
     <lb/>exigencies of the moment they would be 
     <lb/>representing the people of Canada better 
     <lb/>than they are to-day.

     Hon. GEO. E. FOSTER (North Toronto). 
     <lb/>
     Before the Orders of the Day are called, I 
     <lb/>
     wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he 
     <lb/>
     has any information for the House in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the filling of the vacant portfolio of 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior ? It is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of a great deal of moment, and we 
     <lb/>
     have not yet had a really thorough answer 
     <lb/>
     from the Prime Minister. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER (Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister). I have no information to give 
     <lb/>
     to my hon. friend to-day.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Then I suppose I will be 
     <lb/>
     equally successful when I make a plea for 
     <lb/>
     that return with reference to the transport 
     <lb/>
     of hay to the lower provinces, which was 
     <lb/>
     ordered by the House on January 25. A 
     <lb/>
     second order in reference to the matter was 
     <lb/>
     passed a fortnight later, and the return to 
     <lb/>
     that has been brought down, but it is ab<lb break="no"/>solutely useless without the other. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I shall in<lb break="no"/>quire about that.

     course of his speech that he comes from

     that part of Canada surnamed the Garden

     of Ontario. It was necessary that he 
     <lb/>
     should do so, as his violent delivery and 
     <lb/>
     forcible language might have led us to 
     <lb/>
     believe that he was not a resident of that 
     <lb/>
     rich and beautiful country surrounding St. 
     <lb/>
     Catharines, but rather that his mind had 
     <lb/>
