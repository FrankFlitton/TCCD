     <persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr MACKENZIE</persName> moved the 
     <lb/>third reading of Bill to amend and consoli<lb break="no"/>date the laws respecting the North-West<lb/>Territories.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN MACDONALD</persName> said he did <lb/>not object to the third reading and passage<lb/>of this Bill, but he would again impress upon<lb/>the leader of the Government the expe<lb break="no"/>diency, from an economical point of view,<lb/>of governing the North-West Territories<lb/>from Fort Garry. A commission could be <lb/>issued to the Lieut. Governor of Manitoba<lb/>to act for the present as Lieut. Governor<lb/>of the North-West. He had plenty of<lb/>time on his hands, and there was no reason<lb/>in the world why he should not direct his<lb/>attention to the government of the whole<lb/>of the North-West for the present. The <lb/>objection of the hon. Premier that the <lb/>North-West Council had proved a failure,<lb/>because none of its members residing west<lb/>of Manitoba was fully answered by the <lb/>hon. member for Selkirk who stated that<lb/>

     at least six of these gentlemen were 
     <lb/>scattered through the territory and knew<lb/>all about it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName> received the<lb/>suggestion of the hon. member, in the <lb/>spirit in which it was offered, but could<lb/>not adopt it. If he had not regarded this<lb/>measure as a necessity he would not have<lb/>introduced it. The Lieut. Governor, as <lb/>one of the commissioners who accom<lb break="no"/>panied the Minister of the Interior to<lb/>negotiate a treaty with the Indians,<lb/>although only absent three weeks from<lb/>Manitoba and distant about 250 miles<lb/>from that Province was obligated to issue a<lb/>commission to the Chief Justice to act as <lb/>Lieut. Governor of Manitoba in his<lb/>absence. That was, to say the least, incon<lb break="no"/>venient, and the inconvenience would be <lb/>increased, of course, in proportion to the <lb/>length of absence required in administrat<lb break="no"/>ing the affairs in the North-West. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill was read a third time and<lb/>passed.<lb/>
