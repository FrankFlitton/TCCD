           <!-- <p>Mr. HYMAN. Private members' work 
     <lb/>
     will be taken up, and if we get through with 
     <lb/>
     that we will go into supply. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Mr. INGRAM. On what items ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Mr. HYMAN. I cannot answer that, but 
     <lb/>
     it will not be on the Public Works esti<lb break="no"/>mates. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Mr. INGRAM. Could any of the minis<lb break="no"/>ters say what estimates they will discuss? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Mr. HYMAN. It is a difficult matter. If 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Agriculture is here, I 
     <lb/>
     think he will go on with his estimates, but 
     <lb/>
     I would not like to be bound down to saying 
     <lb/>
     exactly what we will go on with. It will 
     <lb/>
     be private members' day, and I suppose it 
     <lb/>
     will be taken up with private members' 
     <lb/>
     business. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

                                          called, I intend to ask the attention of the <lb/> House
                                          to a very grave matter ; and, if neces<lb break="no"/>sary, to put myself in order, I will con<lb break="no"/>clude with a motion. The very important <lb/> matter to
                                          which I propose to call attention <lb/> has reference to
                                          provincial rights, particu<lb break="no"/>larly the rights
                                          of the province of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and I regret
                                          very much that neither <lb/> the Minister of the Interior
                                          (Mr. Sifton) nor <lb/> the late premier of Manitoba (Mr.

                                          this House <lb/> is in his place. It is largely because
                                          these <lb/> hon. gentlemen have not chosen to call the
                                          <lb/> attention of the House to this matter that <lb/> I
                                          do so today. I think I can best bring <lb/> the question
                                          immediately within the view <lb/> of hon. members by
                                          reading a translation <lb/> of an article that was

            <p>On February 17, that paper, in an edi<lb break="no"/>torial, discussed the rights of the province

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>In proportion to her big sisters Manitoba will 
     <lb/>
     count as little more than a large county. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>This is one of the reasons invoked by Mani<lb break="no"/>toba's delegates to obtain an enlargement of 
     <lb/>
     her territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>There is another. Quebec and Ontario have 
     <lb/>
     extended their limits, the one to the west, the 
     <lb/>
     other to the east, to attain on the north the 
     <lb/>
     shores of James bay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Manitoba aspires to the shores of Hudson bay, 
     <lb/>
     on the northeast. It would be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     withdraw her boundaries several hundred miles 
     <lb/>
     towards the north, to cut the districts of Sas<lb break="no"/>katchewan and Athabaska, and encircle that of 
     <lb/>
     Keewatin. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Manitoba is asking for treble her existing 
     <lb/>
     territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>This enlargement is hardly possible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>The district of Saskatchewan opposes it, at 
     <lb/>
     least the part directly interested. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>The finances of Manitoba in their actual state 
     <lb/>
     are not made to attract the free residents of 
     <lb/>
     the districts. Manitoba has a debt of $4,000,000. 
     <lb/>
     The school legislation of the little province is 
     <lb/>
     not of a nature to attract the immigrants who 
     <lb/>
     people the districts. The Northwest has its 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. Manitoba has abolished them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Every good act has its reward, every bad act 
     <lb/>
     its chastisement.

            <p>In other words, a threat is here held out 
     <lb/>
     by the Quebec organ of hon. gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite that Manitoba is to be kept in her 
     <lb/>
     inferior position, as compared with the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces, as a punishment because she 
     <lb/>
     chose to vindicate her provincial rights. 
     <lb/>
     She is to be denied territory, and worse 
     <lb/>
     things than that are to befall her. Again 
     <lb/>
     I say I regret the absence of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of the Interior and the late Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba. Among the laws of this coun<lb break="no"/>try is a very important Act called the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Lands Act. Reading from the Re<lb break="no"/>vised Statutes of 1886, I find that section 
     <lb/>
     23 of that Act, under the head of School 
     <lb/>
     Lands, says: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Now, from the statement which was made 
     <lb/>
     to all Canada the other day, we must infer 
     <lb/>
     that the Dominion Lands Act is to be chang<lb break="no"/>ed, and that in the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     these school lands, which are now conse<lb break="no"/>crated to public schools, not to separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, are to be sold, and the proceeds dis<lb break="no"/>tributed in an entirely different way. That 
     <lb/>
     follows from the statement made here the 
     <lb/>
     other day, and on behalf of Manitoba I pro<lb break="no"/>test to-day against any such change in the 
     <lb/>
     law, or any such chastisement being meted 
     <lb/>
     out to that province as is proposed by this 
     <lb/>
     organ of the government. That organ 
     <lb/>
     wants Manitoba chastised because of cer<lb break="no"/>tain laws which that province has passed 
     <lb/>
     in connection with the school lands, and yet 
     <lb/>
     this same organ is the mouthpiece of this 
     <lb/>
     government, of which the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior (Mr. Sifton) is a member, and of 
     <lb/>
     which the late premier of Manitoba (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Greenway) is an ardent supporter. If any 
     <lb/>
     wrong has been wrought to the Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of Manitoba in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the school question, is not that 
     <lb/>
     due to the Minister of the Interior and the 
     <lb/>
     late premier of Manitoba ? They it was 
     <lb/>
     who caused the Manitoba legislation now 
     <lb/>
    complained of to be enacted. It was the 
     <lb/>Liberal party which passed it, and did so 
     <lb/>in the interests of that province. Yet to-day 
     <lb/>we have the Dominion government, of which 
     <lb/>these gentlemen are the mainstay, threaten<lb break="no"/>ing, through its leading organ, to chastise 
     <lb/>Manitoba because of that very legislation. 
     <lb/>That organ says to the province of Manito<lb break="no"/>ba : You shall not extend your bounds, you 
     <lb/>shall continue in the lowly inferior position 
     <lb/>you now occupy. On behalf of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and because these gentlemen are not 
     <lb/>here to raise their voices in its behalf, I 
     <lb/>raise mine.

            <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh. oh.

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. I raise my protest
                                          <lb/> because the proposal about to be made here <lb/> is
                                          of a most far reaching character. Not <lb/> only the
                                          school lands of Manitoba, but the <lb/> whole educational
                                          fund of that province, is <lb/> to be changed by a general
                                          Act, which must <lb/> follow from what was said here the
                                          other <lb/> day. I draw the attention of the right hon.
                                          <lb/> gentleman to this. If these important <lb/> changes
                                          are to be made on the lines laid <lb/> down by him, then
                                          it follows that remedial <lb/> legislation is in order as
                                          concerns Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. The argument is an a
                                          fortiori one. <lb/> Remedial legislation must follow, and
                                          it <lb/> will be introduced in this House by the <lb/>
                                          right hon. gentleman who warned the coun<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw type="num">1748</fw>try against such legislation eight years ago. <lb/>
                                          There is this prospect for Manitoba, that all <lb/> her
                                          schools lands are, in every probability, <lb/> to be
                                          diverted this very session of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment
                                          to other purposes than those to which <lb/> they are
                                          devoted to-day by a general Act <lb/> amending the
                                          Dominion Lands Act. Fur<lb break="no"/>thermore the
                                          Manitoba school funds are to <lb/> be diverted by
                                          legislation which must follow <lb/> as a logical sequence
                                          from the statement <lb/> made the other day. Logically the
                                          right hon. <lb/> gentleman is bound to introduce a Bill
                                                 re<lb break="no"/>medying the school grievances of
                                          the minor<lb break="no"/>ity in the province of Manitoba,
                                          and yet <lb/> these very so called grievances are due to
                                          <lb/> the Minister of the Interior of this govern<lb break="no"/>ment and his friend (Mr. Greenway) who,
                                          <lb/> I am told, is to be his immediate successor in <lb/>
                                          this government. It was to give these hon. <lb/> gentlemen
                                          an opportunity here to repudiate <lb/> this language, to
                                          say they could not be par<lb break="no"/>ties to any such
                                          legislation, that I brought <lb/> this mattter up to-day ;
                                          and in all proba<lb break="no"/>bility the absence of the
                                          hon. the Minister <lb/> of the Interior from this House
                                          ever since the <lb/> beginning of this session and the
                                          absence <lb/> of the hon. member for Lisgar, (Mr. Green-
                                                 <lb break="yes"/> way) to-day are due to their
                                          desire to shirk <lb/> their manifest duty in connection
                                          with this <lb/> matter. The hon. the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior was here only for a moment the
                                          other <lb/> day, and his absence no doubt is due, as <lb/>
                                          well as that of the other hon. gentleman, <lb/> to what is
                                          in the immediate future in store <lb/> for them. If what
                                          was foreshadowed the <lb/> other day is to happen, it must
                                          follow that <lb/> those school lands are to be diverted
                                          from <lb/> their present purpose and a Remedial Bill <lb/>
                                          introduced this session, and the party, which <lb/> claims
                                          to be the defender of provincial rights <lb/> from one end
                                          of the country to the other, is <lb/> to-day doing nothing
                                          to prevent the shackles <lb/> being put on the provinces
                                          of this great and <lb/> free Dominion. These provinces are
                                          to-day <lb/> free, and my-right hon. friend must know
                                          <lb/> that if there is one thing which the people <lb/>
                                          who breathe the free air of the prairies, the <lb/> people
                                          of the great west, value, it is their <lb/> political
                                          liberty ; and if the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman
                                          insists on shackling these people <lb/> in connection with
                                          the dispossession of their <lb/> school lands, he will
                                          make a great mistake. <lb/> He apparently does not
                                          understand the <lb/> genius of. the western people if he
                                          thinks <lb/> that by aid of any constitutional argument,
                                          <lb/> he can interfere with the school lands of the <lb/>
                                          province of Manitoba. I leave the case for <lb/> the
                                          present but may have to return to it. <lb/>

                                          place. Again I call the attention of the <lb/> right hon.
                                          gentleman to the absence of a <lb/> number of his

                                          Works (Mr. Suther<lb break="no"/>land) is not here. I
                                          regret that he is ill, <lb/> but the constitutional
                                          practice is that when <lb/> a minister is not able to take
                                          his place in <lb/>

                                          late government about this very thing. <lb/> I regret that
                                          the Minister of the Interior, <lb/> (Mr. Sifton) was not
                                          in his place at the <lb/> time when these provincial
                                          rights which he <lb/> held at one time to be most dear to
                                          the <lb/> people of Manitoba, were being assailed. I <lb/>
                                          recollect when that hon. gentleman came <lb/> down to the
                                          province of Ontario and told the <lb/> people of Haldimand
                                          that of all things the <lb/> people of Manitoba did not
                                          want separate <lb/> schools or remedial legislation
                                          imposed upon <lb/> them. He came to the province of
                                          Ontario <lb/> for sympathy on that score and he got it.
                                          <lb/> But now if we are to believe the right hon. <lb/>
                                          gentleman's organ, all that is to be taken <lb/> back, the
                                          school lands are to be diverted <lb/> from their proper
                                          purpose, and the hon. <lb/> gentleman is bound, if he
                                          carries out what. <lb/> he promised, to introduce this
                                          session, an <lb/> Act to remedy the school grievances of
                                          the <lb/> minority of Manitoba. If any such thing <lb/> be
                                          attempted, the wrong will be done, pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights will be taken away, and to-day, <lb/> in

                                          every session more and more quix<lb break="no"/>otic in

                                          just read from the Soeil<lb break="no"/>eil' and on which
                                          he has built so unwar<lb break="no"/>ranted a conclusion
                                          that the government <lb/>contemplates introducing a

                                          not, I know not <lb/>how to characterize in what manner it
                                          was <lb/>manufactured. Where is there a single <lb/>word
                                          to warrant what the hon. gentleman <lb/>sees there
                                          ?--<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. <lb/> I did not say that it

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. My hon. friend
                                          <lb/> admits there is nothing there to warrant his <lb/>
                                          outbreak. The whole thing is in my hon. <lb/> friend's own
                                          mind, and it is from his own <lb/> mind alone that he has
                                          evolved the notion <lb/> that this government contemplates
                                          any such <lb/> thing as introducing a Remedial Bill for
                                          the <lb/> province of Manitoba. That is the only <lb/>
                                          authority he has for his remarks this after<lb break="no"/>noon. The thing is too absurd for consider<lb break="no"/>ation. My hon. friend professes to have <lb/> his soul
                                          harrowed by the prospect be con<lb break="no"/>templates.
                                          Let me tell him once and for <lb/> all that the government
                                          since 1896 has never <lb/> contemplated introducing any
                                          Remedial Act <lb/> affecting the province of Manitoba and
                                          does <lb/> not intend doing so. <lb/>
                                   </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. What about the
                                          <lb/> school lands ? <lb/>
                                   </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I may say to
                                          <lb/> the hon. gentleman that the government has <lb/> not
                                          contemplated and does not contemplate <lb/> to introduce
                                          any law to amend the School <lb/> Law. Is that categorical
                                          enough for the <lb/> hon. gentleman? <lb/>
                                   </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. You cannot change
                                          <lb/> the School Law without changing the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Lands Act. <lb/>
                                   </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Then I will
                                          <lb/> make my answer more categorical yet. The <lb/>
                                          government has not contemplated, does not <lb/>
                                          contemplate and will not contemplate any <lb/> amendment
                                          to the Dominion Lands Act. <lb/> I do not understand what
                                          the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man ls aiming at to-day. If
                                          he has any <lb/> object it must be to try and create a
                                          false <lb/> impression to arouse prejudices somewhere.
                                          <lb/> But the hon. gentleman began by express<lb break="no"/>ing his deep regret that the Minister
                                          of the <lb/> Interior and the hon. member from Lisgar
                                          <lb/> (Mr. Greenway) the former premier of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, were not in their seats. Why,
                                          Sir, <lb/> it would have been very easy for the hon. <lb/>
                                          gentleman to secure their presence in their <lb/> seats if
                                          he wanted them to be present. Why <lb/> did he not notify
                                          them that he wanted to <lb/> bring before the House some
                                          question re<lb break="no"/>quiring their presence, and
                                          which required <lb/> them to make some defence to charges
                                          that <lb/> he intended to bring against them. Did <lb/>
                                          the hon. gentleman notify the Minister of <lb/> the
                                          Interior that he wanted him here to<lb break="no"/>day?
                                          Did he notify the hon. member for <lb/> Lisgar that he
                                          desired his presence here to<lb break="no"/>day? I am in
                                          the judgment of the House <lb/> when I say that the hon.
                                          gentleman, when <lb/> he intended to bring charges against
                                          the <lb/> members of the House. wilful and deliber<lb break="no"/>ate charges, has not had the manliness
                                          to <lb/> notify them that he intended to do so. As <lb/>
                                          to the ' Soleil,' I have no interest whatever <lb/> in

                                          supports the government, but <lb/> sometimes opposes it.
                                          It the hon. gentle' <lb/> man expects me to be responsible
                                          for any<lb break="no"/>thing that is published in the '

            <p><persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Mr. Speaker, the
                                          <lb/> right hon. gentleman is trying to draw a <lb/> red
                                          herring across the track. This news<lb break="no"/>paper
                                          which declares it is his organ, and <lb/> he has not
                                          repudiated it, says that the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of
                                          Manitoba is to be chastised be<lb break="no"/>cause of its
                                          pretentious school law, it is <lb/> to be chastised by the
                                          right hon. gentleman <lb/> and his party, and the
                                          chastisement is in <lb/> evidence now before all the
                                          people. Mani<lb break="no"/>toba expected that her
                                          boundaries would be <lb/> extended, and she expected that
                                          the Minister <lb/> of the interior would be here to see
                                          that <lb/> her boundaries were extended, but Manitoba
                                          <lb/> is being chastised to-day, as the organ of <lb/> the
                                          right hon. gentleman says, because of <lb/> her
                                          pretentious school laws. They are not <lb/> pretentious,
                                          they are constitutional, she had <lb/> a right to make
                                          them, yet she is to be chas<lb break="no"/>tised to-day.
                                          The right hon. gentleman <lb/> said practically the other
                                          day that the <lb/> province was entitled to have its
                                          boundaries <lb/> enlarged, it was entitled to be put on an
                                          <lb/> equality with the other provinces. All over <lb/>
                                          the country the statement has been publish<lb break="no"/>ed that Manitoba is being chastised because <lb/> of her
                                          manliness in connection with public <lb/> schools. The
                                          right hon. gentleman says he <lb/> does not propose to
                                          interfere with the Do<lb break="no"/>minion Lands Act. He
                                          does in substance, <lb/> he does in a certain measure
                                          which I know <lb/> of, where it is all outlined that the
                                          public <lb/> school lands and the public funds in re<lb break="no"/>lation to education are to be
                                          interfered <lb/> with. It may be in a special Bill, but
                                          the <lb/> intention is to make laws in that direction.
                                          <lb/> What follows then is this, that in the way <lb/> the
                                          right hon. gentleman aproaches this <lb/> question he is
                                          making flesh of one and fish <lb/> of the other ; certain
                                          provinces are to enjoy <lb/> certain school lands and
                                          others are to be de<lb break="no"/>nied them. If that is
                                          not an injustice and <lb/> an interference with the lands
                                          of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, I do not know what it is.
                                          The right <lb/> hon. gentleman is trying to get away from
                                          <lb/> this question in saying that he does not <lb/>
                                          propose to introduce remedial legislation. <lb/> He is
                                          bound to introduce it if there is any<lb break="no"/>thing
                                          in the constitutional argument he <lb/> made here the
                                          other day. There is nothing <lb/> in that constitutional
                                          argument, but there is <lb/> a great deal in the
                                          constitutional argument <lb/> that Manitoba is entitled to
                                          remedial legis<lb break="no"/>lation. If that is true, I
                                          will have to put <lb/> up for the present with the trivial
                                          reply of <lb/> the right hon. gentleman; but before two
                                          <lb/> weeks are over, before another week is <lb/> over,
                                          he will sing on the other side of his <lb/> face. He will
                                          find that the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada are in
                                          favour of the maintenance of <lb/> provincial rights; they
                                          are not in favour of <lb/>
                                          <cb/>
     <fw type="num">1752</fw> a paternalized autonomy like that which <lb/> the
                                          hon. gentleman proposes. The people <lb/> of this country
                                          believe in provincial rights <lb/> as they have been
                                          defined and won out by <lb/> the province of Manitoba.
                                          Again I say that <lb/> the hon. gentleman is attempting a
                                                 revolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and the Minister of the
                                          Interior ought <lb/> to be in his place here to-day, since
                                          these <lb/> things are being done in the department <lb/>
                                          over which he presides. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man
                                          asks why I did not notify the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of

                                          have to go to find him? <lb/> It is not for the right hon.
                                          gentleman to say <lb/> to me that I should notify this man
                                          or <lb/> notify that man; let them be here to look <lb/>
                                          after themselves. <lb/>

                                          may not be the keeper of the Minister <lb/> of the
                                          Interior. But there is a rule of <lb/> courtesy recognized
                                          in this House which reÂ« <lb/> quires that when an hon.
                                          member intends <lb/> to bring up a matter pertaining
                                          particularly <lb/> to any department, the minister
                                          presiding <lb/> over that department must be notified.
                                                 Min<lb break="no"/>isters have all sorts of reasons
                                          for not be<lb break="no"/>ing in the House. Deputations
                                          wait upon <lb/> them from time to time, as we all know.
                                          <lb/> We know not why the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior is not in his place to-day; but there is <lb/>
                                          this much about it, it is a small thing and <lb/> a mean
                                          thing for the hon. member for South <lb/> York to make
                                          these remarks without hav<lb break="no"/>ing intimated to
                                          the Minister of the Interior <lb/> that he desired his
                                          presence here. Now I <lb/> desire on this occasion to
                                          enter my protest <lb/> against such interruptions and
                                          interjections, <lb/> on the Orders of the Day being
                                          called, as <lb/> have been made by the hon. member for
                                          <lb/> South York. If there is anything cal<lb break="no"/>culated to stir up strife and trouble in this <lb/>
                                          country it is speeches such as that hon. <lb/> gentleman
                                          has delivered, and articles that <lb/> appear in his
                                          newspaper. If hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers in this House
                                          would treat the question <lb/> which the hon. member for
                                          South York has <lb/> introduced, with calmness, with
                                          candour, <lb/> with that liberality which no doubt they
                                          <lb/> all possess, there would be no danger of <lb/>
                                          producing that storm and that inflamed <lb/> condition of
                                          the public mind which appears <lb/> in the party press and
                                          among the people, <lb/> which we see to-day, and will see
                                                 through<lb break="no"/>out Canada. Now, the hon.
                                          member cites <lb/> the case of Manitoba. I am not going to
                                          <lb/> dwell on that, I merely say that so far <lb/> as I
                                          am concerned, as a member of this <lb/> House supporting
                                          the government, the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of schools in
                                          the province of Manitoba <lb/> is a settled question.
                                          There is no analogy <lb/> whatever between the conditions
                                          of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and the new provinces which
                                          are to <lb/> be admitted in to the confederation; I say
                                          <lb/> this now, although these are matters which <lb/>
                                          will more properly come up when the Bill <lb/> is read the
                                          second time. But when we per<lb break="no"/><pb n="1753" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-02-27_Page_1753.jpg"/>

                                          equitable. <lb/> It was so with the other provinces, and,
                                          I <lb/> presume, will be so with the provinces that <lb/>
                                          are to come in. Mr. Speaker, I only rise <lb/> to protest
                                          against interjections and inter<lb break="no"/>ruptions by
                                          hon. members such as those of <lb/> the hon. member for
                                          South York (Mr. W. F. <lb/> Maclean) who seeks both by his
                                          voice <lb/> in this House and by the newspaper, which,
                                          <lb/> fortunately or unfortunately, he controls, an <lb/>
                                          inflammatory condition of indignation in the <lb/>
                                          country. I think that, when the Bill is before <lb/> us
                                          and when discussion is proper, then the <lb/> hon. member
                                          for South York can enter any <lb/> protest he sees fit.
                                          But, untiI that time, it is <lb/> much better for the

                                          Mr. <lb/> Speaker, I would like to ask the attention <lb/>
                                          of the Postmaster General (Sir William <lb/> Mulock)
                                          through the right hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister (Sir
                                          Wilfrid Laurier) to the condition <lb/> of the mail
                                          service in Prince Edward Island. <lb/> I received on
                                          Saturday a despatch from a <lb/> resident of Tignish
                                          saying that, in answer <lb/> to communications addressed
                                          to the post<lb break="no"/>master of Charlottetown they
                                          have received <lb/> absolutely no information as to the
                                          carriage <lb/> of the mails, and the people throughout the
                                          <lb/> district have now undertaken the service <lb/>
                                          themselves, and the mails have been started <lb/> by
                                          sleighs sent out by private individuals. <lb/> It seems to
                                          me that this is very unsatis<lb break="no"/>factory, and,
                                          I should think, an illegal <lb/> method of handling the
                                          public mails of this <lb/> country. I will ask the right
                                          hon. First <lb/> Minister to bring this subject to the
                                                 atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Postmaster General
                                          and have <lb/> some inquiry made into it. And. if the

                                          <lb/> be brought through by the trains a service <lb/>
                                          should be established by means of sleighs <lb/> under

                                          Island (Mr. Lefurgey). I beg to <lb/> inform the House and

                                          <lb/> been raised. I had communications to-day <lb/>
                                          stating that the trains are now moving in <lb/> and out of
                                          Halifax, and also between <lb/> Sydney and Truroâ€”so that
                                          the road is com<lb break="no"/>pletely free. The Dominion
                                          Atlantic line <lb/> which is the line running between
                                          Halifax <lb/> and Yarmouth, had been closed for a week
                                          <lb/> or ten days. Even the highways are entirely <lb/>
                                          impassable. With the assistance of the In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial and the using of the appliances of <lb/>
                                          that road, the Dominion Atlantic has been <lb/> opened up,
                                          and trains are now running over <lb/> it. The blockade, of
                                          course has been a very <lb/> great drawback to the

                                          Regretful for the <lb/> past, I shall endeavour to make

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">1756</fw>
   
            <p>It has been pointed out by very import~ 
     <lb/>
     ant men in the United States and by the 
     <lb/>
     great newspapers of the United States that 
     <lb/>
     an effort was being made in New York by 
     <lb/>
     great capitalists represented by Harriman 
     <lb/>
     Gould and the great bond house represented 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. Schiff, of New York, to control this 
     <lb/>
     company and that they were willing to give 
     <lb/>
     $5,000,000 of ready money for the controlling 
     <lb/>
     interest in the shares of the Equitable Life. 
     <lb/>
     This has proved to be a matter of supreme 
     <lb/>
     interest to the people of the United States, 
     <lb/>
     that a few men with a very small capital 
     <lb/>
     could control the immense reserve fund for 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the policy holders. It is pro<lb break="no"/>posed there nowâ€”and we will have to do 
     <lb/>
     the same thing, we will have to change our 
     <lb/>
     insurance lawsâ€”to enact that the policy 
     <lb/>
     holders shall have a great deal to say in the 
     <lb/>
     disposition of these immense trust funds, 
     <lb/>
     and I take this opportunity of calling the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the minister to it. I trust that, it 
     <lb/>
     not this session at a very early date, we will 
     <lb/>
     be able to cope with this great question, be 
     <lb/>
     cause if there is one thing of importance in 
     <lb/>
     connection with an insurance company it is 
     <lb/>
     that the trust moneys which are there for 
     <lb/>
     the security of the policy holders ought to 
     <lb/>
     have the best possible administration. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think the best administration of these 
     <lb/>
     funds can be secured when it is possible for 
     <lb/>
     their management to fall into the hands of 
     <lb/>
     two or three men who by controlling the 
     <lb/>
     shares of the proprietary company are free 
     <lb/>
     to do what they like with great funds of this 
     <lb/>
     kind. It is openly charged by the leading 
     <lb/>
     newspapers in the United States to-day that 
     <lb/>
     Harriman and Gould are anxious to get con<lb break="no"/>trol of the Equitable Insurance Company in 
     <lb/>
     order that they may play ducks and drakes 
     <lb/>
     with the $500,000,000 of trust money which 
     <lb/>
     is the absolute property of the policy holders, 
     <lb/>
     in order that they may use it for their great 
     <lb/>
     railway propositions, and we are in danger 
     <lb/>
     of reaching the same condition in this coun<lb break="no"/>try. I trust that later on some proper provi<lb break="no"/>sion will be introduced into our General In<lb break="no"/>surance Act for the protection of the policy 
     <lb/>
     holders.

     <lb/>
     once dissent from that interpretation. It 
     <lb/>
     cannot be admitted that the government will 
     <lb/>
     simply till the part of a mere recording 
     <lb/>
     clerk for the Board of Trade. When re<lb break="no"/>commendations are made to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment by the Board of Trade, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is bound to consider the fitness of the 
     <lb/>
     persons proposed, but naturally would ac<lb break="no"/>cept those recommendations unless there 
     <lb/>
     was cause to the contrary. At all events, 
     <lb/>
     that is the interpretation we have given to 
     <lb/>
     the statute, and I think that interpretation 
     <lb/>
     will be accepted by parliament. In this 
     <lb/>
     case the recommendations made by Toronto 
     <lb/>
     were accepted without dissent. So were 
     <lb/>
     the recommendations made by Winnipeg. 
     <lb/>
     But some dissent was expressed to the re<lb break="no"/>commendations made by the Montreal Board 
     <lb/>
     of Trade. I do not mean that the fact that 
     <lb/>
     Messrs. Carrnthers and Metcalfe were 
     <lb/>
     passed over would indicate anything against 
     <lb/>
     those gentlemen. I do not think it would 
     <lb/>
     be fair to imply or accept anything of that 
     <lb/>
     kind. But the Minister of Trade and Com<lb break="no"/>merce informs me that these gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     have been passed over for good and suffi<lb break="no"/>cient reasons. which will appear upon the

                                          the prayer of the province of Manitoba, <lb/> because the

                                          stated <lb/> there was a portion of territory north of
                                          <lb/> Lake \Vinnipegosis and Lake Manitoba as <lb/> to
                                          which the legislature had expressed no <lb/> objection to
                                          granting it to Manitoba. But <lb/> we have reserved this,
                                          it is not included in <lb/> the boundaries of the new

                                          the west, which are still territories and not <lb/>
                                          provinces. Manitoba has been looking for<lb break="no"/>ward all along to acquiring them, and I <lb/> believe
                                          the Minister of the Interior has <lb/> made statements to
                                          that effect, that some <lb/> day Manitoba might look

                                          <lb/> latter part of his motion means. Of course, <lb/>
                                          the government has no objection to pro<lb break="no"/>ducing whatever papers can be produced. <lb/> but the
                                          latter part of his motion cannot be <lb/> complied with. I
                                          might suggest to the hon. <lb/> gentleman that he call at
                                          the Department <lb/> and indicate what papers he desires
                                          to <lb/> obtain. The Department will furnish him <lb/>
                                          with a list of those that can be produced. <lb/> Let the
                                          motion stand in the meantime. <lb/>

                                          <lb/> in committee, the question was on an <lb/> amendment
                                          proposed by the hon. member <lb/> for St. John and

                                          should be inserted in subsection A <lb/> of subsection 1
                                          of the Act. That motion <lb/> was not disposed of at the
                                          time the com<lb break="no"/>mittee rose and asked leave to
