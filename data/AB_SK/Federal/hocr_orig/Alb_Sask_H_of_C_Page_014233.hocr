<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> it some persons in the country are
inclined <br />
to think that there must have been a rea- <br />
son for such treatment of the duly accre- <br />
dited representatives of the Northwest in <br />
connection with this important matter. The <br />
Minister of Finance is the gentleman who <br />
on the part of the government would be <br />
held responsible for the ﬁnancial terms <br />
which however lightly they may be spoken <br />
of in this House and however slightly they <br />
may be discussed by members who may not <br />
feel competent to discuss such an involved <br />
and intricate question, are of immense im- <br />
portance to this country in view of the fact <br />
that some millions of dollars a year are <br />
to be paid out to each of these provinces. <br />
Yet, it cannot be denied that the one min- <br />
ister in the government who should have <br />
been consulted on the ﬁnancial terms was <br />
not even in the city of Ottawa when the <br />
Bill was brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down,</span> for it
was brought <br />
down two days I think before the date on <br />
which it was known the Minister of Finance <br />
‘would arrive here. The Minister of Jus- <br />
tice was the member of the government <br />
who above all others was most intimately <br />
acquainted with all the questions involved <br />
in this measure, and yet it cannot be denied, <br />
for he himself has admitted it, that al- <br />
though he discussed different other ques- <br />
tions with the government, although he had <br />
given long and anxious consideration to <br />
the education question, this. the most im- <br />
portant of all the questions had never been <br />
mentioned between him and his leader up <br />
to the time the Bill was laid before the <br />
House; and the Bill was hurriedly brought <br />
down within a couple of days before the <br />
hon. gentleman’s expected return. Surely we <br />
cannot be surprised if some people should <br />
think that this is a suspicious circumstance. <br />
We ﬁnd, from the statements made to the <br />
House, that this important matter was de- <br />
ferred to a subcommittee of the government. <br />
I have not a word to say against the mem- <br />
bers of that sub-committee, but I would <br />
venture to suggest that perhaps those whom <br />
I may describe as the minority must not <br />
be surprised if those who happen to be in <br />
the majority think it rather strange, that <br />
when Mr. Haultain could not be consulted <br />
on the education clause, and when the ex- <br />
Minister of the Interior and the Minister <br />
of Finance could not be consulted, that a <br />
commitee composed of the Premier, Mr. <br />
Fitzpatrick, the Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
Justice; Mr. <br />
Scott, the Secretary of State, and Sir Wil- <br />
liam Mulock were the four to Whom was <br />
referred this important question. Surely <br />
there is something in'that to cause the peo- <br />
ple of this country to wonder if everything <br />
is as simple and plain as has been repre- <br />
sented by hon. gentlemen opposite. We ﬁnd <br />
on the return of the Minister of the In- <br />
terior, that he promptly resigns and hav- <br />
ing resigned he was heralded through the <br />
country as a man who had made sacriﬁces <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span>
we have had the Minister of the <br />
Interior before the Canadian House of Com- <br />
mons. I stand in the judgment of all those <br />
who heard him this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evening, if</span> a
more pit- <br />
iable attempt to explain what could not be <br />
explained was ever presented to any intel- <br />
ligent body. I am sorry the hon. gentle- <br />
man is not here to—night. I was at a loss <br />
while he was speaking to know, whether <br />
one should pity him or pity his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-colleagues</span>
<br />
the more. Just think of the position he <br />
was in. The Minister of Finance says the <br />
only difference between the parties is that <br />
one half hour of religious education; the <br />
Minister of Justice says he did not intend <br />
to go one inch beyond the present condi- <br />
tions, but the clauses are drawn in such a <br />
tangled net that a man of the intelligence <br />
of the Minister of the Interior did not know <br />
what they meant, and he believed they were <br />
something so terrible that he had to resign <br />
from the government. There is an end to <br />
everything in this world, and you would <br />
have thought that about that time there <br />
was an end to the want of conﬁdence the <br />
ministers exhibited towards one another. <br />
You would think that gentlemen of the <br />
intelligence of the Minister of Justice, the <br />
Minister of the Interior and the Minister of <br />
Finance when they met together and found <br />
they were in absolute accord as to what <br />
they wanted; you would have thought it <br />
would not have been very dificult for them <br />
to have said: There is a slight misunder- <br />
standing, we will make it clear in a few <br />
words; and then and there the Minister of <br />
the Interior would have been contented with <br />
the clauses and would not have resigned. <br />
Evidently there was no such discussion. or <br />
the discussion that was held was not what <br />
we have been told. Evidently we have <br />
not been told all the truth, or else there <br />
was more all round stupidity displayed <br />
than ever before was displayed in this or <br />
any other country by three cabinet min- <br />
isters. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Then, when the Minister of the Interior
had <br />
resigned, and the country had sounded his <br />
praises from one end to the other, we had <br />
this incident. The newspapers sometimes <br />
foresee What is to happen, and among them <br />
the Montreal ‘Witness’ of to-day, a paper <br />
published before the explanation of this <br />
afternoon, writes : <br />
