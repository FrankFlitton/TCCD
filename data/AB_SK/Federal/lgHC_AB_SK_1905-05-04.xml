     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     some few days ago my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Leeds (Mr. Taylor) asked me a question 
     <lb/>
     with reference to a rumour to the effect that 
     <lb/>
     all the shipping space available in the har<lb break="no"/>bour of Montreal for the shipping of cattle 
     <lb/>
     had been obtained by the Armours, of Chi<lb break="no"/>cago. The inquiry I made leads me to the 
     <lb/>
     conclusion that there is no foundationfor 
     <lb/>
     the rumour. I have received information 
     <lb/>
     to this effect, dated 28th of April. Regard<lb break="no"/>ing the cattle situation, there is no space let 
     <lb/>
     to American shippers, either on the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Pacific Railway line, the Allan line. 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion line, the Donaldson line or 
     <lb/>
     the Manchester line. For the month of 
     <lb/>
     May there is available at the present time 
     <lb/>
     9.000 spaces, and probably 100,000 for the 
     <lb/>
     season. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TAYL1">Mr. TAYLOR</persName>. I may say in reply to the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister that he deals altogether with 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
     space.

     <lb/>
     reading was put. But, if as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     fact, the form in which the question was 
     <lb/>
     decided was that the main motion was 
     <lb/>
     agreed to on the same division reversed, it 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately places me in the position of 
     <lb/>
     apparently speaking one way and voting 
     <lb/>
     the other, which was not my intention nor 
     <lb/>
     did I do so in fact. It may be that, some 
     <lb/>
     time before I get through with my political 
     <lb/>
     life, I will be guilty of doing that. If I have 
     <lb/>
     apparently done so at this time, it was in<lb break="no"/>advertently. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. gentleman suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded admirably in doing it this time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. A. B. INGRAM</persName>. In the case of the 
     <lb/>
     vote taken last night, when the main motion 
     <lb/>
     was put to the House, according to the ' Han<lb break="no"/>sard' to-day it says, 'Carried,' without say<lb break="no"/>ing whether it was carried unanimously. It 
     <lb/>
     leaves it to be understood that it was carried 
     <lb/>
     unanimously. Every one knows that the 
     <lb/>
     division took place on the amendment, and 
     <lb/>
     the main motion was carried on the same 
     <lb/>
     division reversed exactly. Now the Votes 
     <lb/>
     and Proceedings show the names of the first 
     <lb/>
     division, and according to the practice 
     <lb/>
     usually adopted in this House the names 
     <lb/>
     should have been recorded on the second 
     <lb/>
     division, because every hon. gentleman in 
     <lb/>
     this House should be placed on record ex<lb break="no"/>actly as he has voted. It is a well known 
     <lb/>
     fact that according to the custom of this 
     <lb/>
     House the hon. member for South Perth 
     <lb/>
     voted for the Bill, as every hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     did who voted against the amendment. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore I say that the Votes and Proceed<lb break="no"/>ings ought to be amended so as to show the 
     <lb/>
     names twice instead of only once, as they 
     <lb/>
     are now shown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. As I remem<lb break="no"/>ber, the suggestion was made to declare the 
     <lb/>
     motion carried on division, and then I think 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the opposition said, 'Carried 
     <lb/>
     on division reversed if there is no objection,' 
     <lb/>
     and no objection was made. But with re<lb break="no"/>gard to my hon. friend from South Perth 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. McIntyre). it is well known that he had 
     <lb/>
     stated that he intended to vote against the 
     <lb/>
     Bill, and his position is quite correct and 
     <lb/>
     well understood. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I always understood it 
     <lb/>
     was the right of any member of this House 
     <lb/>
     to have a vote if four other gentlemen stand 
     <lb/>
     up with him, then a division must take place. 
     <lb/>
     It is assumed that when no. person stands 
     <lb/>
     up to vote no one desires a division, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore the question goes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
                  
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I would think that 
     <lb/>
     the case is even stronger than my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has 
     <lb/>
     put it. As a matter of fact, the method 
     <lb/>
     which was adopted last night is often adopt<lb break="no"/>ed purely for convenience. We have adopt<lb break="no"/>ed it in this House on many occasions, par<lb break="no"/>ticularly in the numerous divisions which 
     <lb/>
     took place in connection with the govern<lb break="no"/>ment Bill relating to the Transcontinental 
     <lb/>
     Railway. It was declared 'Carried by di<lb break="no"/>vision reversed' or 'Carried on the same 
     <lb/>
     division.' However, the system has been 
     <lb/>
     adopted purely for convenience. As last 
     <lb/>
     night we were here until about a quarter to 
     <lb/>
     two o'clock in the morning, I suggested that 
     <lb/>
     the main motion should be carried   on the 
     <lb/>
     same division reversed, purely as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of convenience, not having in mind my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from South Perth, and that was done. 
     <lb/>
     It did not need five gentlemen to rise and 
     <lb/>
     call for the yeas and nays, all that was 
     <lb/>
     necessary for my hon. friend from South 
     <lb/>
     Perth to have done was to stand up and call 
     <lb/>
     for the yeas and nays, because the division 
     <lb/>
     had already been granted by the Speaker. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore it was a matter for himself to 
     <lb/>
     determine whether we should have another 
     <lb/>
     division or not. There may be some excuse 
     <lb/>
     for him as a new member, but he could, 
     <lb/>
     simply by raising his voice, have had a vote 
     <lb/>
     taken in the way in which he says now he 
     <lb/>
     would like to have had it taken. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I think my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the leader of the opposition is 
     <lb/>
     hardly correct. The hon. member for South 
     <lb/>
     Perth could not have exacted the yeas and 
     <lb/>
     nays, because he was alone, though he could 
     <lb/>
     have objected to the motion being declared 
     <lb/>
     carried on the same division reversed, and 
     <lb/>
     he could have insisted on having it carried 
     <lb/>
     by division. But at all events, I think the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman has made his position clear, 
     <lb/>
     and we all understand it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. What I thought was 
     <lb/>
     that when a division had once been assented 
     <lb/>
     to by the Speaker any hon. member could 
     <lb/>
     call for the yeas and nays on that division. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. What I would like to know 
     <lb/>
     particularly is if the Votes and Proceedings 
     <lb/>
     of yesterday can be amended in order that 
     <lb/>
     the names of hon. gentlemen may be record<lb break="no"/>ed as having voted on two different occa<lb break="no"/>sions, because it is a subject that will be 
     <lb/>
     referred to very frequently in the future, it 
     <lb/>
     was one of the most important votes ever 
     <lb/>
     cast in this House, and every member of this 
     <lb/>
     House should be placed on record so that 
     <lb/>
     there will be no dispute as to how he voted? 
     <lb/>
     I think the Votes and Proceedings need to 
     <lb/>
     be amended. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I doubt if we 
     <lb/>
     can do that now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. I do not see how the 
     <lb/>
     Votes and Proceedings, which are now cor<lb break="no"/>rect as a matter of record, can be amended. 
     <lb/>
       

            <pb n="5431" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5431.jpg"/>

     They state exactly what occurred, and any 
     <lb/>
     one reading them can ascertain exactly how 
     <lb/>
     the division came about. As a matter of 
     <lb/>
     record, the Votes and Proceedings are 
     <lb/>
     correct.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Do I understand you to 
     <lb/>
     say that it would not be correct to have the 
     <lb/>
     names appear twice on the Votes and Pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. Yes.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. The record is correct as 
     <lb/>
     far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. 
     <lb/>
     because it only shows the names in one divi<lb break="no"/>sion, whereas there were two divisions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCIN1">Mr. MCINTYRE</persName>. I have no doubt, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker is entirely correct in what he says ; 
     <lb/>
     I have made inquiry and find it is so. I 
     <lb/>
     only regret that I did not hear the motion 
     <lb/>
     distinctly put, and being somewhat ignorant 
     <lb/>
     of the proceedings with regard to divisions— 
     <lb/>
     we have had so few of them this session—— 
     <lb/>
     I was not aware that I had such privileges 
     <lb/>
     as the leader of the opposition says I had. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I may be permitted 
     <lb/>
     to make a suggestion to his honour the 
     <lb/>
     Speaker. The question came up once before 
     <lb/>
     on, I think, a precisely similar matter, and 
     <lb/>
     the decision was—I am speaking from 
     <lb/>
     memory—that as the method adopted in the 
     <lb/>
     House was one purely of convenience, a 
     <lb/>
     record of the Votes and Proceedings should 
     <lb/>
     be made precisely in the same way as if the 
     <lb/>
     division had taken place. It was only a 
     <lb/>
     method of saving the time of hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     in this House. But when it comes to re<lb break="no"/>cording the names, they should appear as if 
     <lb/>
     the division had taken place ; that is to say, 
     <lb/>
     that you should have a record as if the 
     <lb/>
     House had actually voted, because every one 
     <lb/>
     in the House is supposed to consent to the 
     <lb/>
     course adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. 'I am not quite dis<lb break="no"/>posed to agree with the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position. If you were to record the 
     <lb/>
     names, you would place the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for South Perth in a false position. Prob<lb break="no"/>ably the best way we can do is to let the 
     <lb/>
     matter go as it stands, because if the names 
     <lb/>
     were again recorded and his name was re 
     <lb/>
     corded as voting for the Bill when in reality 
     <lb/>
     he wanted to vote against it, it would only 
     <lb/>
     make the matter more difficult. I think that 
     <lb/>
     as a matter of record the other form would 
     <lb/>
     be more convenient. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. What about the other 
     <lb/>
     ninety-eight members in this House ? Have 
     <lb/>
     they no rights at all ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. They have not ex<lb break="no"/>pressed any dissent.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I suppose that if any 
     <lb/>
     member of this House desires another vote 
     <lb/>
     he has to show that desire by standing up 
     <lb/>
     and asking for a division, and when he does 
     <lb/>
             
           
            <cb/>
            
     not do that, and no other member has done 
     <lb/>
     it, we assume that he is satisfied. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TISD1">Hon. DAVID TISDALE</persName>. It seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that if we are to declare this record correct, 
     <lb/>
     we must hereafter always have the two di<lb break="no"/>visions, because I am quite certain that the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on this side of the House would 
     <lb/>
     have insisted on another vote if they thought 
     <lb/>
     they were not to be recorded again. Of 
     <lb/>
     course the Speaker must decide that. If the 
     <lb/>
     practice is that we must have a new divi<lb break="no"/>sion under these circumstances in order to 
     <lb/>
     get a record of the names, then we must 
     <lb/>
     always put the House to that trouble. I had 
     <lb/>
     always understood, though I have not 
     <lb/>
     bothered my head much about these rules, 
     <lb/>
     that when it was a division such as was 
     <lb/>
     agreed to last night, the names were re<lb break="no"/>corded the second time, and that when we 
     <lb/>
     consent to the division in that way the 
     <lb/>
     names are always to be recorded, because 
     <lb/>
     the object of the division is to have a record 
     <lb/>
     of the names. But if that is not the case, 
     <lb/>
     then my hon. friend from East Elgin (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ingram) is right, and the minutes ought to 
     <lb/>
     be amended, if we have power to amend 
     <lb/>
     them. I do not know myself what proceed<lb break="no"/>ing we ought to take. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HAGG1">Mr. HAGGART</persName>. Mr. Speaker, you surely 
     <lb/>
     ought to be informed as to what the prac<lb break="no"/>tice of the House has been. This has 
     <lb/>
     occurred a hundred times in the House and 
     <lb/>
     in my opinion such votes have always 
     <lb/>
     been recorded as if the vote had been given 
     <lb/>
     at the time. You can very well find out 
     <lb/>
     what the practice has been and if the prac<lb break="no"/>tice has been as I state then it is your 
     <lb/>
     duty to see that the Minutes of the House 
     <lb/>
     are revised and printed in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the practice. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. I desire to inform the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member (Mr. Haggart) that I have 
     <lb/>
     asked the clerk what the practice has been 
     <lb/>
     and he states that the practice has been to 
     <lb/>
     record the vote as it has been recorded and 
     <lb/>
     not as the hon. gentleman suggests. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILS2">Mr. U. WILSON</persName>. I would have asked 
     <lb/>
     for a division last night on the main motion 
     <lb/>
     had I not understood that these names 
     <lb/>
     would be recorded again, only reversed, 
     <lb/>
     because I want it distinctly understood that 
     <lb/>
     I am opposed to the Bill from beginning 
     <lb/>
     to end.

            </p>
   
            <p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILS2">Mr. U. WILSON</persName>  And I want the peo<lb break="no"/>ple to understand it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I think it 
     <lb/>
     is pretty evident to the House that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
     <lb/>
     proposes to dispose of this matter alto<lb break="no"/>gether too lightly. It is an important mat<lb break="no"/>ter and an important question of prac<lb break="no"/>tice. Although I have not been a great 
     <lb/>
     many years in this House, I feel that 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="5433" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5433.jpg"/>

     <lb/>
           
   
     on this point I do understand the practice. 
     <lb/>
     I wish to protest very distinctly against 
     <lb/>
     the proposition suggested by the hon. the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance. I believe we are 
     <lb/>
     entitled, after what occurred last night, and 
     <lb/>
     it was the understanding of the House 
     <lb/>
     generally at that time, that the votes of 
     <lb/>
     members should be recorded as reversed 
     <lb/>
     from the former division. It is the right 
     <lb/>
     of every hon. member to have his vote so 
     <lb/>
     recorded. It would be unfair and a danger<lb break="no"/>ous practice to depart from that position 
     <lb/>
     to-day. I know it to be perfectly clear, 
     <lb/>
     so far as the last four or five years are 
     <lb/>
     concerned, that upon an occasion of this 
     <lb/>
     kind the practice has been such as is asked 
     <lb/>
     for by my hon. friend from Elgin (Mr. In<lb break="no"/>gram). The hon. Minister of Finance says, 
     <lb/>
     forsooth, that because of the inconvenience 
     <lb/>
     it might occasion to the minority of one, 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for South Perth (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     McIntyre), to have the vote recorded in 
     <lb/>
     that way we should depart from what has 
     <lb/>
     been the practice of parliament. The prac<lb break="no"/>tice of parliament must be well under<lb break="no"/>stood by the older members of this House. 
     <lb/>
     I think it is well understood on this point 
     <lb/>
     by almost every member of this House, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it is the right of the House 
     <lb/>
     to have the vote recorded in the way my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from_Elgin has proposed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I only speak again, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, with your permission. I am 
     <lb/>
     afraid the hon. member for South Simcoe 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Lennox) has entirely misunderstood 
     <lb/>
     my point. I rather agree as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     intelligence and convenience with the sug<lb break="no"/>gestion made by hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     as to recording the names the second time. 
     <lb/>
     I think it would be the better way, whether 
     <lb/>
     that changes the practice of the House or 
     <lb/>
     not. But when my hon. friend declares 
     <lb/>
     that we must have the practice of the 
     <lb/>
     House and not what the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance suggests, he is wrong and I am right 
     <lb/>
     because Mr. Speaker has told us this is 
     <lb/>
     the practice of the House. The particular 
     <lb/>
     point that I was drawing attention to 
     <lb/>
     was that if we recorded the names in the 
     <lb/>
     way suggested you would place my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from South Perth (Mr. McIntyre) 
     <lb/>
     in a position which would be unfair. That 
     <lb/>
     was the only point of my observation.

     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, a word in reply to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Minister of Finance (Mr. Field<lb break="no"/>ing), I wish to make it very distinct that, 
     <lb/>
     with all deference to what Mr. Speaker 
     <lb/>
     may have suggested, having regard to the 
     <lb/>
     practice which has been followed for the 
     <lb/>
     last five years, what was suggested by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Elgin has been the 
     <lb/>
     practice in matters of this kind.

     <lb/>
     been remarked, this is rather an important 
     <lb/>
     matter, and no doubt all of us on both sides 
     <lb/>
     of the House are desirous that our votes 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     should be correctly recorded. I draw atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the 'Votes and Proceedings' of 
     <lb/>
     yesterday and also to the 'Hansard.' In 
     <lb/>
     the ' Votes and Proceedings ' we find that :

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"><p>

            <p>
     That certainly expresses the intention 
     <lb/>
     clearly and without equivocation, but when 
     <lb/>
     I turn to 'Hansard'—and I am not re<lb break="no"/>flecting upon 'Hansard' at all, because, 
     <lb/>
     it is not recording words spoken by an 
     <lb/>

     I did not vote against the Bill I voted 
     <lb/>
     for it and I think, Mr. Speaker, that you 
     <lb/>
     should direct, that, in the Revised 'Han<lb break="no"/>sard' the wording should be changed so 
     <lb/>
     that it will convey the intention, at least

     of the House.

     in the 'Hansard ' report. I did not observe 
     <lb/>
     that before, but obviously it conveys an 
     <lb/>
     entirely wrong impression, and it is the 
     <lb/>
     document which is more likely to be used 
     <lb/>
     in connection with this vote than the formal

     the suggestion that 'Hansard' ought to

     be revised and can be revised, and it will

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>; Resolution 
     <lb/>
     (a) provides, for the support of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment and the legislature, $50,000. That is 
     <lb/>
     based upon the figures of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act. It is the same as Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     Then, in regard to the proposed subsidy of 
     <lb/>
     80 cents per head of the population, I may 
     <lb/>
     say that by the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act it is enacted that Ontario should be 
     <lb/>
     paid 80 cents per head of the population 
     <lb/>
     of 1861, which was then in round numbers 
     <lb/>
     1,400,000 souls, or 1,396,000 souls. It is 
     <lb/>
     distributed equally. Quebec received 80 
     <lb/>
     cents per head of the population upon the 
     <lb/>
     census of 1861, which showed a population 
     <lb/>
     of a little over 1,110,000. Then, all the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces, that is to say, Nova Scotia, 
     <lb/>
     New Brunswick, Manitoba, and so on, 
     <lb/>
     were paid 80 cents per head until they 
     <lb/>
     reached the maximum of 400,000 souls. It 
     <lb/>
     was obviously impossible to accept this 
     <lb/>
     maximum for the provinces of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan and Alberta, because already the two 
     <lb/>
     together have a population which exceeds 
     <lb/>
     the minimum limit of 400,000 souls, so we 
     <lb/>
     have suggested that the gradation should 
     <lb/>
     go on until they have reached in each pro<lb break="no"/>vince a population of 800,000. You have to 
     <lb/>
     fix some arbitrary figure, but it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that the figure that has been arrived at is 
     <lb/>
     as near justice as can be expected.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It seems to be a 
     <lb/>
     very arbitrary arrangement after all. Do 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen know on what it is really 
     <lb/>
     based? If I remember aright in Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia at the time of confederation when 
     <lb/>
     the people were very much opposed to en<lb break="no"/>tering confederation. the cry was that we 
     <lb/>
     were being sold for 80 cents a head.

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L BORDEN</persName>. Yes, for the price 
     <lb/>
     of a sheep skin. How is this 80 cents a

     head arrived at? Why is it that the al<lb break="no"/>lowance now is so much smaller in this

     instance ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Eighty cents a head 
     <lb/>
     was simply an arbitrary rate reached in 
     <lb/>
     order to allow what was thought to be a 
     <lb/>
     reasonable sum on the population to assist 
     <lb/>
     in the maintenance of the local government. 
     <lb/>
     There has never been any particular ques<lb break="no"/>tion about that because it was 80 cents all 
     <lb/>
     around; the real difficulty that has from 
     <lb/>
     time to time arisen with the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments is with respect to the limitation 
     <lb/>
     on population. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. That is what I was 
     <lb/>
     asking about.

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. That is the real diffi<lb break="no"/>culty, and I confess I have never been able 
     <lb/>
     to understand the precise reason why these 
     <lb/>
     limitations were put on the provinces. It 
     <lb/>
     would seem reasonable that if the provinces 
     <lb/>were to receive a proportion of their income 
     <lb/>from the federal treasury, their needs would 
     <lb/>increase with their population, and that 
     <lb/>whatever that population might be in the 
     <lb/>future, they should be paid an allowance 
     <lb/>per capita, although not necessarily the 
     <lb/>same allowance, because one can conceive 
     <lb/>that if the population increased very lar<lb break="no"/>gely a proportionately smaller rate per 
     <lb/>head might serve as well for the purposes 
     <lb/>of government as a larger rate would in 
     <lb/>a thinly populated country. The reason 
     <lb/>for the limit of 400,000 souls in Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>and 800,000 as we are now making it in 
     <lb/>these provinces in order that it may cor<lb break="no"/>respond with the general principle of the 
     <lb/>Act, has never been made very clear, and I 
     <lb/>do not know if any of my hon. friends have 
     <lb/>ever heard a reason given. It is the cause 
     <lb/>at this moment of very considerable dis<lb break="no"/>satisfaction in all the provinces and it has 
     <lb/>been proposed from time to time that that 
     <lb/>limitation should be removed, and that as 
     <lb/>the provinces increased in population the 
     <lb/>amount of their allowance should also in<lb break="no"/>crease. But; inasmuch as in the past there 
     <lb/>has been a fixed limitation in the provinces 
     <lb/>we are making this analogous to it, making 
     <lb/>a liberal allowance for the growth of the 
     <lb/>provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. There have been many 
     <lb/>
     applications from Quebec and the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces for a readjustment of their sub<lb break="no"/>sidies and we know that from the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces in the last few years there have 
     <lb/>
     been representations of this kind. In the 
     <lb/>
     finrst instance, as I understand, they all re<lb break="no"/>ceived 80 cents a head and they were to 
     <lb/>
     receive that up to a limit of population; 
     <lb/>
     that was regarded as a fixed and proper 
     <lb/>
     sum which each should have, In view 
     <lb/>
     of these repeated applications from the dif<lb break="no"/>ferent provinces does the government think 
     <lb/>
     that they are justified in fixing the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces at the same sum now? If the 
     <lb/>
     experience of the past has proven that that 
     <lb/>
     is not enough. would this not be the proper 
     <lb/>
     time for them to consider what is a proper 
     <lb/>
     amount and fix it at that sum for the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces at the present time, rather than 
     <lb/>
     have to go over the whole question when 
     <lb/>
     applications are received from the various 
     <lb/>
     provinces for an increase of their subsidy ? 
     <lb/>
     If you consider applications from Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba, you 
     <lb/>
     would have to consider the case of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories as well, and this may 
     <lb/>
     occur next year. It seems to me that our 
     <lb/>
     experience ought to enable us to determine 
     <lb/>
     very well whether this is the correct sum 
     <lb/>
     or not, and if it is not a large enough sum 
     <lb/>
     we should strike the present rate for the 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. For my part 
     <lb/>
     I would not concur with the view just now 
     <lb/>
     enunciated by the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey (Mr. Sproule). Speaking for myself 
     <lb/>
     personally, I think that the whole system 
     <lb/>
     of giving subsidies to the provinces is one 
     <lb/>
     subject to very serious objection, but we 
     <lb/>
     have adopted it at the time of confederation 
     <lb/>
     and wrong or right we have to abide by it 
     <lb/>
     and live up to it, although it is wrong in 
     <lb/>
     principle. As has been said by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) it is not 
     <lb/>
     a system satisfactory to the provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     agree with the Minister of Finance to this 
     <lb/>
     extent that if you adopt this principle of 
     <lb/>
     going by estimate-it is wrong, but you 
     <lb/>
     have adopted it, you have put it 
     <lb/>
     in your Bill, and the reason for 
     <lb/>
     it was that the Dominion took away from 
     <lb/>
     the provinces their sources of revenue, 
     <lb/>
     customs and excise. If that be the case 
     <lb/>
     there is strong reason to support the view 
     <lb/>
     of the Minister of Finance that there should 
     <lb/>
     be no limitation to population, that there 
     <lb/>
     should be a system of adjustment which 
     <lb/>
     would work automatically, whereby the 
     <lb/>
     subsidy of 80 cents per head would increase 
     <lb/>
     with increasing population. That is a view 
     <lb/>
     of the case which is well worthy of con<lb break="no"/>sideration. The province of Quebec has 
     <lb/>
     complained against the present system it is 
     <lb/>
     true, but the province of Quebec is not 
     <lb/>
     alone in that complaint; all the provinces 
     <lb/>
     have complained, and without at all com<lb break="no"/>mitting the government, speaking for my<lb break="no"/>self, I think it is one of the questions which 
     <lb/>
     will have to be taken up by the federal 
     <lb/>
     government in conjunction with the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces at no distant date. but I do not 
     <lb/>
     think at this present time, as we are legis<lb break="no"/>lating within the corners of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, that it would be ad<lb break="no"/>visable to depart in favour of these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces from the principle which has been 
     <lb/>
     applied to the other provinces. There is 
     <lb/>
     in the other provinces a limit of population 
     <lb/>
     beyond which their subsidy does not in<lb break="no"/>crease and so long as this is the case for 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces, I think there ought also 
     <lb/>
     to be a similar limit imposed upon the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces which we are about to create. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I am not objecting to 
     <lb/>
     the limit of population because that seems 
     <lb/>
     to be on the same principle throughout, but 
     <lb/>
     I want to draw attention to what the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member himself has admitted. What is the 
     <lb/>
     cause of these repeated applications from 
     <lb/>
     the provinces? They are made because we 
     <lb/>
     took away from the provinces their sources 
     <lb/>
     of revenue. Need I draw attention to the 
     <lb/>
     fact that their sources of revenue were 
     <lb/>
     customs and inland revenue, and what they 
     <lb/>
     could make from their timber. lands and 
     <lb/>
     mines? We did not take from the other 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     provinces their timber, their lands and their 
     <lb/>
     mines, but we have taken these assets from 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces, and whereas we took 
     <lb/>
     away only a portion of the sources of re<lb break="no"/>venue from the other provinces, we are 
     <lb/>
     taking the whole of the sources of revenue 
     <lb/>
     away from these new provinces. and yet, 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding that, we only allow them 
     <lb/>
     the same proportionate rate as we allowed 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces which retained part of 
     <lb/>
     their sources of revenue. It is true that 
     <lb/>
     we give them for the land— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. We are allowing them 
     <lb/>
     for the land besides. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">MR. SPROULE</persName>-it is true we give them<lb/>something in lieu of the lands, but we are<lb/>assuming that they have a certain number<lb/>of acres of land and we are putting an ar<lb break="no"/>bitrary value on that which would be about<lb/>the lowest value you could put on land in<lb/>the Northwest; not the value of lands there<lb/>at the present time. The estimate of the<lb/>land is not at all the amount of land that<lb/>is within their territory nor is the arbitrary 
     <lb/>
     value the value that the lands could be 
     <lb/>
     sold at in that territory to-day, because if 
     <lb/>
     the lands were left in the possession of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces and they could sell them at 
     <lb/>
     the price which they might fairly realize 
     <lb/>
     for them to-day they could secure a very 
     <lb/>
     much larger sum for them. But after a 
     <lb/>
     while, when a portion of the lands are sold, 
     <lb/>
     the crowding of population becomes greater 
     <lb/>
     and the lands increase in value to $10 or 
     <lb/>
     $15 or $20 an acre, and yet there are mil<lb break="no"/>lions of acres of land in their territory un<lb break="no"/>sold, but held by the Dominion government, 
     <lb/>
     what about these people ? They are not 
     <lb/>
     allowed the advantage of the revenue de<lb break="no"/>rived from those lands nor are they receiv<lb break="no"/>ing any part of their enhanced value. That 
     <lb/>
     will be a source of annoyance to them in the 
     <lb/>
     future, and will probably be a reason why 
     <lb/>
     they will come back here and ask a read<lb break="no"/>justment of the subsidies. Therefore I 
     <lb/>
     think we should fix the subsidies on some 
     <lb/>
     principle that will be a finality. I remember 
     <lb/>
     on two different occasions, when this ques<lb break="no"/>tion was being considered in this House, 
     <lb/>
     and additional subsidies were being granted 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces—I think it was in 1884, 
     <lb/>
     when we granted additional subsidies, that 
     <lb/>
     we were told that the arrangement then 
     <lb/>
     made was to be a finality; as the previous 
     <lb/>
     arrangement was understood to be ; and yet 
     <lb/>
     the matter was brought up again afterwards, 
     <lb/>
     and the Hon. Edward Blake said this was a 
     <lb/>
     finality of a finality, and it was never to be 
     <lb/>
     taken up in this House again. And yet we 
     <lb/>
     are likely to take it up again, and the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. the First Minister himself is ad<lb break="no"/>mitting the justice of the claim. Is it not 
     <lb/>
     better to settle the matter on some basis 
     <lb/>
     that will be a finality, and let the provinces 
     <lb/>
     understand that they must adopt some other 
     <lb/>
     means of raising a revenue and keep their 
     <lb/>
     expenditure within that revenue, otherwise 
     <lb/>
     they cannot expect to come back to the

     Dominion government from time to time and 
     <lb/>
     ask to be recouped in the form of an in<lb break="no"/>crease in their subsidy which might repre<lb break="no"/>sent—I do not say it does—extravagance 
     <lb/>
     rather than a wise and economic expenditure 
     <lb/>
     or money. I think we should adopt some 
     <lb/>
     principle with reference to the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that would not be subject to the 
     <lb/>
     same difficulties and drawbacks that have 
     <lb/>
     occurred in regard to the other provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     think experience has proved that the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple we have acted upon is not a good one, 
     <lb/>
     and we should learn from that experience 
     <lb/>
     and shape our policy accordingly.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The lands clause will 
     <lb/>
     come up a little later, when that question 
     <lb/>
     may very well be considered. I mentioned, 
     <lb/>
     in the remarks which I addressed to the 
     <lb/>
     House on the second reading of the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     that I might desire to make some changes 
     <lb/>
     in the financial clauses, not as affecting 
     <lb/>
     their amounts, but as to their form ; and 
     <lb/>
     when we come to the land clauses, I will 
     <lb/>
     have a suggestion to offer which may per<lb break="no"/>haps in part meet my hon. friend's views in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the lands. We are hardly in a 
     <lb/>
     position to-day, however, with this measure 
     <lb/>
     before us, to take up the general question 
     <lb/>
     of a readjustment of provincial subsidies. 
     <lb/>
     That is a very large question, and will re<lb break="no"/>quire very careful consideration. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Is there any proposal 
     <lb/>
     to do that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The provinces have no 
     <lb/>
     question in their own mind that they want 
     <lb/>
     it, but there is no proposal at present with 
     <lb/>
     the government to deal with the matter, 
     <lb/>
     although it is constantly agitated. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Premier has expressed the opin<lb break="no"/>ion that the day is not far distant when 
     <lb/>
     that question will have to be considered, 
     <lb/>
     not merely on behalf of Quebec, but on 
     <lb/>
     behalf of all the provinces ; and if a change 
     <lb/>
     is made, it must be on some principle that 
     <lb/>
     will apply to all. The essence of the pro<lb break="no"/>posal of the provinces was that the limita<lb break="no"/>tions with regard to population should be 
     <lb/>
     removed. In the resolutions which were 
     <lb/>
     adopted by the provincial premiers some 
     <lb/>
     years ago in Quebec, I think they included 
     <lb/>
     a provision that they should receive eighty 
     <lb/>
     cents per head up to a certain population, 
     <lb/>
     but that where a population was thickly 
     <lb/>
     settled and its needs would not be so great 
     <lb/>
     as those of a population sparsely settled, 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy for the additional population 
     <lb/>
     should be sixty cents a head. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. When was that? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I think that was at the 
     <lb/>
     conference in 1887, and it was adopted by 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces. I think their demand is 
     <lb/>
     now practically a revival of the demand of 
     <lb/>
     that conference. The last conference was 
     <lb/>
     about a year or eighteen months ago, when 
     <lb/>
     the provincial premiers of the day, Colonel 
     <lb/>
     Prior of British Columbia, Mr. Roblin of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, Mr. Ross of Ontario, Mr. 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     Parent of Quebec, Mr. Murray of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, Mr. Tweedie of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Mr. Peters of Prince Edward 
     <lb/>
     Island, met here. Although the record 
     <lb/>
     will speak for itself, my impression is 
     <lb/>
     that they simply revived the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     of the Quebec conference, the substance of 
     <lb/>
     which I have stated. To take up that whole 
     <lb/>
     matter and determine it finally is a large 
     <lb/>
     question, and as the Prime Minister said, 
     <lb/>
     some of these days we may have to do it, 
     <lb/>
     but I do not think the House is ready to do 
     <lb/>
     it to-day. In the meantime, it is admitted 
     <lb/>
     that we must proceed with this Bill with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the Northwest provinces, and we 
     <lb/>
     might as well deal with them in the same 
     <lb/>
     way as we have dealt with the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ; and if, one of these days a change 
     <lb/>
     is made, it must be made on some principle 
     <lb/>
     that will apply equally to all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. While I do not agree 
     <lb/>
     generally with the hon. Finance Minister, I 
     <lb/>
     quite agree with him that the principle of 
     <lb/>
     granting subsidies to the provinces is all 
     <lb/>
     wrong. There was no other reason why 
     <lb/>
     eighty cents a head was paid to the differ<lb break="no"/>ent provinces than the fact that the rev<lb break="no"/>enues of the different provinces, which they 
     <lb/>derived from customs and excise had been 
     <lb/>taken away from them; and, in order to 
     <lb/>make good to them the revenues which they 
     <lb/>had lost by coming into confederation, they 
     <lb/>were paid eighty cents per head of their 
     <lb/>population, fixed I may say in a rather ar<lb break="no"/>bitrary manner, because. so far as the sub<lb break="no"/>sidies for Ontario and Quebec are concerned. 
     <lb/>they still remain on the basis of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 1861, while the subsidies to the 
     <lb/>other provinces are not so fixed. I am not 
     <lb/>complaining of that. The Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance has said that a country sparsely set<lb break="no"/>tled requires more per head than a country 
     <lb/>thickly settled. Assuming that the province 
     <lb/>of Quebec doubled its population, I do not ' 
     <lb/>know that it would cost very much more 
     <lb/>to govern it than it'does at the present time, 
     <lb/>because the population might not be in<lb break="no"/>creased by reason of more territory being 
     <lb/>populated, but by reason of the population 
     <lb/>becoming more dense in the ctities, towns 
     <lb/>and villages. However, what I want to draw 
     <lb/>attention to is this, that the principle is 
     <lb/>bad. I do not blame the fathers of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion for the system they adopted in 1867. 
     <lb/>Possibly it was the only way out of the diffi<lb break="no"/>culty that they had to deal with. But we 
     <lb/>are on a different basis to-day. We are 
     <lb/>dealing with a province which has neither 
     <lb/>customs nor excise revenue. Why apply to 
     <lb/>such a province the same principle that was 
     <lb/>applied to the old provinces ? It seems to 
     <lb/>me that an opportunity is oflered now of 
     <lb/>getting rid of a bad principle, something we 
     <lb/>do not approve of, but the only one which 
     <lb/>so far as we can see could be acted upon in 
     <lb/>1867. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

            <p>
     I do not see anything in the argument that 
     <lb/>
     the principle which we think is not the best 
     <lb/>
     should be applied to the new provinces un<lb break="no"/>
            
            <pb n="5441" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5441.jpg"/>

            der entirely different conditions, I think 
     <lb/>there ought to be some other way of get<lb break="no"/>ting out of the difficulty and that a splendid 
     <lb/>opportunity presents itself for adopting an<lb break="no"/>other principle and possibly one that by- 
     <lb break="yes"/>and-by might be applied to the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces when the whole matter is brought 
     <lb/>under review by the government. We pro<lb break="no"/>pose to take away the lands, or rather re<lb break="no"/>tain the lands. I should prefer myself to 
     <lb/>use the expression 'take away the lands,' 
     <lb/>because we are taking the lands which be<lb break="no"/>long to the provinces and giving them a 
     <lb/>consideration in return. When we do this 
     <lb/>can we not, on some broad principle, come 
     <lb/>to an arrangement by which this plan of 
     <lb/>handing over in a bulk sum eighty cents 
     <lb/>a head to these people would be got rid of ?  
     <lb/>I do not say for a moment that we should 
     <lb/>be niggardly in starting out these provinces 
     <lb/>in their new sphere. I think it would never 
     <lb/>do to adopt any plan which would not give 
     <lb/>these people sufficient revenue, but we must 
     <lb/>admit the principle that where one govern<lb break="no"/>ment is collecting the revenue and another 
     <lb/>government is spending it, there is not the 
     <lb/>same inducement to the spending govern<lb break="no"/>ment to act with economy as if they were 
     <lb/>collecting it and directly responsible to the 
     <lb/>people from whom they took it. If we can 
     <lb/>in some way hold those people responsible 
     <lb/>to those who contribute the money, we 
     <lb/>would be making a radical change which 
     <lb/>might be taken advantage of at some future 
     <lb/>day possibly with regard to the other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. At any rate I think we would be 
     <lb/>starting out on a basis that would conduce 
     <lb/>more to economy than the principle we are 
     <lb/>adopting at present. I do not think that in 
     <lb/>the province to which I belong, the province 
     <lb/>of Ontario, it was ever conducive to eco<lb break="no"/>nomy in the administration of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince to have simply one million or one and 
     <lb/>a half million dollars taken out of the 
     <lb/>pockets of the people generally, chiefly 
     <lb/>through customs revenue, handed in a bulk 
     <lb/>sum over to its local government. The local 
     <lb/>government of Ontario are not responsible 
     <lb/>to the people of that province for the taxa-. 
     <lb/>tion by means of which that money was 
     <lb/>raised, and consequently could not be called 
     <lb/>to task, as they should be, for any extrava<lb break="no"/>gance in the expenditure of it. I would 
     <lb/>hope that the right hon. gentleman, who no 
     <lb/>doubt has given great consideration to this 
     <lb/>question, could by some means or other 
     <lb/>devise some other plan which would be in   
     <lb/>advance of that which the fathers of con<lb break="no"/>federation felt compelled to take, and more   
     <lb/>especially as we are now told that the con<lb break="no"/>ditions in those new provinces are quite 
     <lb/>different from those which prevailed in the ' 
     <lb/>older provinces in 1867. I must confess 
     <lb/>however, that although I have thought over , 
     <lb/>the matter a good deal, I am not prepared 
     <lb/>to make any suggestion. Neither should I 
     <lb/>be called upon to make one because I am 
     <lb/>not one of the governing party in the coun<lb break="no"/>try. We are in a minority of eighty-one 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
     and look to the other side to provide a po<lb break="no"/>licy. I would be glad however, to make a 
     <lb/>
     suggestion, and I submit this suggestion to 
     <lb/>
     the right hon. gentleman for what it is 
     <lb/>
     worth. We are starting out these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces under new conditions, and I believe 
     <lb/>
     we can devise some plan under these new 
     <lb/>
     conditions, which would be more accept<lb break="no"/>able and perhaps more profitable in the end 
     <lb/>
     to the people in that new country as it 
     <lb/>
     would throw them upon their own resources 
     <lb/>
     entirely. If they were permitted to know 
     <lb/>
     now just what their revenues will be and 
     <lb/>
     had to work out their own destiny with 
     <lb/>
     what we give them now for all time, and 
     <lb/>
     if they were not in a position to come back 
     <lb/>
     time after time and ask for more, the new 
     <lb/>
     local administrations about to be established 
     <lb/>
     would naturally be more economical in the 
     <lb/>
     administration of their affairs, and that of 
     <lb/>
     course would inure largely to the benefit 
     <lb/>
     of that great country.

     I agree very largely in everything said by

     <lb/>have the responsibility of collecting it. is 
     <lb/>so obvious and true that it is a matter of 
     <lb/>surprise to those who look through the de<lb break="no"/>bates of 1865 and the Act of confederation 
     <lb/>as it is. that the fathers of confederation 
     <lb/>should have consented to depart from a prin<lb break="no"/>ciple so true and obvious. Why then did 
     <lb/>they depart from it? Simply because it 
     <lb/>would have been impossible to get any one 
     <lb/>of the provinces to enter confederation un<lb break="no"/>less it was given a subsidy to meet its own 
     <lb/>expenses. The people of this country are 
     <lb/>afraid of taxation, and especially of direct 
     <lb/>taxation, and it was the spectre of direct 
     <lb/>taxation which forced those who were res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for framing the Act of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to agree to the plan adopted. Some 
     <lb/>forty years have elapsed, and since then I 
     <lb/>  do not think that the people of any of the 
     <lb/>provinces would be disposed to part from 
     <lb/>the principle there laid down, and agree to 
     <lb/>release the federal treasury of the subsidy 
     <lb/>they receive every year. The conditions are 
     <lb/>exactly the same in the new provinces of 
     <lb/>Alberta and Saskatchewan as they were in 
     <lb/>the older provinces. It is true that these 
     <lb/>new provinces have not to surrender their 
     <lb/>excise and customs to-day ; but if they were 
     <lb/>not in confederation, they would be free to 
     <lb/>collect their own excise and customs. There<lb break="no"/>fore when they came into confederation they 
     <lb/>surrendered, as did the provinces of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the 
     <lb/>right to collect excise and customs duties, 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>
            
   
            
     and are consequently, for all practical pur<lb break="no"/>poses, in the same condition as were these 
     <lb/>
     in 1867. Whenever a province enters con<lb break="no"/>federation, that very day it surrenders its 
     <lb/>
     right to collect excise and customs and 
     <lb/>
     places itself in the same condition as that 
     <lb/>
     in which were the older provinces. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose you were to say to-day to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Saskatchewan and Alberta: Will you 
     <lb/>
     agree to come into confederation without 
     <lb/>
     compensation or subsidy at all? They 
     <lb/>
     would reply no. Of that there can be no 
     <lb/>
     doubt, and the gentlemen who represent 
     <lb/>
     these provinces to-day will agree in what 
     <lb/>
     I say. What is to be done under such cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances ? We are not introducing a 
     <lb/>
     new principle but simply applying that 
     <lb/>
     which was accepted in 1867.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID LAURlER. I will not dis<lb break="no"/>cuss that now. But suppose it were a fail<lb break="no"/>ure, where would you apply the remedy ? 
     <lb/>
     Would it not be where the failure had 
     <lb/>
     taken place? That failure has not taken 
     <lb/>
     place in the new provinces, but in the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that exist to-day. If you are to in<lb break="no"/>troduce the principle of reform, you ought 
     <lb/>
     to introduce it, not where there has been 
     <lb/>
     no failure, but in all the provinces gener<lb break="no"/>ally. 1 agree with my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) that it may be that the question 
     <lb/>
     of principle may have to be taken up at 
     <lb/>
     some future day. For my part, I think 
     <lb/>
     we shall have to revise the subsidy ques<lb break="no"/>tion. If I propose the present plan, it is 
     <lb/>
     not because I am satisfied that it is the 
     <lb/>
     best that could be. It is not the ideal. But 
     <lb/>
     we have to conform to the measure the peo<lb break="no"/>ple will accept, no more. But the day 
     <lb/>
     may come, probably at no distant time. 
     <lb/>
     when the whole subject of the provincial 
     <lb/>
     subsidies will have to be taken up in a more 
     <lb/>
     radical way than any in which we can 
     <lb/>
     deal with it to-day. But, as a matter of 
     <lb/>
     fact, it is not possible to take it up 
     <lb/>
     today. We have to legislate within 
     <lb/>
     the  four corners of the constitution, 
     <lb/>
     not only within the good elements, but 
     <lb/>
     within the blemishes also. Even though 
     <lb/>
     there may be a blemish, we must accept it 
     <lb/>
     and carry it out loyally. I have to repeat 
     <lb/>
     what I had occasion to say on introducing 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, that confederation was, above all 
     <lb/>
     things, a compromise. It was almost a 
     <lb/>
     superhuman effort to get the several pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and Ontario to agree to surender 
     <lb/>
     their identity and merge it in a common 
     <lb/>
    whole. And those who wanted that con<lb break="no"/>clusion had to sacrifice a good deal to gain 
     <lb/>it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I may not quite under<lb break="no"/>stand it, but it seems to me that the entry 
     <lb/>
     of the original provinces into confederation 
     <lb/>
     and the entry of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     into confederation are not the same thing 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     at all. Confederation was a union of sov<lb break="no"/>ereign provinces who made a compact. 
     <lb/>
     They existed before confederation, and they 
     <lb/>
     had their sources of revenue, and. before 
     <lb/>
     they gave these up, they exacted something 
     <lb/>
     from the common government, demanding 
     <lb/>
     so much per head of their population. It 
     <lb/>
     was fixed at 80 cents per head. I do not 
     <lb/>
     know why it was fixed at that figure, but 
     <lb/>
     it was the consideration agreed upon. But 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are not, in the 
     <lb/>
     proper sense, provinces coming into con<lb break="no"/>federation. They are Territories, they are 
     <lb/>
     lands we have bought. We, the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, the province who form confeder<lb break="no"/>ation are the buyers, or the owners, if I 
     <lb/>
     may use that word, of these provinces 
     <lb/>
     which were for a long time Territories. 
     <lb/>
     Those Territories are peopled by some who 
     <lb/>
     were formerly inhabitants of the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and also by many immigrants who 
     <lb/>
     have come in from all over the world. We 
     <lb/>
     are deciding to-day to erect them into pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and to give them autonomy. But 
     <lb/>
     we are not in the same position with re<lb break="no"/>gard to them as we were with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the older provinces. So, it has struck me, 
     <lb/>
     as it has struck my hon. friend from Hal<lb break="no"/>ton (Mr. Henderson) that we do not owe 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces 80 cents per head on 
     <lb/>
     their population for the same consideration 
     <lb/>
     that we owed that money to the older pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I would not say that I am op<lb break="no"/>posed to giving it, because I can imagine 
     <lb/>
     that some strong consideration must have 
     <lb/>
     actuated the government in deciding upon 
     <lb/>
     this proposal. But it seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     the argument of the hon. member for Hil<lb break="no"/>ton is a very strong one. As to any change 
     <lb/>
     in the allowances to the provinces generally, 
     <lb/>
     we have heard of that for many years. I 
     <lb/>
     should have thought that my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance would have been 
     <lb/>
     able to give something of the reasons for 
     <lb/>
     the demands made upon the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to increase the allowance, he hav<lb break="no"/>ing taken part in the conference of some 
     <lb/>
     years ago. I think the allowance proposed 
     <lb/>
     was to be $1 per head.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr.

     <lb/>
     many years ago.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. The reason why I 
     <lb/>
    think it was $1 per head was that I recol<lb break="no"/>lect it being stated that $1 at the time of 
     <lb/>the conference was about the same as 80 
     <lb/>cents at the time of confederation. There 
     <lb/>must have been an answer from the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government to the demand made by 
     <lb/>the conference. What was the answer ? I 
     <lb/>think that was in 1888 or 1887.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I do not wish to ex<lb break="no"/>press an opinion now, as I understand the 
     <lb/>
     question may come before the House. But 
     <lb/>
     it seems to me that it is a question to he 
     <lb/>
     handled with a great deal of care. The 
     <lb/>
     fathers of confederation, when they fixed 
     <lb/>
     the powers of the provinces on the present 
     <lb/>
     basis had in mind that the provinces would 
     <lb/>
     impose just what my right hon. friend Sir 
     <lb/>
     Wilfrid Laurier) said a moment ago they 
     <lb/>
     were so much afraid of—direct taxation. 
     <lb/>
     That is why they were not given a great deal 
     <lb/>
     of power. I understand that one man who 
     <lb/>
     was looked upon as a great authority on the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal side at that time, Mr. Holton, ex<lb break="no"/>pressed the opinion that it was the duty of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, and their safeguard, to impose 
     <lb/>
     direct taxation. I imagine why the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment came to the conclusion of granting 
     <lb/>
     the provinces their demand. It would be 
     <lb/>
     only for a few years. But it is the way in 
     <lb/>
     which they carry on their finances, that is 
     <lb/>
     the cause of the difficulty in which the old 
     <lb/>
     provinces are to-day. Of course, that is not 
     <lb/>
     the subject under consideration, and I do not 
     <lb/>
     want to discuss it any further. But I wished 
     <lb/>
     to say that, in my opinion, there is a good 
     <lb/>
     deal in what my hon. friend from Halton 
     <lb/>
     IMr. Henderson) said, that if we gave 80 
     <lb/>
     cents per head of population to the older 
     <lb/>
     provinces it was because we were taking 
     <lb/>
     something from the provinces, but that we 
     <lb/>
     are taking nothing in the same way from 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. There is force in 
     <lb/>
     the remark of the hon. member for Hal<lb break="no"/>ton (Mr. Henderson) and the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) that these 
     <lb/>
     are not sovereign political entities, and 
     <lb/>
     therefore up to the present they have not 
     <lb/>
     had the right to collect customs and ex<lb break="no"/>cise revenues for themselves. But, looked 
     <lb/>
     at from the practical standpoint, as to the 
     <lb/>
     giving to them of revenue derived from 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, I agree with the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, and would not make any distinction 
     <lb/>
     between the position they occupy and the 
     <lb/>
     position of the older provinces. If they 
     <lb/>
     were created into provinces by the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament outside of this confederation, we 
     <lb/>
     should find them collecting excise and cus<lb break="no"/>toms as the older provinces did. So, 
     <lb/>
     whether we give 80 cents per head or not, 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     we must give them something equivalent to 
     <lb/>
     what was given to the other provinces. Be<lb break="no"/>hind that altogether is the very important 
     <lb/>
     point which was raised by the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Halton and referred to by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Beauharnois. the question of 
     <lb/>
     the principle on which to determine the 
     <lb/>
     allowance to the different provinces. And 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister has made the very im<lb break="no"/>portant statement, if I understood him cor<lb break="no"/>rectly, in suggesting that it may be the 
     <lb/>
     duty of the government in the present year 
     <lb/>
     to consider the position of the subsidies to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces, which now constitute the con<lb break="no"/>federation. I should have thought that, if 
     <lb/>
     that is the position of the government, it 
     <lb/>
     would have been extremely desirable to deal 
     <lb/>
     with the question at least concurrently with 
     <lb/>
     the measure now before the House. There 
     <lb/>
     will not be so good an opportunity in the 
     <lb/>
     history of this confederation to deal with 
     <lb/>
     this question as that which now presents it<lb break="no"/>self. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the creation of these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     you have the best possible opportunity of 
     <lb/>
     dealing once and for all with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of what shall be the subsidy to be 
     <lb/>
     allowed by the Dominion to the provinces. 
     <lb/>
     I quite agree with the Prime Minister in 
     <lb/>
     his criticism of what was done at the 
     <lb/>
     time of confederation, though I am dis<lb break="no"/>posed to admit that I do not see exactly 
     <lb/>
     what could have been substituted for that 
     <lb/>
     arbitrary allowance. It seems to be en<lb break="no"/>tirely arbitrary. It is said that it was in 
     <lb/>
     lieu of the customs and excise. Well, 
     <lb/>
     then, surely it was illogical to fix an ar<lb break="no"/>bitrary amount and to fix the limit of 
     <lb/>
     population. I submit that for two reasons. 
     <lb/>
     The province of Nova Scotia is limited to 
     <lb/>
     400,000, and the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick is limited to 400,000. The province 
     <lb/>
     of Nova 'Scotia may reach a population of 
     <lb/>
     800,000, and when it does, the amount which 
     <lb/>
     it will contribute to the customs and ex<lb break="no"/>cise will be very much greater than the 
     <lb/>
     amount which it contributes when it has a 
     <lb/>
     population of only 400,000. The same is 
     <lb/>
     true with regard to the population of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and Ontario, and with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the amounts payable to them. But there 
     <lb/>
     is another reason why this allowance made 
     <lb/>
     to the different provinces is absolutely il<lb break="no"/>logical. Every one who has made the 
     <lb/>
     slightest study of political economy knows 
     <lb/>
     that the producing power of money varies 
     <lb/>
     from time to time. Therefore, 80 cents 
     <lb/>
     per head of the population of the provinces 
     <lb/>
     in 1905, is an absolutely different thing to 
     <lb/>
     what 80 cents per head was in 1867. In 
     <lb/>
     this connection I may say that one of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of confederation is at the present 
     <lb/>
     time making a claim which, perhaps, may 
     <lb/>
     be entitled to some consideration, whether 
     <lb/>
     we agree with it or not; the province of 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia is making a claim at 
     <lb/>
     the present time, as I understand, upon 
     <lb/>
     this government for the reason that it 
     <lb/>
     costs so much more to construct public 
     <lb/>
           
            <pb n="5447" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5447.jpg"/>

     <lb/>
            
   
         
     works there than it does in the eastern 
     <lb/>
     provinces, and also because the cost of liv<lb break="no"/>ing and the rate of wages are much higher 
     <lb/>
     than they are in the east. We should not 
     <lb/>
     be unmindful, in dealing with these two 
     <lb/>
     new provinces, of two considerations, one 
     <lb/>
     of which is that probably it will cost more 
     <lb/>
     there to carry out public works—as it does 
     <lb/>
     now in British Columbia—than it costs in 
     <lb/>
     the eastern provinces; in addition to that, 
     <lb/>
     we have to remember the sparse popula<lb break="no"/>tion and the necessity of spreading out 
     <lb/>
     public works over a large area. These 
     <lb/>
     are considerations which we ought to take 
     <lb/>
     into account. But what I want to come 
     <lb/>
     down to is, after all, the practical ques<lb break="no"/>tion, that is, the entire absence of any prin<lb break="no"/>ciple which, apparently, has been found 
     <lb/>
     to guide the government in fixing the sub<lb break="no"/>sidies for these provinces. Along what 
     <lb/>
     lines have they proceeded, upon what prin<lb break="no"/>ciple have they acted in selecting the fig<lb break="no"/>ures of 800,000 of a population as the limit 
     <lb/>
     upon which they fix the allowance ? There 
     <lb/>
     may- possibly have been considerations 
     <lb/>
     which would have induced them to fix 
     <lb/>
     that at a larger amount, such as the higher 
     <lb/>
     cost of public works and the sparse popu<lb break="no"/>lation spread over a great area. They have 
     <lb/>
     departed from the limit of population fixed 
     <lb/>
     for the maritime provinces, and they have 
     <lb/>
     departed also from the limit of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation fixed for Ontario and Quebec, and 
     <lb/>
     they have adopted a somewhat middle 
     <lb/>
     course. But I cannot see upon what prin<lb break="no"/>ciple they fix that particular limit of 800,<lb break="no"/>000 population for the new provinces. Is 
     <lb/>
     it based on any principle whatever, or is 
     <lb/>
     it simply arbitrary, as was the limit fixed 
     <lb/>
     for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec 
     <lb/>
     and Ontario, in the first instance? How 
     <lb/>
     is it arrived at? Is it simply a guess at 
     <lb/>
     the amount which should be considered pro<lb break="no"/>per, or is it fixed as a sort of half-way 
     <lb/>
     house between the 400,000 for Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and New Brunswick and the 1,400,000 for 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. That is a 
     <lb/>
     fair question. When we came to discuss 
     <lb/>
     this clause we would have been glad to 
     <lb/>
     know what principle the population limit 
     <lb/>
     had been fixed for Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick at 400,000, and for Manitoba at 
     <lb/>
     400,000. The record shows us nothing at 
     <lb/>
     all about that. But looking at the history 
     <lb/>
     of the case, we found that this sum was 
     <lb/>
     given, as has been stated already, to start 
     <lb/>
     the provinces with, to give them some 
     <lb/>
     compensation for what they were losing 
     <lb/>
     in entering confederation. The first thought 
     <lb/>
     evidently of those who framed the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     resolutions was to take the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     population as it was in the census of 1861. 
     <lb/>
     They did that for Quebec and Ontario. But 
     <lb/>
     at that time the population of the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces, Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, was very small, if I remember right 
     <lb/>
     about 100,000 each. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

          
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. 330,000 for Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     and 250,000 for New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Well, the 
     <lb/>
     limit of population was fixed for them at 
     <lb/>
     400,000, beyond which their subsidies could 
     <lb/>
     not be increased. Therefore it did not 
     <lb/>
     seem unreasonable that we should fix a 
     <lb/>
     limit double that amount for these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces, which have so much larger an 
     <lb/>
     area, so much more territory, and which 
     <lb/>
     already start with an estimated population 
     <lb/>
     of 250,000 each. With regard to Manitoba, 
     <lb/>
     the case is absolutely hopeless. Every<lb break="no"/>thing with regard to Manitoba seems to 
     <lb/>
     have been done in a purely arbitrary man<lb break="no"/>ner, without any principle which we can 
     <lb/>
     discover. Therefore the best thing we 
     <lb/>
     could do was to say that we will give these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces subsidies on an estimated 
     <lb/>
     population double that which has been fix<lb break="no"/>ed as the limit for Nova Scotia and New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick. Can the hon. gentleman sug<lb break="no"/>gest anything better than that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. We do not claim 
     <lb/>
     on this side to have given the matter the 
     <lb/>
     same consideration which the government 
     <lb/>
     have given it in framing this Bill. Only 
     <lb/>
     by way of criticism can we endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     arrive at some better conclusion, it any can 
     <lb/>
     be found. But it would seem to me that 
     <lb/>
     the reason which the right hon. gentle 
     <lb/>
     man advanced is not so much one which 
     <lb/>
     would lead us to fix their limit at 800,000 
     <lb/>
     as it is one which would lead us to give them 
     <lb/>
     a larger per capita allowance in the first 
     <lb/>
     instance, when the population is sparse 
     <lb/>
     and the territory very great. I do not 
     <lb/>
     see that you will logically reach the result 
     <lb/>
     claimed by the hon. gentleman, if you fol<lb break="no"/>low the statement of the case which he 
     <lb/>
     has made. In the commonwealth of Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia there is an appropriation for cus<lb break="no"/>toms and excise by the federal legislature, 
     <lb/>
     but if I recollect rightly, the provinces 
     <lb/>
     receive, not an arbitrary sum, but a pro<lb break="no"/>portionate part. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It may be impossible-I am not suggesting 
     <lb/>
     it would be possible—to carry that out here 
     <lb/>
     because goods to a very large amount, enter<lb break="no"/>ed in one province, are eventually consumed 
     <lb/>
     and indirect taxation upon them is possibly 
     <lb/>
     paid, to some extent, at least, in another 
     <lb/>
     province. I do not know that you could get 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of comfort out of that, perhaps, 
     <lb/>
     but still the basis of proportion, would 
     <lb/>
     naturally appeal to one as a somewhat more 
     <lb/>
     logical basis than the arbitrary basis which 
     <lb/>
     was adopted by the fathers of confederation 
     <lb/>
     and which has been followed ever since. The 
     <lb/>
     difficulty, of course, is to suggest what we 
     <lb/>
     would substitute, but that only brings me 
     <lb/>
     back once more to what I pointed out in the 
     <lb/>
     few remarks that I made a moment ago, and 
     <lb/>
     that is the extreme importance of dealing 
     <lb/>
     with the whole question as far as all 
     <lb/>
     the provinces are concerned, if it is really 
     <lb/>
     proposed to deal with that question, at 
     <lb/>
          
            <pb n="5449" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5449.jpg"/>

                   the time we are creating these new prov<lb break="no"/>inces. We would not want in the slightest
                   <lb/>
                   degree to be unjust to the new provinces. I
                   <lb/>
                   am not suggesting that. We want to be 
                   <lb/>
                   generous to them in every possible way.
                   <lb/>
                   They are deserving now only of fair but of
                   <lb/>
                   generous treatment from this parliament. I
                   <lb/>
                   am merely suggesting this for the purpose
                   <lb/>
                   of convenience, because when, parliament
                   <lb/>
                   is creating these new provinces, it would be
                   <lb/>
                   much more convenient, it seems to me, to
                   <lb/>
                   treat the whole subject from the standpoint
                   <lb/>
                   of some better principle, if it can be found,
                   <lb/>
                   than it will be years afterwards, or
                   <lb/>
                   even one or two years afterwards,
                   <lb/>
                   when these provinces may be calling upon
                   <lb/>
                   this government to make good certain claims
                   <lb/>
                   which my hon. friend the ex-Minister of the
                   <lb/>
                   Interior (Mr. Sifton) foresaw in respect to
                   <lb/>
                   the question of lands, for example. I do 
                   <lb/>
                   not know whether the government have 
                   <lb/>
                   taken the question of the revision of sub<lb break="no"/>sidies sufficiently into consideration to give
                   <lb/> 
                   to the House any information as to what
                   <lb/>
                   their proposals are at this moment. I would
                   <lb/>
                   infer not, from what my right hon. friend
                   <lb/>
                   has said, but I can only express my regret
                   <lb/>
                   that the government have not been able to
                   <lb/>
                   overtake that question, if they do propose to
                   <lb/>
                   deal with it, in time to present it to the
                   <lb/>
                   House concurrently with the question we
                   <lb/>
                   are now considering. It may be that it is
                   <lb/>
                   impossible to do so. I know how much
                   <lb/>
                   poitical duties interfere with administrative
                   <lb/>
                   and executive duties on the part of any gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but still I think it is a matter for
                   <lb/>
                   very great regret that the question is not
                   <lb/>
                   dealt with at this time if it is proposed to
                   <lb/>
                   deal with it in the near future.

     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I hope my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Prime Minister has some other 
     <lb/>
     reason than the one he gives, because it 
     <lb/>
     seems that he wants to give the committee 
     <lb/>
     to understand that he came to the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     to double the limit of population of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories because these new 
     <lb/>
     provinces were starting with double the 
     <lb/>
     population that Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick had at the time of confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. More than 
     <lb/>
     double the territory. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I understood my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend to say that we are going to double 
     <lb/>
     the limit of population in these Territories 
     <lb/>
     because they are starting with a great deal 
     <lb/>
     larger population than the maritime pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which were limited to 400,000. He 
     <lb/>
     was reminded immediately by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend the Minister of Finance, that Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia and New Brunswick had together 
     <lb/>
     more population in 1867 than the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have to-day. Therefore, my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend must have another reason than the 
     <lb/>
     one he gave for doubling the limit of popu<lb break="no"/>lation in the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Perhaps I did 
     <lb/>
     not express my idea correctly. The popu<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     lation of these two provinces must eventu<lb break="no"/>ally be much larger. They have each a popu<lb break="no"/>lation of 250,000 now and they are only com<lb break="no"/>mencing to keep house. They have ten times 
     <lb/>
     the territory that the maritime provinces 
     <lb/>
     have, and therefore, as they must have a 
     <lb/>
     much larger population, they require more 
     <lb/>
     revenue. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. That is later on, but 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend will remember that 
     <lb/>
     they have not so many people today as the 
     <lb/>
     maritime provinces had in 1867. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. It must be admitted that 
     <lb/>
     there was no logical reason for adopting the 
     <lb/>
     400,000 limit in the original Act of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation and there is no very logical reason for 
     <lb/>
     adopting the 800,000 in this. It is an esti<lb break="no"/>mate of the probable growth, and we know 
     <lb/>
     that in these Territories the growth is likely 
     <lb/>
     to be much more rapid than in the maritime 
     <lb/>
     provinces, but my own judgment is that 
     <lb/>
     before this arrangement has been in opera<lb break="no"/>tion a few years the whole question will 
     <lb/>
     have to be considered in the light of what has 
     <lb/>
     been said to-day, and then perhaps the sys<lb break="no"/>tem will have to be general in its applica<lb break="no"/>tion. In the meantime, with all the weak<lb break="no"/>ness of the system, what can we do to-day 
     <lb/>
     but conform to the principles laid down in 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act ?

     data regarding the finances of the different

     states, as to what they do in regard to their 
     <lb/>
     financial arrangements and whether, in view 
     <lb/>
     of our experience—because it was an ex<lb break="no"/>periment for us and our experience has not 
     <lb/>
     been perfectly satisfactory—the government 
     <lb/>
     have considered any other plan for supply<lb break="no"/>ing a revenue, and if there is any corre<lb break="no"/>spondence between Mr. Haultain and the

     government of the Northwest Territories and 
     <lb/>
     this government in regard to the subject?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I think I am correct in 
     <lb/>
     stating that in the United States they have 
     <lb/>
     no system in regard to subsidies at all but 
     <lb/>
     that each state has to regulate its own 
     <lb/>
     finances. I admit that there is something to 
     <lb/>
     be said in favour of the provinces doing so 
     <lb/>
     here if we could start afresh. I want 
     <lb/>
     to say a word in defence of the fathers 
     <lb/>
     of confederation. and I am not very 
     <lb/>
     much given to defending the fathers of 
     <lb/>
     confederation in reference to the financial 
     <lb/>
     arrangements that were adopted at the

     time of confederation. If we had been

     dealing with the provinces as we are now 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the provinces of the west we 
     <lb/>
     might have demanded from them such terms 
     <lb/>
    as we pleased. We might have said : Get 
     <lb/>your taxation in any way you please. But. 
     <lb/>that was not the condition in 1867. Each of 
     <lb/>these provinces was an independent body 
     <lb/>when it was asked to come in, and the

     my right hon. friend the First Minister (Sir<lb/>Wilfrid Laurier) has referred to undoubtedly 
     <lb/>
     had a great effect on some public men. They 
     <lb/>
     said : Each of these provinces levies excise 
     <lb/>
     and customs duties, and if you take away 
     <lb/>
     from us our excise and customs duties you 
     <lb/>
     must give us some portion back. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that was an unreasonable thing.

     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Not for the old pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. If we admit that it was 
     <lb/>
     a reasonable thing for the old provinces, 
     <lb/>
    what position are we in today ? Shall we 
     <lb/>say to the new provinces: We gave a 
     <lb/>portion of the excise and customs back to 
     <lb/>the old provinces but we will not give it to 
     <lb/>you ? We collect customs and excise from 
     <lb/>the old provinces and we give them some 
     <lb/>back; we will collect the excise and customs 
     <lb/>from the new provinces and we will in the 
     <lb/>same way give some back. This is the uni<lb break="no"/>form practice to-day. My hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>Sproule) wanted to know if any other plan 
     <lb/>has been suggested. and I am frank enough 
     <lb/>to say, that, notwithstanding that there is 
     <lb/>something to be said in favour of some other 
     <lb/>plan, I have no expectation that you can 
     <lb/>arrange the finances on any other basis. 
     <lb/>There is no province which is willing to give 
     <lb/>up its subsidy. The system is a part of our 
     <lb/>constitution. It is provided for by the 
     <lb/>British North America Act wholly beyond 
     <lb/>change by ourselves and we would be oblig<lb break="no"/>ed to go to the imperial parliament to change 
     <lb/>it. I believe that the provinces would be 
     <lb/>rivalling each other to get their delegates 
     <lb/>on the other side in opposition to the pro<lb break="no"/>posal if we asked for anything of the sort. 
     <lb/>I fully anticipate that if any revision is 
     <lb/>made it will have to be on the lines of the 
     <lb/>present system. We may devise some sys<lb break="no"/>tem, which, while adopting the present 
     <lb/>principle, will work the details out in some 
     <lb/>other way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The hon. gentleman said 
     <lb/>
     that originally, at the time of confederation, 
     <lb/>
     we dealt with provinces that were sovereign<lb break="no"/>ties having the power to levy taxation. Or. 
     <lb/>
     in other words, there were two parties to the 
     <lb/>
     contract. Then the one party might offer, 
     <lb/>
     but the other party might not accept, and it 
     <lb/>
     would be for the other party to make a 
     <lb/>
     counter offer and, between them, try to 
     <lb/>
     reach an agreement; that is to say, one 
     <lb/>
     would accept what the other would be will<lb break="no"/>ing to give; but in this case there is only 
     <lb/>
     one party to the contract. There is only one 
     <lb/>
     party, because the federal parliament is the 
     <lb/>
     owner of the Territories, and they are only 
     <lb/>
     establishing an outlying portion of those 
     <lb/>
     Territories which they may call provinces. 
     <lb/>
     and they are giving these provinces certain 
     <lb/>
     powers. They have scarcely consulted the 
     <lb/>
     representatives of those Territories in re<lb break="no"/>gard to other features of these Bills, al<lb break="no"/>though those gentlemen have been hanging 
     <lb/>
     around this parliament for three months. 
     <lb/>
     They did not even deign to take them into 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     consultation in regard to many other fea<lb break="no"/>tures, and why should they do so with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the financial feature? I asked if 
     <lb/>
     any correspondence has been received that 
     <lb/>
     would indicate that they had foreseen some 
     <lb/>
     trouble in regard to this feature, or that 
     <lb/>
     they were satisfied with the government's 
     <lb/>
     proposals. I understood the minister to 
     <lb/>
     say that there was no conference. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>.  There was no corre<lb break="no"/>spondence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Well, correspondence. I 
     <lb/>
     take it that if there were conferences, there 
     <lb/>
     would be some correspondence leading up to 
     <lb/>
     them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. There is cor<lb break="no"/>respondence. including the Haultain Bill. 
     <lb/>
     which has been brought down. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. if there is correspondence 
     <lb/>
     with regard to it, they must have set out 
     <lb/>
     the various features of what would be satis<lb break="no"/>factory to them; the financial question is 
     <lb/>
     one of the important ones, and therefore I 
     <lb/>
     assume that if there is any correspondence 
     <lb/>
     with regard to the introduction of the Bill. 
     <lb/>
     there would be correspondence in reference 
     <lb/>
     to that aspect of it. Therefore, I say that 
     <lb/>
     that justifies what I have said, that there 
     <lb/>
     is no similarity between what we are doing 
     <lb/>
     today and confederation, because at con<lb break="no"/>federation there were two contracting par<lb break="no"/>ties, but today only one party has the power 
     <lb/>
     and can withhold everything from the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces that are being created. We have 
     <lb/>
     been carrying on an experiment for thirty 
     <lb/>
     years in this matter, and I say that the ex<lb break="no"/>perience of time, has shown that the ex<lb break="no"/>periment is not a good one. Am I not justi<lb break="no"/>fied in supposing that a wise and intelligent 
     <lb/>
     government, having to deal with the same 
     <lb/>
     question with regard to the new provinces, 
     <lb/>
     would endeavour to settle on some sound 
     <lb/>
     principle that would not require to be chang<lb break="no"/>ed from time to time ? It seems to me that 
     <lb/>
     would be the part of wisdom and what you 
     <lb/>
     would expect from very astute business 
     <lb/>
     men. Experience must teach us something, 
     <lb/>
     and our experience with our system of di<lb break="no"/>vision of revenues for thirty years should 
     <lb/>
     enable us to judge whether it is a success 
     <lb/>
     or a failure. The Minister of Finance ad<lb break="no"/>mits it is a failure. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I understood him to ad<lb break="no"/>mit it was a failure, because the provinces 
     <lb/>
     are always coming back for a readjustment. 
     <lb/>
     notwithstanding it was declared a finality 
     <lb/>
     ten years ago. They have come back in the 
     <lb/>
     past time after time, and are coming back 
     <lb/>
     now, and are likely to come back in the 
     <lb/>
     future, and does not this suggest that the 
     <lb/>
     part of wisdom would be to adopt some new 
     <lb/>
     and sound system which would avoid the 
     <lb/>
     necessity of readjusting these subsidies from 
     <lb/>
     time to time, as we have been obliged to do 
     <lb/>
     in the past?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I understood my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend to ask if there was any correspon<lb break="no"/>dence from the Northwest government in 
     <lb/>
     regard to suggesting any other methods than 
     <lb/>
     this, and it was to that question I replied 
     <lb/>
     there was no correspondence. The govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Northwest, in the Haultain Bill, 
     <lb/>
     has suggested precisely the same method of 
     <lb/>
     dealing with this matter as that which we 
     <lb/>
     have adopted. I do not understand that the 
     <lb/>
     principle of this matter has been a failure. 
     <lb/>
     What is the principle? That the provinces 
     <lb/>
     shall receive some portion of the revenues 
     <lb/>
     which the people pay to the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I do not think that principle has 
     <lb/>
     been a failure, and there is not a province 
     <lb/>
     in the Dominion today that would be will<lb break="no"/>ing to abandon it. The working out of the 
     <lb/>
     details has not always been satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     and the amount not always sufficient, but 
     <lb/>
     the principle that the government at Otta<lb break="no"/>wa shall pay a subsidy to the provinces is a 
     <lb/>
     principle that has not been a failure. No 
     <lb/>
     province will admit that it is a failure, 
     <lb/>
     though they will all be glad to have a larger 
     <lb/>
     subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It is then a success 
     <lb/>
     pro tanto ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. That principle will cer<lb break="no"/>tainly be retained, the only change that 
     <lb/>
     might take place being a re-adjustment of 
     <lb/>
     details. As to the point that we are not 
     <lb/>
     bound now in dealing with the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     as we were bound in dealing with the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which had the power to enter into a 
     <lb/>
     contract and to bargain, I admit my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend's argument, that if we followed the 
     <lb/>
     principle to its logical conclusion we would 
     <lb/>
     not give the Northwest anything. We would 
     <lb/>
     say: You are not in a position to bargain, 
     <lb/>
     and we will give you nothing. That would 
     <lb/>
     be manifestly unfair, and I am sure my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend would not pretend to take that view. 
     <lb/>
     Inasmuch as that principle has been adopt<lb break="no"/>ed, and inasmuch :as we give back a portion 
     <lb/>
     of our revenue to the provinces already con<lb break="no"/>stituted, it is only reasonable that we should 
     <lb/>
     give a portion to these new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     like manner.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     minister is justified in inferring, from any<lb break="no"/>thing that has come from this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, that we do not propose to give the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces anything; that we do not 
     <lb/>
     propose to be generous to these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I am not seeking to 
     <lb/>
     make that point.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. No, but the remarks 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. gentleman might convey the 
     <lb/>
     impression that those of us who have taken 
     <lb/>
     part in this debate were not inclined to 
     <lb/>
     deal fairly with these new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I certainly did not so 
     <lb/>
     intend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I am glad to hear 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman say so, but his words 
     <lb/>
     will be read. Permit me to say that I would 
     <lb/>
     favour no plan that would not deal reason<lb break="no"/>ably, generously with the people of the west, 
     <lb/>
     for the reason that if we did not do so we 
     <lb/>
     would be immediately called upon to do 
     <lb/>
     something more, and there would be a con<lb break="no"/>tinuous agitation. I am inclined to believe 
     <lb/>
     that we will require to be more than gener<lb break="no"/>ous at the start if we are to have peace 
     <lb/>
     and contentment in that western country, 
     <lb/>
     because the people who live there are a 
     <lb/>
     people who will stand up for their own 
     <lb/>
     rights. Therefore, I wish it to be under<lb break="no"/>stood that I am not going to be parsimoni<lb break="no"/>ous; I do not propose anything of that 
     <lb/>
     kind, but I simply reiterate what I said be<lb break="no"/>fore, that I think some new plan might now 
     <lb/>
     be suggested by which we could adopt con<lb break="no"/>ditions which would throw the responsibility 
     <lb/>
     on the people of these new provinces of con<lb break="no"/>serving what they do get, would make it 
     <lb/>
     more to their interest to protect and con<lb break="no"/>serve their revenues, and to economize with 
     <lb/>
     the moneys which come into their hands 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of carrying on the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. It might be said that would perhaps 
     <lb/>
     be a sort of parental care, that we are a 
     <lb/>
     little too anxious. I think in the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the older provinces we have had 
     <lb/>
     some examples of lack of care to conserve 
     <lb/>
     the assets and revenues of the people. You 
     <lb/>
     may take, as an example, the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ; I am afraid that in past years the 
     <lb/>
     people of Quebec received a severe lesson. 
     <lb/>
     There certainly was a time when they over<lb break="no"/>rode all principles in their expenditure, when 
     <lb/>
     they were reckless and seemed to throw 
     <lb/>
     money right and left, until they accumulat<lb break="no"/>ed a very large debt indeed, which is an 
     <lb/>
     undesirable thing for a province having a 
     <lb/>
     fixed revenue. A debt is a less serious mat<lb break="no"/>ter to the Dominion, because we have a 
     <lb/>
     variable revenue.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Hear, hear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. If we require more 
     <lb/>
     money we simply have to adopt the plan 
     <lb/>
    of the Minister of Finance, reduce the 
     <lb/>taxation and get more revenue. That is. 
     <lb/>we adopt a tariff for revenue only in<lb break="no"/>stead of a protectionist tariff in the interest 
     <lb/>of the people of this country. We simply 
     <lb/>adopt a plan to take more money out of 
     <lb/>the pockets of the people, and therefore a 
     <lb/>debt is not so serious a matter to the Do 
     <lb/>minion as to a province with a fixed re<lb break="no"/>venue. What I said with reference to 
     <lb/>Quebec applies pretty much to Ontario, 
     <lb/>which has now a considerable nucleus of 
     <lb/>a provincial debt, as has recently been dis<lb break="no"/>closed. I am sorry I cannot assist with a 
     <lb/>suggestion as to what direct method should 
     <lb/>be adopted. I believe it could be worked 
     <lb/>out on the principle of allowing the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to retain their lands and work out 
     <lb/>their own destiny, instead of our acting 
     <lb/>the paternal part of taking care of their 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="5455" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5455.jpg"/>

     <lb/>
           
   
            
     lands and using them for Dominion pur<lb break="no"/>poses and giving the provinces a money 
     <lb/>
     consideration instead. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Retaining 
     <lb/>
     their lands in Quebec and Ontario has not 
     <lb/>
     made them more economical. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I think this case is 
     <lb/>
     somewhat different. The new provinces 
     <lb/>
     have the example of Quebec staring them 
     <lb/>
     in the face, and will possibly be warned 
     <lb/>
     by that. But leaving that aside, I think 
     <lb/>
     if they are asked to hew out their own des<lb break="no"/>tiny that properly belongs to them, the re<lb break="no"/>sult will be better not only for the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but for the Dominion. We must 
     <lb/>
     look forward to the time when these enor<lb break="no"/>mous subsidies are going to be a very heavy 
     <lb/>
     charge on this country. What is to become 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion if we are going year after 
     <lb/>
     year to increase the revenues of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces out of the Dominion exchequer? I 
     <lb/>
     look forward to a time when possibly the 
     <lb/>
     revenues of the Dominion, which have been 
     <lb/>
     swollen of late years, will not increase so 
     <lb/>
     rapidly, and when we may possibly be 
     <lb/>
     ca lled upon to increase the debt of the coun<lb break="no"/>try for the purpose of providing these large 
     <lb/>
     subsidies. I have made no calculation as 
     <lb/>
     to what additional sum would require to be 
     <lb/>
     paid by the Dominion on account of the 
     <lb/>
     creation of these new provinces, but I am 
     <lb/>
     under the impresgion that the amount 
     <lb/>
     would be somewhat alarming. I would 
     <lb/>
     be glad if some hon. gentleman who has 
     <lb/>
     made the calculation would inform the 
     <lb/>
     committee just what it is at the present 
     <lb/>
     time; and it is not to the present alone 
     <lb/>
     that we must look, but also to the near 
     <lb/>
     future. The population of that country 
     <lb/>
     will increase from year to year, and when 
     <lb/>
     it reaches 800,000 in each province, the 
     <lb/>
     subsidy at 80 cents a head will amount to 
     <lb/>
     $640,000, or double that for the two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. a very considerable provision, apart 
     <lb/>
     from the allowance which we have to make 
     <lb/>
     to them because of the fact that they come 
     <lb/>
     in without a debt and that we have to pay 
     <lb/>
     them for the lands, with respect to which 
     <lb/>
    I shall have something to say when we 
     <lb/>reach the subclause. Having received the 
     <lb/>assurance of the Finance Minister that he 
     <lb/>did not wish to convey the idea that we 
     <lb/>were acting in an unfair manner to these 
     <lb/>provinces, I have nothing more to say at 
     <lb/>the present time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I was about to say, 
     <lb/>
     when the hon. gentleman rose, that I did 
     <lb/>
     not mean to imply that we were not in 
     <lb/>
     favour of giving assistance to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories in the way of subsidies. 
     <lb/>
     That was not my intention at all; but the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Halton (Mr. Henderson) 
     <lb/>
     has put that matter right. I was directing 
     <lb/>
     my attention to another matter which I 
     <lb/>
     think ought to be considered at the present 
     <lb/>
     time, that is, whether our system has been 
     <lb/>
     a success or a failure. The Minister of 
     <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
            
     Finance does not admit that it has been a 
     <lb/>
     failure: he claims that it has been a suc<lb break="no"/>cess. But I remember distinctly that some 
     <lb/>
     years ago the Hon. Edward Blake declared 
     <lb/>
     it to be a failure. Sir Richard Cartwright 
     <lb/>
     said the same thing. He said over and 
     <lb/>
     over again that he was opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     principle, because it only created an ambi<lb break="no"/>tion to beg for more. He also pointed out 
     <lb/>
     that it would inevitably lead a political 
     <lb/>
     party in a province, when the same party 
     <lb/>
     was in power in the Dominion, to appeal 
     <lb/>
     to the electors for support on the ground 
     <lb/>
     that they were going to get the provincial 
     <lb/>
     subsidy increased or get the Dominion to 
     <lb/>
     assume a debt which they had improvident<lb break="no"/>ly rolled up: and thus they would have 
     <lb/>
     a powerful lever in their hands to induce 
     <lb/>
     the electorate to return them to power. Is 
     <lb/>
     it not a fact that a political party in the 
     <lb/>
     maritime provinces have run the elections 
     <lb/>
     more than once on that ground, declaring 
     <lb/>
     that if they were returned, their friends 
     <lb/>
     being in power in the federal parliament, 
     <lb/>
     they would have a better chance of getting 
     <lb/>
     the provincial subsidy increased than if the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party were in power? And 
     <lb/>
     the result was that they were successful. 
     <lb/>
     The same question was raised in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec and the same party suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded. We have had it knocking at the 
     <lb/>
     doors of the federal parliament for an in<lb break="no"/>crease in the subsidy, and we have had the 
     <lb/>
     declaration of the First Minister to-day that 
     <lb/>
     we must deal with that question in the near 
     <lb/>
     future. Is not that an evidence that the 
     <lb/>
     principle is an unsound one ? We should 
     <lb/>
     adopt a principle which would be a finality 
     <lb/>
     and under which we would not have this 
     <lb/>
     menace constantly before us. It is for 
     <lb/>
     these reasons that I draw attention to the 
     <lb/>
     matter today; and when we are forming 
     <lb/>
     these new provinces, it seems to me a fit<lb break="no"/>ting time to adopt a correct principle with 
     <lb/>
     regard to them, and then try to deal with 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces on a similar principle. 
     <lb/>
     I asked if there was some correspondence, 
     <lb/>
     because I assumed that if there had been 
     <lb/>
     no correspondence before the financial de<lb break="no"/>tails were announced, there would not be 
     <lb/>
     much trouble at the present time. The 
     <lb/>
     financial arrangement is quite liberal now, 
     <lb/>
     in view of the small population. At the 
     <lb/>
     present time, when each province is sup<lb break="no"/>posed to have a population of 250,000, it 
     <lb/>
     will give at least $1,100.000 to each pro<lb break="no"/>vince. Then a province of 250,000 people 
     <lb/>
     would be getting $1,124,000. That would be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as rather lavish taking into 
     <lb/>
     account the smallness of the population. 
     <lb/>
     But when they reach the maximum of 800,<lb break="no"/>000. their revenue will be $2,200,000. How 
     <lb/>
     much did we give the Territories last year 
     <lb/>
     for government ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I cannot say off-hand. 
     <lb/>
     but perhaps some hon. member from the 
     <lb/>
     Territories can recollect it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:TURR1">Mr. TURRIFF</persName>. We do not get the max<lb break="no"/>imum when we attain a population of 800,<lb break="no"/>000, but when we attain a population of 
     <lb/>
     1,200,000 in each province. When we get 
     <lb/>
     the maximum, or a little over $2,000,000, 
     <lb/>
     if the people of the Territories will then be 
     <lb/>
     paying as much revenue to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     per capita as they are now, the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government will be receiving from each of 
     <lb/>
     these provinces a sum of about $10,000,000 
     <lb/>
     or $12,000,000, so that I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     debt of the Dominion will be increased by 
     <lb/>
     the subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. 800,000 is the max<lb break="no"/>imum of the province we are speaking of.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ARMS1">Mr. ARMSTRONG</persName>. Would the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance be good enough to give an esti<lb break="no"/>mate of the amount that will be required to 
     <lb/>
     supply the necessary buildings to carry on 
     <lb/>
     legislation ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. There is a clause later 
     <lb/>
     on which deals with that, subsection 4, 
     <lb/>
     which will be reached in a moment. The 
     <lb/>
     whole sum paid to the government of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories in 1903 was $802,466. There 
     <lb/>
     are several charges in which the Territories 
     <lb/>
     share but the grant to the government it<lb break="no"/>self was that amount. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Did you not spend a 
     <lb/>
     lot on public works in addition ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The Territories have 
     <lb/>
     shared in the various expenditure by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. I am speaking of the sum paid 
     <lb/>
     the territorial government and which was 
     <lb/>
     under their control. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. What is the cost of the 
     <lb/>
     government there today ? I remember 
     <lb/>
     pointing out last year what we spent. What 
     <lb/>
     we gave them to spend reached a little over 
     <lb/>
     a million, which would be at least $600,000 
     <lb/>
     to each of the two. Now we make it $1,<lb break="no"/>124,000. but this covers the administration 
     <lb/>
     of justice and everything else which entails 
     <lb/>
     a great deal of additional expenditure. Hav<lb break="no"/>ing regard to what it costs us to govern 
     <lb/>
     that country to-day, this is not a very extra<lb break="no"/>vagant amount to give them. But ten years 
     <lb/>
     hence, when there will be over a million 
     <lb/>
     people there, they will be back for a re<lb break="no"/>adjustment of their provincial subsidies, 
     <lb/>
     which seem to be lavish to-day ; and because 
     <lb/>
     of this fact we ought to devise some better 
     <lb/>
     principles than are embodied in this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. It would be inter<lb break="no"/>esting to have a statement along the lines 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend has mentioned. The gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of Canada, by means of an allow<lb break="no"/>ance to the government of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     and appropriations for public works and 
     <lb/>
     otherwise, is spending a certain amount. 
     <lb/>
     How does that compare with the amount 
     <lb/>
     which the Territories will receive under 
     <lb/>
     this Bill ? It would be well to have a com<lb break="no"/>parative statement in respect of their house<lb break="no"/>keeping in that regard. Will they be much 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     better off, or in the same position or worse 
     <lb/>
     off ?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The figures which I gave 
     <lb/>
     were taken from the public accounts of 
     <lb/>
     1903, and. they show that we paid some<lb break="no"/>thing over $800,000 to the government of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories in that year. Last year the sum 
     <lb/>
     was larger. I think my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     East Grey is right in saying it was some<lb break="no"/>thing over a million; and if you add the 
     <lb/>
     various charges which the Dominion bears 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest, it will be still more. It 
     <lb/>
     is not easy to make up such an account as 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     suggests because the Northwest shares in 
     <lb/>
     all the expenditure of the various branches 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion service. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I was referring to those

     items they will be obliged to provide for 
     <lb/>
     the future and which we have provided here<lb break="no"/>tofore.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. How much does the 
     <lb/>
     government of Canada provide for the ex<lb break="no"/>penditure which must be paid in future by 
     <lb/>
     the government of the Territories out of the 
     <lb/>
     allowance we make ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. The figures I had at 
     <lb/>
     the time, given me by the representatives 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories, were as follows: The 
     <lb/>
     total revenue for the eleven months of 
     <lb/>
     their financial year ending the lst of Jan<lb break="no"/>uary, from January to November, was $1,<lb break="mp"/>104,842.07. Of that amount they had re<lb break="no"/>ceived from the Dominion $961,936.42. There<lb break="no"/>fore the amount collected from local sources 
     <lb/>
     was $142,905.65. I have since ascertained 
     <lb/>
     that the total amount received during the ' 
     <lb/>
     whole year, both from Dominion and local 
     <lb/>
     revenues, was $1,121,000 and their expen<lb break="no"/>diture to the first January last was $1,<lb break="no"/>053,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Will they, under 
     <lb/>
     the new conditions, have to provide out of 
     <lb/>
     their subsidies to meet expenditures which 
     <lb/>
     are now provided for by the federal govern<lb break="no"/>ment in its general administration of Dom<lb break="no"/>inion affairs, and how much ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. There are certain 
     <lb/>
     expenditures now made by the territorial 
     <lb/>
     government, the money being largely sup<lb break="no"/>plied to them for that expenditure by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. Then there are certain other 
     <lb/>
     expenditures now made by the Dominion  
     <lb/>
     government on account of services that will 
     <lb/>
     be under the control of the provincial gov<lb break="no"/>ernments. Take, for instance, civil gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. It is estimated that the 
     <lb/>
     total amount required to be paid in this 
     <lb/>
     connection will be $101,540, which is 
     <lb/>
     based on the actual expenditure by the ter<lb break="no"/>ritorial government. Then they give an esti<lb break="no"/>mate of the amount required. for legislation. 
     <lb/>
     These two amounts are expended directly 
     <lb/>
     by the territorial government. To that must 
     <lb/>
     be added the administration of Justice, 
     <lb/>
     part of which is now provided for by the 


            <pb n="5459" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-05-04_Page_5459.jpg"/>

     <lb/>
            
   
            
     Dominion government, but expended by the 
     <lb/>
     local government. And, in that connection 
     <lb/>
     you have an additional $65,000, this being 
     <lb/>
     paid by the Dominion government over and 
     <lb/>
     above what is expended by the local gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. There are other expenditures 
     <lb/>
     now made by the Dominion government, 
     <lb/>
     such for instance, as court house, sheriff's 
     <lb/>
     ofiice, Regina jail, and Prince Albert jail 
     <lb/>
     and all which will be required to be paid 
     <lb/>
     by the provincial government in the future. 
     <lb/>
     Then there is the item of public works. 
     <lb/>
     There is now paid for public works by the 
     <lb/>
     territorial government out of money sup<lb break="no"/>plied by the Dominion government, some<lb break="no"/>where about $680,000. In addition to that, 
     <lb/>
     I need hardly say, there is a large amount 
     <lb/>
     expended by the Dominion government, but 
     <lb/>
     that expenditure by the Dominion is for 
     <lb/>
     works that will remain under the control 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion government. Then we have 
     <lb/>
     the details of what will be required for 
     <lb/>
     education and for agriculture and statistics. 
     <lb/>
     In the latter, in addition to what is ex<lb break="no"/>pended by the territorial government, there 
     <lb/>
     is $7,000 paid out by the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Under the head of government in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories we have expen<lb break="no"/>ditures for lieutenant governor's office, regis<lb break="no"/>trars' offices and schools unorganized dis<lb break="no"/>tricts, and so on—these are met by the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government, but hereafter will be a 
     <lb/>
     charge upon the provinces. I think I cannot 
     <lb/>
     do better than give a summary of the expen<lb break="no"/>diture made by the local and by the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government for purposes which here<lb break="no"/>after will come under the control of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces.

     Adding these sums together you get a to<lb break="no"/>tal of $1,909,485. This, according to the 
     <lb/>estimate prepared by the territorial author<lb break="no"/> <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     ities, would approximate the total amount. 
     <lb/>
     In this they have included something like 
     <lb/>
     $200,000 for purposes that we thought were 
     <lb/>
     not necessary and that were deducted. 
     <lb/>
     There was $3,000 in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     administration of justice; $8,000 in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the Edmonton jail, which will 
     <lb/>
     have to remain under the control of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government, because Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     jail is really a penitentiary; $100,000 esti<lb break="no"/>mated for police service which cannot be 
     <lb/>
     included; $38,000 in connection with roads 
     <lb/>
     and $100,000 for the construction of a pro<lb break="no"/>posed fence along the international boun<lb break="no"/>dary line of the territories. There is also 
     <lb/>
     another item which I cannot explain just 
     <lb/>
     now. The deduction of this amount of 
     <lb/>
     about $200,000 would leave about $1,700,000 
     <lb/>
     which was the basis upon which we practi 
     <lb/>
     cally settled.

     probable revenue for the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     would be $1,124,125 for the first year. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. $1,123,125, substantially 
     <lb/>
     the same as the hon. gentleman's figures.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. When the population 
     <lb/>
     reaches 800,000, 1 make the revenue for each 
     <lb/>
     province $1,652, 000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. But at that time the. 
     <lb/>
     revenue which will come to the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     will be a very large sum, and we can well 
     <lb/>
     afford to pay. them an increased subsidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. If the member for 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) is correct, it will reach 
     <lb/>
     $10,000,000. But I think that is a mere 
     <lb/>
     guess because the population would have to 
     <lb/>
     increase very rapidly indeed to bring the 
     <lb/>
     revenue to $10,000,000. It would have to 
     <lb/>
     increase more than twice as rapidly as it 
     <lb/>
     does now; because if we take the revenue 
     <lb/>
     per capita of the whole Dominion, which is 
     <lb/>
     $8.87, and apply it to a population of 5,000,<lb break="no"/>000, for each of those two provinces, it 
     <lb/>
     would not produce quite $5,000,000, which is 
     <lb/>
     a long way from $10,000,000, which the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman said would be the revenue, pos<lb break="no"/>sibly, when they reached the 800,000. An 
     <lb/>
     increase of 300,000 over 500,000 would not 
     <lb/>
     make up the other $5,000,000. So I think we 
     <lb/>
     must not bank too much on this enormous 
     <lb/>
     increase of revenue to meet the very large 
     <lb/>
     expenditure. We will have to make a more 
     <lb/>
     careful calculation than was made by the 
     <lb/>
     member for Assiniboia.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. As I understand it, the 
     <lb/>
     proposition of the Territories was $1,396,000. 
     <lb/>
     So there is that difference between the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment's proposition and that which the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories submitted in their 
     <lb/>
     draft Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. They asked alto<lb break="no"/>gether for $1,909,485, to include all the ser<lb break="no"/>vices that they are now responsible for, and 
     <lb/>
     the services that are provided for by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government directly. That was 
     <lb/>
     their request, $1,909,485. Now when we 
     <lb/>
     examine the details of the figures, we find 
     <lb/>
     that in that sum they include a sum of     
     <lb/>
     $3,000 in connection with the administration 
     <lb/>
     of justice, which they wanted added on, 
     <lb/>
     though it is already provided for. They in<lb break="no"/>cluded the sum of $8.000 for the Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     jail. That sum of $8,000 for the Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     jail will not be a charge on them at all. It 
     <lb/>
     will remain with us, because the Edmonton 
     <lb/>
     jail is to be treated as a penitentiary for the 
     <lb/>
     Territories. Therefore the financial obli<lb break="no"/>gations connected with that penitentiary 
     <lb/>
     will be upon us. and that sum is deducted 
     <lb/>
     from the amount they claim, as the jail will 
     <lb/>
     not pass over. Then in connection with the 
     <lb/>
     police service, they charged $100,000, which 
     <lb/>
     they wanted us to give them in order that 
     <lb/>
     they may provide for their police service. 
     <lb/>
     We did not think, in view of the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Mounted Police is to be main<lb break="no"/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     tained by the Dominion government, that we 
     <lb/>
     ought to maintain the police, and at the same 
     <lb/>
     time give them $100,000 for the same service; 
     <lb/>
     because there is a provision in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Mounted Police Act that if they require the 
     <lb/>
     services of the police they can apply for 
     <lb/>
     them, and each municipality of the province 
     <lb/>
     can pay for such service as they require 
     <lb/>
     from the police. Therefore that sum is also 
     <lb/>
     to be deducted. Then they charged, in con<lb break="no"/>nection with public works, a sum of $13,000, 
     <lb/>
     which we did not think ought to be admitted. 
     <lb/>
     They claimed in connection with colonization 
     <lb/>
     roads, the sum of $25,000, which we did not 
     <lb/>
     think ought to be admitted, because it is the 
     <lb/>
     intention of the government, so far as these 
     <lb/>
     colonization roads are necessary, to continue 
     <lb/>
     to make the expenditure ourselves, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the fact that a part of the Territories will 
     <lb/>
     still remain under our control. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. Do you continue the 
     <lb/>
     construction of these colonization roads in 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces as a Dominion work ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. In so far as it may 
     <lb/>
     be necessary to make colonization roads, 
     <lb/>
     it is our intention to make them, both in the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces and outside—if we deem it 
     <lb/>
     necessary to make any. Then in addition, 
     <lb/>
     they asked for $100,000 for the construction 
     <lb/>
     of a fence along the international boundary. 
     <lb/>
     We did not think that was necessary, and if 
     <lb/>
     it was necessary to construct it, we should 
     <lb/>
     do it ourselves. So we deducted that 
     <lb/>
     amount. Then there is another amount of 
     <lb/>
     $50,000 to be deducted. which they charged 
     <lb/>
     as the result, they claimed, of an examina<lb break="no"/>tion of the Auditor General's Report of 
     <lb/>
     1902-3. They seemed to think they were en<lb break="no"/>titled to $50,000 more, which we also de<lb break="no"/>ducted. So that from this sum of $1,909,485 
     <lb/>
     these deductions have to be made, and if 
     <lb/>
     these are taken into account, it will be 
     <lb/>
     found that the amount we have given to 
     <lb/>
     them to be derived from the different sources 
     <lb/>
     of revenue mentioned in the resolution, will 
     <lb/>
     practically meet all their requirements, of 
     <lb/>
     course, always bearing in mind that they 
     <lb/>
     have from their local sources a revenue of 
     <lb/>
     $143,000.

     do, knowing some of the opinions which 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Finance held in regard 
     <lb/>
     to an arrangement of a very similar char<lb break="no"/>acter as between the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and the Dominion of Canada, and knowing 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. Minister of Finance, in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the large sum of $2,848,000 which 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario alleged for many 
     <lb/>
     years was an asset of that province, sup<lb break="no"/>ported that contention, and that he held that

     at any time the province of Ontario had 
     <lb/>
     the right to call upon the Dominion to pay 
     <lb/>
     over that large sum of money. Knowing 
     <lb/>
     that fact, I may well suspect that there 
     <lb/>
     may be something in even the drafting of 
     <lb/>
     this clause that will allow these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to call upon the Dominion for this 
     <lb/>
     sum of $8,000,000. Whether that is the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the hon. Minister of Finance or 
     <lb/>
     not I hardly think it is the intention, or will 
     <lb/>
     be the intention, of this committee. I 
     <lb/>
     rather think the intention will be to grant 
     <lb/>
     this $400,000 from year to year as a sub<lb break="no"/>sidy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the year 1884, the Dominion of Can<lb break="no"/>ada granted an additional subsidy to the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario of $142,414, based upon 
     <lb/>
     a capital sum of $8,848,000, which it was 
     <lb/>
     alleged was owing to the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario by the Dominion of Canada, alleged 
     <lb/>
     not as a matter of fact, but simply as a 
     <lb/>
     matter of calculation. The sum arose in 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     this way : From 1867 to 1873, the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario was charged the interest on five- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     ninths of the excess of debt which the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Upper and Lower Canada had 
     <lb/>
     over the $62,500,000, when they went into 
     <lb/>
     confederation. In 1873, a readjustment of 
     <lb/>
     subsidies was made and the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment agreed to assume the entire ex<lb break="no"/>cess of debt of $10,500,000 owing by the 
     <lb/>
     old provinces of Canada and to relieve the 
     <lb/>
     old provinces from the payment of interest. 
     <lb/>
     In other words they practically made the 
     <lb/>
     provinces of Ontario and Quebec a gift of 
     <lb/>
     $10,500,000, because these provinces were 
     <lb/>
     for ever relieved from the payment of in<lb break="no"/>terest on that money. This seemed to be 
     <lb/>
     a very generous act on the part of the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government, and it is just one of 
     <lb/>
     those things that I apprehend will occur in 
     <lb/>
     the administration of the affairs of these 
     <lb/>
     provinces when a demand is made for bet<lb break="no"/>ter terms. However, we will say nothing 
     <lb/>
     more about that now. The provinces of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec were satisfied in 1873 
     <lb/>
     to get rid of $10,500,000 of debt and throw 
     <lb/>
     it on the shoulders of the whole of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of Canada. Nothing more was said un<lb break="no"/>til 1884. when the demand was again made 
     <lb/>
     for better terms by the provinces and the 
     <lb/>
     government then led by Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald felt constrained to come to the re<lb break="no"/>lief of the provinces again. The words 
     <lb/>
     quoted by my hon. friend from East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule), I think, made use of by Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Blake, were very apt indeed. These appli<lb break="no"/>cations came time after time, and we had 
     <lb/>
     the continual repetition of the same old 
     <lb/>
     story; better terms, better terms and bet<lb break="no"/>ter terms. In 1884, it became necessary to 
     <lb/>
     conciliate the different provinces, because, 
     <lb/>
     I think, that was really the purpose for 
     <lb/>
     which the new subsidy was given, and it 
     <lb/>
     became necessary to find a basis on which 
     <lb/>
     the new subsidy could be granted. The 
     <lb/>
     fact was that the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act provided no means for an increase of 
     <lb/>
     subsidy and it was necessary to devise 
     <lb/>
     some means. The province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     said: You assumed our excess of debt in 
     <lb/>
     1873 and relieved us of the half yearly pay<lb break="no"/>ment of interest. We had paid for the 
     <lb/>
     first seven years after confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Now, if you had the right to assume that 
     <lb/>
     excess of debt and relieve us of that in<lb break="no"/>terest in 1873, it was right that it should 
     <lb/>
     have been done in 1867, and you ought to 
     <lb/>
     refund to us the interest we paid during 
     <lb/>
     those seven years. A calculation was 
     <lb/>
     made, because it was conceded by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the day that they would have 
     <lb/>
     to do something, and I think, the gentle<lb break="no"/>man who made the calculation at that time 
     <lb/>
     was the present Auditor General, he having 
     <lb/>
     made it before he became Auditor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral. The calculation was made that 13 1/2 
     <lb/>
     half-yearly payments of interest at five per 
     <lb/>
     cent up to 1884 would amount to $2.848,<lb break="no"/>000. In 1884, a Bill was passed by this 
     <lb/>

     parliament granting new subsidies, or prac<lb break="no"/>tically new subsidies, on the basis of five 
     <lb/>
     per cent on $2,848,000 to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, and the other provinces all got 
     <lb/>
     what we commonly call a quid pro quo. 
     <lb/>
     No man in this House at that time assumed 
     <lb/>
     that that $2,848,000 was a debt to be paid 
     <lb/>
     over to the province of Ontario in a bulk 
     <lb/>
     sum at any time, but the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario, in 1894, when their surplus practi<lb break="no"/>cally disappeared, and being desirous of 
     <lb/>
     placing a good financial showing before the 
     <lb/>
     electors of the province, adopted the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of capitalizing this sum of $142,414 
     <lb/>
     and said: The Dominion of Canada owes 
     <lb/>
     us $2,848,000 in cash. Year after year the 
     <lb/>
     matter was discussed in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, some holding one thing and some 
     <lb/>
     the other. I always thought that that $2,<lb break="no"/>848,000 was not a debt owing by this Do<lb break="no"/>minion to the province of Ontario. I was 
     <lb/>
     led to believe that from the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     Act that created that subsidy in 1884 de<lb break="no"/>clared that the $142,414 should be paid in 
     <lb/>
     half-yearly payments to the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario as an additional subsidy. It was 
     <lb/>
     so declared in the Act and as it was sub<lb break="no"/>sidy and not interest there was no authority 
     <lb/>
     for capitalizing it. With other questions 
     <lb/>
     in dispute between the old provinces and 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion of Canada this same matter 
     <lb/>
     was referred to arbitrators. and they de<lb break="no"/>clared that the settlement of 1884 should 
     <lb/>
     be held intact and that this subsidy should 
     <lb/>
     continue to be paid half-yearly to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario and Quebec. But, this 
     <lb/>
     is the point that I wish to draw attention 
     <lb/>
     to. At a later period the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario, still setting up the contention that 
     <lb/>
     this was capital owing to them, applied to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
     <lb/>
     for an interpretation of the statute and I 
     <lb/>
     think we have it on record that the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Finance has given his 
     <lb/>
     opinion that the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     is entitled to call for that sum of $2,848,000. 
     <lb/>
     subject to certain conditions, but those 
     <lb/>
     conditions were conditions that could very 
     <lb/>
     readily be got over. If I recollect aright, 
     <lb/>
    the simple conditions were that they 
     <lb/>could be used in the construction of 
     <lb/>public works ; so that the conditions 
     <lb/>were of such a minor character that they 
     <lb/>would not constitute a defence for the 
     <lb/>Dominion of Canada in resisting payment of 
     <lb/>that money. Now what I fear here is that 
     <lb/>probably these new provinces may make a 
     <lb/>demand in the same way, and that some 
     <lb/>day, when the Minister of Finance finds 
     <lb/>himself a little short of funds, when his 
     <lb/>surplus may not be quite so large, he will 
     <lb/>find each of these provinces coming down 
     <lb/>and asking him for the sum of $8,000,000 
     <lb/>in solid cash. I desire to call attention to 
     <lb/>this matter because I think we should be 
     <lb/>most explicit in the language and I have 
     <lb/>never intended to find fault and I am not 
     <lb/>finding fault with the allowance. I am not 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
           
     finding any fault with the province of Al<lb break="no"/>berta, or the province of Saskatchewan get<lb break="yes"/>ing a yearly allowance, on account of hav<lb break="no"/>ing no debt, of $400,000. I am finding no 
     <lb/>
     fault with that, but when we are enacting 
     <lb/>
     thls law I think we should be very parti<lb break="no"/>cular to see that the law is framed so that 
     <lb/>
     these provinces will not come down at a 
     <lb/>
     later period and make a demand on the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion of Canada for something that we 
     <lb/>
     never intended to give them, as has been 
     <lb/>
     done in the case of the province of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     I have no doubt that the draughtsman will 
     <lb/>
     be able to put that language in such definite 
     <lb/>
     and explicit form that there will be no dan<lb break="no"/>ger of uncertainty, but I always thought 
     <lb/>
     that the language of the Act of 1884 was 
     <lb/>
     extremely definite and very explicit indeed. 
     <lb/>
     It declared that the sum to be granted to 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario at this time, the 
     <lb/>
     $142,414 was to he paid as a subsidy and 
     <lb/>
     not as interest. Here we find that the re<lb break="no"/>solution declares that there is a sum of 
     <lb/>
     interest to be paid half-yearly to this pro<lb break="no"/>vince. I fancy we will find as shrewd men 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories as we find in 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa and those men will come down to 
     <lb/>
     us and say: You are paying us half-yearly 
     <lb/>
     interest at the rate of five per cent 
     <lb/>
     on $8,000,000; and if there is in<lb break="no"/>terest there must be principal, there can<lb break="no"/>not be interest without principal, and there<lb break="no"/>fore without accepting your little sum of 
     <lb/>
     $200,000 a year we believe we are able to 
     <lb/>
     manage our own affairs and we want you 
     <lb/>
     to pay over the $8,000,000 at once. Now 
     <lb/>
     let there be no uncertainty about this. I 
     <lb/>
     would ask the Finance Minister before I sit 
     <lb/>
     down what the real meaning of the clause 
     <lb/>
     is. Is it to be left open, is it to be left in 
     <lb/>
     uncertainty, or is the government of the 
     <lb/>
     same mind as the Minister of Finance was 
     <lb/>
     of some two or three years ago, and is he 
     <lb/>
     of that opinion still, that under the wording 
     <lb/>
     of this resolution, the province of Alberta, 
     <lb/>
     or the province of Saskatchewan could at 
     <lb/>
     any time call upon the Dominion for the 
     <lb/>
     capital sum of $8,000,000 instead of getting 
     <lb/>
     the allowance of $200,000 per .half year in 
     <lb/>
     perpetuity ? I make no objection to the 
     <lb/>
     grant of money or to the allowance only I 
     <lb/>
     say, do not let us fall into the mistake of 
     <lb/>
     1884, if a mistake was made in 1884, and 
     <lb/>
     leave it in uncertainty. There is certainly 
     <lb/>
     more room for the contention in this case 
     <lb/>
     that the province would have a right to 
     <lb/>
     call for the capital sum than in the case 
     <lb/>
     of 1884, because the Act of 1884 said that 
     <lb/>
     $142,414 should be paid as subsidy; here 
     <lb/>
     it is paid as interest and as I said before 
     <lb/>
     if there is interest, the people there will 
     <lb/>
     say there is principal behind it. I submit 
     <lb/>
     this to the Minister of Finance and I hope 
     <lb/>
     he will make the matter clear, and if the 
     <lb/>
     language of the draughtsman is not suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently clear to protect us in the opinion 
     <lb/>
     which we desire to express, then I think the 
     <lb/>
     clause might be so amended as to place it 
     <lb/>
     beyond doubt and not leave us with a con<lb break="no"/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I do not think there is 
     <lb/>
     much difference substantially between the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Halton (Mr. Henderson) 
     <lb/>
     and myself with regard to the nature of 
     <lb/>
     these payments. His contention as I under<lb break="no"/>stand it is that they should be subsidies 
     <lb/>
     or annuities, that the sums are marked as 
     <lb/>
     interest simply with that intention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I presume that the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's intention is that these 
     <lb/>
     sums will be paid as annuities in perpetuity, 
     <lb/>
     but I think the language of the resolution 
     <lb/>
     is not sufficiently definite to protect parlia<lb break="no"/>ment in that contention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. That is the contention 
     <lb/>
     I know that my hon. friend has always 
     <lb/>
     made in relation to the case in Ontario, and 
     <lb/>
     it has always been arguable. There is how<lb break="no"/>ever a difference between the Ontario case 
     <lb/>
     and this case. In the case of Ontario the 
     <lb/>
     Act under which these increased sums are 
     <lb/>
     granted treated them as capital. I am 
     <lb/>
     speaking from memory but I think that is 
     <lb/>
     correct. The government of the day carried 
     <lb/>
     those sums to the credit of the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, and they remained as a debt due 
     <lb/>
     by the Dominion to the province of Onta<lb break="no"/>rio and were so placed in the public ac<lb break="no"/>counts. This parliament passed an Act a 
     <lb/>
     good many years ago which declared—I am 
     <lb/>
     speaking from memory but I think I am cor<lb break="no"/>rect—that where there is a sum available in 
     <lb/>
     the debt account of any province that sum 
     <lb/>
     may, on the application of the government 
     <lb/>
     of the province, be withdrawn for the pur<lb break="no"/>poses of public works. Under that Act 
     <lb/>
     various provinces of the Dominion did with<lb break="no"/>draw from their debt accounts sums of 
     <lb/>
     money, thereby reducing their capital sum 
     <lb/>
     and thereby reducing their annual revenue. 
     <lb/>
     When the question was raised in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario, my view was that, 
     <lb/>
     under the Act, Ontario could under certain 
     <lb/>
     conditions, which I shall state later, apply 
     <lb/>
     to the Dominion for that money, and that 
     <lb/>
     under those conditions the province might 
     <lb/>
     receive that money as a payment out of its 
     <lb/>
     own invested capital. Of course, I went on 
     <lb/>
     to say that it was not a practical question 
     <lb/>
     inasmuch as it was not conceivable that 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario would withdraw 
     <lb/>
     money earning 5 per cent when it could go 
     <lb/>
     out on the public market and borrow at 4 
     <lb/>
     per cent or less. Therefore it always seem<lb break="no"/>ed to me to be rather more of. an aca<lb break="no"/>demic subject which we were discussing, a 
     <lb/>
     matter not likely ever to take practical 
     <lb/>
     shape. But under an Act passed away back 
     <lb/>
     in, I think, 1874, provision was made that 
     <lb/>
     a provincial government might under cer<lb break="no"/>tain conditions withdraw from its capital 
     <lb/>
     accounts at Ottawa sums of money for pub<lb break="no"/>lic works. I think that in the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     the matter when that Act was passed it was 
     <lb/>
     entirely a matter for executive action be<lb break="no"/>tween the governments of the provinces and 
     <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
            
     the Dominion. That is to say if the execu<lb break="no"/>tive of the province made application for the 
     <lb/>
     money and if the executive of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     should see fit to grant it, the money might 
     <lb/>
     thereupon be paid out for the purposes de<lb break="no"/>signated, always limiting it to public works. 
     <lb/>
     Later on, about the year 1885, the Act was 
     <lb/>
     amended to provide that a province could 
     <lb/>
     only make applications for money out of 
     <lb/>
     such funds when so authorized by the pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislature ; and, speaking from 
     <lb/>
     memory, I think that is the state of the law 
     <lb/>
     today. In order to draw money out of that 
     <lb/>
     capital fund, there must first be the 
     <lb/>
     authority of the provincial legislature 
     <lb/>
     supporting the demand of the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government, and then it becomes 
     <lb/>
     a matter of discretion with the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor General in Council whether or not he 
     <lb/>
     will advance the money for the purposes 
     <lb/>
     stated. That was the substance of the ans<lb break="no"/>wer which I gave to the government of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario. As I said a moment ago 
     <lb/>
     I treated it rather as an academic question, 
     <lb/>
     for I did not quite see how it could practi<lb break="no"/>cally rise. The money was earning 5 per 
     <lb/>
     cent in the treasury of the Dominion, and as 
     <lb/>
     I said it was hardly to be supposed that the 
     <lb/>
     government of any province would with<lb break="no"/>draw that money when they could go out 
     <lb/>
     on the public market and borrow money at 
     <lb/>
     4 per cent or less. So much on the general 
     <lb/>
     subject of the law. In the case of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     that sum was carried into the public ac<lb break="no"/>counts as a debt due by the Dominion to 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario. I admit that under 
     <lb/>
     the language used in this resolution it is 
     <lb/>
     not declared to be capital, and perhaps there 
     <lb/>
     is some room to doubt whether under this 
     <lb/>
     we could capitalize it. I am rather dis<lb break="no"/>posed to take the view that it ought to be 
     <lb/>
     regarded as an annuity and not as a cap<lb break="no"/>ital sum. I understand that is the view 
     <lb/>
     suggested by my hon. friend (Mr. Hender<lb break="no"/>son), that he thinks it ought to be an an<lb break="no"/>nuity and not a capital sum. There is 
     <lb/>
     a good deal to be said in favour of 
     <lb/>
     that view and before the matter is finally 
     <lb/>
     disposed of—I shall not regard it as final 
     <lb/>
     now,—I am inclined to think much might 
     <lb/>
     be said in favour of inserting words 
     <lb/>
     which would make that clear. I quite 
     <lb/>
     realize that these amounts which do not 
     <lb/>
     represent an actual debt, represent allow<lb break="no"/>ances made to one province or another in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the various conditions of 
     <lb/>
     the public debt; that these are all methods 
     <lb/>
     of bookkeeping. They were not actual 
     <lb/>
     debts ; but, by virtue of the terms on which 
     <lb/>
     these grants were made, in some if not all 
     <lb/>
     instances. they were carried into the public 
     <lb/>
     debt account of theDominion. In that ac<lb break="no"/>count they stand as debts due to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion by the province, and I am inclined to 
     <lb/>
     think that the legal gentlemen opposite will 
     <lb/>
     say that if the province saw fit to make ap<lb break="no"/>plication to the Dominion executive. we 
     <lb/>
     could pay money out of that fund for the 
     <lb/>
     construction of public works. That was 
     <lb/>

     our view with regard to the case of On<lb break="no"/>tario. Whether we should use other words 
     <lb/>
     to make it clear that this is an annuity and 
     <lb/>
     not a capitalized sum is worthy of consi<lb break="no"/>deration, and before the Bill is finally dis<lb break="no"/>posed of I will return to the matter again.

     <persName ref="pers:HEND1">Mr. HENDERSON</persName>. I do not wish to 
     <lb/>
     prolong the discussion, but there may not 
     <lb/>
     be another opportunity for some days to 
     <lb/>
     take this matter up. I never could agree 
     <lb/>
     with the Minister of Finance that that was 
     <lb/>
     a capital sum. It is a simple matter of 
     <lb/>
     bookkeeping. I know that in the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1884 it is stated as capital, but the Act 
     <lb/>
     says that the interest at five per cent will 
     <lb/>
     be paid to the province as an annual sub<lb break="no"/>sidy. The sum of $4,848,000 was never 
     <lb/>
     owing by the Dominion to the province. It 
     <lb/>
     was practically a scheme to provide a basis 
     <lb/>
     on which a new subsidy could be calculated. 
     <lb/>
     It was no more a capital sum than the 
     <lb/>
     assessment of a town or village; it was 
     <lb/>
     simply used for the purpose of determining 
     <lb/>
     what the subsidy should be, just as we use 
     <lb/>
     an assessment and an assessment roll in or<lb break="no"/>der to fix the rate of taxation. I believe 
     <lb/>
     that was the opinion of the judges of the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court when they had that matter 
     <lb/>
     under consideration. My recollection is 
     <lb/>
     that they decided that when the subsidy 
     <lb/>
     had been ascertained as $142,414, the capital 
     <lb/>
     sum dropped out of sight and was no more 
     <lb/>
     to be regarded as capital. But, as the 
     <lb/>
     Finance Minister has told us that he is 
     <lb/>
     prepared to modify, if necessary, the lan<lb break="no"/>guage in this resolution to make plain what 
     <lb/>
     the intention of parliament is, I am quite 
     <lb/>
     satisfied. All we want is to have it de<lb break="no"/>finitely understood. so that it will not be 
     <lb/>
     said in future years that we made a mis<lb break="no"/>take in our legislation or left it an open 
     <lb/>
     question as to whether the province should 
     <lb/>
     call on us for $400,000 a year in perpetuity, 
     <lb/>
     or come down on us at once for $8,000.000. 
     <lb/>
     Perhaps if' they got the $8.000,000, they 
     <lb/>
     might use it extravagantly. I do not say 
     <lb/>
    that they would, but I think it is better to   
     <lb/>give them an annuity in perpetuity. It 
     <lb/>will be better for them, because it will be 
     <lb/>equivalent to an investment at 5 per cent. 
     <lb/>But as the Finance Minister has promised 
     <lb/>to make the matter clear, I am satisfied.

     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Up to the time of the in<lb break="no"/>troduction of this Bill I understand that 
     <lb/>
     the government of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged that they were in debt to the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. I notice in a speech delivered 
     <lb/>
     by the premier of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     in 1900, that he admitted $3,000,000 odd, 
     <lb/>
     made up of several items. This resolution 
     <lb/>
     reads, 'inasmuch as the said province is 
     <lb/>
     not in debt.' This would appear rather 
     <lb/>
     conflicting with the fact. I would like some 
     <lb/>
     explanation with respect to that.

     an amendment to the next clause. It does 
     <lb/>
     not change the substance of these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions but only their form. Resolution 3 
     <lb/>
     deals with the allowances for land. In the

     founded. That seems unnecessary and I

                 VACANCY IN THE CABINET.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN (South York). Be<lb break="no"/>fore the Orders of the Day are called, I in<lb break="no"/>tend to draw the attention of the govern— 
     <lb/>
     ment and of the House to a matter of very 
     <lb/>
     great importance, and, in order to put my<lb break="no"/>self within the rules of the House, I intend 
     <lb/>
     to conclude with a motion. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister is no doubt aware of a 
     <lb/>
     vacancy in his cabinet; he is also no doubt 
     <lb/>
     aware that there is a vacancy in North 
     <lb/>
     Oxford, and if he is loyal and true to an 
     <lb/>
     old and trusted colleague, there will be in a 
     <lb/>
     very short time, or there may already be, 
     <lb/>
     for aught I know, a vacancy in the city of 
     <lb/>
     London. At the same time the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman is endeavouring to put through 
     <lb/>
     this House a constitutional Bill, a Bill 
     <lb/>
     which, it once passed, can't be revoked. In 
     <lb/>
     a country where there is a constitution as 
     <lb/>
     we have in Canada, my idea is that any con<lb break="no"/>stitutional amendment of the gravity of the 
     <lb/>
     one for autonomy in the west now before 
     <lb/>
     the House ought to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people in a general election. In the United 
     <lb/>
     States, if a great constitutional change is 
     <lb/>
     proposed, it must be submitted to all the 
     <lb/>
     states for consideration before it can become 
     <lb/>
     law; and in countries organized under a 
     <lb/>
     constitution such as Switzerland, before a 
     <lb/>
     constitutional change can take place, there 
     <lb/>
     must be a referendum; and the same cus<lb break="no"/>tom prevails in a number of other countries 
     <lb/>
     where they have written constitutions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Now, in Canada, this Bill proposing great 
     <lb/>
     constitutional issues, was brought down to 
     <lb/>
     parliament without any intimation to the 
     <lb/>
     people at the last general election that such 
     <lb/>
     a change was contemplated. In fact, the 
     <lb/>
     people were led to believe that no constitu<lb break="no"/>tional change was to take place ; but imme<lb break="no"/>diately the session was opened this Bill 
     <lb/>
     was introduced, a Bill that involves a great 
     <lb/>
     constitutional issue that to-day is disquiet<lb break="no"/>ing the country from one end to the other. 
     <lb/>
     \Vhile I take the broad ground that this 
     <lb/>
     question ought first to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the whole country, I certainly say, 
     <lb/>
     in view of the vacancy that has occurred in 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet, the vacancy that has occurred 
     <lb/>
     in North Oxford, and the vacancy that I 
     <lb/>
     think ought to occur in the House, if the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman has confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman who has filled that office 
     <lb/>
     now for nearly two years—there ought to 
     <lb/>
     be a vacancy in London. In view, then, of 
     <lb/>
     these two vacancies, or one vacancy, which<lb break="no"/>ever it may be, I say it is the duty of the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman to cause writs to be 
     <lb/>
     issued immediately for that election, or 
     <lb/>
     those two elections, in Ontario, and to give 
     <lb/>
     the people of Ontario, that province which 
     <lb/>
     has been charged by some hon. gentlemen in 
     <lb/>
     this House with being an intolerant pro<lb break="no"/>vince a bigoted province, a narrow-minded 
     <lb/>
     province—to give the people of that province 
     <lb/>
     an opportunity to answer the contention. 
     <lb/>
     which, I believe, is held by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister, that he has Ontario at his back in 
     <lb/>
     this matter ; and certainly to give the Post<lb break="no"/>master General, the acting Minister of Pub<lb break="no"/>lic Works and the Minister of Customs an 
     <lb/>
     opportunity to justify before the people of 
     <lb/>
     their province the policy which they are 
     <lb/>
     now advocating in this House. Until that 
     <lb/>
     is done, I say the hon. gentleman cannot ask 
     <lb/>
     that any progress be made in connection 
     <lb/>
     with this constitutional Bill now before the 
     <lb/>
     House; in fact, I do not think this House 
     <lb/>
     will be justified in making any progress 
     <lb/>
     whatever, or progress of the most secondary 
     <lb/>
     character in a Bill of this kind. But, on the 
     <lb/>
     contrary, these vacancies ought to be filled. 
     <lb/>
     the writs ought to be issued for the elections,
