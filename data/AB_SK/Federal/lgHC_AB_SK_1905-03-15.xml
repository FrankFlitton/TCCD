            <p>
               asked  that  this  legislation  should  not  be 
                  <lb/>
               granted when the company had the right to 
                  <lb/>
               increase the rates.  The  authorities  of  the 
                  <lb/>
               city believe that if you take away from the 
                  <lb/>
               city the competition that exists to—day the 
                  <lb/>
               rates will go up.   The  whole  gist  of  the 
                  <lb/>
               question is that this legislation aims at de<lb break="no"/>stroying the competition, with the result<lb/>that rates are bound to be increased.  The <lb/>city does not object to the two companies 
                  <lb/>
               making a reasonable pro-fit. If the rates are 
                  <lb/>
               too low, surely they can get adequate rates. 
                  <lb/>
               In reply to the hon. member for South 
                  <lb/>
               Lanark (Mr. Haggart), as to the resolution 
                  <lb/>
               passed by the city council, or the promise 
                  <lb/>
               made by it, I understand him to say that 
                  <lb/>
               the city  of  Ottawa had promised a monopoly 
                  <lb/>
               to the Ottawa Electric Company.   It is 
                  <lb/>
               true a resolution was passed by the council 
                  <lb/>
               of the city of Ottawa promising a monopoly 
                  <lb/>
               to the Ottawa Electric Company.   I  think it 
                  <lb/>
               is open to the members of the Ottawa city 
                  <lb/>
               council to change their minds on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion.   Immediately after the resolution was 
                  <lb/>
               passed—and it may have been secured in 
                  <lb/>
               some way,  although I am not suggesting 
                  <lb/>
               anything of that kind—―notice of reconsider<lb break="no"/>ation was given, and it was pointed out by 
                  <lb/>
               the solicitor of the company that the resolu 
                  <lb/>
               tion promised something that no municipali<lb break="no"/>ty could give, that in common law it was im<lb break="no"/>possible  to  grant  a  monopoly  to  any  one 
                  <lb/>
               company.   An  illustration  of  the  fact  that 
                  <lb/>
               it was against the common law was shortly 
                  <lb/>
               afterwards afforded by something that hap<lb break="no"/>pened in the adjoining municipality of Hull. 
                  <lb/>
               The  corporation  of  the  city  of  Hull  endea<lb break="no"/>voured to give a monopoly to the Hull Com<lb break="no"/>pany and the Ottawa Company,  which  is 
                  <lb/>
               to-day  seeking  a  monopoly  in  the  city  of 
                  <lb/>
               Ottawa,  entered  a  protest ;  an  appeal  was 
                  <lb/>
               taken to the courts, and it was found to be 
                  <lb/>
               a violation of the common law.  The result 
                  <lb/>
               is that to—day there is competition in the 
                  <lb/>
               city of Hull, where an endeavour was made 
                  <lb/>
               to create a monopoly.   Now the point made, 
                  <lb/>
               as I understand it,  by  the hon.  member for 
                  <lb/>
               South Lanark is  that  the  city  of  Ottawa 
                  <lb/>
               had entered into a bargain, or made a pro<lb break="no"/>mise, that they afterwards did not keep. 
                  <lb/>
               It is true this resolution was passed by the 
                  <lb/>
               city council, but I do not think that should 
                  <lb/>
               govern parliament.  If we consider that in 
                  <lb/>
               our judgment it is a wrong thing to inter <lb/>fere with the vested rights of the city of 
                  <lb/>
               Ottawa, then I do not believe we should pass 
                  <lb/>
               this legislation.  We should not interfere 
                  <lb/>
               with the rights of the municipality. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>

            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK.  We are now on the 
                  <lb/>
               preamble of the Bill, and perhaps it would 
                  <lb/>
               be more regular if we adopted the preamble 
                  <lb/>
               and proceeded to deal with the clauses as 
                  <lb/>
               they arise.  There are clauses in the Bill 
                  <lb/>
               which are not objectionable, and when we 
                  <lb/>
               reach any clause that is objectionable, then 
                  <lb/>
               we can consider the question.  I have a great 
                  <lb/>
               deal of respect for vested rights as far as 
                  <lb/>
               cities are concerned, and I have some re<lb break="no"/><cb/><!-- <p>Mr. STEWART. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->spect for the vested rights of corporations 
                  <lb/>
               also.  I am sorry to say that I am not a 
                  <lb/>
               municipal ownership man, but I am in 
                  <lb/>
               favour of corporations when they are pro<lb break="no"/>perly regulated, and I want to have an 
                  <lb/>
               opportunity of saying so.

               Mr. F.  L.  SCHAFFNER (Souris).   Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Speaker,  I  would not rise to-night to ad<lb break="no"/>dress this House on this question,  which 
                  <lb/>
               has been so well discussed this afternoon <lb/>—perhaps I shall only be repeating very 
                  <lb/>
               many of the statements that have been 
                  <lb/>
               already made—were it not that I felt it to 
                  <lb/>
               be an imperative duty.  There are one or 
                  <lb/>
               two reasons why I believe it imperative that 
                  <lb/>
               I should have something to say on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion.  I will endeavour to-night, in the few 
                  <lb/>
               remarks which I make, not to discuss the 
                  <lb/>
               Bill.  There seems to be a great tempta<lb break="no"/>tion to enter into a discussion of the Bill. 
                  <lb/>
               When the proper time comes to discuss the 
                  <lb/>
               Bill, I hope to have an opportunity of mak<lb break="no"/>ing a few remarks. But I will say right 
                  <lb/>
               here that when the proper time comes my 
                  <lb/>
               effort will be to address this House on that 
                  <lb/>
               question in a manner absolutely free from 
                  <lb/>
               offence to any creed or any set of people 
                  <lb/>
               in this House or in this country.  I believe 
                  <lb/>
               that this great question in connection with 
                  <lb/>
               the formation  of  these two provinces in 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest  is  more than a provincial 
                  <lb/>
               question ; it  is  a  national  question ;  and 
                  <lb/>
               I  believe  that  whatever  men,  or whatever 
                  <lb/>
               hon.  members  on  this  or  the  other  side 
                  <lb/>
               of the House think, that is the way in which 
                  <lb/>
               we should endeavour to discuss it.   There 
                  <lb/>
               are one or two reasons why I wish to tres<lb break="no"/>pass upon the time of the House.   One is 
                  <lb/>
               that I represent a constituency of the west, 
                  <lb/>
               which I can say—and I do not do it boast<lb break="no"/>fully—has to—day more elevators and grows 
                  <lb/>
               more wheat, although it is somewhat of a 
                  <lb/>
               large district, than any other section of a 
                  <lb/>
               similar size in the Dominion of Canada. <lb/>One other reason why I would like to make 
                  <lb/>
               a few remarks is that the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment were good enough to give us, before 
                  <lb/>
               the last election,  increased representation. 
                  <lb/>
               In order that we might have that increased 
                  <lb/>
               representation, it was necessary that the 
                  <lb/>
               constituencies that already existed should 
                  <lb/>
               be divided.   I was particularly favoured by 
                  <lb/>
               having the honour of contesting a portion 
                  <lb/>
               of the constituency which has been repre― 
                  <lb/>
               sented by the hon. member for Brandon <lb/>(Mr.  Sifton).   I  was  given  the  south  half. 
                  <lb/>
               In the south half of that constituency, which 
                  <lb/>
        
            <pb n="2549" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2549.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">2549</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 15, 1905</fw> <fw type="num">2550</fw>
            
        
               was controlled by and which always elected 
                  <lb/>
               my hon. friend the member for Brandon 
                  <lb/>
               when he was able to bring those wonderful 
                  <lb/>
               powers which he possessed to bear upon the 
                  <lb/>
               electorate, he was able to secure a majority 
                  <lb/>
               of 200 or 300. To-day, after that power has 
                  <lb/>
               been withdrawn, the same people who elect<lb break="no"/>ed him were good enough to elect me by a 
                  <lb/>
               majority of a little over 500. Knowing, as 
                  <lb/>
               I do what these same people think on this 
                  <lb/>
               great question, I feel it my duty to trespass 
                  <lb/>
               upon the time of the House for a short 
                  <lb/>
               while. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Now, Mr. Speaker, although I am new in 
                  <lb/>
               this parliament, I am not very new in the 
                  <lb/>
               matter of years, and I am not very new in 
                  <lb/>
               my knowledge of the political aspect of 
                  <lb/>
               this country and of my friends who sit on 
                  <lb/>
               the other side of the House. Living so 
                  <lb/>
               near as I do to the hon. member for Bran<lb break="no"/>don (Mr. Sifton), we became to same extent 
                  <lb/>
               at least chums—I do not know if that is a 
                  <lb/>
               parliamentary expression, but it is at all 
                  <lb/>
               events a somewhat endearing term. I do 
                  <lb/>
               not suppose the hon. gentleman (Mr. Sifton) 
                  <lb/>
               wants my sympathy, but I cannot help be<lb break="no"/>ing a little sensitive for him and I feel very 
                  <lb/>
               deeply the manner in which he was treated 
                  <lb/>
               in connection with this Bill. Some time 
                  <lb/>
               ago, when we asked the First Minister as 
                  <lb/>
               to when the member for Brandon might be 
                  <lb/>
               expected back, we were told he was in the 
                  <lb/>
               south for his health. Soon after that Bill 
                  <lb/>
               was introduced, and from a health point of 
                  <lb/>
               view it was very unfair to compel the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior to make such a break 
                  <lb/>
               neck journey to Ottawa, and after getting 
                  <lb/>
               here to force him to rush out on the street 
                  <lb/>
               to ascertain what were the contents of the 
                  <lb/>
               Autonomy Bill which had been introduced 
                  <lb/>
               to parliament. The Prime Minister told us <lb/>to-day that the member for East Grey (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Sproule) had asked for three weeks' delay 
                  <lb/>
               between the first and second readings of 
                  <lb/>
               this Bill, but hon. gentleman will remember 
                  <lb/>
               with what derisive cheers from the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment supporters that request of the 
                  <lb/>
               member for East Grey was met at the time. 
                  <lb/>
               The three weeks asked for by the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Grey have passed and although 
                  <lb/>
               this House of Commons has not been 
                  <lb/>
               very busy, we are still waiting for the 
                  <lb/>
               second reading. To-day the honoured leader 
                  <lb/>
               of the opposition endeavoured to get some 
                  <lb/>
               information from the premier as to when 
                  <lb/>
               the second reading would be moved, and 
                  <lb/>
               when that request was made a gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               on the Liberal benches remarked : You will 
                  <lb/>
               know soon. Well, I for one, would like to 
                  <lb/>
               know how long that 'soon' is. We have 
                  <lb/>
               the information now that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sifton) was not consulted as to 
                  <lb/>
               this Bill, that the Minister of Finance was <lb/>not consulted either, and that Mr. Haultain, 
                  <lb/>
               the Prime Minister of the Territories was 
                  <lb/>
               not consulted as to the educational clauses. 
                  <lb/>
               The Prime Minister tried to make out that 
                  <lb/>
               Mr. Haultain had been consulted, but I 
                  <lb/>
            have too much confidence in the ability of 
                  <lb/>

<!--82<lb/>-->
            <cb/>
      
               the right hon. gentleman to think that he 
                  <lb/>
               for one moment thought that he was mak<lb break="no"/>ing the House believe any such thing. So 
                  <lb/>
               far as we know at present, the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               the Interior, the Minister of Finance, Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Haultain and the members of parliament 
                  <lb/>
               from the Northwest Territories were not 
                  <lb/>
               consulted on this matter. Right here I 
                  <lb/>
               would like to say that this afternoon 
                  <lb/>
               during the discussion of this great question, 
                  <lb/>
               not one member from the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories supporting the government was in 
                  <lb/>
               his place in the House. I do not know all 
                  <lb/>
               these members and that statement may not 
                  <lb/>
               be correct, but I am told that it is a fact. 
                  <lb/>
               Any way, whether they were here or not 
                  <lb/>
               they were absolutely silent on the question 
                  <lb/>
               and I suppose the inference is they are 
                  <lb/>
               satisfied with what has occurred. I have 
                  <lb/>
               not such a deep interest in the other mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government as I have in the 
                  <lb/>
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) and there<lb break="no"/>fore I am not so concerned in the fact that 
                  <lb/>
               the others were not consulted about this 
                  <lb/>

               any rate of showing whether they are willing,

               by the administration of the law, to do as the

               government and people of Nova Scotia have 
                  <lb/>
               done—that is, consult the prejudices or require<lb break="no"/>ments of the minority of that province. Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Speaker, in the province of New Brunswick we 
                  <lb/>
               have a law similar to that of Nova Scotia. I 
                  <lb/>
               was here during part or the time in 1872-73-74 
                  <lb/>
               when the question of the New Brunswick school 
                  <lb/>
               was brought up by the present Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Marine and Fisheries, who invited us to inter<lb break="no"/>fere. Wisely, Sir, we abstained from interfer<lb break="no"/>ence, and what is the result to-day ? The re<lb break="no"/>sult is that in New Brunswick the law is being 
                  <lb/>
               administered in a way that is satisfactory to 
                  <lb/>
               all classes of the community. Suppose we had 
                  <lb/>
               listened to the hon. gentleman who now fills 
                  <lb/>
               the position of Minister of Marine and Fisher<lb break="no"/>ies, who so eloquently urged upon us the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of interfering with the legislation of New 
                  <lb/>
               Brunswick, and had undertaken to interfere 
                  <lb/>
               with the laws of that province. Suppose we 
                  <lb/>
               had interfered, what would have been the posi<lb break="no"/>tion in that province to-day ? Think you that 
                  <lb/>
               you would have had the same amicable and 
                  <lb/>
               friendly relations between that province and 
                  <lb/>
               this Dominion that exists to-day ?  No, Sir. If 
                  <lb/>
               the hon. gentleman had prevailed he would have 
                  <lb/>
               sown the seed of discord throughout this Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. As a result I say that to-day you have in 
                  <lb/>
               the province of New Brunswick as happy a con<lb break="no"/>dition of things as exists in the province of 
                  <lb/>
               Nova Scotia, so also in the province of Prince 
                  <lb/>
               Edward Island. There is a Public School Act 
                  <lb/>
               and there is no difficulty among the different 
                  <lb/>
               denominations in that province.

                  <lb/>
               of this Dominion presenting an object lesson 
                  <lb/>
               to this parliament to take note of and to take 
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
               left to the administration of its own laws it <lb/>will administer them in such a way in its own

               No, Sir, I think not. I think that no more fatal

               If we substitute 'the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories' for 'Manitoba' we will have a pretty 
                  <lb/>
               good description of the Bill which is now 
                  <lb/>
               proposed in this House, and which no doubt 
                  <lb/>
               this House will be asked to sanction. We 
                  <lb/>
               have here just what the Minister of Militia 
                  <lb/>
               thinks about this question, and if he thinks 
                  <lb/>
               that, how is it possible that he could have 
                  <lb/>
               approved of the present Bill which is con<lb break="no"/>trary to the views which he expressed be<lb break="no"/>fore. Now, let us sum up briefly the opi<lb break="no"/>nions which he expressed. First he objects 
                  <lb/>
               to coercion. None of us like that word. 
                  <lb/>
               Then he takes the stand that what is past 
                  <lb/>
               cannot be changed even down to the third 
                  <lb/>
               or fourth generation. I am afraid that be<lb break="no"/>fore that time we will all be chloroformed. 
                  <lb/>
               He also takes the stand for provincial 
                  <lb/>
               rights he thinks the minority should be 
                  <lb/>
               considered, he thinks that before any great 
                  <lb/>
               change in the policy of the country is made 
                  <lb/>
               there should be an investigation. He thinks 
                  <lb/>
               that if Manitoba is left to administer its 
                  <lb/>
               own laws it will administer them in its own 
                  <lb/>
               interest and in the interests of all parts of 
                  <lb/>
               the Dominion. I have taken some pains <lb/>to find what the minister said on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and I want the House to take it into 
                  <lb/>
               consideration that it is difficult to under<lb break="no"/>stand how this gentleman ever supported 
                  <lb/>
               the introduction of a Bill of this spirit. As

               regards the extension of the boundaries of 
                  <lb/>
               the province of Manitoba, I would like to 
                  <lb/>
               say that I think that is a right principle. The 
                  <lb/>
               people of that province have been to a large 
                  <lb/>
               extent pioneers in that western country ; 
                  <lb/>
               they have been pioneers in reference to 
                  <lb/>
               the government of that western country. 
                  <lb/>
               In that case are they not deserving of some 
                  <lb/>
               rights now ? When the First Minister 
                  <lb/>
               wanted to make two provinces in the North<lb break="no"/>west he seems to have been determined on 
                  <lb/>
               making them so large that even the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Calgary, who lives in that district, 
                  <lb/>
               thinks they are too large and yet he did 
                  <lb/>
               not even consult the Minister of the Inte<lb break="no"/>rior or the Minister of Finance or I believe 
                  <lb/>
               the Minister of Militia, or several other 
                  <lb/>
               ministers. It is impossible, the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister says, to extend the boundaries of 
                  <lb/>
               Manitoba unless he calls into council with 
                  <lb/>
               him the province of Quebec, Ontario and 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest Territories. I claim that 
                  <lb/>
               that is not fair to us in Manitoba. I cannot 
                  <lb/>
               understand how it is that the hon. the First 
                  <lb/>
               Minister could occupy as much time as he 
                  <lb/>
               does in replying to straight away questions 
                  <lb/>
               put from this side of the House, and say so 
                  <lb/>
               little. It seemed to me that he absolutely 
                  <lb/>
               failed to give information. I suppose, per<lb break="no"/>haps, that is part of the game and that I 
                  <lb/>
               have not been here long enough to under<lb break="no"/>stand, but I think on some points at least 
                  <lb/>
               we should have the information we asked. 
                  <lb/>
               He said to-day that although this question 
                  <lb/>
               had been before the people for some three 
                  <lb/>
               weeks the only fault found with it was in 
                  <lb/>
               connection with the school clauses. This 
                  <lb/>
               House must remember that the people who 
                  <lb/>
               are most interested in that clause are scat<lb break="no"/>tered over very many hundred miles of 
                  <lb/>
               this country and it takes quite a long while 
                  <lb/>
               for mails to reach them, but if that hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman has not yet received any commu<lb break="no"/>nication from that country objecting to any 
                  <lb/>
               other clause except the school clause, I 
                  <lb/>
               wish to read to-night a petition that has 
                  <lb/>

               House this afternoon, which will show that 
                  <lb/>
               there are others and perhaps just as great 
                  <lb/>
               objections to this Bill. This petition is as

               country west of Lake Superior is not repre<lb break="no"/>sented to-day in the Dominion government. 
                  <lb/>
               However great his ability may be, no man 
                  <lb/>
               on either side of this House at such a time 
                  <lb/>
               in the history of the country as this can 
                  <lb/>
               be Prime Minister and at the same time 
                  <lb/>
               perform with satisfaction the duties of the 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of the Interior. I hold that this 
                  <lb/>
               cannot be done, and I want to say further 
                  <lb/>
               that I do not want to detract from any east<lb break="no"/>ern province. Nearly all of us who have 
                  <lb/>
               been in that western country for 20, 25 
                  <lb/>
               and 30 years, who have been pioneers, 
                  <lb/>
               nothwithstanding that we have made that 
                  <lb/>
               country our home, we are sons of the east <lb/>―I am sure this is true of the majority of 
                  <lb/>
               the people of that country—and we are 
                  <lb/>
               loyal to the east. Personally, though I have 
                  <lb/>
               been in the west for twenty-four years, I 
                  <lb/>
               never hear the word ' Nova Scotia ' spoken 
                  <lb/>
               but it fills me with pride. And I believe 
                  <lb/>
               that is true of every easterner. Every 
                  <lb/>
               member of this House, I am sure, believes 
                  <lb/>
               that if this Canada of ours is to be a great 
                  <lb/>
               country like the country to the south of us, 
                  <lb/>
               great in population, in trade and in wealth, 
                  <lb/>
               the resources upon which its progress must 
                  <lb/>
               be based lie west of Lake Superior. We 
                  <lb/>
               have, perhaps, to take some of our lessons 
                  <lb/>
               from the east, but it we are to become 
                  <lb/>
               great, if we are ever to have forty or fifty 
                  <lb/>
               millions of inhabitants, it must be because 
                  <lb/>
               of the resources of the west. And yet that 
                  <lb/>
               country is deprived of a man in the 
                  <lb/>
               council to represent our case as it should 
                  <lb/>
               be represented. That is not a condition of 
                  <lb/>
               affairs that ought to exist to-day. I think 
                  <lb/>
               I need not say more on the subject of the 
                  <lb/>
               extension of the boundaries. If I were to 
                  <lb/>
               talk for an hour I could not make myself 
                  <lb/>
               better understood than by the statement 
                  <lb/>
               that I believe it is the right of Manitoba 
                  <lb/>
               to have her boundaries extended. And we 
                  <lb/>
               should have at once a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, a man who can do our business for us. 
                  <lb/>
               And I would like to make a suggestion<lb break="no"/>well, no ; I have no right to put it that way; 
                  <lb/>
               I would like to submit a request—to the 
                  <lb/>
               First Minister that when he, in his own 
                  <lb/>
               good time, appoints a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, he will appoint a man who is res<lb break="no"/>ponsible to the people. We do not want a 
                  <lb/>
               man, however great his ability may be, that 
                  <lb/>
               belongs to some constituency in which he 
                  <lb/>
               is not directly responsible to the people. I 
                  <lb/>
               would like to see some constituency in the 
                  <lb/>
               west opened up to test public opinion on 
                  <lb/>
               these great questions. I think we are 
                  <lb/>
               ready for it. When this question was being 
                  <lb/>
               settled for Manitoba the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) was very an<lb break="no"/>xious for investigation. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
                  <lb/>
               don't you think that a very good way to 
                  <lb/>
               find out what the people think upon this 
                  <lb/>
               question would be to throw open one of the 
                  <lb/>
               constituencies ? We are not very particular 
                  <lb/>
               which constituency in the west these hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentlemen decide to open ; any of them will

                  <lb/>
               much for the kind attention with which they 
                  <lb/>
               have heard me.

               Mr. J. HERRON (Alberta). I shall occupy

            <p>
               only a few minutes of your time, Mr. Speaker, 
                  <lb/>
               in stating, as briefly as possible my views on 
                  <lb/>
               the phase of the provincial autonomy ques<lb break="no"/>tion that is now before us. I was much 
                  <lb/>
               surprised to hear the Prime Minister (Sir 
                  <lb/>
               Wilfrid Laurier) state this afternoon that 
                  <lb/>
               he believed that the clauses of his Bill af<lb break="no"/>fecting education were the only clauses not 
                  <lb/>
               satisfactory to the people of the Northwest 
                  <lb/>
               Territories. If the Prime Minister believes 
                  <lb/>
               that he expresses the opinions of the people 
                  <lb/>
               of the Northwest when he says that, except 
                  <lb/>
               for the educational clauses, they are entirely 
                  <lb/>
               in accord with the Bill, I can only tell him 
                  <lb/>
               that I believe that he is mistaken. What his 
                  <lb/>
               sources of information may be, I do not 
                  <lb/>
               know. But this is one of the reasons, I 
                  <lb/>
               think, why we should have a Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               the Interior to represent that country and 
                  <lb/>
               express at the council board the wishes 
                  <lb/>
               of its people. Dealing with the question 
                  <lb/>
               which involves such important questions, 
                  <lb/>
               such grave financial responsibilities and con<lb break="no"/>trols such vast areas of land, and dealing 
                  <lb/>
               also with the right of half a million people, 
                  <lb/>
               it seems perfectly plain that those people 
                  <lb/>
               should be represented in the government. 
                  <lb/>
               I do not consider that we are represented 
                  <lb/>
               at this time. And that is one of the ob<lb break="no"/>jections the people have to the present 
                  <lb/>
               situation. We in the Northwest will not 
                  <lb/>
               be satisfied unless we get the handling of 
                  <lb/>
               our own lands and our own minerals. I for 
                  <lb/>
               one believe that no compensation could be 
                  <lb/>
               given by this government that would re<lb break="no"/>concile the people of that country to being 
                  <lb/>
               deprived of this control, for this involves 
                  <lb/>
               far more than dollars and cents to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. I wish to put myself on record as say<lb break="no"/>ing that there are several clauses in the Bill 
                  <lb/>
               as objectionable to our people as the clauses 
                  <lb/>
               dealing with education. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Hon. GEORGE E. FOSTER (North To<lb break="no"/>ronto). Mr. Speaker, the discussion of this 
                  <lb/>
               afternoon, I believe, has not been without 
                  <lb/>
               its lessons for this House and the country. 
                  <lb/>
               Any one of an observant turn of mind sit<lb break="no"/>ting in the gallery or even on the floor of 
                  <lb/>
               this House, would have thought over a great 
                  <lb/>
               many things, while many deductions from 
                  <lb/>
               the circumstances would have forced them<lb break="no"/>selves upon his mind. Why is it, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, that when an important question of 
                  <lb/>
               this kind is being discussed we are not 
                  <lb/>
               afforded even the courtesy of having res<lb break="no"/>ponsible ministers—still ministers, however 
                  <lb/>
               long they may continue in their positions<lb break="no"/>in their seats ? The conduct of the policy 
                  <lb/>
               of the government of which they form, I 
                  <lb/>
               suppose, a responsible part is being reviewed 
                  <lb/>
               by His Majesty's loyal opposition. I do not 
                  <lb/>
               think there is any sufficient answer to that 
                  <lb/>
               
            <cb/>
  
               question. I think these ministers ought to 
                  <lb/>
               be here. I think they owe it to themselves, 
                  <lb/>
               to those they represent and to the country 
                  <lb/>
               at large to be present in their seats. And 
                  <lb/>
               yet, as this discussion has gone on the ob<lb break="no"/>servant person would have noticed that 
                  <lb/>
               at one time there would be but one minister 
                  <lb/>
               in his seat, at another time two, sometimes 
                  <lb/>
               even three, but the number always very 
                  <lb/>
               small. Now, it may be good policy for hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentlemen opposite to affect a show of 
                  <lb/>
               indifference, and, perhaps, at the same 
                  <lb/>
               time to conceal their true feeling, which is 
                  <lb/>
               not indifference, but a very genuine discom<lb break="no"/>fiture at the mistakes they have made and 
                  <lb/>
               the position in which they find themselves. 
                  <lb/>
               Why is it also that when a subject involving 
                  <lb/>
               so greatly, the interests of the Northwest 
                  <lb/>
               is under review, we find almost all the 
                  <lb/>
               members on the other side representing con<lb break="no"/>stituencies in the Northwest Territories ab<lb break="no"/>senting themselves from their places ?  
                  <lb/>
               Was it because they have such superior 
                  <lb/>
               knowledge and such superior parts that they 
                  <lb/>
               did not think it consistent with their high 
                  <lb/>
               qualities to listen to animadversions and 
                  <lb/>
               to statements reflecting on a policy of the 
                  <lb/>
               government or a Bill which vitally afects 
                  <lb/>
               themselves ? I do not think it was. I think 
                  <lb/>
               that their modesty would not allow them 
                  <lb/>
               to come to any such conclusion. Then 
                  <lb/>
               was it because they were supremely care<lb break="no"/>less and did not care a fig how things 
                  <lb/>
               went? I hardly think it was that either. <lb/>Or was it because they were schooled to 
                  <lb/>
               silence and told to say nothing and get 
                  <lb/>
               out of the House? Perhaps that would 
                  <lb/>
               come nearer the right answer than either 
                  <lb/>
               of the other suppositions I have made. 
                  <lb/>
               These hon. gentlemen opposite were wont 
                  <lb/>
               to be voluble enough. In 1896, their ton<lb break="no"/>gues were not tied. When they were on 
                  <lb/>
               this side of the House they had a volume 
                  <lb/>
               of speech and sound which was admirable, 
                  <lb/>
               long continued and vehement it seemed 
                  <lb/>
               to come from inexhaustible sources. Why 
                  <lb/>
               are those gentlemen so silent now ? Why 
                  <lb/>
               is it they have not a single word to say in 
                  <lb/>
               their own defence? Why is it that res<lb break="no"/>ponsible ministers who, I suppose, count 
                  <lb/>
               for something in the cabinet—some min<lb break="no"/>isters do count for something—why is it 
                  <lb/>
               that two of them at any rate who counted 
                  <lb/>
               for something were forestalled deliberately 
                  <lb/>
               before the Bill was brought down. The 
                  <lb/>
               others who remained, and who presum<lb break="no"/>ably did not count for much, were simply 
                  <lb/>
               taken in hand by that autocrat, the First 
                  <lb/>
               Minister. His Bill was rushed in and he 
                  <lb/>
               practically said to these gentlemen : there 
                  <lb/>
               it is before you and the country ; you can 
                  <lb/>
               support it or not as you please. I make 
                  <lb/>
               bold to say, Mr. Speaker, that never before 
                  <lb/>
               has any parliament witnessed such an 
                  <lb/>
               exhibition. Like whipped children fearing 
                  <lb/>
               the lash, yet afraid to confess their faults, 
                  <lb/>
               the members of the government, from the 
                  <lb/>
           
            
            <pb n="2559" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2559.jpg"/>

               highest to the lowest, sit in the House, 
                  <lb/>
               take their medicine and say nothing. To 
                  <lb/>
               the simplest question they have no an<lb break="no"/>swer, or if they attempt an answer—I 
                  <lb/>
               should not put it in the plural but in the 
                  <lb/>
               singular—or if the Prime Minister attempts 
                  <lb/>
               an answer, it is an attempt not to give 
                  <lb/>
               the information but to evade the questions 
                  <lb/>
               put to him. I put it to the right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman as a serious sensible man : Is 
                  <lb/>
               it or is it not a question to which the op<lb break="no"/>position and the country have the right to 
                  <lb/>
               an answer, why he rushed his Bill into 
                  <lb/>
               parliament as the measure of a united 
                  <lb/>
               government when he knew that his two 
                  <lb/>
               most important ministers were diametri<lb break="no"/>cally opposed to one of the principal 
                  <lb/>
               clauses in that Bill, and had placed them<lb break="no"/>selves on record as irrevocably pledged 
                  <lb/>
               against it time and again ? Was not that 
                  <lb/>
               somewhat peculiar? One by one the pre<lb break="no"/>tenses of the right hon. gentleman have 
                  <lb/>
               been struck from him, and by this time he 
                  <lb/>
               stands before this House and country 
                  <lb/>
               pretty bare. He is no longer the some<lb break="no"/>what picturesque object he was a few 
                  <lb/>
               months ago. Shorn of his feathers and 
                  <lb/>
               his beautiful colours, he is coming to be 
                  <lb/>
               known more and more for what he is and 
                  <lb/>
               what he has proved himself. If in 1896, 
                  <lb/>
               my right hon. friend secured any popu<lb break="no"/>larity among the staunch stalwart Lib<lb break="no"/>erals of this country, he secured it solely 
                  <lb/>
               because he then made himself the cham<lb break="no"/>pion of provincial rights. And if to-day 
                  <lb/>
               he has forfeited the respect, esteem and 
                  <lb/>
               confidence of thousands and tens of thou<lb break="no"/>sands in this country, as he has, it is be<lb break="no"/>cause he has at last come out in his true 
                  <lb/>
               colours as being the opponent and not the 
                  <lb/>
               champion of provincial rights. It is be<lb break="no"/>cause he has reversed his position. The 
                  <lb/>
               position of 1896' was apparently a brave 
                  <lb/>
               one. That of 1905 is an entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent one, and to it is due the loss 
                  <lb/>
               of respect and confidence of which the 
                  <lb/>
               right hon. gentleman and his colleagues 
                  <lb/>
               are only too well aware. The speech 
                  <lb/>
               which he delivered in this House not 
                  <lb/>
               two weeks ago abounded in pretense 
                  <lb/>
               and assumption, but when the facts come 
                  <lb/>
               to be known these are stripped from it 
                  <lb/>
               one after the other. He declared that he 
                  <lb/>
               was about to put the crown of complete 
                  <lb/>
               and absolute autonomy on these western 
                  <lb/>
               territories, and all his people behind him 
                  <lb/>
               cried out amen, and rent the air with their 
                  <lb/>
               plaudits. But five minutes after any one 
                  <lb/>
        
               of them that listened knew that the two 
                  <lb/>
        
               most sparkling gems in that crown, the 
                  <lb/>
               control of education, the right to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands, were missing and thus rendered 
                  <lb/>
               his statement absolutely meaningless and 
                  <lb/>
               without foundation. In 1896, what was 
                  <lb/>
               the plea of the right hon. gentleman ? It 
                  <lb/>
               was that he wanted to consult the people 
                  <lb/>
               whose interests were chiefly affected. He 
                  <lb/>
               wanted to get at the exact condition of 
                  <lb/>
               
   <cb/>
            <!--<p>

               things amongst the people of Manitoba in 
                  <lb/>
               order that he might find out the exact 
                  <lb/>
               remedy to be applied. He wanted to know 
                  <lb/>
               exactly what the people desired. He was, 
                  <lb/>
               as he had often boasted, a democrat up 
                  <lb/>
               to the hilt and—he wished to find out ex<lb break="no"/>actly what the people required and carry 
                  <lb/>
               out their will. What reason had he for 
                  <lb/>
               not giving autonomy a year ago? Because 
                  <lb/>
               he wanted to wait until he had ten repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from that country in this House 
                  <lb/>
               instead of four. He wanted also to have 
                  <lb/>
               the executive of the Northwest here in or<lb break="no"/>der that he might confer with them. And

            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               yet when I asked the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man tonight whether he embodied in that 
                  <lb/>
               educational clause any of the fruits of that 
                  <lb/>
               wide and thorough consultation of the 
                  <lb/>
               wishes of the 500,000 people of the North<lb break="no"/>west, what answer has he? He must 
                  <lb/>
               answer that he had not. When I asked him 
                  <lb/>
               whether in that same clause be embodied 
                  <lb/>
               the results of his conferences and inter<lb break="no"/>changes of opinion with the executive of 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest Territories, his reply and 
                  <lb/>
               that of Mr. Haultain taken together show 
                  <lb/>

               I ask him and ask hon. members from the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest sitting on that side of the House 
                  <lb/>
               if the educational clause embodied their last 
                  <lb/>
               thought, or deepest conviction, or complete 
                  <lb/>
               assent, to what ought to be given to their 
                  <lb/>
               people in the Northwest, and I have but to 
                  <lb/>
               ask the question to answer it. Can the 
                  <lb/>
               right hon. Prime Minister say that he did ? 
                  <lb/>
               Yet in his speech he declared that what he 
                  <lb/>
               had the benefit of was, not only the consul<lb break="no"/>tation with, but the advice of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the Northwest. Let him 
                  <lb/>
               get up and answer now whether the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clause embodied the advice, the last 
                  <lb/>
               thought, and best thought of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the Northwest. Let any 
                  <lb/>
               representative from the Northwest get up 
                  <lb/>
               and say that it did so. I challenge them 
                  <lb/>
               to-night—those that are here—I challenge 
                  <lb/>
               them. Does that clause represent them ? 
                  <lb/>
               Did it represent them when it was brought 
                  <lb/>
               down ? Does it represent them now ? 
                  <lb/>
               There is not a man of them that will get up 
                  <lb/>
               on his legs and say that it does. All of the 
                  <lb/>
               preceding negotiations of the Northwest in 
                  <lb/>
               reference to autonomy went on the as<lb break="no"/>sumption that the man chiefly to be em<lb break="no"/>ployed, the medium chiefly to be considered, 
                  <lb/>
               the representative through whom all the 
                  <lb/>
               ideas should filter to the government, 
                  <lb/>
               was the right hon. gentleman's Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior. Does he deny that ? 
                  <lb/>
               The records show it. The whole course 
                  <lb/>
               of the administration shows it. It was 
                  <lb/>
               so in our time ; the people from the 
                  <lb/>
               outside get to the inside of the cabinet 
                  <lb/>
               through an accredited member of it. It is 
                  <lb/>
               more so now, because, at the instigation of 
                  <lb/>
               my right hon. friend himself, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment have enlarged and strengthened the 
                  <lb/>
               functions of the cabinet minister. Not only 
                  <lb/>
               have they made each a cabinet minister as 
                  <lb/>

                          to the country at large, but they have in<lb break="no"/>vested him with what we may call a geo<lb break="no"/>graphical ministerial responsibility, and 
                  <lb/>
               they have declared above board, honestly, 
                  <lb/>
               we suppose, earnestly, we know, that the 
                  <lb/>
               new doctrine has been embodied in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this country, that a minister is 
                  <lb/>
               not only responsible to the whole country, 
                  <lb/>
               but he is especially responsible to the geo<lb break="no"/>graphical division which he is more inti<lb break="no"/>mately connected with. Now, Sir, if that 
                  <lb/>
               were good for a Fisher, why is it 
                  <lb/>
               not good for a Sifton ? If that were good 
                  <lb/>
               enough when you wanted some machinery 
                  <lb/>
               and engineering in order to carry out a 
                  <lb/>
               piece of vile patronage, why is it not a 
                  <lb/>
               thousand times better when the rights of 
                  <lb/>
               500,000 free people in the great and grow<lb break="no"/>ing Northwest are in question ? Good, when 
                  <lb/>
               you want to suppress a Dundonald, but bad, 
                  <lb/>
               when you want to use it as the means 
                  <lb/>
               for keeping these 500,000 people from get<lb break="no"/>ting their wishes embodied in parliamentary 
                  <lb/>
               form. The pretense of absolute and com<lb break="no"/>plete autonomy has been completely 
                  <lb/>
               stripped off from the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman. These pretenses were lovely and 
                  <lb/>
               beautiful when the speech was being de<lb break="no"/>livered, and all the men on that side of the 
                  <lb/>
               House said 'amen' and rent the air with 
                  <lb/>
               their plaudits. What do they think now, 
                  <lb/>
               that these pretenses are stripped off ?  To<lb break="no"/>day the Northwest has no representative in 
                  <lb/>
               the cabinet. To-day I cannot say that the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest has any friend in the cabinet. 
                  <lb/>
               You are not legislating here for the province 
                  <lb/>
               of Nova Scotia, you are not legislating here 
                  <lb/>
               for the province of Prince Edward Island, 
                  <lb/>
               you are not legislating here for the province 
                  <lb/>
               of New Brunswick, of Quebec, of Ontario or 
                  <lb/>
               of British Columbia. Only in a general 
                  <lb/>
               way are you legislating for these provinces, 
                  <lb/>
               and in this particular Bill that general way 
                  <lb/>
               is a very small way indeed. Thus we, the 
                  <lb/>
               representative of these other provinces, are 
                  <lb/>
               legislating for a great people now and an im<lb break="no"/>mensely greater people hereafter, laying 
                  <lb/>
               down a hard granite mould, outside of 
                  <lb/>
               which they cannot step or run in their great 
                  <lb/>
               growing life for all the years that are to 
                  <lb/>
               come. Yet these gentlemen who stood up in 
                  <lb/>
               1896 to demand provincial rights, who stood 
                  <lb/>
               up in 1896 in strong demand that the people 
                  <lb/>
               in the country for which that legislation 
                  <lb/>
               was demanded were the people whose 
                  <lb/>
               wishes and will were to be found out—these 
                  <lb/>
               people to-day rush into legislation without 
                  <lb/>
               consulting the accredited representative of 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest, who, I do not think, have 
                  <lb/>
               a single friend in the cabinet. Why should 
                  <lb/>
               I think they have not a single friend in the 
                  <lb/>
               cabinet ? Who is a friend ? The hon. Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior had his convictions. He 
                  <lb/>
               made them known. The right hon. First 
                  <lb/>
               Minister knew them. But there were other 
                  <lb/>
               men who said they had convictions. The 
                  <lb/>
               hon. minister who sits alongside my right 
                  <lb/>
               hon. friend, the Postmaster General (Sir 
                  <lb/>
               William Mulock), said in 1896 that he had 
                  <lb/>
               
           <cb/>

               convictions. They were as strong as those 
                  <lb/>
               that were held by the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior. That hon. minister has been in the 
                  <lb/>
               cabinet. He has seen his brother minister 
                  <lb/>
               who had convictions leave it for these con<lb break="no"/>victions. He himself has subscribed to the 
                  <lb/>
               clause which has made it necessary for his 
                  <lb/>
               brother minister, the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, to leave the cabinet. Can we count 
                  <lb/>
               upon the hon. Postmaster General as a 
                  <lb/>
               friend of the Northwest Territories ? We 
                  <lb/>
               have got to say this, that the hon. Postmas<lb break="no"/>ter General agreed with the legislation, 
                  <lb/>
               helped to frame it, stands by it, let his con<lb break="no"/>victions of the past be what they may have 
                  <lb/>
               been. We know the hon. Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral to be a man who has ideals when they 
                  <lb/>
               are pleasant, who has ideals, and high ones, 
                  <lb/>
               when he is aiming for power, but who for<lb break="no"/>gets to practise them when once he gets 
                  <lb/>
               into power. What have we to-day ?  My 
                  <lb/>
               right hon. friend has declared before this 
                  <lb/>
               House that he does not propose to take into 
                  <lb/>
               consideration at present the nomination of 
                  <lb/>
               a minister of the Northwest Territories. 
                  <lb/>
               How long are we going to sit in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment without having a minister for the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest Territories, without having the 
                  <lb/>
               cabinet filled up ? The hon. Postmaster 
                  <lb/>
               General had ideals at one time. One ideal 
                  <lb/>
               was that you should not keep offices 
                  <lb/>
               dangling before the minds and eyes of re<lb break="no"/>presentatives for fear you might influence 
                  <lb/>
               them corruptly. What a splendid thing to 
                  <lb/>
               keep dangling to-day is the ministership for 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest Territories ? How effective<lb break="no"/>ly my right hon. friend might use it, and 
                  <lb/>
               he knows how to use such things. He used 
                  <lb/>
               them with Mr. Langelier, and all the world 
                  <lb/>
               knows it. He has been using them ever 
                  <lb/>
               since, and all Canada knows it. How nice 
                  <lb/>
               it is to see him now holding this Minister<lb break="no"/>ship of the Interior up before the gaze of 
                  <lb/>
               all the members from the Northwest, as 
                  <lb/>
               much as to say—and it is not necessary for 
                  <lb/>
               the right hon. First Minister to say it in 
                  <lb/>
               words—behold the beautiful thing ! See the 
                  <lb/>
               patronage and power that are attached to 
                  <lb/>
               it! Look at the splendour which crowns 
                  <lb/>
               it ! It is for one of you, which one I do not 
                  <lb/>
               say ;  but it is certainly not going to the 
                  <lb/>
               chap who does not stand by me. Yet the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. Postmaster General, who made a long 
                  <lb/>
               crusade against that kind of thing at a 
                  <lb/>
               period when he had ideals, helps to forward 
                  <lb/>
               the same gross and material conception as 
                  <lb/>
               an aid to twentieth century statesmanship.

               Where is the Minister of Finance ? He 
                  <lb/>
               too was a brother of the Minister of the 
                  <lb/>
               Interior in these good old days when they 
                  <lb/>
               were straining for power and when it was 
                  <lb/>
               popular to advocate provincial rights. Can 
                  <lb/>
               any stronger statements be made by any<lb break="no"/>body than were made by the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Finance ? Is that the reason why the Bill 
                  <lb/>
               should have been brought down before the 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Finance got here ? Any way 
                  <lb/>
               the Bill is down and the education clause is 
                  <lb/>
               in it. Is the Minister of Finance a friend

               of the Minister of the Interior ? Their opi<lb break="no"/>nions were the same, their convictions were 
                  <lb/>
               the same, one has stood by his convictions 
                  <lb/>
               and gone out—the other, where oh where is 
                  <lb/>
               he ? It is said that he may go out ; well, he 
                  <lb/>
               may go out. And there is the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Customs, not in his seat of course, but 
                  <lb/>
               the Minister of Customs has a record on 
                  <lb/>
               this very question. In what thundering 
                  <lb/>
               tones in 1892 and 1896 and years inclusive, 
                  <lb/>
               did he pulverize these Tories who were 
                  <lb/>
               against provincial rights. Where is he to<lb break="no"/>day ? Is he a friend of the Northwest, or 
                  <lb/>
               does he believe in the school clause as it is, 
                  <lb/>
               and has he been one of those who has fa<lb break="no"/>voured it and brought it down, and so 
                  <lb/>
               must stand by it. And the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Militia ; his record has been read. The 
                  <lb/>
               statements he made in 1896 were as strong 
                  <lb/>
               as ginger ; were stronger in fact. Does he 
                  <lb/>
               too acquiesce ? Now, there is the govern<lb break="no"/>ment for you, with all its pretenses stripped, 
                  <lb/>
               with its professions of 1896 absolutely re<lb break="no"/>versed, flinging to the winds anything 
                  <lb/>
               smacking of the democratic idea of con<lb break="no"/>sulting the people whose interests are at 
                  <lb/>
               stake. And, like the autocratic Czar of 
                  <lb/>
               Russia, the Prime Minister rushing his Bill 
                  <lb/>
               in before his ministers can get together to 
                  <lb/>
               consult him, declaring the Bill to embody his 
                  <lb/>
               doctrine and the doctrine on which he is 
                  <lb/>
               bound to stand. What is the weakness of 
                  <lb/>
               the Czar of Russia to-day ? It is because 
                  <lb/>
               he does not consult the people ; it is worse 
                  <lb/>
               than that : it is because while not consult<lb break="no"/>ing the people he consults only the Grand 
                  <lb/>
               Dukes. The Prime Minister of Canada is in 
                  <lb/>
               the same position to-day. The people, are 
                  <lb/>
               the 500,000, out in the west for whom he 
                  <lb/>
               legislates. Who are the grand dukes ? We 
                  <lb/>
               know right well whom he has not con<lb break="no"/>sulted, but do we know whom he has con<lb break="no"/>sulted if there has been any consulting. I 
                  <lb/>
               am bound to say that if anybody is to be 
                  <lb/>
               consulted it is the members of this House 
                  <lb/>
               primarily, and it is essentially the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people of the great North<lb break="no"/>west for whom we are legislating in this 
                  <lb/>
               matter. When my friend the leader of the 
                  <lb/>
               opposition put his question and put his case 
                  <lb/>
               today, every man in this House noticed 
                  <lb/>
               how he was answered. The question was : 
                  <lb/>
               Why so much haste to get the Bill down 
                  <lb/>
               two days before two of his most responsible 
                  <lb/>
               ministers could arrive here, when three 
                  <lb/>
               weeks have since elapsed without a step 
                  <lb/>
               in advance ? That was a fair honest ques<lb break="no"/>tion. What was the answer the right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman gave ? Did he himself believe <lb/>in that answer ? Did any man who heard 
                  <lb/>
               him believe in it ? He tried to make it ap<lb break="no"/>pear that this delay was all due to the fact 
                  <lb/>
               that my hon. friend from Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
                  <lb/>
               asked him not to be in too great a hurry to 
                  <lb/>
               bring on the second reading of the Bill. I 
                  <lb/>
               ask the right hon. gentleman now: Is that 
                  <lb/>
               the reason of this delay of three weeks ? 
                  <lb/>
               The right hon. gentleman knew it was not 
                  <lb/>
              <cb/>

<!-- Mr. FOSTER. -->
                  
               the reason when he stated it, and why 
                  <lb/>
               then make that answer ? If that was sim<lb break="no"/>ply the reason, why all this travelling to 
                  <lb/>
               and fro by the ministers for the last three 
                  <lb/>
               weeks ; why these frequent consultations ; 
                  <lb/>
               why this disruption in the cabinet ; why 
                  <lb/>
               the rumour of other ruptures; why this 
                  <lb/>
               government reduced to utter incapacity for 
                  <lb/>
               three weeks ? Is it all because the member <lb/>for Grey asked the Prime Minister to 
                  <lb/>
               postpone the second reading ? My right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend may take credit to himself for hav<lb break="no"/>ing dodged the question, but he cannot 
                  <lb/>
               take credit for having answered it. What 
                  <lb/>
               reply has the Prime Minister to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion put to him as to whether he thought 
                  <lb/>
               it right to go on in this matter in the 
                  <lb/>
               absence of any accredited representative 
                  <lb/>
               from the Northwest Territories. Has he 
                  <lb/>
               given any answer ? There is none. I call 
                  <lb/>
               the attention of the Prime Minister to the 
                  <lb/>
               fact that this is all the worse because there 
                  <lb/>
               are now two departments of government 
                  <lb/>
               which are in hypothec, so to speak ; they 
                  <lb/>
               are not being carried on by men respon<lb break="no"/>sible to this House. One is under the 
                  <lb/>
               nominal headship of my old friend Sir 
                  <lb/>
               Richard Cartwright, but Sir Richard Cart<lb break="no"/>wright is in another House, and the deputy 
                  <lb/>
               minister is not physically able to transact 
                  <lb/>
               the business. That is not a live depart<lb break="no"/>ment, and we only needed to have the ex<lb break="no"/>hibition of the Minister of Customs trying 
                  <lb/>
               to put through its simple estimates to tell 
                  <lb/>
               us how little anybody else know about that 
                  <lb/>
               department. There is the Department of 
                  <lb/>
               Public Works not under a responsible head. 
                  <lb/>
               I sympathize as much as any one can with 
                  <lb/>
               the cause that prevents our friend the min<lb break="no"/>ister from being in this House, but the 
                  <lb/>
               business of this country must go on, and 
                  <lb/>
               sickness, and death, cannot always be 
                  <lb/>
               pleaded as an excuse for the public busi<lb break="no"/>ness not going one. It is high time that 
                  <lb/>
               there should be a responsible minister in 
                  <lb/>
               this House in charge of the Public Works. 
                  <lb/>
               I believe it is nominally under my hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend from London (Mr. Hyman). Will not 
                  <lb/>
               the Prime Minister now do a good turn to 
                  <lb/>
               the hon. member from London, and do a 
                  <lb/>
               good turn to the public service, by accepting 
                  <lb/>
               the resignation of the Minister of Public 
                  <lb/>
               Works at once and giving a chance to my 
                  <lb/>
               hon. friend (Mr. Hyman) to go back to his 
                  <lb/>
               old constituency and get the endorsation of 
                  <lb/>

               run where he ran before.

               Mr. FOSTER. Only twenty ; but this

               Bill which has been brought down in such 
                  <lb/>
               a hurry is of such sterling quality and 
                  <lb/>
               commends itself so strongly to the elect<lb break="no"/>orate of the west, that it would be a strong 
                  <lb/>
               factor in favour of the member of London 
                  <lb/>
               if the constituency were opened now. My 
                  <lb/>
               hon. friend (Mr. Hyman) will not be doing 
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
               of the people of London. The portfolio of 
                  <lb/>
               the Interior is vacant. To-night in this city, 
                  <lb/>
               there are two or three hundred men from 
                  <lb/>
               all parts of the Dominion, and especially 
                  <lb/>
               from the great Northwest, who are down 
                  <lb/>
               here to do business with the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               the Interior, and very important business 
                  <lb/>
               at that. Can they do it ? No, it is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely impossible. Even this House has not 
                  <lb/>
               been able to do anything in connection with 
                  <lb/>
               the Interior Department for the last three, 
                  <lb/>
               or four, or five weeks. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman says he is trying to administer the 
                  <lb/>
               department. He may be trying to do it, 
                  <lb/>
               but he will not think I am saying anything 
                  <lb/>
               out of the way when I say that he is not 
                  <lb/>
               doing it, and it is practically impossible for 
                  <lb/>
               him to do it. It is a very large department, 
                  <lb/>
               with great ramifications. The right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman has all he can do without trying 
                  <lb/>
               to master the details of that department. It <lb/>is impossible for him to do it ; he cannot 
                  <lb/>
               undertake it and he cannot overtake it. Why 
                  <lb/>
               should not my right hon. friend appoint 
                  <lb/>
               his Minister of the Interior and let him go 
                  <lb/>
               to his constituency and come back here as 
                  <lb/>
               soon as possible in order that the business 
                  <lb/>
               of this country may go on ? It will not 
                  <lb/>
               take long, and it will serve another very 
                  <lb/>
               useful purpose, the purpose, namely, of 
                  <lb/>
               testing the feeling of the Northwest itself 
                  <lb/>
               upon the measure which my right hon.

               Mr. FOSTER. I do not think he will ; 
                  <lb/>
               but I think he ought to do it in the interest 
                  <lb/>
               of good government and also in the in<lb break="no"/>terest of a full and free expression, in the 
                  <lb/>
               only way in which it can be given, of the 
                  <lb/>
               people of the Northwest in regard to the 
                  <lb/>
               measure which he has brought down. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               My right hon. friend accused the leader 
                  <lb/>
               of the opposition of treating this subject 
                  <lb/>
               lightly. Well, I must say that I bent for<lb break="no"/>ward quickly in my seat when I heard that 
                  <lb/>
               expression, to make sure that it was the ex<lb break="no"/>pression actually used. If the treatment 
                  <lb/>
               of my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
                  <lb/>
               was light treatment, what does the right. hon 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman think of his own treatment? 
                  <lb/>
               If the earnest, honest, straightforward way 
                  <lb/>
               which my hon. friend beside me took to put 
                  <lb/>
               his question and to ask for explanations was 
                  <lb/>
               light treatment, what was the tone adopted 
                  <lb/>
               and the arguments used by the right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman himself ? Surely my right hon.<lb/>friend must have been laughing inside of 
                  <lb/>
               himself when he made that statement. Does 
                  <lb/>
               not my right hon. friend see this? He took 
                  <lb/>
               his own method of getting his information; 
                  <lb/>
               he took his own time to consult the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of his government―those whom he <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>chose to consult ; he took his own leisure<lb/>
            <cb/>

        
               to frame a measure that should be ade<lb break="no"/>quate ; and so sure was he that it was 
                  <lb/>
               adequate that he could not wait until the 
                  <lb/>
               second reading to make his argument, but 
                  <lb/>
               made it on the introduction of the Bill. 
                  <lb/>
               However, he had taken his ground, and was 
                  <lb/>
               determined to stand to it—that was the 
                  <lb/>
               position of my hon. friend when he intro<lb break="no"/>duced this Bill three weeks ago. Now he 
                  <lb/>
               says that even his government is not above 
                  <lb/>
               making changes if they are necessary, study<lb break="no"/>ing the people and the expression of their 
                  <lb/>
               feelings, and trying to meet them if they 
                  <lb/>
               possibly can. Should not that have been 
                  <lb/>
               done before ? The right hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               spoke of the gravity of the question. It is 
                  <lb/>
               a grave question. I do not think we are go<lb break="no"/>ing to discuss this question, whenever it does 
                  <lb/>
               come before us, in any other than an open, 
                  <lb/>
               honest and straightforward manner, on its 
                  <lb/>
               merits. The merits of separate schools are <lb/>not involved in this Bill. It is a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional question, pure and simple, as it seems 
                  <lb/>
               to me. If we differ upon it, we will differ 
                  <lb/>
               as gentlemen differ, not reproaching each 
                  <lb/>
               other for differences of creed or race.  
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
                  
         
            
            <p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
                  
         
            
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. Hon. gentlemen do not 
                  <lb/>
               wish to do that. They are opposed to such 
                  <lb/>
               a course as that. Very well ; they can 
                  <lb/>
               have their way. If they wish the other way, 
                  <lb/>
               they can have it ; but if they do wish it, 
                  <lb/>
               upon themselves will be the responsibility, 
                  <lb/>
               that is all ; and there is this further to be 
                  <lb/>
               said, that although no man knew better 
                  <lb/>
               than my right hon. friend the danger of ex<lb break="no"/>plosion, the closeness and nearness with 
                  <lb/>
               which opinions on creed and race are held, 
                  <lb/>
               and the danger that whenever you touch 
                  <lb/>
               them you will have harsh expressions, which 
                  <lb/>
               will grate upon opposing ears—although no <lb/>man knew better than my right hon friend, 
                  <lb/>
               for he has been through these from con<lb break="no"/>federation up, yet, when it was not called 
                  <lb/>
               for, when he himself disowned it in the 
                  <lb/>
               first part of his speech, he forgot himself 
                  <lb/>
               in the latter part and raised the question 
                  <lb/>
               pure and simple of public schools as opposed 
                  <lb/>
               to separate schools. Now, if in the heat of 
                  <lb/>
               debate some harsh expression is used, you 
                  <lb/>
               will probably find the right hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               and some of his followers saying : Oh, you 
                  <lb/>
               are raising the sectarian discussion. The<lb/>sectarian discussion has been raised by my<lb/>right hon. friend. He has challenged the 
                  <lb/>
               public school system of this country and of 
                  <lb/>
               this continent. He did it gratuitously ; it 
                  <lb/>
               was absolutely unnecessary ; although in 
                  <lb/>
               the first part of his speech he declared that 
                  <lb/>
               he was not going to do it. Therefore if 
                  <lb/>
               there is any sinner, it is my right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend ; and if there be further sinners, so 
                  <lb/>
               far as I am concerned, they will be gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side of the House, and not 
                  <lb/>
               myself at least, nor, I believe, gentlemen on 
                  <lb/>
               this side of the House. Autonomy is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion which was bound to come up. No human 
                  <lb/>
  
            <pb n="2567" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2567.jpg"/>

               foresight could, I suppose, have prevented it. 
                  <lb/>
               New provinces had to be created, and when 
                  <lb/>
               they were created the question of their edu<lb break="no"/>cational rights would have to come up; <lb/>Statesmanship does not cower before a pro<lb break="no"/>blem of that kind. It meets it in a bold 
                  <lb/>
               and statesmanlike way. We who repre<lb break="no"/>sent the people of different creeds and races 
                  <lb/>
               have to meet it in this House, and whilst 
                  <lb/>
               we have our opinions and hold them strong<lb break="no"/>ly and express them boldly, we will not, I 
                  <lb/>
               hope, offend even the most sensitive of those 
                  <lb/>
               who do not agree with us on questions of 
                  <lb/>
               creed or race. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to carry 
                  <lb/>
               this further to-night. I am going to reiter<lb break="no"/>ate what I think the right hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               ought to take into consideration. He ought 
                  <lb/>
               to fill up his vacant or dormant cabinet posi<lb break="no"/>tions, especially the one in which is needed 
                  <lb/>
               a representative of the Northwest people, 
                  <lb/>
               whose interests are being legislated upon; 
                  <lb/>
               and I hope the right hon. gentleman will 
                  <lb/>
               revise the statement which he made a few 
                  <lb/>
               days ago, that he does not propose to give 
                  <lb/>
               his attention to that matter at the present 
                  <lb/>
               time. I think it ought to be done ; we on 
                  <lb/>
               this side of the House think it ought to be 
                  <lb/>
               done ; I believe the people of the great 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest think it ought to be done. De<lb break="no"/>prived of their own champion and repre<lb break="no"/>sentative in this matter, they do at least 
                  <lb/>
               ask the government of the day to give them 
                  <lb/>
               another representative through whom they 
                  <lb/>
               can voice their opinions. It is not enough to 
                  <lb/>
               say to that great country and the million 
                  <lb/>
               of people who are there : Give your views 
                  <lb/>
               to us, and we will take them into consider<lb break="no"/>ation. Everybody knows that even a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative cannot go where a minister goes. 
                  <lb/>
               The formative process is in the cabinet itself, 
                  <lb/>
               and it is difficult to decide upon what is 
                  <lb/>
               not formulated in the cabinet. Therefore 
                  <lb/>
               I say the west needs its representative, 
                  <lb/>
               needs its champion. How inadequate was 
                  <lb/>
               the argument of my right hon. friend that 
                  <lb/>
               there was no objection to any part of this 
                  <lb/>
               Bill but one clause. Suppose we take that 
                  <lb/>
               for granted, will not my right hon. friend 
                  <lb/>
               admit that that one clause is the great clause 
                  <lb/>
               for this whole Dominion as well as for the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest ? If public opinion centres, with 
                  <lb/>
               unerring aim and unerring sense of right, 
                  <lb/>
               upon the one great essential clause, is that 
                  <lb/>
               an argument for saying that all the rest of 
                  <lb/>
               a multiplicity of enactments are satisfactory 
                  <lb/>
               and find no dissentients in the Northwest 
                  <lb/>
               or anywhere else in this country ? It is 
                  <lb/>
               simply that this one overshadows the others, 
                  <lb/>
               but that there are others my right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend knows and he will know still better 
                  <lb/>
               as this discussion goes on. He will find out 
                  <lb/>
               one thing I think and that is that his fin<lb break="no"/>ancial terms, as he has placed them in this 
                  <lb/>
               Bill, will bring upon him every province in 
                  <lb/>
               this Dominion. Already the mutterings are 
                  <lb/>
               in that direction, already the tendency is 
                  <lb/>
               clearly discernible. Take it on any ground 
                  <lb/>
               
      
            <!--<p>
               Mr. FOSTER. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
            
         
 
               you like and by the proportions which you 
                  <lb/>
               have meted out to the Northwest and you 
                  <lb/>
               have gone beyond the financial conditions 
                  <lb/>
               of every other province of this Dominion. 
                  <lb/>
               That is why the Minister of Finance, I think, 
                  <lb/>
               should have been here and should have been 
                  <lb/>
               considered when this Bill was in prepara<lb break="no"/>tion. But my right hon. friend will find 
                  <lb/>
               that there are other clauses besides the edu<lb break="no"/>cational clause which will be brought up. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Now what has the right hon. gentleman

               told us ? He gave us the wonderful infor<lb break="no"/>mation the other day that amendments are 
                  <lb/>
               very often made to Bills and that they are 
                  <lb/>
               very often made as the Bills go through 
                  <lb/>
               committee. He did not say whether he was 
                  <lb/>
               going to amend the Bill or not. To-day he 
                  <lb/>
               rather foreshadowed an amendment. The 
                  <lb/>
               right hon. gentleman came out without its 
                  <lb/>
               being necessary or constitutional, three 
                  <lb/>
               weeks, four weeks, five weeks, out of due 
                  <lb/>
               season and ahead of time, burned all his 
                  <lb/>
               bridges behind him and made an impas<lb break="no"/>sioned argument for the four chief points of 
                  <lb/>
               his Bill. He nailed his colours to the mast, 
                  <lb/>
               and he declared that he would have the 
                  <lb/>
               courage once his convistions were formed to 
                  <lb/>
               stand by those convictions. What said he 
                  <lb/>
               in 1895 ?

               Well, Sir, to be wanting in courage is a grave 
                  <lb/>
               charge I admit. But if to make promises and 
                  <lb/>
               not to implement them is courage, if to make 
                  <lb/>
               threats and to quail before their consequences 
                  <lb/>
               is courage, if to be boisterous in language and 
                  <lb/>
               meek in action is courage, if to pass an order 
                  <lb/>
               and refuse to execute it is courage, if to act in 
                  <lb/>
               such a manner as to force your best friends to 
                  <lb/>
               the conviction that you are deceiving them is 
                  <lb/>
               courage, there is a galaxy of courageous men 
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
               a noble thing in itself, but foresight is not to 
                  <lb/>
               be despised either. Foresight is not to be de<lb break="no"/>spised in such a country such as this, with all its 
                  <lb/>
               conflicting elements. My courage is not of the

               kind of courage possessed by hon. gentlemen 
                  <lb/>

               hasty promises and then to ignominiously break 
                  <lb/>
               them. My courage is to speak slowly, but once 
                  <lb/>

               Mr. Speaker, to say that I have no desire

                  <lb/>
               the path on which he has entered. I have 
                  <lb/>
               no desire to do it because I think it would 
                  <lb/>
               entail a useless waste of time in the first

                    place and in the second because I feel I am

               not by any means qualified to tread the 
                  <lb/>
               same path. However I think it proper to 
                  <lb/>
               say that my hon. friend's (Mr. Foster's) allu<lb break="no"/>sion to my friend the right hon. leader of 
                  <lb/>
               the government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) should 
                  <lb/>
               not pass unnoticed and my answer to him 
                  <lb/>
               will be brief, brief because I trust it will 
                  <lb/>
               express the sincere convictions which I 
                  <lb/>
               entertain. My hon. friend (Mr. Foster) has 
                  <lb/>
               spoken of the leader of the government (Sir 
                  <lb/>
               Wilfrid Laurier) as one who has been shorn 
                  <lb/>
               of his feathers ; he has referred to him in 
                  <lb/>
               contemptuous terms as the erring cham<lb break="no"/>pion of provincial rights. Now in the first 
                  <lb/>
               instance let me say that in so far as my hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend's allusion to the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) as one who has 
                  <lb/>
               been shorn of his feathers is concerned, 
                  <lb/>
               our answer to him is this : We have heard 
                  <lb/>
               that statement, not so eloquently put forth 
                  <lb/>
               but put forth very frequently in this House, 
                  <lb/>
               and our answer is to appeal to the verdict 
                  <lb/>
               which the people of this country have given 
                  <lb/>
               in 1896, have given again in 1900 and have 
                  <lb/>
               renewed in the month of November last, 
                  <lb/>
               1904. He has said that the leader of the 
                  <lb/>
               government has lost the respect and the 
                  <lb/>
               confidence of the people of this country. 
                  <lb/>
               I venture to make this statement, Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Speaker, that the leader of the government 
                  <lb/>
               has not lost the respect nor the confidence 
                  <lb/>
               of any man in this country whose respect 
                  <lb/>
               and whose confidence he values. My hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend has gone on, leaving the path marked 
                  <lb/>
               out by the leader of the opposition when he 
                  <lb/>
               began this discussion to-day, to challenge the 
                  <lb/>
               government to appeal to the country at the 
                  <lb/>
               present time so as to see whether or not, 
                  <lb/>
               under existing conditions, the conduct of the 
                  <lb/>
               government in respect to this Northwest 
                  <lb/>
               Territories Bill will be approved of. I say 
                  <lb/>
               Mr. Speaker, and I say it deliberately, and I 
                  <lb/>
               say it with the honest conviction that .my 
                  <lb/>
               hon. friend from Toronto (Mr. Foster) will 
                  <lb/>
               agree with me that designedly gentlemen 
                  <lb/>
               opposite, as representing the Conservative 
                  <lb/>
               party, have appealed to passions, have arous<lb break="no"/>ed prejudices in this country--<lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK—in connection with 
                  <lb/>
               this Bill upon which they expect to rely. 
                  <lb/>
               But they will find that appeal in the present 
                  <lb/>
               time to be nothing more than a broken reed 
                  <lb/>
               as was the case in 1896 when they endea<lb break="no"/>voured to appeal to the passions and preju<lb break="no"/>dices of the Catholics in this country.

                  <lb/>
    
               deliberately and of set purpose appealed to 
                  <lb/>
               the passions of the people. 
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. SPROULE. I ask the ruling of the<lb/>Speaker if the hon. gentleman has not gone<lb/>beyond the bounds ' deliberately and of set 
                  <lb/>
               purpose '. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
  
            <p>
               Mr. SPEAKER. I think that that state<lb break="no"/>ment goes a little beyond the bounds of par<lb break="no"/>liamentary decorum. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>

            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. If that expression 
                  <lb/>
               goes beyond the rules of parliamentary 
                  <lb/>
               etiquette as suggested by the hon. member 
                  <lb/>
               for North Toronto, I will attempt to pare 
                  <lb/>
               it down, and instead of making the state<lb break="no"/>ment I will bring forward the proof. What 
                  <lb/>
               is going on at the present time, in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, Mr. Speaker ? What is being done ? 
                  <lb/>
               Petitions are being circulated emanating 
                  <lb/>
               from the other side, addressed on the one 
                  <lb/>
               hand to the people of Ontario in the hope 
                  <lb/>
               that they may arouse them against this 
                  <lb/>
               Bill on the ground that the privileges of 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest Protestants are being in<lb break="no"/>vaded. And, on the other hand, what have 
                  <lb/>
               we going on ? Petitions emanating from 
                  <lb/>
               the same source addressed to the Catholics 
                  <lb/>

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. Petitions are be<lb break="no"/>ing circulated throughout the province of 
                  <lb/>
               Quebec asking what ? Asking that this

               government should be forced to adopt that 
                  <lb/>
               clause in this Bill that hon gentlemen op<lb break="no"/>posite are asking the people from Ontario

            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. Will my hon. friend (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Fitzpatrick) allow me a word? He said 
                  <lb/>
               he was going to prove it. Does he not 
                  <lb/>
               acknowledge the gravity of the charge ? 
                  <lb/>
               Will he not prove it ? 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. What I for my 
                  <lb/>
               part, would ask is this : The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Fitzpatrick) has said that there 
                  <lb/>
               were petitions to the province of Quebec 
                  <lb/>
               emanating from this side, pointing to my<lb break="no"/>self and to the gentlemen around me, ask<lb break="no"/>ing the Catholics of that province to urge 
                  <lb/>
               the government to pass this Bill. Now, I 
                  <lb/>
               want to tell the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
                  <lb/>

               Mr FITZPATRICK. The statement I 
                  <lb/>
               made was that these petitions were being 
                  <lb/>
               deliberately circulated in the province of 
                  <lb/>
               Quebec. And I make the statement now 
                  <lb/>
               on the authority of a colleague of mine in

               Mr. FlTZPATRICK—that these peti<lb break="no"/>tions are being circulated by one Elie 
                  <lb/>
               Maurault, secretary of the Jacques Cartier 
                  <lb/>

               Mr. R. L BORDEN—if every other state<lb break="no"/>ment that the Minister of Justice has made<lb/>is equally untrue with the one he has just 
                  <lb/>
               made, there is not the slightest truth in<lb/>
           any of those statements.<lb/>

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I am perfectly in

               order I am speaking of that which is 
                  <lb/>
               within my own knowledge. I say the 
                  <lb/>
               Jacques Cartier club did not extend its 
                  <lb/>
               hospitality to me within the last ten days; 
                  <lb/>
               and if the Minister of Justice has no bet<lb break="no"/>ter knowledge of other facts than he has 
                  <lb/>
               in this particular case, he had better defer 
                  <lb/>
               his remarks until he is more fully ac<lb break="no"/>quainted with what he is talking about.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The statement I

               made was that these petitions were being

            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man stated that the club from which eman<lb break="no"/>ated these petitions sent to Quebec had 
                  <lb/>
               extended its hospitality to me within the 
                  <lb/>
               last ten days, meaning to imply, it he 
                  <lb/>
               meant anything, that I had in some way 
                  <lb/>
               some connection with the circulating of 
                  <lb/>
               those petitions. I ask him to make that 
                  <lb/>
               statement good, or, as a gentleman, to 
                  <lb/>
               withdraw it. 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The statement 
                  <lb/>
               that I made was that these petitions were 
                  <lb/>
               being circulated through the agency of 
                  <lb/>
               Mr. Elie Maurault, of the city of Mont<lb break="no"/>real, secretary of the Jacques Cartier club. 
                  <lb/>
               The Jacques Cartier club is a prominent 
                  <lb/>
               Conservative organization in the city of 
                  <lb/>
               Montreal. And, in that connection, I said 
                  <lb/>
               that the leader of the opposition had been 
                  <lb/>
               entertained by the Jacques Cartier club 
                  <lb/>
               within the last ten days. I am now in<lb break="no"/>formed that in the last statement I was 
                  <lb/>
               incorrect, and I now take it back. 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I would like one 
                  <lb/>
               word more;—we might as well thrash these 
                  <lb/>
               things out as we go along. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Fitzpatrick) said that he is 
                  <lb/>
               able to prove that those petitions eman<lb break="no"/>ated from some gentleman on this side of 
                  <lb/>
               the House. I ask him either to withdraw 
                  <lb/>
               that statement or to name in your presence, 
                  <lb/>
               Mr. Speaker, and in the presence of mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, the hon. gentleman on 
                  <lb/>
               this side of the House from whom any 
                  <lb/>
               one of those petitions emanated. 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I want to say for 
                  <lb/>
               the benefit of the leader of the opposition 
                  <lb/>
               that I do not intend to allow him or any 
                  <lb/>
               other member in this House to put words 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man said every word of it.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. And it was said

               for a purpose--<lb/>

            <p>   Mr. FITZPATRICK. What I said to<lb break="no"/>night was said for a purpose, and said de<lb break="no"/>liberately—― 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. And untruthfully. 
                  <lb/></p>

<p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. Order. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I do not think the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. Fos<lb break="no"/>ter) ought to say 'untruthfully.' 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. Let me explain. 
                  <lb/></p>

<p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. I ask my hon. friend 
                  <lb/>
               (Mr. Fitzpatrick) if he will allow me to 
                  <lb/>
               explain. If ever I heard anything plainly 
                  <lb/>
               and distinctly—and now, if I am wrong, I 
                  <lb/>
               will take it back—it was the statement 
                  <lb/>
               made by the Minister of Justice that these 
                  <lb/>
               petitions emanated from hon. gentlemen 
                  <lb/>
               on this side of the House. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. No, no. 
                  <lb/></p>

<p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. If the hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               did not state that, then, my ears deceived 
                  <lb/>
               me. But, I most certainly, have pretty 
                  <lb/>
               sharp ears. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I do not want to 
                  <lb/>
               get into any altercation with the Minister 
                  <lb/>
               of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick)—― 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I think I am 
                  <lb/>
               showing a great deal of good temper about 
                  <lb/>
               this matter. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man objects—― 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I do not. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN―I will take my 
                  <lb/>
               seat at once. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I do not object. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. This is a personal 
                  <lb/>
               matter, and it seems to me it is better to 
                  <lb/>
               thrash these things out on the spot than 
                  <lb/>
               have any ill-feeling on the matter after<lb break="no"/>wards. I distinctly say, that, so far as my 
                  <lb/>
               ears could gather the words of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, spoken distinctly and with a great 
                  <lb/>
               deal of passion and earnestness, they were 
                  <lb/>
               that these petitions to which he referred, 
                  <lb/>
               and one which he said he held in his hands, 
                  <lb/>
               emanated from this side, and he pointed 
                  <lb/>
               to this side of the House. I ask him to 
                  <lb/>
               name to this House and this country the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. gentleman on this side from whom 
                  <lb/>
               these petitions emanated, or else to with<lb break="no"/>draw the statement. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I did not make 
                  <lb/>
               the statement that the petitions emanated 
                  <lb/>
               from any hon. gentleman on the other side 
                  <lb/>
               of the House. I did make the statement 
                  <lb/>
               that they emanated from the other side--<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            
            <p>
               Mr. LENNOX. The hon. gentleman said 
                  <lb/>
               they emanated from the same source as 
                  <lb/>
               the petitions from the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Fitzpatrick) is pretty badly in—― 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. It is because I am 
                  <lb/>
               so badly in that my hon. friends opposite 
                  <lb/>
               ought to be more generous. It seems to 
                  <lb/>
               me not quite fair that I should have to 
                  <lb/>
               answer four or five at a time. When it is  
                  <lb/>
               realized that I am endeavouring to come 
                  <lb/>
               after the hon. member for North Toronto 
                  <lb/>
               (Mr. Foster) it seems to me that I ought 
                  <lb/>
               to have the sympathy of every member 
                  <lb/>
               of this House. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. You have mine. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I am entitled to the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. gentleman's (Mr. Foster's) sympathy, 
                  <lb/>
               because my task is no easy one. I quite un<lb break="no"/>derstand that. Now, leaving that question 
                  <lb/>
               aside for the moment I want to be precise 
                  <lb/>
               in the position I take, I want to be quite 
                  <lb/>
               sincere about this, for it is a serious mat<lb break="no"/>ter. I hold the Conservative party res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for the fact that two sets of peti<lb break="no"/>tions are being circulated in this country 
                  <lb/>
               at present—one addressed to the people of 
                  <lb/>
               Ontario for the purpose of creating prejudice 
                  <lb/>
               in their minds against this Bill and the 
                  <lb/>
               other addressed to the people of Quebec for 
                  <lb/>
               a like purpose. My hon. friend the member 
                  <lb/>
               for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) charged us 
                  <lb/>
               with not having consulted the people of the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest who are most concerned in this 
                  <lb/>
               Bill. I say, and I say it deliberately, that 
                  <lb/>
               an attempt is being made to prejudice the 
                  <lb/>
               people of Ontario against this Bill. And 
                  <lb/>
               for what reason forsooth ? Because they are 
                  <lb/>
               jealous that a Catholic happens to be con<lb break="no"/>nected with it. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Some hon. MEMBERS. No. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. Read the Toronto 
                  <lb/>
               'Telegram' and you will find the proof 
                  <lb/>
               of what I say. But, Mr. Speaker, it is said 
                  <lb/>
               that this Bill was introduced into this House 
                  <lb/>
               without any previous conference or con<lb break="no"/>sultation with the representatives of the 
                  <lb/>
               people of the Northwest Territories who 
                  <lb/>
               are most concerned. Let me say that every 
                  <lb/>
               line of this Bill was settled after previous 
                  <lb/>
               conference with the people representing the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest Territories, with the single ex<lb break="no"/>ception of the educational clause--<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I rather like to hear 
                  <lb/>
               my hon. friends interrupt me. There must 
                  <lb/>
               be some reason for it. When I rose in fear 
                  <lb/>
               and trembling to follow the Goliath of the

               opposition, I did not expect so much success. 
                  <lb/>
               As far back as 1902, Mr. Speaker, a Bill 
                  <lb/>
               was prepared by the executive of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories in anticipation of that au<lb break="no"/>tonomy which is now about to be granted. 
                  <lb/>
               They prepared for the consideration of this 
                  <lb/>

               government the provisions under which they<lb/>wished to be granted provincial status. That 
                  <lb/>
               Bill has been under consideration since. 
                  <lb/>
               Not only that, but it was in the possession 
                  <lb/>
               of the present member for Brandon (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Sifton) and we had the advantage of his 
                  <lb/>
               notes on that Bill and his consideration of 
                  <lb/>
               it. The only exception was with respect to 
                  <lb/>
               the clause regarding education. Let me 
                  <lb/>
               deal with that, and I want to be precise. In 
                  <lb/>
               so far as that clause is concerned, there is<lb/>no direct reference to it in the Bill as it<lb/>was submitted to us or in the Bill which was 
                  <lb/>
               handed over to me by the hon. member for 
                  <lb/>
               Brandon (Mr. Sifton) previous to his going<lb/>away on his last journey immediately before<lb/>the session. But when that question came 
                  <lb/>
               up for consideration I myself had a con<lb break="no"/>ference with Mr. Haultain, and I want 
                  <lb/>
               now to say that in the statement I am about <lb/>to make I have absolutely and exclusively <lb/>to trust to my recollection of what took 
                  <lb/>
               place in that meeting. I have no notes of 
                  <lb/>
               what occurred, but I feel certain I can put 
                  <lb/>
               almost in terms what passed between us. 
                  <lb/>
               When that Bill was up for consideration it 
                  <lb/>
               was necessary to refer to the educational 
                  <lb/>
               clause ; and on the Thursday preceding 
                  <lb/>
               the day when the Bill was introduced 
                  <lb/>
               Messrs. Bulyea, Haultain, Read and myself 
                  <lb/>
               with two or three other members of the 
                  <lb/>
               government—I forget who they were—dis<lb break="no"/>cussed the measure. Then the question<lb/>arose regarding schools, and I said to Mr.<lb/>Haultain, what are we to do with respect to 
                  <lb/>
               this educational clause ? His answer to me 
                  <lb/>
               was that provision was made for the school<lb/>question, so far as the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies were concerned, by section two of the 
                  <lb/>
               Bill, section two being that section which 
                  <lb/>
               makes applicable to the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories the provisions of the British North 
                  <lb/>
               America Act, section 93 included. My 
                  <lb/>
               answer to that was that in my judgment to 
                  <lb/>
               make the British North America Act ap<lb break="no"/>plicable in these general terms would be 
                  <lb/>
               fruitful of difficulties in the future, and I 
                  <lb/>
               had no desire to have a repetition of the 
                  <lb/>
               Manitoba school controversy. I wanted to 
                  <lb/>
               make the position of the people in the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest with respect to educational mat<lb break="no"/>ters so clear and simple that any man might<lb/>understand the clause when he read it. 
                  <lb/>
               I said that nothing should be left to doubt, <lb/>uncertainty or misconception ; and in so far<lb/>as I am concerned, that clause, in the terms<lb/>in which it is now drafted, was prepared 
                  <lb/>
               merely for the purpose of giving to the 
                  <lb/>
               people of the Northwest Territories those 
                  <lb/>
               things which they now have and it never 
                  <lb/>
               was intended to go one inch beyond that. 
                  <lb/></p>

<p>
               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. What does my hon.<lb/>friend mean by that ? He says the intention<lb/>was to give the precise rights which are<lb/>enjoyed at present. Of course that might<lb/>be susceptible of two meanings, as my hon. 
                  <lb/>
               friend will rightly gather. He knows what 
                  <lb/>
               I mean, and I would ask him to be a little 
                  <lb/>
               more precise. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>

            
          <!--  <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
            
         
  <cb/>
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I do not think that 
                  <lb/>
               this is the proper time to discuss that pro<lb break="no"/>vision of this Bill. When the time comes, 
                  <lb/>
               it will be my duty to explain line by line 
                  <lb/>
               and clause by clause this Bill from begin<lb break="no"/>ning to end, and I shall endeavour to do so 
                  <lb/>
               to the best of my ability. But I think the 
                  <lb/>
               question put by my hon. friend the leader of 
                  <lb/>
               the opposition is a perfectly fair one, and I 
                  <lb/>
               shall answer it as briefly as I can without, 
                  <lb/>
               I trust, breaking to too great an extent 
                  <lb/>
               the rules of the House. In 1875 the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of separate schools was settled so far 
                  <lb/>
               as the Northwest Territories are concerned, 
                  <lb/>
               and so far as it could be settled under the 
                  <lb/>
               provisional legislation of that time. Under 
                  <lb/>
               the Act of 1875 a system of schools was 
                  <lb/>
               created by an ordinance of the Territories ; 
                  <lb/>
               and to that system of schools so created, 
                  <lb/>
               certain pecuniary allowances were made. 
                  <lb/>
               This Bill is intended for no other purpose, 
                  <lb/>
               in so far as I am concerned, than to give 
                  <lb/>
               effect to that provision of the Act of 1875 
                  <lb/>
               and the conditions of the ordinances now in 
                  <lb/>
               force in the Northwest Territories. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               I am quite sure that I have trespassed on 
                  <lb/>
               the attention of the House far beyond the 
                  <lb/>
               limits I originally assigned to myself, but I 
                  <lb/>
               would like to say a word in conclusion. My <lb/>hon. friend the member for North Toronto 
                  <lb/>
               (Mr. Foster) has spoken of the 500,000 peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the Northwest who ought to be con<lb break="no"/>sulted. I have no desire to introduce un<lb break="no"/>necessarily controversial matter, but I ask 
                  <lb/>
               him in all earnestness—and when I do so 
                  <lb/>
               I ask him to remember the speeches he made 
                  <lb/>
               in this House in 1896 which I read then 
                  <lb/>
               and have read only quite recently—I ask 
                  <lb/>
               him in all earnestness ; have we no regard 
                  <lb/>
               to pay in the settlement of that delicate 
                  <lb/>
               question, to the opinion, the honest con<lb break="no"/>victions of over forty per cent of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation of this Dominion ?  I say that there 
                  <lb/>
               are deep seated prejudices being aroused, 
                  <lb/>
               passions being inflamed, and the desire, I 
                  <lb/>
               am quite convinced, of every man in this 
                  <lb/>
               House is that peace should reign supreme 
                  <lb/>
               throughout this land. All I say now, and 
                  <lb/>
               I speak for myself, is that there can be no 
                  <lb/>
               peace except that peace which is based on 
                  <lb/>
               justice ; there can be no peace expect that 
                  <lb/>
               peace which is based on equal rights and 
                  <lb/>
               respect for the honest convictions of every 
                  <lb/>
               man in this country. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. W. H. BENNETT. (East Simcoe). 
                  <lb/>
               Mr. Speaker, the government are at least 
                  <lb/>
               to be congratulated on the fact that at 
                  <lb/>
               last they have found some hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               ready to stand behind them and perhaps it 
                  <lb/>
               may be that there is some truth in the 
                  <lb/>
               rumour that the hon. Minister of Justice 
                  <lb/>
               (Mr. Fitzpatrick) is about to retire from the 
                  <lb/>
               cabinet, and that to-night he is giving a 
                  <lb/>
               parting shot. Be that as it may the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice has appeared as he al<lb break="no"/>ways has done in his favourite role of fan<lb break="no"/>ning and appealing to prejudices. One 
                  <lb/>
               would imagine that the hon. Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               
         
            <pb n="2577" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2577.jpg"/>

               Justice had comported himself throughout 
                  <lb/>
               his lifetime and particularly prior to his 
                  <lb/>
               advent to this House as a perfect har<lb break="no"/>binger of peace, and that he had gone from 
                  <lb/>
               one end of the country to the other in order 
                  <lb/>
               to pacify and alleviate the feelings of those 
                  <lb/>
               who might have been influenced by reli<lb break="no"/>gious prejudices. One would have supposed, 
                  <lb/>
               at least from the strong statements he has 
                  <lb/>
               made to-night, that the hon. Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Justice would be the last man who would 
                  <lb/>
               desire to look back upon the recent history 
                  <lb/>
               of this country. There was a general elec<lb break="no"/>tion in 1896 and it was found by hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite to be a matter of life and 
                  <lb/>
               death. From 1878 down to that time they 
                  <lb/>
               had attempted time and again on different 
                  <lb/>
               issues to achieve office, but always with 
                  <lb/>
               the same result that they had been repulsed 
                  <lb/>
               by the electors. Unfortunately, perhaps, 
                  <lb/>
               for the peace of the country and for the 
                  <lb/>
               peace of the Conservative party, a question 
                  <lb/>
               similar to the present one loomed up on the 
                  <lb/>
               political horizon. The hon. Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Justice went down through the province of 
                  <lb/>
               Quebec and his complaint against the Tup<lb break="no"/>per government on that occasion was that 
                  <lb/>
               the Tupper government had been recreant 
                  <lb/>
               to the cause of the Roman Catholic part of 
                  <lb/>
               the population and he said that if he went 
                  <lb/>
               to Ottawa he would go there—to be a Lib<lb break="no"/>eral ?—No, not a Liberal. To be a Conser<lb break="no"/>vative ?—No, not a Conservative, but that 
                  <lb/>
               if elected he would only support the party 
                  <lb/>
               which would support a Remedial Bill. I 
                  <lb/>
               challenge the hon. minister to-night to deny 
                  <lb/>
               that statement. 
                  <lb/>

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. My hon. friend 
                  <lb/>
               from North Toronto (Mr. Foster) used that 
                  <lb/>
               quotation with very much more force be<lb break="no"/>fore, and I think I can stand a repetition <lb/>by my hon. friend from East Simcoe (Mr. 
                  <lb/>

            </p>
            
         
            
            
            <p>
               Mr. BENNETT. Well, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man may affect that, but I challenge him 
                  <lb/>
               to deny the statement that when he went 
                  <lb/>
               into the province of Quebec and was elected 
                  <lb/>
               for the county of Quebec he did not think 
                  <lb/>
               it was wrong on his part to pledge himself 
                  <lb/>
               to the hilt to the bishop of the diocese, that 
                  <lb/>
               if he was elected to a seat in this House he 
                  <lb/>
               would not be a Conservative, not a Liberal, 
                  <lb/>
               but he would be a Remedial Bill man, first, 
                  <lb/>
               last and always. That was the pledge the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. gentleman made and the pledge upon 
                  <lb/>
               which he was returned by the electors of 
                  <lb/>
               that riding. How did the hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               redeem his pledge ? He came into this 
                  <lb/>
               House, he secured or was appointed to the 
                  <lb/>
               position of Solicitor General, and after the 
                  <lb/>
               pledge that he had made to his party and 
                  <lb/>
               the pledge that he had made to his electors 
                  <lb/>
               that Remedial Bill was thrown to the winds 
                  <lb/>
               and nothing further was heard of it. But,<lb/>the day has come when the hon. gentleman <lb/>has to meet his overdue note. That is what 
                  <lb/>
               it is.  <lb/>The hon. gentleman has found out 
                  <lb/>
               
           <cb/>

               that he cannot hoodwink the people of the 
                  <lb/>
               county of Quebec any longer. Living as 
                  <lb/>
               he is living, not on what should be the 
                  <lb/>
               ground work of statesmanship, but on reli<lb break="no"/>gious fanaticism—and that is what he is liv- <lb/>ing on in the province of Quebec—he finds 
                  <lb/>
               that he is brought face to face with the 
                  <lb/>
               question of this Northwest school Bill and 
                  <lb/>
               he is bound to throw in his lot on the side 
                  <lb/>
               of the church, that is why the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man is to-day posing as the advocate of 
                  <lb/>
               these people in the Northwest Territories. 
                  <lb/>
               But, I tell the hon. Minister of Justice that 
                  <lb/>
               in the province of Ontario and in every 
                  <lb/>
               province of this Dominion there would be 
                  <lb/>
               little religious prejudice were it not for fire 
                  <lb/>
               brands of the stamp of the hon. Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Justice.  
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. SPEAKER. Order. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. It does not make 
                  <lb/>
               any difference. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. SPEAKER. The hon. gentleman (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Bennett) will withdraw that remark, I hope. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            
            <p>
               Mr. BENNETT. No, I am not sure that 
                  <lb/>
               the hon. Minister of Justice has been a flam<lb break="no"/>ing torch in Quebec nor has he been a 
                  <lb/>
               flaming torch perhaps from Quebec on the <lb/>minsterial side because to-day the right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) an<lb break="no"/>nounced that he was going to back down 
                  <lb/>
               from his position. The hon. minister is 
                  <lb/>
               put in this position that after all these 
                  <lb/>
               strong pledges and promises which have 
                  <lb/>
               been given, he and the right hon. Prime 
                  <lb/>
               Minister are to-day endeavouring to cover 
                  <lb/>
               their retreat. I had supposed that the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice would have denied the 
                  <lb/>
               charge that he had made a pledge to sup<lb break="no"/>port a Remedial Bill, but as nothing has 
                  <lb/>
               been denied he stands confessed to the new 
                  <lb/>
               members of the House at least as having<lb/>secured his election in the county of Que<lb break="no"/>bec by making a promise and a pledge to 
                  <lb/>
               the bishop of the diocese and to the electors 
                  <lb/>
               of that riding that if he came here as their 
                  <lb/>
               representative, and that if Sir Wilfrid Lau<lb break="no"/>rier—then plain Mr. Laurier—became pre<lb break="no"/>mier, he, the Minister of Justice, would 
                  <lb/>
               vote against him unless he produced and 
                  <lb/>
               formulated a Remedial Bill. Yet, here the <lb/>hon. Minister of Justice sits, his pledge 
                  <lb/>
               made to the people unredeemed and unful<lb break="no"/>filled, he coutinues in the emoluments of 
                  <lb/>
               his office and being confronted with this 
                  <lb/>
               overdue note he is endeavouring to get even 
                  <lb/>
               with his pledge. The hon. Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice talks about religious prejudice in the 
                  <lb/>
               province of Ontario. Who is stirring up 
                  <lb/>
               religious prejudice in the province of Onta<lb break="no"/>rio to-day ? Who is stirring it up in this 
                  <lb/>
               House to-day ? Not one word is said from 
                  <lb/>
               this side of the House on this question, but, 
                  <lb/>
               when the Bill is introduced one of the sup<lb break="no"/>porters of hon. gentlemen opposite, the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               member for North Simcoe (Mr. L. G. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) rises up on his feet, denounces the 
                  <lb/>

               Bill and tells the right hon. Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter and the government that they shall not 
                  <lb/>
               have his support on this question. What 
                  <lb/>
               attitude has the Toronto 'Globe' taken on 
                  <lb/>
               this question ? What attitude has been 
                  <lb/>
               taken by Mr. Stapleton Caldecott, a gentle<lb break="no"/>man who a little time ago was nominated 
                  <lb/>
               in the city of Toronto as the Liberal can<lb break="no"/>didate, but declined the honour ? It is a 
                  <lb/>
               very doubtful honour to be nominated as a 
                  <lb/>
               Liberal candidate in the city of Toronto. 
                  <lb/>
               And, to go further, Mr. Robinette, the can<lb break="no"/>didate for hon. gentleman opposite in Cen<lb break="no"/>tre Toronto, only a few months ago, has 
                  <lb/>
               denounced the stand taken by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment on this question. Still further, the 
                  <lb/>
               candidate of hon. gentlemen opposite in 
                  <lb/>
               North Toronto, Mayor Urquhart, has also 
                  <lb/>
               denounced the position which the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has taken on this question. The hon. 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice says that the right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               Prime Minister has not lost the respect of 
                  <lb/>
               any of his former supporters. I say to 
                  <lb/>
               hon. gentlemen opposite, let them bring on 
                  <lb/>
               a general election to-day in Ontario and 
                  <lb/>
               throughout the whole Dominion, and they 
                  <lb/>
               will find whether or not he has lost the 
                  <lb/>
               respect and support of the country. What 
                  <lb/>
               an exhibition this government is to-day be<lb break="no"/>fore the people of Canada. Ministers are 
                  <lb/>
               in open mutiny. The hon. Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance (Mr. Fielding), one of the most promi<lb break="no"/>nent members of the cabinet, the gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has been named as the successor 
                  <lb/>
               of the Prime Minister when the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister shall see fit to drop out of his position. 
                  <lb/>
               is insulted. He is on his way to the city, 
                  <lb/>
               but within two or three days of his arrival 
                  <lb/>
               this Bill is brought down without his know<lb break="no"/>ledge, consent or confirmation, and Sir, 
                  <lb/>
               while it was manliness on the part of the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton) to resent the insult, apparently the 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Finance likes to lick the hand 
                  <lb/>
               that smites him. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               As to the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior 
                  <lb/>
               he is to be congratulated on his position 
                  <lb/>
               and on the attitude which he has taken. In<lb break="no"/>sult could not have gone further, and hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentlemen opposite show their pique and 
                  <lb/>
               resentment as soon as an hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               on that side of the House, be he a member 
                  <lb/>
               of the House or Minister of the Crown, turns 
                  <lb/>
               upon them. What is being said to-day of 
                  <lb/>
               the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior ?  Look 
                  <lb/>
               at the newspapers in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. Do they attribute to the hon. ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior the fact that he left<lb/>the government by reason of an honesty of 
                  <lb/>
               purpose and a regard for principle ? Not 
                  <lb/>
               at all, but he is reported as having been 
                  <lb/>
               kicked out of the government by reason of 
                  <lb/>
               scandals which it is said attach to him. 
                  <lb/>
               Why does not the right hon. Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter display a more noble and manly spirit 
                  <lb/>
               towards his late minister ? Why does he 
                  <lb/>
               not stand up in his place and resent the im<lb break="no"/>putations that are being cast upon the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               ex-Minister of the Interior ? Nay more, there 
                  <lb/>
               
     
            
           <!-- <p>

                  <lb/>
               of the House. There is the hon. member <lb/>for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) whose name is 
                  <lb/>
               associated with 'Le Nationaliste.' 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Why does he not rise in his place and im<lb break="no"/>peach the ex-Minister of the Interior for 
                  <lb/>
               wrong-doing in connection with his depart<lb break="no"/>ment ? The fact is that this government is 
                  <lb/>
               all at sixes and sevens, knowing not where 
                  <lb/>
               to turn or what move to make next. And 
                  <lb/>
               as to the ministers from Ontario, with the 
                  <lb/>
               two old men of the sea in the Senate Cham<lb break="no"/>ber and the two chloroformed ministers in 
                  <lb/>
               this House—the Postmaster General and 
                  <lb/>
               the Minister of Customs—both Oslerized be<lb break="no"/>cause they are over 60, what can the Libe<lb break="no"/>rals of Ontario expect from them ? What 
                  <lb/>
               is the hon. member for Centre York (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Campbell) doing on the present occasion ? 
                  <lb/>
               He was at a meeting in his own riding the 
                  <lb/>
               other night, at which the government was 
                  <lb/>
               denounced on all sides, but the member for 
                  <lb/>
               Centre York was afraid either to condemn 
                  <lb/>
               the government or approve of their policy. 
                  <lb/>
               His cry was : Wait, wait ; you will see 
                  <lb/>
               something will happen. To-day we have 
                  <lb/>
               an intimation of what is going to happen. 
                  <lb/>
               I suppose it will be a repetition of the Re<lb break="no"/>medial Bill experience in 1896, of members 
                  <lb/>
               and ministers opposite giving their pledges 
                  <lb/>
               that they are going to do this and that, and 
                  <lb/>
               then doing the other thing. The debates on 
                  <lb/>
               the Manitoba question show that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the Northwest schools was a live 
                  <lb/>
               question in 1896, and although the Minister 
                  <lb/>
               of Justice did not go so far as to pledge his 
                  <lb/>
               word of honour that in the event of a Reme<lb break="no"/>dial Bill not being passed he would oppose 
                  <lb/>
               any administration that might be formed by 
                  <lb/>
               Mr. Laurier ; yet there were other members 
                  <lb/>
               who found their way into this chamber by 
                  <lb/>
               giving pledges that when the question of 
                  <lb/>
               the Northwest schools came up they would 
                  <lb/>
               stand for legislation similar to the remedial 
                  <lb/>
               legislation for Manitoba. There is fear and 
                  <lb/>
               trembling among them to-day. The Solici<lb break="no"/>tor General (Mr. Lemieux) came to parlia<lb break="no"/>ment on one of these pledges. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>

               Mr. LEMIEUX. No. 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. BENNETT. The hon. gentleman did 
                  <lb/>
               not ? 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. BENNETT. Perhaps I had better 
                  <lb/>
               read it. 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. LEMIEUX. Read it.

            <p>
               Mr. BENNETT. I thought perhaps the 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice might invite me to read 
                  <lb/>
               his. 
                  <lb/>

            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I can refer the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman to the four elections I have since 
                  <lb/>
               had in my county. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FOSTER. How did you get in ? 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. In the last two my 
                  <lb/>
               opponent lost his deposit. 
                  <lb/>

                  <p>
         
               Mr. BENNETT. We all know that cer<lb break="no"/>tain influences were at work in the province 
                  <lb/>
               of Quebec in the last election ; there was 
                  <lb/>
               the pledge that there should be separate 
                  <lb/>
               schools in the Northwest, and I have no 
                  <lb/>
               doubt that was worked to the bitter end ; 
                  <lb/>
               quietly no doubt ; much quieter than in the 
                  <lb/>
               case of the Remedial Bill in 1896. Be that 
                  <lb/>
               as it may, here is a cabinet disjointed and 
                  <lb/>
               disrupted, paralyzed before the people of 
                  <lb/>
               Canada for the last three weeks, fighting 
                  <lb/>
               within and fears without, and its supporters 
                  <lb/>
               all muzzled except the hon. member for 
                  <lb/>
               North Simcoe (Mr. Leighton McCarthy), 
                  <lb/>
               whom I congratulate on his bravery in 
                  <lb/>
               standing up in defiance of the government, 
                  <lb/>
               and the hon. member for South Wellington 
                  <lb/>
               (Mr. Guthrie), who has not been seen since. 
                  <lb/>
               My fear is that if any other gentleman on 
                  <lb/>
               that side were to make a similar statement, 
                  <lb/>
               the same fate might attend him. And what 
                  <lb/>
               is the position of the hon. member (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Guthrie) to-day ? Here is the Bill which 
                  <lb/>
               he was to support going to be emasculated, 
                  <lb/>
               nothing to be left of it, and if the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman comes back to the House he will have 
                  <lb/>
               to denounce the government for taking the 
                  <lb/>
               very vitals out of his pet measure. And 
                  <lb/>
               where is the hon. member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Scott) ? He published in the 
                  <lb/>
               newspapers that he was favourable to this 
                  <lb/>
               legislation, but to-night he is as silent as 
                  <lb/>
               the tomb. What a humiliating spectacle! 
                  <lb/>
               Only the Prime Minister to speak, and 
                  <lb/>
               after him the Minister of Justice ; and when 
                  <lb/>
               the Minister of Justice has had his say, it 
                  <lb/>
               is the same parade of the stock in trade that 
                  <lb/>
               brought the Prime Minister to the front in 
                  <lb/>
               the province of Quebec, and on which he 
                  <lb/>
               has been depending ever since, and on which 
                  <lb/>
               he must always depend in order to have a 
                  <lb/>
               political existence in this country. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            
            <p>
               Mr. A. C. BOYCE (West Algoma). If this 
                  <lb/>
               House can congratulate itself that during 
                  <lb/>
               the discussions of this measure inflamma<lb break="n"/>tory addresses have been unknown in the 
                  <lb/>
               past, we have now to regret that such a 
                  <lb/>
               happy condition of affairs has come to an 
                  <lb/>
               end. It has remained for another member 
                  <lb/>
               of the silent ministry to drag in that passion, 
                  <lb/>
               that prejudice and that extreme asperity 
                  <lb/>
               and bitterness which hon. members on this 
                  <lb/>
               side of the House have been most anxious 
                  <lb/>
               to exclude. In reply to the repeated de<lb break="no"/>mands from this side of the House that 
                  <lb/>
               some one should speak for the government, 
                  <lb/>
               the Minister of Justice flew to his feet and 
                  <lb/>
               indulged in the most extreme degree of 
                  <lb/>
               heat and passion. I would remind the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               minister that there is a time to be bitter, as 
                  <lb/>
               there is a time to be tranquil. If, in the 
                  <lb/>
               bitterness of his soul. the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice is forced to rise up and denounce 
                  <lb/>
               the engendering of passion and prejudice 
                  <lb/>
               where passion and prejudice did not exist, 
                  <lb/>
               I must refer him to his leader, the Prime 
                  <lb/>
               Minister, for the ground upon which pas<lb break="no"/>sion and prejudice is fostered. Eating<lb/>dead sea fruit is bitter work, and the bit<lb break="no"/><!--

                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            --><cb/>terness of the eating lies with the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice to-day, and it is made more 
                  <lb/>
               bitter because the bitterness of it is thrust 
                  <lb/>
               down his throat by the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. gentleman has appealed to 
                  <lb/>
               the verdict of the people in 1896. Will he 
                  <lb/>
               stand by the verdict of the people in 1896 ? 
                  <lb/>
               Is he content to take that verdict upon the 
                  <lb/>
               principles involved in this question ? But, 
                  <lb/>
               Sir, it is the verdict of the people of to-day 
                  <lb/>
               that is wanting, and that verdict we have 
                  <lb/>
               not by reason of the fact that this measure 
                  <lb/>
               was not submitted to the people, but was 
                  <lb/>
               kept in the back ground when the govern<lb break="no"/>ment made their appeal at the last general 
                  <lb/>
               election. The Minister of Justice has told 
                  <lb/>
               us that in pursuing the course which he has 
                  <lb/>
               pursued, the Prime Minister has not lost the 
                  <lb/>
               respect of a single person whose respect he 
                  <lb/>
               values. Contrast that with the statement 
                  <lb/>
               of the Prime Minister, who said he accepted 
                  <lb/>
               with sorrow and regret the resignation of 
                  <lb/>
               his Minister of the Interior, and you will 
                  <lb/>
               see in it a direct contradiction of the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of Justice. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               The right hon. gentleman said, in ac<lb break="no"/>cepting the resignation of the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior, on the first day of 
                  <lb/>
               the month, that he had regret in accepting 
                  <lb/>
               it—that there were no causes of difference 
                  <lb/>
               between them beyond the cause of differ<lb break="no"/>ence set forth in the correspondence. Yet, 
                  <lb/>
               the hon. Minister of Justice would have 
                  <lb/>
               this House believe that the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman did not care for the support of the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. Minister of the Interior, and there<lb break="no"/>fore he dismissed him and sent him from 
                  <lb/>
               the cabinet doors. There is a position of 
                  <lb/>
               inconsistency, Sir, which it is hard to re<lb break="no"/>concile. But when we talk of inflamma<lb break="no"/>tory addresses, let us see the extraordinary 
                  <lb/>
               position in which this cabinet finds itself 
                  <lb/>
               to-day. Upon this important question, 
                  <lb/>
               which has occupied more or less off and 
                  <lb/>
               on the attention of this House since the 
                  <lb/>
               21st day of February last, when the Bill 
                  <lb/>
               was introduced by the Prime Minister, 
                  <lb/>
               what intimation have we had from the

                  <lb/>
               have been issued from this side of the

               House, they have not met with any res<lb break="no"/>ponse except from the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has posed as the Czar of this 
                  <lb/>
               measure. Yes, they have. Through these 
                  <lb/>
               weary days of waiting, we have heard 
                  <lb/>
               from the hon. Minister of the Interior, and 
                  <lb/>
               the moment he spoke he condemned the 
                  <lb/>
               measure; and when after further weary 
                  <lb/>

               this side of the House to explain, we

               have at last, at long last, Sir, been favour<lb break="no"/>ed with an expression of opinion by the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. Minister of Justice. Sir, from all 
                  <lb/>
               that rumour has brought to our ears, some

               of us on this side of the House would not 
                  <lb/>
               have been astonished if we had seen the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. Minister of Justice rise to disagree 
                  <lb/>
               with the right hon. gentleman, and to 
                  <lb/>
               state that he was not entirely in accord 
                  <lb/>
               with him; because rumour has been ban<lb break="no"/>dying about strange things lately in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the name of the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice. But that is indicative 
                  <lb/>
               only of the tempest that is raging or the 
                  <lb/>
               fire that is burning within those doors. 
                  <lb/>
               There was a burst out on the 2lst day of 
                  <lb/>
               February, when the Bill was introduced, 
                  <lb/>
               and we have again had a burst out from 
                  <lb/>
               the Minister of Justice in another way. 
                  <lb/>
               But I must refer again to what the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman said, although the hon. member 
                  <lb/>
               for Simcoe has referred to it. The hon. 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice has stated that we 
                  <lb/>
               have appealed to prejudice, that we have 
                  <lb/>
               circulated petitions and have dragged in 
                  <lb/>
               the creedal question. Sir, I have been in 
                  <lb/>
               this House during the whole of this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion since this Bill was introduced, and 
                  <lb/>
               I say that on every occasion on which it has 
                  <lb/>
               been dealt with, it has been dealt with on 
                  <lb/>
               this side irrespective of party, faction, sec<lb break="no"/>tion or creed. There has been no question 
                  <lb/>
               raised upon which that charge could be 
                  <lb/>
               visited upon any member on this side of 
                  <lb/>
               the House. But it has been said that the 
                  <lb/>
               action of bodies or associations of persons, 
                  <lb/>
               and of individual persons who have felt 
                  <lb/>
               themselves aggrieved, and who are exer<lb break="no"/>cising their prerogative in appealing to 
                  <lb/>
               parliament by petition, has been engineered 
                  <lb/>
               and provoked from this side of the House. 
                  <lb/>
               I would ask the Minister of Justice if he 
                  <lb/>
               considers that the action of the Liberal 
                  <lb/>
               papers in Ontario has been engineered by 
                  <lb/>
               gentlemen on that side of the House—whe<lb break="no"/>ther they are responsible for the position 
                  <lb/>
               which the ' Globe ' has taken, and the pa<lb break="no"/>pers which profess independent support of 
                  <lb/>
               hon. gentlemen opposite, in opposition to 
                  <lb/>
               this Bill. Would he like to take one horn 
                  <lb/>
               of the dilemma or both? If we are res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for one, is it too much to say 
                  <lb/>
               that they are responsible for the others ? 
                  <lb/>
               Then, Sir, there is in this measure that 
                  <lb/>
               which has provoked some questions from 
                  <lb/>
               the leader of the opposition to-day ; and, 
                  <lb/>
               without desiring or intending to take the 
                  <lb/>
               time of the House longer than a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments to run over the ground, I would 
                  <lb/>
               just like to point out to you, Sir, the ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary position, chronologically, in 
                  <lb/>
               which this government finds itself to-day, 
                  <lb/>
               face to face with the utterances of the 
                  <lb/>
               Prime Minister himself. On the 21st day 
                  <lb/>
               of February there was transacted here an 
                  <lb/>
               event for which this House had been wait<lb break="no"/>ing for some time. In the speech from 
                  <lb/>
               the Throne we had read that the long-<lb break="yes"/>
               looked-for Bill granting autonomy to the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest Territories was to be brought 
                  <lb/>
               down. Questions were asked in the House 
                  <lb/>
               as to when that might be expected. On 
                  <lb/>
               
          
            
            <!--<p>
               Mr. BOYCE. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
            <cb/>
         
            
           
               the 31st day of January, the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister was asked across the floor of this 
                  <lb/>
               House when the hon. Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior might be expected to return, and the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. member for North Toronto was in<lb break="no"/>formed by the Prime Minister that the 
                  <lb/>
               minister was expected to return on the 
                  <lb/>
               15th day of February. On the 10th day 
                  <lb/>
               of February, as appears by ' Hansard,' the 
                  <lb/>
               question as to the absence of the Minister 
                  <lb/>
               of the Interior and the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance was again repeated by hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on this side of the House, and, in 
                  <lb/>
               conjunction with other business, it is a 
                  <lb/>
               notable circumstance that the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister was asked whether it was his inten<lb break="no"/>tion to introduce this Bill, and he stated 
                  <lb/>
               that the Bill would be introduced, so far 
                  <lb/>
               as he then knew, on the 21st day of Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary; and significant was his remark, 
                  <lb/>
               when asked if the Minister of the Interior 
                  <lb/>
               would be here, that ' the Prime Minister 
                  <lb/>
               would be in his place'. The introduction 
                  <lb/>
               of the Bill took place on the 21st day of 
                  <lb/>
               February. With regard to education, the 
                  <lb/>
               clause which the right hon. gentleman 
                  <lb/>
               says is the only one to which there is op<lb break="no"/>position, the right hon. gentleman, in the

               course of a deliberate speech, says, on

               stated, and the hon. Minister of Justice

                  <lb/>
               in an abstract interrogative form, that 
                  <lb/>
               there was a hesitation on the part of the 
                  <lb/>
               government, because was it not open to 
                  <lb/>
               the government to change this measure if 
                  <lb/>

               consultations, deliberations and a great deal 
                  <lb/>
               of searching of hearts with respect to mat<lb break="no"/>ters then under consideration, and that 
                  <lb/>
               the final decision which was reached was 
                  <lb/>
               then crystallized into that Bill and was 
                  <lb/>
               then explained and argued for by the in<lb break="no"/>troductory speech. Then a change came 
                  <lb/>
               over the spirit of the dream of the right 
                  <lb/>
               hon. gentleman. The Minister of the Inter<lb break="no"/>ior resigned, and there came one of those 
                  <lb/>
               eloquent silences which have prevailed lat<lb break="no"/>terly over the government benches when 
                  <lb/>
               awkward questions from this side of the 
                  <lb/>
               House have been asked. There have been 
                  <lb/>
               silences when questions as to the absence 
                  <lb/>
               of ministers have been asked, and questions 
                  <lb/>
               with regard to the intention to change that 
                  <lb/>
               which the government had said was decided 
                  <lb/>
               upon, and there have been great silences 
                  <lb/>
               to-night and this afternoon with regard to 
                  <lb/>
               the cogent questions which have been asked 
                  <lb/>
               by the leader of the opposition. The right <lb/>hon. gentleman is face to face with a pos<lb break="no"/>ition which is not an enviable one and one 
                  <lb/>
               which he will find it difficult to reconcile 
                  <lb/>
               with what has been said. There has been the 
                  <lb/>
               deliberation which he admits, there has been 
                  <lb/>
               the knowledge of the existence of the fact<lb break="no"/>ional strife, knowledge of the existence 
                  <lb/>
               of that prejudice to which in his speech he 
                  <lb/>
               referred ; there has been the argument and 
                  <lb/>
               the positive assertion that the clause has 
                  <lb/>
               been introduced after mature deliberation ; 
                  <lb/>
               there has been the first reading of the Bill, 
                  <lb/>
               its printing and circulation, and then there 
                  <lb/>
               were rumours with regard to the dissentions 
                  <lb/>
               which exist in the cabinet to-day. The 
                  <lb/>
               House and the country are in the dark, 
                  <lb/>
               are labouring to know what the intentions 
                  <lb/>
               of the government are with regard to this 
                  <lb/>
               important clause in that Bill. I consider, 
                  <lb/>
               Sir, that they are entitled to know because 
                  <lb/>
               if the Prime Minister of this country can 
                  <lb/>
               stand up in his place and pronounce for a 
                  <lb/>
               certain state of things as the result of 
                  <lb/>
               deliberation, and state that that is his dec<lb break="no"/>ision, and that is the law to-day, and then 
                  <lb/>
               afterwards state or hint vaguely that <lb/>changes may take place and will not deny 
                  <lb/>
               the suggestion that there may be a reference 
                  <lb/>
               to a judicial tribunal, then I say the people

               are entitled to know the reason for this 
                  <lb/>
               vaccillation. The position of the government 
                  <lb/>
               upon this question is simply incomprehens<lb break="no"/>ible. It is simply impossible to ascertain 
                  <lb/>
               from its members where it stands. The re<lb break="no"/>cord of ' Hansard ' shows that it stands in 
                  <lb/>
               one place and that it is absolutely, irre<lb break="no"/>vocably or in the words of the hon. member 
                  <lb/>
               for Wellington, unalterably committed to 
                  <lb/>
               one line of policy. Then we have the dark 
                  <lb/>
               hints which have fallen from the lips of the 
                  <lb/>
               Prime Minister, that there might be changes <lb/>—and changes with regard to the very clause 
                  <lb/>
               of this Bill which he states was the subject 
                  <lb/>
               of mature deliberation. There is a point 
                  <lb/>
               with regard to the resignation of the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon, the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior (Hon. Mr. Sifton), to which I would 
                  <lb/>
               like to refer. The hon. minister on that 
                  <lb/>
               day made an explanation of his reasons and 
                  <lb/>
               that explanation is before the House. It 
                  <lb/>
               contains something to which I would in<lb break="no"/>vite the consideration of the House in view 
                  <lb/>
               of the statements made by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister since that time. He says :

               What does that indicate ? Is it not reason<lb break="no"/>able to infer from the very plain utterance <lb/>of the hon. gentleman that he had confer<lb break="no"/>ences with the leader of the government, 
                  <lb/>
               that the result of these conferences was that

               clauses of this Bill were submitted for con<lb break="no"/>sideration that he was leaving on a prolong<lb break="no"/>ed absence and that further consideration,

               further conferences at any rate, as he un<lb break="no"/>derstood, were postponed until he should

               been rightly treated by the leader of the

                  <lb/>
               he had a right to be further consulted be<lb break="no"/>fore that Bill was brought down. And 
                  <lb/>
               very natural was his chagrin and disap<lb break="no"/>pointment when he found on his return that

               the Bill had been introduced with clauses

               to which he had objected. Sir, reference

               has been made by the Prime Minister to the

               record of the election of 1896, when hon.

               opposite of the principle that has been 
                  <lb/>
               lately enunciated by the leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I would point out that the quo<lb break="no"/>tations the right hon. gentleman has given 
                  <lb/>
               from the utterances of hon. George Brown 
                  <lb/>
               will not gloss over the inconsistency he has 
                  <lb/>
               shown or make more tenable the unstable 
                  <lb/>
               position he has taken. The hour is late 
                  <lb/>
               and in conclusion, I would only desire, if the 
                  <lb/>
               right hon. Prime Minister were in his place 
                  <lb/>
               to contrast the position he took in 1895 
                  <lb/>
               and 1896, when he was on this side of the 
                  <lb/>
               House, with the utterance he has recently 
                  <lb/>
               made. I would contrast the inflammatory 
                  <lb/>
               addresses which he then made in this House 
                  <lb/>
               and on the hustings advocating provincial 
                  <lb/>
               rights and non-interference with the acts 
                  <lb/>
               of provincial legislatures, with his present 
                  <lb/>
               speeches. And I would refer the right hon. 
                  <lb/>
               gentleman to the words of the Hon. George 
                  <lb/>
               Brown on the subject of the stability, and 
                  <lb/>
               consistency that ought to be the ornament 
                  <lb/>
               and the crown of the Prime Minister of a 
                  <lb/>
               country of the importance of Canada. In 
                  <lb/>
               1896 the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid 
                  <lb/>
               Laurier) took a certain position in order to 
                  <lb/>
               obtain power. And now, after his third re<lb break="no"/>turn, we have him laying down a policy 
                  <lb/>
               which is the absolute negation of that which 
                  <lb/>
               he contended for in 1896. Let him consider 
                  <lb/>
               the words of Hon. George Brown : 'If, Sir, 
                  <lb/>
               a public man can avow certain principles, 
                  <lb/>
               agitate those principles and seek to over<lb break="no"/>throw the government of the day to estab<lb break="no"/>lish those principles, and, when he obtains 
                  <lb/>
               power laughs at his professions and casts 
                  <lb/>
               his principles to the winds, he is aiming a 
                  <lb/>
               blow at public morality.'

               Mr. A. B. INGRAM (East Elgin). At this 
                  <lb/>
               late hour, I do not intend to take up much 
                  <lb/>
               of the time of the House. But, in view of 
                  <lb/>
               the Bill introduced by the Prime Minister 
                  <lb/>
               on the 21st: of February, in view of the 
                  <lb/>
               large number of inquiries that are being 
                  <lb/>
               made from time to time concerning it, and 
                  <lb/>
               in view of the rumours that are in circula<lb break="no"/>tion, I have not been in a position, up to 
                  <lb/>
               this evening, to give a definite answer to 
                  <lb/>
               those who have asked me whether the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment proposed to carry the Bill through 
                  <lb/>
               the House as it has been introduced or not. 
                  <lb/>
               So, I wish to compliment the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for being so frank 
                  <lb/>
               as he was this evening, for he has stated 
                  <lb/>
               that when he framed this Bill he framed 
                  <lb/>
               it on the line of the legislation already af<lb break="no"/>fecting the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. That being true, I am in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to state exactly what the government 
                  <lb/>
               propose to do in the matter of this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. The Minister of Justice stated that 
                  <lb/>
               there could be no peace except it were based 
                  <lb/>
               on justice. There are a large number of 
                  <lb/>
               people in this country who do not believe 
                  <lb/>
               in the present system in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories being carried out by any law pass<lb break="no"/>ed by the Dominion parliament. I would 
                  <lb/>
               like to ask him whether he believes that

              those who oppose this legislation are doing <lb/>what they ought not to do ? And will he 
                  <lb/>
               say that there shall be no peace in this 
                  <lb/>
               country if his so-called justice is not 
                  <lb/>
               meted out to the people of the Northwest ? 
                  <lb/>
               The Minister of Justice is the man above 
                  <lb/>
               all others in this House who should keep an 
                  <lb/>
               even temper, should calmly consider all 
                  <lb/>
               questions coming before him and should 
                  <lb/>
               be particularly guarded in the remarks he 
                  <lb/>
               makes, for it is to his department that the 
                  <lb/>
               people look for good advice based upon calm<lb break="no"/>ness and judgment. I was sorry therefore, 
                  <lb/>
               to observe, the tone of the hon. gentleman's 
                  <lb/>
               speech to-night. He has charged hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on this side with appealing to preju<lb break="no"/>dice. He was not a member of this House 
                  <lb/>
               in the first session of 1896. Had he been, 
                  <lb/>
               how would he have found his friends oc<lb break="no"/>cupied ? The government of that day, after 
                  <lb/>
               introducing a Bill in this House, were try<lb break="no"/>ing to get it into committee to have it 
                  <lb/>
               considered on its merits. But hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite then on this side, showed 
                  <lb/>
               no willingness to have this carried out. 
                  <lb/>
               They even remained for one hundred and 
                  <lb/>
               twenty-nine hours without rest, keeping this 
                  <lb/>
               House in session, for the purpose of pre<lb break="no"/>venting that Bill being considered by the 
                  <lb/>
               House. And, on the one hand we found 
                  <lb/>
               members in the opposition of that day 
                  <lb/>
               standing up and condemning the govern<lb break="no"/>ment because the Bill went too far. On 
                  <lb/>
               the other hand some condemned it be<lb break="no"/>cause it did not go far enough. Still others 
                  <lb/>
               condemned the financial arrangements as 
                  <lb/>
               unsatisfactory. But, on all sides, they 
                  <lb/>
               were fanning the flames of prejudice, and 
                  <lb/>
               it was through the existence of these pre<lb break="no"/>judices that they came into power in 1896. 
                  <lb/>
               So far as the present opposition is concerned 
                  <lb/>
               nothing of this kind has been done. No 
                  <lb/>
               man on this side, so far as I can learn, 
                  <lb/>
               has expressed his opinion in regard to that 
                  <lb/>
               legislation. They have carefully waited 
                  <lb/>
               to see what the government would do in 
                  <lb/>
               the matter—and rightly so. The leader 
                  <lb/>
               of the government has told us that amend<lb break="no"/>ments may be introduced. But, thank 
                  <lb/>
               goodness, the Minister of Justice, with his 
                  <lb/>
               frankness has stated exactly the position 
                  <lb/>
               the government is in. And, when the First 
                  <lb/>
               Minister proceeds with the second reading 
                  <lb/>
               of the Bill, I have no doubt that the same 
                  <lb/>
               good judgment will be displayed and the 
                  <lb/>
               same calm criticism given by the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, whether they agree or disagree with 
                  <lb/>
               the Bill. Whatever hon. members on this 
                  <lb/>
               side may say will be in parliamentary 
                  <lb/>
               form and will be the result of calm consi<lb break="no"/>deration and not of mere prejudice. The 
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice tried to work up a 
                  <lb/>
               little agitation about the Toronto ' Tel<lb break="no"/>egram. Everybody who knows the 'Tele<lb break="no"/>gram' knows that it is an independent paper 
                  <lb/>
               with Conservative leanings. It is almost 
                  <lb/>
               as likely to condemn the Conservative 
                  <lb/>
               party as to condemn the Liberal party. The 
                  <lb/>
               Conservative party would not hold itself 
                  <lb/>

               responsible for the opinions of the Tor<lb break="no"/>onto 'Telegram.' Reference was made to 
                  <lb/>
               the Bill of 1902 as submitted by Mr. Haul- <lb/>tain. The Minister of Justice did not pay 
                  <lb/>
               much of a compliment to the ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) when he 
                  <lb/>
               said that the draft Bill was submitted to 
                  <lb/>
               the government for its consideration. If that 
                  <lb/>
               statement meant anything at all it meant 
                  <lb/>
               that the draft Bill contained the very 
                  <lb/>
               sections the ex-Minister of the Interior is 
                  <lb/>
               objecting to in the Bill introduced by the 
                  <lb/>
               leader of the House (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). 
                  <lb/>
               I have read that draft Bill and I fail to 
                  <lb/>
               find in it any similarity to the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses in the Bill now introduced. 
                  <lb/>
               That being true, the government could not 
                  <lb/>
               have consulted the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior with respect to these educational 
                  <lb/>
               clauses. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               I wish to say a word or two about these 
                  <lb/>
               gentlemen who resign from the government. 
                  <lb/>
               It seems to me that if a question arises on 
                  <lb/>
               which the difference of opinion between one 
                  <lb/>
               of the ministers and his colleagues is so 
                  <lb/>
               clear that he feels it is his duty to resign, 
                  <lb/>
               then, he is not doing his duty to his con<lb break="no"/>science, or to the people he represents, or 
                  <lb/>
               to the people who agree with him, by sitting 
                  <lb/>
               silently in his place and refraining from 
                  <lb/>
               taking any part in the discussion of that 
                  <lb/>
               question when it comes up. It strikes me 
                  <lb/>
               that if I were in such a connection, I would <lb/>lose no opportunity to make myself heard. <lb/>I would rise day after day and, by my pro<lb break="no"/>tests seek to prevent the passing of the legis<lb break="no"/>lation which seemed to me so far wrong. 
                  <lb/>
               Those hon. gentlemen who have resigned 
                  <lb/>
               from the cabinet seem to think they do their 
                  <lb/>
               duty when they make one speech explaining 
                  <lb/>
               their position. If there are more ministers 
                  <lb/>
               in the cabinet who take the same view, 
                  <lb/>
               it seems to me that, even though they differ 
                  <lb/>
               with their colleagues they might as well 
                  <lb/>
               swallow the objectionable legislation holus 
                  <lb/>
               bolus and remain where they are. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               Now, a word about the petitions and I 
                  <lb/>
               am through. The Minister of Justice (Mr. 
                  <lb/>
               Fitzpatrick) seems to lay great stress upon 
                  <lb/>
               the fact that certain Conservatives sign 
                  <lb/>
               petitions in favour of this legislation. I 
                  <lb/>
               fail to see why any Conservative in the 
                  <lb/>
               province of Quebec, or Nova Scotia, or in the 
                  <lb/>
               Northwest Territories for that matter, if 
                  <lb/>
               he feels that the legislation introduced by 
                  <lb/>
               the government of the day is legislation that 
                  <lb/>
               should be approved, does any wrong by 
                  <lb/>
               petitioning the government in favour of its 
                  <lb/>
               being made law. If the petition is a proper 
                  <lb/>
               one, one that can be fairly presented to 
                  <lb/>
               this House, in what way does a Conservative 
                  <lb/>
               violate good taste or any rule of this House 
                  <lb/>
               when he signs it ? But, what is the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of what the hon. gentleman (Mr. Fitz<lb break="no"/>patrick) has stated ? He remembers quite 
                  <lb/>
               well the conduct of his own friends in 1896 
                  <lb/>
               —his own included—when they did not take 
                  <lb/>
               an honourable stand on the school question. 
                  <lb/>
               They fanned the flame of prejudice, and it 
                  <lb/>
               
            <cb/>

               was only by doing so that they attained 
                  <lb/>
               power. A prominent legal Liberal came to 
                  <lb/>
               this House in 1896 and advised his friends 
                  <lb/>
               here to keep up the work of increasing popu<lb break="no"/>lar prejudice as the only means by which 
                  <lb/>
               they could get into power. And, had it 
                  <lb/>
               not been for their success in that work, they 
                  <lb/>
               would have been in opposition until this 
                  <lb/>
               day. And I say, as a humble member of 
                  <lb/>
               this Conservative opposition, that, I would 
                  <lb/>
               remain in opposition until doomsday rather 
                  <lb/>
               than obtain power by such means. We 
                  <lb/>
               ought to be above that kind of thing, and 
                  <lb/>
               we are. We have here a good country, a 
                  <lb/>
               great country, and our aim, instead of 
                  <lb/>
               stirring contention should be to unite our 
                  <lb/>
               people and, as far as possible to quench 
                  <lb/>
               these dangerous fires of popular prejudice. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. T. S. SPROULE (East Grey). I wish 
                  <lb/>
               merely to refer to one or two statements 
                  <lb/>
               made in the course of this discussion. The 
                  <lb/>
               first was a statement by the Prime Minister 
                  <lb/>
               (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), who spoke of the hon. 
                  <lb/>
               member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) as 
                  <lb/>
               occupying a dual position, and in one capa<lb break="no"/>city stirring up strife in the country, while 
                  <lb/>
               in the other he might be doing his duty as 
                  <lb/>
               a member of this House. That can only 
                  <lb/>
               refer to one thing, to the petitions which 
                  <lb/>
               are coming in and which hon. gentlemen 
                  <lb/>
               opposite have been good enough to attribute 
                  <lb/>
               to myself as having sent them out. I ac<lb break="no"/>cept that ; and I gave the explanation. I 
                  <lb/>
               have never denied or attempted to deny that 
                  <lb/>
               I did it nor do I make any apology for doing 
                  <lb/>
               it. The Minister of Justice followed this up 
                  <lb/>
               by saying that the members of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion were deliberately and of set purpose 
                  <lb/>
               arousing religious prejudices by distributing 
                  <lb/>
               petitions amongst the Protestants of Ontario 
                  <lb/>
               for that purpose while, from the same 
                  <lb/>
               source, they were distributing petitions to 
                  <lb/>
               the people of Quebec to arouse feeling 
                  <lb/>
               amongst them. I took down the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's statement as he made it. Have I re<lb break="no"/>corded it correctly ? 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. FITZPATRICK. If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule) says he took it down, I 
                  <lb/>
               suppose he took it down correctly. But I 
                  <lb/>
               must say that I do not think he did. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Mr. SPROULE. That is the statement as 
                  <lb/>
               I took it down. Had it not been that the  
                  <lb/>
               Minister of Justice displayed so much 
                  <lb/>
               warmth and declared that he could prove 
                  <lb/>
               his statement, while at the same time flour<lb break="no"/>ishing a document as though it contained the 
                  <lb/>
               proof, I would not have paid so much atten<lb break="no"/>tion to his statement. But he made the 
                  <lb/>
               statement that these petitions emanated 
                  <lb/>
               from the same source as the others. And 
                  <lb/>
               just before that he had attributed the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of these petitions in Ontario to 
                  <lb/>
               myself. Had he not thus, by implication at 
                  <lb/>
               least, attributed the distribution of these 
                  <lb/>
               petitions to myself, I would not have paid 
                  <lb/>
               any attention to the matter. If any one in 
                  <lb/>
               this House could know whether his allega<lb break="no"/><pb n="2591" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2591.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">2591</fw>
            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> <fw type="num">2592</fw>tions are correct, it would be the member for 
                  <lb/>
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule), and I rise to give 
                  <lb/>
               that the most emphatic contradiction possi<lb break="no"/>ble. There is not a word of truth in the 
                  <lb/>
               statement. I am not here to deny that peti<lb break="no"/>tions may have come in on the other side 
                  <lb/>
               from the province of Quebec. About that 
                  <lb/>
               I know nothing. The Minister of Justice 
                  <lb/>
               endeavoured to lead this House to believe 
                  <lb/>
               that these petitions were distributed among 
                  <lb/>
               the Protestants of Ontario for the purpose 
                  <lb/>
               of inflaming their passions, but that similar 
                  <lb/>
               petitions were not distributed among the 
                  <lb/>
               Protestants of Quebec. I said last night, 
                  <lb/>
               and I repeat, that the very same peti<lb break="no"/>tions which were distributed in Ontario 
                  <lb/>
               were distributed throughout Quebec, and 
                  <lb/>
               many of them have come back since signed, 
                  <lb/>
               not only by Conservatives, but by Reform<lb break="no"/>ers as well. If petitions did come from the 
                  <lb/>
               supporters of the one party for and against 
                  <lb/>
               a certain measure, does it necessarily follow<lb/>that the members of that party are working<lb/>these petitions for the purpose of raising 
                  <lb/>
               sectional strife ? If it does, then let me 
                  <lb/>
               refer the hon. gentleman to the fact that 
                  <lb/>
               supporters of the government in Ontario are 
                  <lb/>
               petitioning today in hundreds of thousands 
                  <lb/>
               against the very Bill the government has 
                  <lb/>
               before the House, and from the province of 
                  <lb/>
               Quebec as well, and likewise the maritime 
                  <lb/>
               provinces. They are petitioning against 
                  <lb/>
               this Bill, while, at the same time, supporters 
                  <lb/>
               of the government are sending here peti<lb break="no"/>tions in favour of it—doing the very thing 
                  <lb/>
               which the Minister of Justice tried to lead 
                  <lb/>
               this House to believe is so very wrong. Be<lb break="no"/>cause petitions come against this Bill from 
                  <lb/>
               Conservatives and also in favour of it, there<lb break="no"/>fore the Conservatives must be doing some<lb break="no"/>thing that is radically wrong. But the very 
                  <lb/>
               same thing applies to the opposite side. And, 
                  <lb/>
               as my hon. friend from East Elgin has said: 
                  <lb/>
               Is it not the right of every British subject to 
                  <lb/>
               petition the Crown and parliament ? Have 
                  <lb/>
               we not members supporting the Conservative 
                  <lb/>
               party who are to-day supporting this Bill 
                  <lb/>
               and others who are opposing it ? Have we 
                  <lb/>
               not among the members of the Reform party 
                  <lb/>
               some who are petitioning for this Bill and 
                  <lb/>
               others against it ? If that argument is 
                  <lb/>
               worth anything, it applies with equal force 
                  <lb/>
               to the opposite side as well as to this side. 
                  <lb/>
               But, with respect to the petitions that 
                  <lb/>
               have been circulated, the hon. Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Justice made the statement that they were 
                  <lb/>
               deliberately and intentionally put in cir<lb break="no"/>culation to arouse religious strife and pas<lb break="no"/>sion. What justification has be for mak<lb break="no"/>ing that statement? Who is responsible 
                  <lb/>
               for raising the religious strife and passion 
                  <lb/>
               that have been imparted into this debate 
                  <lb/>
               during the present session? Was it the 
                  <lb/>
               Conservative party ?—not by any means. 
                  <lb/>
               Who introduced the Bill? Was it not the 
                  <lb/>
               Reform party? Who made an impassion<lb break="no"/>ed appeal along religious lines? Was it 
                  <lb/>
               not the right hon. Prime Minister on the 
                  <lb/>
               occasion of the introduction of the Bill and 
                  <lb/>


              <!-- Mr. SPROULE. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->

         <cb/>
               was it not a thing most unusual in this 
                  <lb/>
               House? It invited reprisals from the 
                  <lb/>
               other side of the House. I can tell the 
                  <lb/>
               hon. Minister of Justice when he says that 
                  <lb/>
               there will be no peace until it is fought out, 
                  <lb/>
               and he added I throw down the gauntlet and 
                  <lb/>
               I invite this fight to come on. He has thrown 
                  <lb/>
               down the gauntlet and I assure him that he 
                  <lb/>
               will not be disappointed about the fight. 
                  <lb/>
               When it is over he can congratulate himself 
                  <lb/>
               upon what he has done for the purpose of 
                  <lb/>
               promoting peace, harmony and good feeling 
                  <lb/>
               amongst the citizens of this country. If 
                  <lb/>
               he succeeds in doing it I will be very 
                  <lb/>
               much mistaken. He has thrown down the 
                  <lb/>
               gauntlet to a class of people who will 
                  <lb/>
               stand up for their rights whether it pleases 
                  <lb/>
               or displeases the Minister of Justice. There 
                  <lb/>
               is no doubt that from the commencement 
                  <lb/>
               of this discussion, from the first word to 
                  <lb/>
               the last which has been said on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, there has not been displayed so much 
                  <lb/>
               rancour as that which has been exhibited 
                  <lb/>
               by the hon. Minister of Justice, and there 
                  <lb/>
               has not been heard as strong language as 
                  <lb/>
               that which has come from the Minister of 
                  <lb/>
               Justice who ought to be the last man in 
                  <lb/>
               this House to set such an example to the 
                  <lb/>
               parliament of Canada. If this measure re<lb break="no"/>sults in arousing passions and creating 
                  <lb/>
               hard feelings let me assure hon. gentlemen 
                  <lb/>
               opposite that upon them above all others 
                  <lb/>
               must the responsibility rest. 
                  <lb/>
