                  Speaker, before you leave the chair, I wish <lb/> to bring an important question
                  to the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House. I had intended to <lb/> have
                  brought to the attention of the House <lb/> yesterday, the matter which I am about
                  <lb/> to mention, but it was not very con<lb break="no"/>venient for the First
                  Minister (Sir Wilfrid <lb/> Laurier) so I have let the matter stand <lb/> over
                  until to-day. The subject on which <lb/> I wish to speak for a few moments con<lb break="no"/>cerns certain passages in a letter which the <lb/> Prime Minister
                  of the Northwest Territories <lb/> has recently addressed to the right hon. <lb/>
                  gentleman who leads this House (Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier). In proposing
                  to discuss cer<lb break="no"/>tain passages in that letter I do not for one <lb/>
                  moment forget that it is not open for me <lb/> to-day to discuss the measures
                  which the <lb/> letter relates and therefore I am touching <lb/> the letter of Mr.
                  Haultain in so far <lb/> only as it is concerned with the manner and <lb/>
                  circumstances in which and under which <lb/> this Bill was introduced in this
                  House. I <lb/> assume that Mr. Haultain's letter will be <lb/> brought down with
                  any other additional <lb/> correspondence and laid upon the table of <lb/> the
                  House by the government in due <lb/> course. In the meantime, however, it has
                  <lb/> been made public in the press of the coun<lb break="no"/>try and, without
                  going over what I have <lb/> already brought to the attention of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment on two occasions last week, may <lb/> I be permitted at
                  least to say this, that <lb/> the situation which has developed between <lb/>
                  <cb/> the month of October last and the present <lb/> time is certainly a very
                  peculiar one. We <lb/> had this subject, the granting of provincial <lb/> autonomy
                  to the Northwest Territories <lb/> discussed to some extent in the year 1901,
                  <lb/> again in 1902, and again in 1903. On the <lb/> last occasion I moved a
                  formal resolution in <lb/> this House in which after setting out re<lb break="no"/>solutions of the legislature of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to the
                  effect that provin<lb break="no"/>cial status should be granted to these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. I had submitted to the House that <lb/> that request
                  should be taken into immediate <lb/> consideration by the government of this <lb/>
                  country and should be acted upon forthwith. <lb/> I pointed out at that time that
                  even if my <lb/> motion passed, if the government was dis<lb break="no"/>posed at
                  once to accept the suggestion <lb/> which I then made, it would take a <lb/>
                  considerable time to arrange the de<lb break="no"/>tails. It was not a matter, as
                  I admitted, <lb/> to be lightly undertaken or to be disposed <lb/> of in haste,
                  and it was for that reason that <lb/> I urged upon the government the imme<lb break="no"/>diate consideration of the question, in the <lb/> month of October,
                  1903, saying as I did <lb/> at that time, that if the matter were taken <lb/> up
                  by the government at once the <choice>
                     <sic>popula<lb break="no"/>ion</sic>
                     <corr>population</corr>
                  </choice> of the Northwest Territories of Can<lb break="no"/>ada would probably be
                  500,000 before the <lb/> details could be arranged and the measure <lb/> brought
                  down for the consideration of the <lb/> House and of the country. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Not one member of the administration <lb/> made any answer to the motion which I
                  <lb/> brought before the House on that occasion. <lb/> My hon. friend who now
                  represents the con<lb break="no"/>stituency of Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) spoke <lb/>
                  on that motion. He would not support the <lb/> resolution for the granting of
                  provincial <lb/> institutions to the Northwest Territories <lb/> unless he knew
                  exactly the terms upon which <lb/> autonomy would be granted. Let me quote <lb/>
                  his own expressive words : <lb/>

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> I, as a representative of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, do not propose to go into a sort of blind <lb/> pool, not

               </quote>
               <p>And the member for West Assiniboia (Mr. <lb/> Scott) spoke on the same subject.
                  If I re<lb break="no"/>member his attitude correctly, on one occas<lb break="no"/>ion at least, he was not prepared to have <lb/> this matter discussed or even
                  considered <lb/> in the House of Commons unless his leader <lb/> the Minister of
                  the Interior (Mr. Sifton) <lb/> were present for the purpose of guiding the <lb/>
                  discussion, as he thought that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's guidance necessary
                  for the protection <lb/> of the rights of the people of the Northwest <lb/>
                  Territories. No member of the administra<lb break="no"/>tion spoke in answer to
                  the motion. The <lb/> gentlemen to whom I have referred answer<lb break="no"/>ed
                  for the government ; then the division <lb/> was taken, and the members of the

                  the request of the <lb/> people of the Northwest Territories for <lb/> provincial

                  nor acted <lb/>upon in the immediate future. My motion <lb/>demanded that the
                  question should be <lb/>considered and acted upon as promptly <lb/>as
                  circumstances permitted. Parliament <lb/>was dissolved. Then, in the month of
                  <lb/>October, 1904, the Right Hon. Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister (Sir Wilfrid
                  Laurier) suddenly awoke <lb/>to the gravity of the situation in the midst <lb/>of
                  an election campaign. He then, for the <lb/>first time, recollected that letters
                  written to <lb/>him by the Prime Minister of the North<lb break="no"/>west
                  Territories in the month of May <lb/>previous had not been answered ; and, in
                  <lb/>all the stress and hurry of that campaign<lb break="no"/>no doubt, upon
                  advice communicated to him <lb/>by his friends in the Northwest Territories,
                  <lb/>—suddenly he came to the conclusion, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding the
                  arguments put forward on <lb/>his behalf, and indeed by himself in prev<lb break="no"/>ious sessions of parliament, that the matter <lb/>must be taken up
                  without the slightest de<lb break="no"/>lay. So, he wrote to the Prime Minister of
                  <lb/>the Northwest Territories as follows : <lb/>
               </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> You will have learned, prior to the receipt of
                  <lb/> this letter, that parliament has been dissolved. <lb/> The new House of
                  Commons will contain not <lb/> four but ten representatives of the Northwest <lb/>
                  Territories, who, coming fresh from the people, <lb/> will be entitled to speak
                  with confidence as to <lb/> the views and requirements of those whom <lb/> they
                  represent. Should my government be sus<lb break="no"/>tained, we will be prepared,

                  purpose of arriving at a settlement of the <lb/> various questions involved in the
                  granting of <lb/> provincial autonomy, with a view to dealing <lb/> with the
                  question at the next session of par<lb break="no"/>liament. <lb/>
               </quote>
               <p>That was a very much balder proposition, <lb/> I think, than the opposition had
                  presented to <lb/> parliament by motion and by speech in this <lb/> House. We had
                  at least defined our position <lb/> with regard to the lands in the Northwest
                  <lb/> Territories which are owned by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Canada, and
                  we had defined our <lb/> position with regard to the tax exemption <lb/> of lands
                  patented, or about to be patented, <lb/> by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and not
                  <lb/> one of these matters was mentioned by <lb/> the Prime Minister. And,
                  although my <lb/> hon. friend from Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) was <lb/> not willing to
                  enter a 'blind pool' when it <lb/> was proposed by the opposition, I understand
                  <lb/> he gleefully accepted the proposition of the <lb/> government, although in
                  that case the pool <lb/> was very much 'blinder' than that to which <lb/> he had
                  objected. Now, certainly, the terms <lb/> of the government's proposal might
                  properly <lb/> and indeed should properly have been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed
                  before and considered by the people <lb/> of the Northwest Territories in that
                     cam<lb break="no"/>paign. And so the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, my hon. friend from Brandon (Mr. <lb/> Sifton) was asked about the
                  terms. I do <lb/> not know whether he was asked about the <lb/> terms at the
                  instigation of the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from Edmonton or not. The Prime <lb/>

                  <cb/> Minister of the Northwest Territories, who<lb/>
                  <lb/> spoke during the course of that campaign, <lb/>asked the Minister of the
                  Interior of that <lb/>day (Mr. Sifton) to define the terms. The <lb/>request was
                  much along the line which had <lb/>been suggested by the hon. member for Ed<lb break="no"/>monton (Mr. Oliver). No satisfaction was <lb/>given by the hon.

                  answer to the Prime Minister of the <lb/>Northwest Territories, who desired that
                  the <lb/>terms might be discussed during the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of that

                  even suggesting that terms should be <lb/>discussed. Speaking at Regina, about the

               <p>The Prime Minister seems in the end to <lb/> have given my hon. friend from
                  Brandon <lb/> (Mr. Sifton)—if I may use a common expres<lb break="no"/>sion—a dose
                  of his own medicine. For the <lb/> hon. member for Brandon thought that this <lb/>
                  matter should be settled by the government <lb/> without giving any opportunity to
                  the people <lb/> of the Northwest Territories to consider <lb/> the terms of the
                  proposed Bill, and the <lb/> Prime Minister, carrying that idea a little <lb/>
                  farther thought that the matter should be <lb/> discussed and the Bill brought
                  down to <lb/> parliament without giving even the ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of
                  the Interior an opportunity to con<lb break="no"/>sider or even to see it. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>I would remark to my hon. friend from <lb/> Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) that the manner
                  in <lb/> which this Bill was introduced—introduced <lb/> on the eve of the return
                  of the ex-Minister <lb/> of the Interior, who was then still a minister <lb/> (Mr.
                  Sifton) and on the eve of the return of <lb/> the Minister of Finance (Mr.
                     Fielding)<lb break="no"/>affords an excellent specimen of the way in <lb/>
                  which a ' blind pool ' was offered those gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen. Let us revert
                  for one moment to <lb/> the debates of 1902 and to the speech which <lb/> the
                  Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) then <lb/> made with all the authority of a
                  member of <lb/> the administration. The ex-minister spoke <lb/> then for the Prime
                  Minister of this country, <lb/> for his colleague the Minister of Finance, <lb/>
                  and for my hon. friend the Postmaster <lb/> General (Sir William Mulock.) He was
                     en<lb break="no"/>deavouring to show good reason for post<lb break="no"/>poning
                  the introduction and consideration <lb/> of a Bill of this kind, and what did he
                  say : <lb/>

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Last year it was arranged that a discussion <lb/>
                  should take place, and our friends of the terri<lb break="no"/>torial government
                  did urge that it should take <lb/> place earlier. But the Minister of Finance was
                  <lb/> obliged to go to England immediately after the <lb/> session, and a

               <p>I am not reading this as simply the <lb/> language of the Minister of the
                  Interior, but <lb/> as a declaration by the present administra<lb break="no"/>tion, whose mouthpiece that hon. gentleman <lb/> then was, that the
                  consideration of this ques<lb break="no"/>tion could not possibly be proceeded
                  with in <lb/> the absence of these ministers. But to-day, <lb/> not much more than
                  two years later, we find <lb/> the Prime Minister of this country, in the <lb/>
                  absence of his Minister of the Interior and <lb/> his Minister of Finance—the
                  presence of <lb/> both of whom this government had declared <lb/> absolutely
                  necessary in order that this ques<lb break="no"/>tion might be considered and a
                  decision <lb/> arrived at—we find the Prime Minister <lb/> bringing down to the
                  House on the 21st of <lb/> February this important measure in the <lb/> absence of
                  these two ministers. And we <lb/> find further that notwithstanding that ex<lb break="no"/><cb/>traordinary—I might even say, in view of <lb/> all the
                  circumstances, that indecent haste<lb break="no"/>not one single step has since
                  been taken to <lb/> press this Bill through. And when we asked <lb/> the right
                  hon. gentleman why it was that, <lb/> without regard for constitutional usage, in
                  <lb/> absolute contempt of all constitutional pre<lb break="no"/>cedent, he not
                  only did that which I have <lb/> just mentioned but brought this Bill down, <lb/>
                  as the Act of the government and the result <lb/> of the collective wisdom of the
                  government, <lb/> without the assent of his two colleagues,<lb break="no"/>who
                  above all others should have been con<lb break="no"/>sulted—when we ask him why he
                  took that <lb/> extraordinary course, he vouchsafes to the <lb/> House not one
                  word in explanation. I <lb/> ventured to suggest some days ago that it <lb/> was
                  due, not only to the House and the <lb/> country but to the right hon. gentleman
                     him<lb break="no"/>self, that some explanation should be given. <lb/> I am
                  still of that opinion. What was the <lb/> reason, when the Minister of the
                  Interior <lb/> (Mr. Sifton) was expected in Ottawa within <lb/> two days, that
                  this Bill was rushed into <lb/> the House of Commons before his arrival, <lb/>
                  while not one step has been taken to for<lb break="no"/>ward it through any of its
                  stages for three <lb/> weeks afterwards ? Why was it, when the <lb/> Minister of
                  Finance was on his way home <lb/> from England and expected to arrive, as he <lb/>
                  did arrive, in Ottawa within four or five <lb/> days, that the Prime Minister
                  rushed in <lb/> feverish haste to the House with this meas<lb break="no"/>ure, and
                  has not since sought to advance <lb/> it one single stage ? Was it because some
                  <lb/> of the right hon. gentleman's colleagues <lb/> were wavering and he dreaded
                  the result <lb/> of the influence of two such strong members <lb/> of his cabinet
                  as the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior and the Minister of Finance
                  upon <lb/> those who were hesitating to indorse the <lb/> course the right hon.
                  gentleman purposed <lb/> to pursue. Was there any idea in the mind <lb/> of the
                  First Minister that these gentlemen <lb/> might not be so ready to hesitate or to
                  <lb/> retreat once this measure had been brought <lb/> down as a government
                  measure. Was there <lb/> anything of that kind in the mind of the <lb/> right hon.
                  gentleman ? I do not know. I <lb/> cannot tell what was in his mind, but we <lb/>
                  at least are able to conclude that something <lb/> very extraordinary must have
                  impelled him <lb/> to take the course he did. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>But a still more extraordinary condi<lb break="no"/>tion of affairs seems to have
                  existed <lb/> with regard to the representatives of <lb/> the Northwest
                  Territories. The right hon. <lb/> gentleman, when I brought up this matter <lb/>
                  in 1902 and again in 1903, took the ground <lb/> that the Northwest Territories
                  already had a <lb/> very considerable degree of responsible gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They had a legislature of their <lb/> own, a cabinet of their own, and
                  he pointed <lb/> out that with the exception of the right to <lb/> incur debt and
                  one or two other matters, <lb/> they were already invested with the powers <lb/>
                  of responsible government. Well, Sir, the <lb/> ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr.
                  Sifton), in <lb/> the speech to which I alluded a moment <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">2500</fw> ago—a speech delivered at Regina about the <lb/> 19th or
                  20th of March last—told us that <lb/> this Bill must be in the nature of a
                  contract <lb/> between the Northwest Territories and the <lb/> rest of this
                  country—a contract made, as <lb/> the premier of the Northwest Territories has
                  <lb/> pointed out, between the great majority of <lb/> the people of this country
                  and the minority <lb/> who live in the Territories ; an agreement <lb/> to be made
                  between five and one half mil<lb break="no"/>lions of the people of Canada
                  residing in <lb/> the seven existing provinces and the half <lb/> million people
                  who reside in the Northwest <lb/> Territories. These 500,000 people have a <lb/>
                  government. That government was sum<lb break="no"/>moned here to Ottawa for the
                  purpose of <lb/> conferring with a special committee of the <lb/> Privy Council in
                  regard to the terms of this <lb/> measure. It was to be a matter of contract,
                  <lb/> so the ex-Minister of the Interior told us. <lb/> Well, one, would suppose
                  that, under these <lb/> conditions, at least the representatives of the <lb/>
                  Northwest Territories would have been con<lb break="no"/>sulted about all the
                  important provisions of <lb/> this Bill. Does my right hon. friend remem<lb break="no"/>ber how he swelled with indignation in 1896 <lb/> when he charged
                  Sir Charles Tupper across <lb/> the floor of this House with having trampled <lb/>
                  upon the liberties of the people of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia in passing through
                  a moribund legislature <lb/> the resolutions relating to confederation ? <lb/>
                  Does he remember how he advocated the <lb/> rights of the people at that time ?
                  Does he <lb/> forget how he accused Sir Charles Tupper <lb/> of having trampled
                  upon the dignity of a <lb/> proud people who would never forget that <lb/>
                  treatment ? But at least this can be said in <lb/> favour of the measure which Sir
                  Charles <lb/> Tupper caused to be passed at that time, <lb/> that it went before
                  the representatives of <lb/> the people and was considered by them in <lb/>
                  parliament, even if it were a moribund par<lb break="no"/>liament. But, the Prime
                  Minister, if we are <lb/> to believe the statements contained in the <lb/> letter
                  of Mr. Haultain, has seen fit to bring <lb/> down to the parliament of Canada
                  certain <lb/> provisions in this measure without even <lb/> deigning for one
                  moment to consult the <lb/> representatives of the people in those terri<lb break="no"/>tories. We see the constitutional advocate <lb/> of the liberties
                  of the people of ten years <lb/> ago changed into the—may I say—tyrant <lb/> of

               </p>
               <p>Well, I do not know what my right hon. <lb/> friend will make of all this. He did
                  not <lb/> consult the hon. ex-Minister of Interior <lb/> who specially represents
                  the people of the <lb/> Northwest Territories ; he did not consult <lb/> the
                  Minister of Finance who is especially <lb/> concerned with the financial features
                  of <lb/> this Bill ; he did not consult, in so far as <lb/> this part of the
                  measure is concerned, the <lb/> Prime Minister of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and his colleagues. The question <lb/> naturally arises :
                  Whom did he consult ? <lb/> I can only answer that question in one <lb/> way. It
                  seems to me that he must have <lb/> consulted the seven gentlemen from the <lb/>
                  Northwest Territories who are elected as <lb/> Liberals and these provisions are
                  the result <lb/> of their collective and united wisdom. He <lb/> postponed this
                  measure in order that he <lb/> might have the benefit of the wisdom of <lb/> ten
                  gentlemen from the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. He did not get as many
                  as he <lb/> thought he would get ; he got seven and <lb/> I presume that the
                  educational provisions <lb/> of the measure which has been brought <lb/> down are
                  the result of the advice and ass<lb break="no"/>istance of the seven gentlemen who
                  sit on <lb/> that side of the House for the moment. <lb/> Assuming that to be the

                  solely the advice of <lb/> these gentlemen and to seek solely their <lb/>
                  assistance. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>I have no more to say at present. <lb/> I trust that my right hon. friend will
                  <lb/> recede a little from the position which <lb/> he took the other day, and
                  that he will give <lb/> us some reason for the very extraordinary <lb/> course
                  which he has pursued in the intro<lb break="no"/>duction of this Bill, that he
                  will perhaps <lb/> be good enough to advise us, although he <lb/> has not seen fit
                  to do so up to the present <lb/> time, whether or not any amendments to <lb/> the
                  Bill have been under the consideration <lb/> of the government. Whenever I have
                  asked <lb/> that question before, my right hon. friend <lb/> has told me with a
                  great air of wisdom <lb/> that amendments can be made to any Bill. <lb/> Nearly
                  all of us on this side of the House <lb/> were aware of that before the right hon.
                  <lb/> gentleman told us. There may have been <lb/> one or two hon. gentlemen to
                  whom that <lb/> came as a refreshing piece of news, but <lb/> nearly all of us
                  were aware of it before. <lb/> That was not the question I asked. The <lb/>
                  question I asked and to which I have a <lb/> right to get an answer is this : Has
                  the <lb/> government under consideration at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent time any
                  amendments to the Bill <lb/> which was brought down in such extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary haste three weeks ago and in the <lb/> progress of which not one step
                  has been <lb/> taken since ? In addition to that perhaps <lb/> my right hon.
                  friend will be good enough <lb/> to enlighten the House as to the personnel <lb/>
                  of the members of the administration who <lb/> constituted the committee of
                  council which <lb/> was appointed to deal with this question. <lb/> We have
                  nothing official before the House <lb/> in so far as I am aware with regard to it.
                  <lb/> I understand from the documents that my <lb/> right hon. friend was a
                  member, that the <lb/> hon. Postmaster General was a member, <lb/> and I would
                  gather also that my hon. <lb/> friend the Minister of Justice must have <lb/> been
                  a member, because it would be abso<lb break="no"/>lutely indispensable to have the
                  assistance <lb/> of his very great legal ability and experi<lb break="no"/>ence.
                  Were there any other members of <lb/> this sub-committee and if so, who were <lb/>
                  they ? Was there any gentleman specially <lb/> appointed to represent the
                  interests of the <lb/> people of the Northwest Territories ? Was <lb/> there any
                  gentleman appointed to consider <lb/> this question from the standpoint of the
                  <lb/> maritime provinces, because, as the hon. <lb/> ex-Minister of the Interior
                  has well pointed <lb/> out, this is a matter which must be consid<lb break="no"/>ered not only from the standpoint of the <lb/> interests of the people of the
                  Northwest <lb/> Territories but from the standpoint of the <lb/>
                  <cb/> interests of the entire country ? Now this <lb/> would appear not an
                  unreasonable demand, <lb/> and I trust my right hon. friend departing <lb/> in
                  that regard from his practice on the <lb/> last few occasions on which I brought
                  <lb/> this matter to the attention of the House, <lb/> will really on this
                  occasion give the House <lb/> information upon the subjects which I have <lb/>
                  ventured to refer to. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>There has just been placed in my hands a <lb/> copy of a journal which is
                  sometimes sup<lb break="no"/>posed to be in the secrets of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment ; which is sometimes supposed to con<lb break="no"/>tain
                  statements that have an official in<lb break="no"/>spiration. I observe that this
                  journal, quot<lb break="no"/>ing from the Montreal organ of a member <lb/> of the
                  administration, gives currency to a <lb/> rumour that some question or questions
                  in <lb/> connection with this Bill are to be sub<lb break="no"/>mitted for the
                  consideration of the Supreme <lb/> Court. If my right hon. friend's view, ex<lb break="no"/>pressed when he introduced this Bill, is a <lb/> sound one—and I
                  presume it was not taken <lb/> without due consideration—of course it <lb/> would
                  not be necessary to submit any ques<lb break="no"/>tion to the court, but perhaps
                  he may have <lb/> had new light on the subject since he made <lb/> his speech.
                  However that may be, I do re<lb break="no"/>spectfully ask the Prime Minister to
                  give <lb/> the House some information with regard <lb/> to all these matters, and
                  especially to <lb/> inform us why it was that he did not see <lb/> fit to consult
                  these gentlemen from the <lb/> Northwest Territories who were in Ottawa <lb/> at
                  his call and who were supposed to rep<lb break="no"/>resent the voice and the
                  desires of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west. <lb/>

                  Minister). My hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Bor<lb break="no"/>den) has stated that it
                  would have been <lb/> convenient for him to speak on this matter <lb/> yesterday
                  as he had given me notice, and <lb/> that I had asked him to postpone his re<lb break="no"/>marks until this afternoon, because I had <lb/> an engagement after
                  the dinner hour be<lb break="no"/>fore which the question could not have been
                  <lb/> reached. I knew I could appeal to the cour<lb break="no"/>tesy of my hon.
                  friend, because he and I <lb/> have always managed these matters be<lb break="no"/>tween us to our mutual satisfaction. I <lb/> thanked my hon. friend, and I thank
                  him all <lb/> the more because I appreciate that in agree<lb break="no"/>ing to my
                  request to postpone this discus<lb break="no"/>sion, I deprived him of the
                  pleasure of bring<lb break="no"/>ing forward once again extract after ex<lb break="no"/>tract from his scrap book. Judging from <lb/> the extract after
                  extract which my hon. <lb/> friend has read, and the innuendo after <lb/> innuendo
                  which he has given utterance to, <lb/> my hon. friend has come to the conclusion
                  <lb/> that this Bill has been too hastily prepared. <lb/> As an evidence of this
                  hasty preparation he <lb/> tells us that the Bill though given a first <lb/>
                  reading on the 21st of February has not yet <lb/> been called for second reading.
                  It is true <lb/> that we have not yet moved the second <lb/> reading of the Bill,
                  and it makes my heart <lb/> sink within me to think that whenever we <lb/> defer

                  conferring upon him a favour and <lb/> meeting the wishes of the leader of the

               </p>
               <p>My hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) has <lb/> found another evidence of the hasty
                     prepa<lb break="no"/>ration of this Bill, in the general scope <lb/> of the
                  letter of Mr. Haultain. I do <lb/> not agree with my hon. friend in this <lb/>
                  respect. It is true that the letter from Mr. <lb/> Haultain which he asks to be
                  placed on the <lb/> table of the House, takes exception to al<lb break="no"/>most
                  every provision of the Bill, but, if I <lb/> am to judge from the expressions of
                  public <lb/> opinion which are coming from all parts of <lb/> the country, there
                  is only one feature of the <lb/> Bill, and that the school clause, which has <lb/>
                  caused any comment. With regard to the <lb/> number of provinces to be created ;
                  with <lb/> regard to the land question, with regard to <lb/> the finance question
                  ; indeed with regard to <lb/> all other proposals of the Bill I have yet to <lb/>
                  learn that serious exception has been taken. <lb/> There have indeed been some
                  expressions <lb/> from here and there, but so far as con<lb break="no"/>cerns any
                  general views from the people <lb/>
                  <cb/> of Canada, the manifestations seem to <lb/> be only against the clause
                  referring <lb/> to education. The House is aware that <lb/> every day we have
                  received numerous peti<lb break="no"/>tions regarding these Bills. Do they speak
                  <lb/> of the land question ; do they speak of the <lb/> finance question ; do they
                  speak of the <lb/> number of provinces ? No ; it is only on <lb/> the education
                  clause of the Bill as to which <lb/> we have received any petitions so far. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>I know, Sir, that in dealing with this <lb/> question we are walking upon very
                  tender <lb/> ground. It shall be my duty some time or <lb/> other to discuss it,
                  but I do not need to <lb/> say anything as to the merits of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion at the present time. I take issue with <lb/> my hon. friend when he says
                  that the Bill <lb/> bears evidence of hasty preparation. On <lb/> the contrary it
                  has every evidence of hav<lb break="no"/>ing been discussed and prepared with
                  great <lb/> care and deliberation, and, if the educa<lb break="no"/>tional phase
                  were eliminated, I do not <lb/> think the Bill itself would then receive a <lb/>
                  word of criticism. My hon. friend (Mr. R. <lb/> L. Borden) says : You have not
                  consulted <lb/> Mr. So-and-So, and Mr. So-and-So, and in <lb/> particular you have
                  not consulted Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain. On this ground I am prepared to give
                  <lb/> my hon. friend all the satisfaction, and per<lb break="no"/>haps more than
                  all the satisfaction he is <lb/> entitled to. Upon a recent occasion my hon. <lb/>
                  friend questioned me as to what had taken <lb/> place in the conferences between
                  us and <lb/> Mr. Haultain and Mr. Bulyea. I did not <lb/> think it advisable to
                  give my own version <lb/> on that subject, and I gave my reasons to <lb/> the
                  House and it is for the House to decide <lb/> whether these reasons were good or
                  bad. <lb/> I stated that in my judgment and to my <lb/> way of thinking these
                  conferences had been <lb/> confidential ; that there had been no secre<lb break="no"/>tary appointed ; that there had been no rec<lb break="no"/>ord
                  kept, and that there had been simply an <lb/> exchange of opinion across the table
                     be<lb break="no"/>tween the members of the government at <lb/> Ottawa and the
                  members of the Northwest <lb/> government. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Under such circumstances, I do not think <lb/> it would have been right for me to
                  have <lb/> given my own version of what had taken <lb/> place at that conference.
                  I am still of that <lb/> opinion ; and, Sir, I can appeal to the judg<lb break="no"/>ment of any man in this House that when <lb/> you have a
                  conference, the proceedings of <lb/> which are not recorded in writing, it is
                  <lb/> always a somewhat risky process to en<lb break="no"/>deavour to say exactly
                  what took place. <lb/> Mr. Haultain thinks differently. I do not <lb/> know that
                  Mr. Haultain, in the letter which <lb/> he has addressed to me, and which he has
                  <lb/> also given to the public, has improved the <lb/> criticism which he makes of
                  the Bill when <lb/> he complains that he had not received due <lb/> consideration.
                  Sir, I would be sorry to <lb/> think that I or my colleagues had been <lb/> guilty
                  of any want of courtesy towards Mr. <lb/> Haultain in regard to the matters which
                  <lb/> were treated at the conference. But Mr. <lb/> Haultain has relieved us of
                  any such im<lb break="no"/><pb n="2505" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2505.jpg"/>

                  the other members of the sub-committee of <lb/> council throughout the whole

               <p>I could not conceive it possible for Mr. <lb/> Haultain to complain that the

                  time, he says he has <lb/> been shown every possible consideration. It <lb/> would
                  have been showing Mr. Haultain <lb/> very poor courtesy indeed simply to ask him
                  <lb/> to sit at the table of conference and give <lb/> him no information
                  whatever. But I will <lb/> take the statement of Mr. Haultain. My <lb/> hon.
                  friend read it a moment ago ; I will <lb/> take the liberty of reading it again,
                  so that <lb/> the House may appreciate whether there <lb/> has been any fault on
                  my part or on the part <lb/> of my colleagues on the sub-committee, or <lb/>
                  whether Mr. Haultain is making a case <lb/> which, as I have said, it would have
                  been <lb/> better for him not to have attempted. Mr. <lb/> Haultain says : <lb/>
               </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> I must take strong exception to the way in <lb/>
                  which the subject of education has been treated <lb/> both in the conferences and

                  not laid before my colleague or myself <lb/> until noon of the day upon which you
                     intro<lb break="no"/>duced the Bill. Up to that time the question <lb/> had not

               <p>So it appears, according to this testimony <lb/> of Mr. Haultain, that this

                  that we differed on several mat<lb break="no"/>ters with Mr. Haultain. True it is,
                  as he <lb/> says, that we differed with him on the land <lb/> question. Mr.
                  Haultain was of opinion that <lb/> the land should be given to the provinces.
                  <lb/> We thought, on the contrary, that the land <lb/> should be kept in the hands
                  of the Dominion <lb/> government. I have already given the rea<lb break="no"/>sons
                  for that, and I think those reasons, <lb/> when they come to be discussed, will
                  stand <lb/> good in the judgment of every one. Mr. <lb/> Haultain differed with us
                  also in regard to <lb/> the subject of irrigation. We thought that <lb/> subject
                  should go to those who have the <lb/> management of the land, because the two
                  <lb/> are intimately connected. Mr. Haultain <lb/> refers to the fact that we
                  proposed to es<lb break="no"/>tablish two provinces instead of one. We <lb/>
                  differed from Mr. Haultain on this point <lb/> also. We thought it would be
                  preferable <lb/> to have two provinces in that vast domain ; <lb/>
                  <cb/> Mr. Haultain thought it would be better to <lb/> have only one province. But
                  I appeal to the <lb/> judgment of my hon. friend who has taken <lb/> us to task
                  because we have not adopted the <lb/> ways and means of Mr. Haultain, and I <lb/>
                  ask him if he is prepared to say that there <lb/> shall be one province in that
                  immense terri<lb break="no"/>tory instead of two—that we should create <lb/> there
                  one province which would have al<lb break="no"/>most twice the area of the largest
                  province <lb/> of the Dominion. Whatever may be the <lb/> views of Mr. Haultain on
                  this subject, the <lb/> government came to a different conclusion, <lb/> and our
                  action in this regard, as on every<lb break="no"/>thing else, is in the judgment
                  of the House. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>But now I come to the principal point <lb/> made by Mr. Haultain—that the
                  education <lb/> clauses did not receive fair consideration. <lb/> As Mr. Haultain
                  says, this question was <lb/> debated on the Friday previous to the 21st <lb/> of
                  February. Mr. Haultain calls this a <lb/> casual consideration only. Well, Sir,
                  this <lb/> is the result of having no record of what <lb/> took place. What may
                  have been casual <lb/> to Mr. Haultain may have been thorough to <lb/> somebody
                  else ; what may have been only <lb/> passing to him, may have been sufficient
                  <lb/> for somebody else. On this I have only to <lb/> say that the discussions
                  which took place on <lb/> the 21st of February between Mr. Haultain <lb/> and
                  members of Council there revealed this <lb/> fact, that while he held one view, we
                  held <lb/> another, with regard to the educational <lb/> clauses. As Mr. Haultain
                  has laid down <lb/> his views in his memorandum, I shall not <lb/> commit any
                  breach of privacy if I say what <lb/> his views were. Mr. Haultain took the <lb/>
                  ground that section 93 of the British North <lb/> America Act applied mechanically
                  to those <lb/> new provinces. The ground we took was <lb/> that section 93 of the
                  British North America <lb/> Act did not apply mechanically, but that <lb/> it
                  should be made to apply in the legislation <lb/> we offered to the House, subject
                  only to <lb/> such modifications as the circumstances of <lb/> the new provinces
                  would warrant. That <lb/> was, therefore, a distinct difference of <lb/> opinion
                  between us and Mr. Haultain. The <lb/> Bills before the House indicate what our
                  <lb/> position was. The letter of Mr. Haultain <lb/> speaks of the views he laid
                  before the com<lb break="no"/>mittee of Council. Those views were that <lb/>
                  section 93 of the British North America <lb/> Act applied mechanically to those
                  provinces, <lb/> and that there was, therefore, no necessity <lb/> of going beyond
                  section 2 of the Bill. But <lb/> we said : No ; we agree with you that <lb/>
                  section 93 must go into this Bill, but we <lb/> think it should be done
                  legislatively, subject <lb/> to such modifications as are called for by <lb/> the
                  present condition of the people. There <lb/> was the subject of difference.
                  Therefore, <lb/> we knew exactly what our position was <lb/> and what the position
                  of Mr. Haultain was. <lb/> Although we might have discussed the ques<lb break="no"/>tion for a month or a year, there would have <lb/> been the same difference. We
                  knew exactly <lb/> the line of cleavage between us and him. <lb/> We said to Mr.
                  Haultain : We do not agree <lb/> with you : perhaps you are right, perhaps <lb/>
                  <pb n="2507" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2507.jpg"/>

                  thinking, and we will prepare a clause <lb/> according to our view which we will
                  submit <lb/> to you. When the clause was prepared, it <lb/> was submitted to him.
                  It was open to him to <lb/> discuss it ; but after he had taken his posi<lb break="no"/>tion and we had taken ours, I do not sup<lb break="no"/>pose there
                  would have been much to accom<lb break="no"/>plish by discussion. We knew where we
                  <lb/> were and where he was. That is the position <lb/> of the matter, and I leave
                  it to the House to <lb/> say whether or not, under such circum<lb break="no"/>stances, we have not given to Mr. Haultain, <lb/> and Mr. Bulyea, the members
                  representing <lb/> the Northwest government, every oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to
                  be heard by us and to have <lb/> their views represented to us and thorough<lb break="no"/>ly discussed. Every impartial man who <lb/> reads the letter of Mr.
                  Haultain will come <lb/> to the conclusion, after the explanation that <lb/> I
                  have given to the House, that there was <lb/> nothing to complain of on his part.
                  The <lb/> subject was thoroughly threshed out on the <lb/> first day on which it
                  was taken up, and <lb/> after that we placed before the House the <lb/> result of
                  our deliberations. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now, this is all I have to say on this <lb/> question at the present time. My
                  hon. friend <lb/> has again pressed me for information on <lb/> other subjects. I
                  do not think that on such <lb/> an occasion I am called on to give my hon. <lb/>
                  friend more information than I have given <lb/> on former ocasions. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>It will be the duty of the government, in <lb/> due time, to give to my hon.
                  friend (Mr. <lb/> R. L. Borden) and to the House every in<lb break="no"/>formation
                  that is necessary for the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the Bill. My hon. friend
                  has asked <lb/> me if we contemplate amendments to the <lb/> Bill. I do not know,
                  Sir, that any wrong <lb/> will be done to anybody if we are contem<lb break="no"/>plating amendments. Would it be the first <lb/> time that a government when
                  introducing a <lb/> measure should endeavour to see whether <lb/> or not it was
                  possible to satisfy all sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the country in regard to that
                     mea<lb break="no"/>sure ? In view of the petitions that have <lb/> been
                  presented to the House, some coming <lb/> from one quarter and other petitions
                  coming <lb/> from another side, would it be wrong if the <lb/> government would
                  say : We will reconsider <lb/> our position and see whether or not we can <lb/>
                  satisfy this country ? I am sorry my hon. <lb/> friend has treated the subject a
                  little more <lb/> lightly than I would have expected him to <lb/> do on an
                  occasion of this kind. What is <lb/> the spectacle we have to-day ? We have <lb/>
                  the spectacle of numerous petitions being <lb/> presented asking that the
                  educational <lb/> clauses should be withdrawn from the Bill <lb/> and numerous
                  other petitions asking that <lb/> the Bill should be passed as it is. This is
                  <lb/> a very delicate subject. It is not the first <lb/> time this question of
                  education has come <lb/> before the House. It is not the first time <lb/> it has
                  engaged the attention of the country <lb/> and upon every occasion that it has
                  come <lb/> before the House, in 1872-73 with regard to <lb/> the New Brunswick
                  school question, in 1875, <lb/>
                  <!--<p>Sir WILFRID LAURIER. 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
                  <cb/> with regard to the school question again, <lb/> and in 1896, whenever it has
                  come before <lb/> the country there has always been an exhi<lb break="no"/>bition
                  of strong public sentiment and of <lb/> contrary opinions. Sir, under such
                     circum<lb break="no"/>stances, if the government were thinking : <lb/> ' Well
                  we may consider again the position <lb/> we have taken ; we may again look at what
                  <lb/> we are going to do,' is there any man on <lb/> that side or on this side of
                  the House, or <lb/> without the House throughout this broad <lb/> country who
                  would say that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment was not doing right in thinking
                  twice <lb/> before taking a final step upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion ? Sir, I
                  claim that I have some sense <lb/> of the responsibility that attaches to the
                  <lb/> government and to those who are entrusted <lb/> with the administration of
                  the affairs of <lb/> the country, and, in a question of this kind <lb/>
                  especially, whenever such a matter is <lb/> brought up the government is faced
                  with a <lb/> difficulty which perhaps it has not <choice>
                     <sic>antici<lb break="no"/>parted</sic>
                     <corr>anticipated</corr>
                  </choice> and finding difficulties which no man <lb/> could have foreseen, viewing
                  the virulence <lb/> with which passions are roused, per<lb break="no"/>haps, Sir,
                  there is some reason why a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should be slow to take any
                  action <lb/> and should hesitate in coming to a final <lb/> decision. I have
                  spoken of the virulence of <lb/> the passions exhibited. I do not say <lb/> that
                  offensively ; I know that would be <lb/> greatly mistaken if I were to say
                  anything <lb/> offensively on this point. I would not do <lb/> so ; I know that
                  public passions, strong <lb/> passions, are not always ignoble ; some<lb break="no"/>times on the contrary, they are only the <lb/> exaggeration of a
                  noble sentiment, but even <lb/> the exaggeration of a noble sentiment may <lb/>
                  lead to outbursts of public passion. I say <lb/> to my hon. friend, if he wants to
                  know, <lb/> that this subject gives me a great deal to <lb/> think about, and if
                  it be possible to amend <lb/> this Bill the government need not fear to <lb/>
                  consider the matter. More than this I will <lb/> not say at present. This I will
                  say, that <lb/> we are thinking upon these matters, that it <lb/> is our duty to
                  do so and the result of our <lb/> deliberations shall be given in due time to
                  <lb/> the House, but at this present moment, I <lb/> think I have given to my hon.
                  friend all <lb/> the answer to which he is entitled. <lb/>

                  Mr. Speaker, although the House can hardly <lb/> congratulate itself that the
                  right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman who so ably leads it (Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
                  Laurier) has shed any great flood of light <lb/> upon the questions submitted to
                  him, still, <lb/> day by day, as question follows question we <lb/> do elicit
                  information, and in due time if the <lb/> Bill continues to be delayed and if only
                  as <lb/> much information leaks out every day as <lb/> has so far leaked out we
                  will at all events <lb/> be able to discuss the matter when it comes <lb/> before
                  us with a light of understanding <lb/> that certainly was lacking in the first
                     in<lb break="no"/>stance. To-day the right hon. gentleman has <lb/> accepted
                  the statement of Mr. Haultain as to <lb/> the facts laid down in his letter and he
                  has <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">2510</fw> told us in so many words that Mr. Haultain <lb/> had no
                  right or reason to complain of the op<lb break="no"/>portunity given him to
                  discuss the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses in the Bill. When we look at <lb/>
                  Mr. Haultain's letter and find that he states <lb/> that he never saw these
                  clauses until noon <lb/> of the day on which the Bill was introduced, <lb/> that
                  he never heard of these clauses until <lb/> the previous Friday when there was but
                  a <lb/> casual reference to them—and evidently the <lb/> clauses themselves could
                  not have been laid <lb/> before him—we have an idea of the impor<lb break="no"/>tance the right hon. gentleman attaches to <lb/> the opinion of the Northwest
                  Territories <lb/> when it applies to the educational clauses <lb/> of these
                  important Acts. When a most im<lb break="no"/>portant question touching the
                  province of <lb/> Manitoba was presented to the right hon. <lb/> gentleman, when
                  the legislature of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and the people of Manitoba were a
                  <lb/> unit in desiring that their province should <lb/> be extended to the west,
                  when it was an <lb/> undeniable fact that a little province 73,000 <lb/> square
                  miles in size, of which 10,000 miles <lb/> were under water, was to be placed side
                  by <lb/> side with two gigantic provinces of a quar<lb break="no"/>ter of a
                  million square miles each, when <lb/> the legislature of Manitoba and the people
                  <lb/> of that province pleaded that their province <lb/> might be placed on an
                  equal footing with <lb/> these new provinces, the one sufficient an<lb break="no"/>swer that the right hon. gentleman gave <lb/> was why the people of the
                  Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories through their legislature have op<lb break="no"/>posed such a claim. And inasmuch as the <lb/> people of the west
                  have opposed it the re<lb break="no"/>quest of Manitoba was promptly denied. <lb/>
                  Why is it that the people of the Northwest <lb/> Territories and the premier of
                  the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories have so extraordinary an <lb/> influence
                  on the right hon. gentleman and <lb/> his government in regard to some matters,
                  <lb/> and that their opinions have so little value <lb/> in regard to the
                  educational clauses which <lb/> it passed must bind these provinces for all <lb/>
                  time to come, through all eternity. The <lb/> right hon. gentleman thought the
                  matter <lb/> was of so little importance that to-day, after <lb/> the country has
                  been convulsed for more <lb/> than a month he congratulates himself and <lb/>
                  gravely tells us that Mr. Haultain had ample <lb/> opportunity to discuss these
                  clauses which <lb/> he never saw. I am sorry, Sir, that a case <lb/> such as this,
                  without precedent one might <lb/> say, leads to peculiar complications, and so I
                  <lb/> am not perfectly certain that I agree with <lb/> my leader in one statement
                  that he made. <lb/> That hon. gentleman seems to be under the <lb/> impression
                  that the seven members from the <lb/> west were those who enlightened, instruct<lb break="no"/>ed and controlled the premier in this legis<lb break="no"/>lation.
                  Possibly they did, Sir, on the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of the doctrine of
                  exclusion. We know <lb/> that the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) <lb/> did not
                  ; we know that the ex-Minister of <lb/> the Interior (Mr. Sifton) did not, and we
                  <lb/> know that the premier, representing the <lb/> people of the Northwest
                  Territories did <lb/> not, and I suppose that the hon. gentleman <lb/>
                  <cb/> who leads this side of the House, (Mr. R. L. <lb/> Borden), must have
                  concluded that the <lb/> seven gentlemen in question were the ones <lb/> who
                  really did guide the premier, basing <lb/> his opinion on the kind of advice they
                  gave <lb/> on statements of the right hon. gentleman <lb/> as made before the
                  House when the Bill <lb/> was introduced. The hon. gentleman who <lb/> leads the
                  opposition may be right, but I de<lb break="no"/>cline to think that any
                  native—born Cana<lb break="no"/>dian could have given the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman such advice as he evidently received. <lb/> I think that no
                  one who reads the statement <lb/> which he made when the Bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced, and I say it with all respect to the <lb/> right hon.
                  gentleman, because I quite un<lb break="no"/>derstand that the onerous duties of
                  the <lb/> leader of a government, especially when the <lb/> session is in
                  progress—can doubt that the <lb/> right hon. gentleman has no time to devote <lb/>
                  to the acquisition of facts of law and other<lb break="no"/>wise, and therefore he
                  is dependent on <lb/> some one for these facts. It would seem <lb/> that the
                  gentleman who instructed him re<lb break="no"/>lied on imagination for his history
                  and his <lb/> invention for his law, and I think we are <lb/> justified in
                  considering that even these seven <lb/> were not consulted. The question as to the
                  <lb/> propriety or impropriety of the clauses is <lb/> oi course not a question
                  which we can dis<lb break="no"/>cuss at the present time. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>But surely all must admit that the very <lb/> evidence we have seen in this House
                  day <lb/> after day, when, from one end of this coun<lb break="no"/>try to the
                  other petitions are pouring in, <lb/> some for and some against this measure,
                  <lb/> must be enough to impress the members of <lb/> this House with the gravity
                  of the position <lb/> in which the right hon. gentleman placed <lb/> this House,
                  has placed these provinces, has <lb/> placed the people of Canada by introducing
                  <lb/> the Bill which has been so long held back. <lb/> And the right hon.
                  gentleman seems to <lb/> lead us to infer that the Bill was held <lb/> back out of
                  kindness and consideration for <lb/> the wishes of the hon. member for East <lb/>
                  Grey (Mr. Sproule). Applying the old rule <lb/> that it is the unexpected that
                  happens, we <lb/> would naturally expect the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman
                  to defer his own wishes to the con<lb break="no"/>venience and interest of the
                  hon. member <lb/> for East Grey. But, as I understand the <lb/> complaints made by
                  the hon. member for <lb/> East Grey and other gentlemen on this side <lb/> of the
                  House, they are not that the right <lb/> hon. gentleman has held back the second
                  <lb/> reading of the Bill so much as that we cannot <lb/> find out what the Bill
                  is. I think the hon. <lb/> member for East Grey was right in asking <lb/> that
                  ample time should be given to the coun<lb break="no"/>try to consider and digest
                  the provisions <lb/> of the Bill. But how is the country to con<lb break="no"/>sider and digest these most important mat<lb break="no"/>ters when the right
                  hon. Prime Minister will <lb/> not tell us, though appealed to again and <lb/>
                  again, what the provisions of the Bill are to <lb/> be. It is all very well for
                  the right hon. <lb/> gentleman to tell us that no important Bill <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">2512</fw> goes through parliament without changes <lb/> and
                  amendments. That is perfectly true. <lb/> But I would ask the right hon gentleman
                  <lb/> if, in the course of his reading of consti<lb break="no"/>tutional law, he
                  has ever found a case where <lb/> the leader of a government introduced a <lb/>
                  Bill and, contrary to the ordinary practice <lb/> not only explained its
                  provisions, but made <lb/> an impassioned appeal to the House by all <lb/> the
                  principles of right, and by all the <lb/> claims of justice, loyalty, and even
                  religion, <lb/> to pass certain clauses, and days and weeks <lb/> after told the
                  House gravely that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was considering these clauses
                  and <lb/> reserved its right to do as it saw fit about <lb/> them ? I would ask
                  the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's followers if it would not be more <lb/>
                  in accordance with constitutional procedure <lb/> and more statesmanlike if this
                  consideration, <lb/> this discussion, had taken place before the <lb/> Bill came
                  down, and before this burning <lb/> question was thrown into the political arena?
                  <lb/> Would it not have been better to discuss <lb/> the matter with his hon.
                  colleagues, so that <lb/> they might have a chance, before the Bill <lb/> was
                  brought to parliament, to oppose the <lb/> measure and to try, by resignation or
                  in any <lb/> other proper way, to compel a modification of <lb/> its terms? Would
                  not this be better than, <lb/> after parliament is called, the members <lb/>
                  should be detained from their business week <lb/> after week because the
                  government is not <lb/> ready to announce its policy ? My hon. <lb/> leader (Mr.
                  R. L. Borden) asked the right <lb/> hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) a most
                  <lb/> important question—it occurs to me the most <lb/> important question in
                  connection with this <lb/> matter—which the right hon. gentleman did <lb/> not
                  answer. He inquired whether it was the <lb/> intention of the government, as
                  stated in a <lb/> newspaper ordinarily supposed to be one of <lb/> the organs of
                  the party of hon. gentlemen <lb/> opposite, to refer this question to the Supreme
                  <lb/> Court. Now, I do not know what the policy <lb/> of the Conservative party or
                  any other mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Conservative party may be on this <lb/>
                  subject. But, speaking for myself, I op<lb break="no"/>pose any proposal to refer
                  this matter to the <lb/> Supreme Court. We know that even a wise <lb/> man may be
                  caught napping once, but no <lb/> wise man will be caught napping twice in <lb/>
                  the same way. I remember a question sim<lb break="no"/>ilar to this that agitated
                  this country nearly <lb/> ten years ago. I remember that a consti<lb break="no"/>tutional question arose along lines similar <lb/> to this in the province of
                  Manitoba. After <lb/> it had been decided that Manitoba had <lb/> not the right to
                  separate schools because <lb/> there were no separate schools by law or <lb/>
                  practice in the province at the time it entered <lb/> into confederation, Manitoba
                  claimed the <lb/> right, under the remedial clauses of the law, <lb/> to appeal to
                  the Dominion parliament. The <lb/> right of this parliament to repeal a provin<lb break="no"/>cial statute passed after the union was <lb/> discussed, and the
                  House was asked to <lb/> consent to a reference of the matter to the <lb/> Supreme
                  Court. It was so referred. But <lb/>
                  <!-- <p>Mr. NORTHRUP. 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
                  <cb/> no less an authority than the right hon. <lb/> gentleman himself (Sir
                  Wilfrid Laurier) <lb/> potnted out—and, I think, wisely and cor<lb break="no"/>rectly—that the very fact of the House refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the Supreme
                  Court the question of <lb/> its right to pass this legislation was an <lb/>
                  admission by the House that, should it be <lb/> held that parliament had the right
                  to pass <lb/> such a law, it was in reason and in honour <lb/> bound to exercise
                  that right. And it was <lb/> for that reason, and not because we were <lb/>
                  advocating separate schools in Manitoba that <lb/> I and many others like me,
                  thought that, <lb/> this House having asked whether it had the <lb/> power to pass
                  remedial legislation, it would <lb/> be a monstrous absurdity, it would be a <lb/>
                  stultifying of ourselves not to pass it. To <lb/> ask whether we had the right to
                  act and, <lb/> when that right was established refuse to <lb/> act, would simply
                  be playing a double game. <lb/> It would be asking the Supreme Court and <lb/> the
                  Privy Council gravely whether our <lb/> rights extended to a certain point while
                  <lb/> determined that even if they did extend that <lb/> far, we would not act
                  upon the right thus <lb/> decided to be ours. There is a clear cut <lb/> line
                  between the right hon. Prime Minister <lb/> and Mr. Haultain and many other
                     gentle<lb break="no"/>men in this country as to the constitutional <lb/> right
                  of this House to pass the legislation <lb/> now proposed. Of course, I do not
                  propose <lb/> to discuss that point at present. But I <lb/> venture to say that no
                  lawyer will look into <lb/> the matter and not come to the conclusion <lb/> that,
                  at least, the question is open to argu<lb break="no"/>ment that it is doubtful
                  whether this House <lb/> has power to pass and enforce such legis<lb break="no"/>lation. But, if we should pass such legis<lb break="no"/>lation, and it should
                  be decided to be ultra <lb/> vires of our powers, the provinces will find <lb/>
                  that out for themselves and it will not be <lb/> long before the people will find
                  that they <lb/> are not bound as they were supposed to <lb/> be. But I would
                  protest against submitting <lb/> the question to the Supreme Court or Privy <lb/>
                  Council whether we have power to pass such <lb/> educational clauses as are
                  proposed ; for <lb/> all must see that, if this House should ask <lb/> the Supreme
                  Court whether we have that <lb/> power to pass such clauses, it might be <lb/>
                  contended, as the right hon. Prime Minister <lb/> said ten years ago, that, if it
                  should be <lb/> decided that we had the power, then we <lb/> should be bound to
                  show our sincerity and <lb/> good faith by passing such legislation and <lb/> so
                  impose these clauses upon the Northwest <lb/> Territories for all time to come.
                  <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now, the right hon. Prime Minister (Sir <lb/> Wilfrid Laurier) spoke of the
                  educational <lb/> clauses as the only objectionable clauses in <lb/> the Bill. I
                  would enter a very earnest dis<lb break="no"/>sent from that proposition. The Bill
                  may <lb/> have many objectionable clauses, but, if it <lb/> has one transcendently
                  objectionable, it is <lb/> quite reasonable for the people, for the <lb/> time
                  being, to concentrate their attack upon <lb/> that clause rather than spend their
                  time <lb/> on minor clauses which, however objection<lb break="no"/><pb n="2513" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2513.jpg"/>

                  <fw type="num">2514</fw>able, are comparatively of small importance. <lb/> I can
                  assure the hon. gentleman that he will <lb/> find in the Northwest Territories the
                  people <lb/> have a very strong, and, he may find, a very <lb/> well-founded
                  objection to many of the <lb/> clauses outside of the educational clauses <lb/> to
                  which he has referred. I do not wish to <lb/> occupy time more than to say that
                  the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, I suppose, have a per<lb break="no"/>fect right, when the government brings down <lb/> such a measure as this and
                  when the right <lb/> hon. gentleman tells us that the government <lb/> is
                  considering the question, to ask that <lb/> when they have pondered over, they
                  will <lb/> give us the benefit of their views. When <lb/> the right hon. gentleman
                  takes the position <lb/> he does we have the right to ask if he brings <lb/> to
                  the discussion of this question the same <lb/> open mind, the same views as to
                     constitution<lb break="no"/>al law and the rights of the provinces that <lb/>
                  he held years ago. In case he may have for<lb break="no"/>gotten, I will read his
                  own views as to the <lb/> rights of the provinces, as explained by him<lb break="no"/>self some years ago. In 1893, he said : <lb/>

               <p><persName ref="pers:OSLE1">Mr. E. B. OSLER</persName> (West Toronto). When <lb/>
                  my right hon. friend, the Prime Minister, <lb/> charged the leader of the
                  opposition with <lb/> treating this matter with levity, he made <lb/> Mr. Speaker,
                  what I consider a most ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary statement. I fail to see how
                  <lb/> any one who has listened to the remarks <lb/> of my hon. friend (Mr. Borden)
                  could come <lb/> to any other conclusion than that he has <lb/> treated this
                  question as what it really is, <lb/> one of the most serious that has ever come
                  <lb/> before this House. But if a charge of <lb/> levity in this connection rests
                  against any <lb/>
                  <cb/> one, it certainly does against the Prime <lb/> Minister. In his reply to my
                  hon. friend <lb/> I fail to discover a single argument. In<lb break="no"/>stead of
                  arguing seriously the points raised <lb/> by the leader of the opposition, he has
                  <lb/> sought lightly to brush them aside as if <lb/> the question were not to be
                  considered or <lb/> discussed at all until it suited the right <lb/> hon.
                  gentleman to proceed further with <lb/> his Bill and favour the House with some
                  <lb/> further particulars. But that my right <lb/> hon. friend is daily finding
                  his position <lb/> more uncomfortable and his difficulties in<lb break="no"/>creasing is evidenced by the fact that in <lb/> his reference to the hon. member
                  for East <lb/> Grey (Mr. Sproule) he let slip an allusion <lb/> of a personal
                  nature, because that is a <lb/> species of retort which my right hon. <lb/> friend
                  is usually careful to avoid. In refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the hon. member, he
                  spoke of him <lb/> as not being a member of parliament only, <lb/> but as
                  something else. Well, we all know <lb/> what the right hon. gentleman meant. We
                  <lb/> all know that by something else he meant <lb/>that the hon. member for East
                  Grey (Mr. <lb/>Sproule) was the chief source of those pe<lb break="no"/>titions
                  which are being daily presented <lb/>against the clause in this Bill relating to
                  <lb/>schools. For my part I can say, so far as <lb/>my knowledge goes, that my
                  hon. friend is <lb/>not the chief source of those petitions. In <lb/>fact I have
                  been very much surprised that <lb/>the body which the hon. member for East
                  <lb/>Grey represents has shown itself so thor<lb break="no"/>oughly self contained
                  throughout this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. I do not believe that the First Minister
                  <lb/>realizes for a moment the feeling which this <lb/>Bill has created. Already
                  by this measure <lb/>he has set creed against creed in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Ontario. Already he has done <lb/>evil which ten years will not wipe
                  out; and <lb/>I appeal to him to lose not another day <lb/>in submitting this Bill
                  to the House and <lb/>the people because every day's delay is <lb/>widening the
                  breach and intensifying the <lb/>feeling against it. It is intensifying that
                  <lb/>feeling to such an extent that no matter <lb/>whether the Bill be altered to
                  meet the <lb/>views of those who are opposing it or not <lb/>the bitterness now
                  created will last longer <lb/>than the lifetime of many in this House. <lb/>I have
                  been astonished at the strength <lb/>of the feeling which has been aroused <lb/>in
                  connection with this educational clause. <lb/>My right hon. friend pleads that as
                  this <lb/>is the only clause in the Bill to which <lb/>objection has been made, we
                  must con<lb break="no"/>clude that great consideration has been <lb/>given to it.
                  But, Mr. Speaker, the fact <lb/>rather is that this educational clause so
                  <lb/>overshadows all the others that the other <lb/>clauses have not received the
                  criticism <lb/>which they ought to get. It is stated in <lb/>the newspapers
                  without contradiction that <lb/>this measure was left to four members of <lb/>the
                  cabinet—the First Minister, the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice (Mr.

                  <fw type="num">2516</fw>master General (Sir Wiliam Mulock). I am <lb/> sorry my
                  hon. friend the Posmaster General <lb/> is not in his place because I wished to
                  call <lb/> his attention to the fact that there is a <lb/> feeling in the
                  constituency I represent and <lb/> among my friends that he has not given <lb/>
                  his full assent to this measure and has <lb/> reserved his right to withdraw
                  later. I <lb/> have felt it my duty to bring before the <lb/> right hon. gentleman
                  and this House what <lb/> I believe, the right hon. gentleman does <lb/> not
                  realize, namely, the intense feeling <lb/> which is being created by this Bill and
                  I <lb/> appeal to the First Minister not to delay <lb/> a day in submitting the
                  Bill in its present <lb/> shape, if he be determined to submit it in <lb/> that
                  shape. Let us in that event deal with <lb/> the Bill and fight it out, and perhaps
                  the <lb/> feeling which is being created in the coun<lb break="no"/>try and is
                  continuing to spread may then <lb/> be stopped. Surely from the 21st Febru<lb break="no"/>ary until the 15th March is a reasonable <lb/> length of time to
                  have the Bill before the <lb/> country, and it ought now to be submitted <lb/> to
                  the consideration of parliament. Surely <lb/> that is all the time the hon. member
                  for <lb/> East Grey (Mr. Sproule) could possibly <lb/> have asked for. Every day
                  the feeling is <lb/> intensifying. Every day the newspapers <lb/> are instilling
                  more and more into the <lb/> minds of the people that this is a measure <lb/>
                  which simply is setting creed against <lb/> creed. Let us then face the issue
                  straight <lb/> and squarely. Every day's delay is inten<lb break="no"/>sifying the
                  feeling against the Bill, and <lb/> that feeling has taken such root that I <lb/>
                  venture to-day that ten years hence will <lb/> not see the sore healed. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. McCARTHY</persName> (Calgary). Repre<lb break="no"/>senting, as I do, one of the constituencies <lb/> directly affected
                  by this Bill, I do not see how <lb/> I can remain silent in this discussion es<lb break="no"/>pecially in view of some of the remarks <lb/> which have been made
                  by the right hon. <lb/> the First Minister. I rise to protest <lb/> against the
                  conduct of the administration <lb/> in having framed this measure without any
                  <lb/> reference to, and in the absence of the <lb/> minster who is charged by
                  statute with <lb/> the control and management of the affairs <lb/> of the
                  Northwest Territories, and for hav<lb break="no"/>ing introduced it in his
                  absence. I may <lb/> perhaps be permitted to draw the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of
                  hon. members to the statute to <lb/> which I refer. By section 3 of chapter 22
                  <lb/> of the Revised Statutes of Canada it is <lb/> provided that the Minister of
                  the Interior <lb/> shall have the control and management of <lb/> the affairs of
                  the Northwest Territories. <lb/> Why then should a measure of such vital <lb/>
                  importance to the people of that country <lb/> have been framed and introduced
                  without <lb/> reference to the minister who has been <lb/> clothed by statute with
                  this particular <lb/> duty. That needs explanation. No one <lb/> can fail to see
                  that there was no member <lb/> of the cabinet whose presence was more <lb/>
                  <!--<fw type="running">Mr.</fw>
            <fw type="num">OSLER.</fw>-->
                  <cb/> necessary before arriving at a conclusion <lb/> on such an important matter
                  for the west <lb/> than the hon. member for Brandon (Mr. <lb/> Sifton) for there
                  was no minister whose in<lb break="no"/>dividual responsibility in that matter was
                  <lb/> so great. It is a matter of common com<lb break="no"/>plaint that the
                  affairs of the Northwest <lb/> Territories can be given only a very small <lb/>
                  portion of the time which the ministers <lb/> are able to spare from their
                  respective de<lb break="no"/>partments. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>That is a complaint that one often hears, <lb/> and perhaps the reason is plain.
                  There are <lb/> matters pressing on the different ministers <lb/> in their
                  departments—matters near at hand <lb/> —in which they must be more interested
                  <lb/> than they are in the rights of the people <lb/> living two or three thousand
                  miles away. <lb/> That it has been the practice in the past to <lb/> consult the
                  Minister of the Interior in regard <lb/> to matters of much less importance
                     regard<lb break="no"/>ing the administration of the affairs of the <lb/>
                  Northwest Territories, I think cannot be <lb/> denied. Looking at the
                  correspondence <lb/> which has been had between members of <lb/> the legislative
                  assembly and the federal <lb/> government, it will be observed that near<lb break="no"/>ly all that correspondence has been carried <lb/> on with the hon.
                  member for Brandon (Mr. <lb/> Sifton). I find that on April 5th, 1901, he <lb/>
                  writes the Hon. F. W. G. Haultain in con<lb break="no"/>nection with this matter,
                  saying that busi<lb break="no"/>ness is so pressing upon the respective min<lb break="no"/>isters that the measure could not be brought <lb/> down that
                  session. Then, again, I find that <lb/> Mr. Haultain was communicating with the
                  <lb/> Minister of the Interior over an appoint<lb break="no"/>ment to discuss
                  affairs relating to the terri<lb break="no"/>tories with the members of the
                  government, <lb/> and I find that on June 4th, 1901, the Hon. <lb/> F. W. G.
                  Haultain wired to Hon. Clifford <lb/> Sifton : <lb/>

                  which was submitted to them by <lb/> that draft Bill ? The right hon. leader of
                  <lb/> the government has stated that no com<lb break="no"/>plaints have come in

                  not been <lb/> made I would not have troubled the House <lb/> this afternoon. I
                  have here a copy of a re<lb break="no"/>solution passed at Medicine Hat three
                  weeks <lb/> ago. I may say, explaining it, that it ob<lb break="no"/>jects to the

                  objects <lb/> to the proposed legislation in respect to <lb/> education, and it
                  goes further, and declares <lb/> that the placing of the dividing line on the

                  eastern province of Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan. The objection to that division
                  is that <lb/> the ranching country in that eastern pro<lb break="no"/>vince will
                  have such small representation <lb/> in the local House that its demands and its
                  <lb/> needs may not receive the recognition which <lb/> they deserve. The people
                  inhabiting that <lb/> district have realized this, and so they sent <lb/> their
                  resolution of protest down to their <lb/> representative in this House. Another
                     ob<lb break="no"/>jection which may seem of small concern to <lb/> the people
                  of the east, but which is very im<lb break="no"/>portant to the people of the
                  west, is that <lb/> by placing a portion of the ranching terri<lb break="no"/>tory
                  in the eastern province there is a possi<lb break="no"/>bility that there will be
                  a conflict in the <lb/> branding laws, which would undoubtedly <lb/> lead to great
                  inconvenience. <lb/>

               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:MCCA4">Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY</persName>. We were told <lb/>
                  to-day by the Prime Minister that no objec<lb break="no"/>tions had been raised to
                  the Bill except <lb/> as regards the educational clause and l <lb/> want to show
                  the right hon. gentleman <lb/> that there are still other objections. I <lb/>
                  point him to the fact that there is no chan<lb break="no"/>nel through which we
                  could approach the <lb/> government to make known our objections <lb/> other than
                  by open statements in this <lb/> House of Commons, and so it devolves on <lb/> us
                  from the Northwest to call the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the government to some
                  very im<lb break="no"/>portant objections which the people of the <lb/> west have
                  to this Bill. Of course, Mr. <lb/> Speaker, if I am out of order I will bow <lb/>
                  to your decision and desist. Let me how<lb break="no"/>ever point out that another
                  very strong <lb/> objection raised against this Bill is, that <lb/> the great
                  northern country is being includ<lb break="no"/>ed in the new provinces. While we
                  may <lb/> have great hopes and aspirations for the <lb/> future prosperity of that
                  northern country <lb/> yet the greater part of that territory is not <lb/>
                  agricultural, if we can accept as true the <lb/> statement of the Prime Minister
                  on intro<lb break="no"/>ducing the Bill. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>If we look at the census of 1901 it will <lb/> be found that in the provisional
                  district of <lb/> Athabaska the population consists of 80 <lb/> English : 8 Irish
                  : 39 Scotch : 105 French : <lb/> 7 Germans : 2 Scandinavians ; 1 Belgian, or <lb/>
                  142 white people in all. There were 2,393 <lb/> halfbreeds. 3,716 Indians, 262
                  unspecified, <lb/>
                  <!--<p>Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY.

            </p>-->
                  <cb/> giving a total population for the district of <lb/> Athabaska of 6,615. We
                  remember that <lb/> the Prime Minister when introducing the <lb/> Bill discussed
                  the question as to whether <lb/> or not it was advisable to give Manitoba, <lb/>
                  with a population then of 10,000 a provin<lb break="no"/>cial status in 1870, and
                  he suggested that <lb/> it would have been better to allow them <lb/> to mature by
                  gradual process. If that view <lb/> were sound in regard to Manitoba is it not
                  <lb/> equally applicable to-day to this great <lb/> northern country ? Is there
                  any great de<lb break="no"/>mand from that northern country to be in<lb break="no"/>cluded in any province ? I believe that they <lb/> need and are entitled to the
                  establishment <lb/> of courts of law and a further measure of <lb/> civil justice,
                  but I have not heard there is <lb/> any demand for autonomy in the district <lb/>
                  of Athabaska. Would it not be just as <lb/> logical to add the Yukon to British
                     Colum<lb break="no"/>bia or to add Keewatin to Ontario or to <lb/> add Ungava
                  to Quebec, as to add the dis<lb break="no"/>trict of Athabaska to the western
                  province <lb/> and extend that territory to the north ? <lb/> There is this
                  additional objection : that <lb/> under the proposed autonomy Bill the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces have no interest in the lands, mines. <lb/> or minerals, and
                  that is an important con<lb break="no"/>sideration when we are dealing with this
                  <lb/> phase of the measure. What would the <lb/> members in this House from
                  British Col<lb break="no"/>umbia, from Ontario and from Quebec say <lb/> if the
                  territories to the north of their pro<lb break="no"/>vinces were to be given
                  representation in <lb/> the provincial legislatures and they were to <lb/> be
                  saddled with the cost of this administra<lb break="no"/>tion under conditions
                  similar to those on <lb/> which Athabaska is to be included in the <lb/> province
                  of Alberta ? <lb/>

                  whom the <lb/> people can transmit their grievances. I <lb/> trust that the Prime

                  Speaker, in a matter of such importance to <lb/> the Northwest Territories, I feel
                  it my duty <lb/> to say a very few words at the present <lb/> time, and especially
                  shall I address myself <lb/> to the urgency of the appointment of a <lb/> Minister
                  of the Interior. To learn, as we <lb/> did the other day, that the terms of this
                  <lb/> Bill had been agreed upon and laid before <lb/> parliament without
                  consultation with the <lb/> Minister of the Interior—and as it after<lb break="no"/>wards proved, in direct opposition to his <lb/> known views—was surprising
                  enough ; but <lb/> to have the statement ten days later from <lb/> the Prime
                  Minister, that he had then no <lb/> intention of selecting a new Minister of the
                  <lb/> Interior, was simply amazing. I am glad <lb/> to say that on the following
                  day the right <lb/> hon., gentleman modified that statement <lb/> and gave us a
                  hope that in the near future <lb/> there would be an appointment. I feel that
                  <lb/> we are entitled to ask from the right hon. <lb/> gentleman an absolute and
                  positive state<lb break="no"/>ment on this question. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>If it is not unconstitutional to go on with <lb/> such important measures as
                  those before the <lb/> House in the absence of the Minister of <lb/> the Interior,
                  and I believe it is uncon<lb break="no"/>stutional, I will make this assertion,
                  that <lb/> it is plainly against the spirit of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution,
                  and that it is also against the <lb/> principles which were laid down by the <lb/>
                  Prime Minister himself, in the Order in <lb/> Council which was published in
                  connection <lb/> with the retirement of the Earl of Dundonald <lb/> last year. I
                  submit, Sir, that it is absolutely <lb/> necessary at the present time that the
                  <lb/> Prime Minister should admit into his most <lb/> confidential counsels some
                  man who is <lb/> thoroughly imbued with the spirit and the <lb/> aspirations of
                  the west. I do not believe <lb/> that the Bills in their present form would <lb/>
                  have been brought down if the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister had had in the
                  cabinet at the time <lb/> they were being discussed a gentleman from <lb/> the
                  west who was in touch with the west ; <lb/> and I feel quite certain that those
                  Bills <lb/> would not have been introduced in the <lb/> terms in which they
                  were—terms which <lb/> practically threw down the gauntlet to the <lb/> people of
                  the west on a subject on which the <lb/> Prime Minister must have known that they
                  <lb/> were very sensitive indeed. <lb/>

               <cb/>
               <p>In his speech in introducing the Bills, <lb/> the right hon. gentleman said : '
                  The North<lb break="no"/>west Territories have at the present time <lb/> a large
                  measure of local autonomy.' He <lb/> went on to say that they have ' most of the
                  <lb/> essential powers which are now given to <lb/> the provinces,' and he
                  concluded by saying <lb/> that he proposed to crown that with ' com<lb break="no"/>plete and absolute autonomy.' I sometimes <lb/> wonder whether it could be
                  possible that the <lb/> right hon. gentleman really meant that when <lb/> he said
                  it. I do not think that anybody who <lb/> chooses to study these Bills and to take
                  them <lb/> in connection with the constitutions of the <lb/> other provinces of
                  Canada, can doubt but <lb/> that it is proposed to form in the Northwest <lb/>
                  Territories ' imperfect and inferior organi<lb break="no"/>zations,' to quote the
                  words of the premier <lb/> of that country ; and if more proof were <lb/> needed
                  that the people of the Territories <lb/> did not believe that they were going to
                  <lb/> be put on the plane of the older provinces of <lb/> the Dominion, I would
                  point to the character <lb/> of the meetings which are now being held <lb/> almost
                  daily throughout the west. This <lb/> question is not dealt with up there as a
                  <lb/> party question. I notice that in the towns <lb/> in the district which I
                  have the honour to <lb/> represent, in several cases the prime <lb/> movers are
                  gentlemen who are supporters <lb/> of the right hon. gentleman opposite ; and
                  <lb/> I was surprised to hear that he had not <lb/> heard that other objections
                  had been taken <lb/> to the terms of these Bills above and be<lb break="no"/>yond
                  the objections which were taken to <lb/> the educational clauses. I may tell him
                  that <lb/> I have received copies of resolutions tak<lb break="no"/>ing the very
                  strongest objections to other <lb/> clauses. Of course, the terms in which <lb/>
                  the educational clauses are couched have <lb/> been such as to raise a feeling
                  which must <lb/> overshadow all other feelings amongst the <lb/> people of the
                  Northwest Territories ; and <lb/> therefore we find that the agitation against
                  <lb/> these educational clauses takes the first <lb/> place. But I can assure the
                  Prime Minister <lb/> that there are the very strongest objections <lb/> against
                  the proposal that our lands should <lb/> be retained by the Dominion of Canada.
                  <lb/> There are the very strongest objections <lb/> to having the perpetual
                  exemption from <lb/> taxation which is at the present moment <lb/> enjoyed by the
                  Canadian Pacific Railway <lb/> Company placed on the shoulders of the new <lb/>
                  provinces forever. That is a burden which <lb/> we believe the Dominion of Canada
                  should <lb/> hear. I may say that the large measure of <lb/> local autonomy which
                  the Prime Minister <lb/> referred to in his speech as having been <lb/> enjoyed by
                  the Territories has developed a <lb/> strong western sentiment and solidarity
                  <lb/> which is manifesting itself in connection <lb/> with the clauses of these
                  Bills ; and I would <lb/> suggest to him that he should put this mat<lb break="no"/>ter to the test by inviting some genleman <lb/> from amongst the western Liberal
                  members <lb/> of parliament to enter his cabinet and in this <lb/> way open a seat
                  in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/><pb n="2523" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2523.jpg"/>

               <p>The right hon. gentleman said : ' We have <lb/> had the benefit of the presence
                  of Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain and Mr. Bulyea,' and he went on to <lb/> say
                  further : ' We have had the advantage of <lb/> the advice of several members from
                  the <lb/> Territories in the discussion of these Bills. <lb/> Now, as has been
                  pointed out this after<lb break="no"/>noon, Mr. Haultain at any rate has put
                     him<lb break="no"/>self definitely on record as objecting to <lb/> the terms of
                  the draft Bill. And I may say <lb/> that Mr. Haultain and Mr. Bulyea do not <lb/>
                  speak as private individuals ; they speak <lb/> as being armed with the authority
                  of the <lb/> accredited representatives of the government <lb/> and the
                  legislative assembly of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. And it must be
                     remem<lb break="no"/>bered that the claims of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories were set forth in the most distinct <lb/> and definite terms—were set
                  forth categor<lb break="no"/>ically—in a draft Bill which the premier <lb/> of the
                  Northwest Territories submitted to <lb/> the Prime Minister more than three years
                  <lb/> ago. Those terms were discussed in the <lb/> legislative assembly, and were
                  for all prac<lb break="no"/>tical purposes unanimously approved. I may <lb/> say
                  that there was a unanimous approval <lb/> of the various terms of that draft Bill,
                  with <lb/> just one exception : that was as to whether <lb/> there should be one
                  or two provinces. On <lb/> that question the majority--<lb/>

                  but <lb/> I will get at it more directly. The Prime <lb/> Minister made a strong
                  point of the fact <lb/> that Mr. Haultain had objected to two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces being formed. That made a large <lb/> part of his argument, and surely I
                  should be <lb/> allowed to say a few words in reference <lb/> to that. What I wish
                  to point out is this, <lb/> that a very large majority of the members <lb/> of the
                  legislative assembly were in favour <lb/> or one province. There was a small
                     min<lb break="no"/>ority in favour of two provinces, but they <lb/> were
                  divided in opinion as to how these two <lb/> provinces should be formed—whether
                  there <lb/> should be a northern one and a southern <lb/> one or an eastern one
                  and a western one. <lb/> Mr. Haultain was only doing his duty when <lb/> he
                  advocated what was the very strong ver<lb break="no"/>dict of the members of the
                  legislative as<lb break="no"/>sembly. When the right hon. gentleman<lb/>referred
                  to the immense province which<lb/>such an area would make, I think he
                  forgot<lb/>that the legislative assembly had not asked<lb/>for the immense area
                  which he now proposes<lb/>to include in the two new provinces. They<lb/>had only
                  asked for a portion of it ; and I<lb/>might suggest to him that the three
                  present<lb/>organized districts only include an area less<lb/>than that of British
                  Columbia or that of<lb/>Quebec.<lb/>
               </p>
               <!--<p>Mr. LAKE<lb/>
            </p>-->
               <cb/>
               <p>I may say further that the terms of this <lb/> draft Bill formed the principal
                  question in <lb/> the general election of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories which took place shortly after its <lb/> submission to the legislative
                  assembly ; and <lb/> that the principal campaign literature issued <lb/> by the
                  local government of that day was <lb/> the correspondence in connection with the
                  <lb/> draft Bill, and the draft Bill itself, so that <lb/> there can be no
                  question, seeing that Mr. <lb/> Haultain's government was returned to pow<lb break="no"/>er with an overwhelming majority, that he <lb/> was voicing the
                  opinion of the people of the <lb/> Northwest in the demands which he has <lb/>
                  made in regard to the terms upon which the <lb/> Northwest Territories were to
                  become pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. But, as the right hon. the Prime <lb/> Minister
                  says, he had discussed this ques<lb break="no"/>tion and had great advantage in
                  the dis<lb break="no"/>cussion not only with the representatives of <lb/> the
                  Territorial government, but also with <lb/> several western members, we must
                  presume <lb/> that the Bill was introduced with the con<lb break="no"/>currence of
                  these western members. We <lb/> must assume that, or else these remarks of <lb/>
                  the Prime Minister would have no signific<lb break="no"/>ance or meaning. I
                  noticed also that some <lb/> Northwest members on the other side of the <lb/>
                  House greeted the remarks of the Prime <lb/> Minister on that occasion with the
                  most <lb/> vigorous applause. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Again I say that I consider that the pre<lb break="no"/>sence of the Minister of
                  the Interior in <lb/> this House is most necessary. A proposal <lb/> is made in
                  these draft Bills that the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion government should remain in
                  possession <lb/> of the public lands of the Northwest. I <lb/> venture to assert
                  that it has been found <lb/> impossible in the past to administer the <lb/> lands
                  of that country, with satisfaction, from <lb/> Ottawa and I think that if a close
                  inquiry <lb/> were made into the conditions it would be <lb/> found that there is
                  a great deal of dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction in that country with the
                  proclaimed <lb/> policy of the Minister of the Interior with <lb/> reference to
                  the settlement of these lands, <lb/> and that the administration of these lands
                  <lb/> is not satisfactory to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west. This
                  House should have the fullest in<lb break="no"/>formation on these points, and I
                  apprehend <lb/> that it would be practically impossible to <lb/> get that full
                  information unless we have, <lb/> sitting in his seat on the other side of the
                  <lb/> House. a Minister of the Interior. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:ROCH1">Mr. W. J. ROCHE</persName> (Marquette). Mr. <lb/>
                  Speaker, as a western representative, I<lb/>
                  <lb/>desire for a very short time this afternoon<lb/>to discuss more particularly
                  one feature of<lb/>this debate that has been referred to, espec<lb break="no"/>ially by my now colleagues from the west, a<lb/>question in which we are
                  particularly inter<lb break="no"/>ested in common with the people who
                  reside<lb/>in that portion of Canada. I refer to the<lb/>vacancy which exists in
                  the portfolio of the<lb/>Minister of the Interior. Some two or<lb/>three years ago
                  when the territorial execu<lb break="no"/>tive consulted with the right hon.
                  gentleman<lb/>  as to whether he was willing and ready to <pb n="2525" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2525.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="num">2525</fw>
                  <fw type="dateline">MARCH 15, 1905</fw>
                  <fw type="num">2526</fw> enter into a conference with the members of <lb/> the
                  executive with a view to granting pro<lb break="no"/>vincial government to the
                  people of the <lb/> Northwest Territories, the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman replied at that time that he could <lb/> not accede to their request ;
                  for what rea<lb break="no"/>son ? Because of the absence of the Minister <lb/> of
                  the Interior through illness. He could <lb/> not take up this great question in
                  the <lb/> absence of the member of the government <lb/> who was particularly
                  charged with looking <lb/> after the welfare of western interests, with <lb/> the
                  gentleman who, from his long residence <lb/> in that western country and from his
                  long <lb/> official connection was better able to give <lb/> him official advice
                  than any other colleague <lb/> in his cabinet. I must admit that the con<lb break="no"/>tention of the right hon. gentleman at <lb/> that time was a very
                  valid one and that <lb/> in the absence of this gentleman it was not <lb/>
                  reasonable to take up the question of self <lb/> government for the Territories.
                  According <lb/> to my judgment this was in accordance <lb/> with constitutional
                  procedure and was a de<lb break="no"/>ferring to the Minister of the Interior that
                  <lb/> was only that gentleman's due. The grant<lb break="no"/>ing of autonomy to
                  the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories is a most important
                     ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; it marks another epoch in the history <lb/> of the
                  confederation of Canada and it is a <lb/> question requiring the best advice of
                  the <lb/> most responsible advisers. Realizing this, <lb/> as undoubtedly the
                  Prime Minister did, he <lb/> would not enter into the initial stages even, <lb/>
                  he would not take up the question of hold<lb break="no"/>ing a conference with the
                  territorial execu<lb break="no"/>tive in the absence of his responsible Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior. If, however, it was <lb/> so very necessary
                  to have that gentleman <lb/> present in the conducting of negotiations, <lb/> how
                  much more was it necessary to have <lb/> him here when that Bill was being drafted
                  <lb/> for submission to this House. And yet, we <lb/> find the right hon.
                  gentleman having a <lb/> Bi11 prepared or preparing it himself, in com<lb break="no"/>pany with his colleagues, without that gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's
                  presence, without his consent, with<lb break="no"/>out his knowledge even, and
                  launching it <lb/> on this parliament without ever having sub<lb break="no"/>mitted it to him for his approval or disap<lb break="no"/>proval. No explanation
                  has yet been vouch<lb break="no"/>safed to this House by the Prime Minister <lb/>
                  why he followed such a course. He has <lb/> not touched upon that phase of the
                  speech <lb/> of the hon. the leader of the opposition <lb/> (Mr. R. L. Borden)
                  this afternoon. He real<lb break="no"/>izes that there is no explanation that can
                  <lb/> be forthcoming for his having treated his <lb/> Minister of the Interior so
                  cavalierly and <lb/> having so contemptuously treated indirectly <lb/> the people
                  of the west. There has been no <lb/> explanation of why he took so different <lb/>
                  a position from that of two or three years <lb/> ago when he would not even have a
                     con<lb break="no"/>ference in the absence of the Minister of the <lb/>
                  Interior. This information, I may say, did <lb/> not come from the right hon.
                  gentleman him<lb break="no"/>self ; it remained for the Minister of the
                  <lb/>Interior, upon his return to the House of <lb/>
                  <cb/> Commons when he saw for the first time <lb/> this Bill that has been
                  submitted to <choice>
                     <sic>parila<lb break="no"/>ment</sic>
                     <corr>parliament</corr>
                  </choice>, when he read the educational clauses, <lb/> and realized that he could
                  not consistently <lb/> give his support to the educational clauses <lb/> to sever
                  his official connection with the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and give an
                  explanation to the <lb/> members of the House, which conveyed the <lb/> idea to
                  every member in this House that that <lb/> hon. gentleman resented, and justly
                  resented, <lb/> the treatment accorded to him by his chief, <lb/> the head of the
                  government, in paying so <lb/> little respect to those views which the prem<lb break="no"/>ier knew quite well his colleague held. This <lb/> is especially
                  remarkable in view of the <lb/> policy that was laid down by the hon. <lb/>
                  gentleman and his colleagues no longer ago <lb/> than the session of 1904 in
                  regard to the <lb/> principle that was to guide the right hon. <lb/> gentleman and
                  his government in the divi<lb break="no"/>sion of ministerial responsibility. This
                  <lb/> has been referred to on a previous occa<lb break="no"/>sion, but it will
                  stand emphasizing, and <lb/> I desire to read this Order in Council where<lb break="no"/>in the hon. gentleman laid it down as his <lb/> guiding principle
                  as to how the affairs of <lb/> the country were to be managed. He said : <lb/>
               </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> In the case of members of the cabinet, while
                  <lb/> all have an equal degree of responsibility in a <lb/> constitutional sense,
                  yet in the practical work<lb break="no"/>ing out of responsible government, in a
                  country <lb/> of such vast extent as Canada, it is found neces<lb break="no"/>sary
                  to attach special responsibility to each <lb/> minister for the public affairs of
                  the province <lb/> or district with which he has close political <lb/> connection,
                  and with which his colleagues might <lb/> not be so well acquainted. <lb/>
               </quote>
               <p>And yet, notwithstanding that declara<lb break="no"/>tion of policy within eight
                  months of laying <lb/> down that principle to guide himself and <lb/> his
                  colleagues, he, the erstwhile democrat to <lb/> the hilt, in the most autocratic
                  manner, <lb/> rides roughshod over the terms of this <lb/> Order in Council and
                  practically ignores <lb/> the fact that he has a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior at all. The right hon. gentleman <lb/> knew quite well the very strong
                  views held <lb/> by his Minister of the Interior on that sepa<lb break="no"/>rate
                  school question. He was quite well <lb/> aware of the fact that in the west a few
                  <lb/> years ago he earned himself the sobriquet <lb/> of being the special
                  champion of national <lb/> schools. The right hon. gentleman knew <lb/> the strong
                  stand his minister had taken <lb/> against Dominion interference with matters
                  <lb/> that should be entirely under provincial con<lb break="no"/>trol and yet,
                  with this knowledge in his <lb/> possession, he had so little respect for his
                  <lb/> colleague from the west that he did not <lb/> even submit the educational
                  clauses to that <lb/> hon. gentleman. The right hon. gentleman <lb/> evidently did
                  not do so, to judge by the re<lb break="no"/>marks of the ex-Minister of the
                  Interior <lb/> himself. Is it at all surprising, therefore, <lb/> under the
                  circumstances that that gentle<lb break="no"/>man should resent such treatment and
                  <lb/> should sever his official connection with his <lb/> colleagues and should
                  step down and out. <lb/>

               <p>But, at the same time, the country, and <lb/> especially the west, is left
                  without a voice <lb/> in the council, without a representative of <lb/> the
                  western interests that are paramount, <lb/> at a time when they should have
                  somebody <lb/> in the cabinet to maintain their rights. The <lb/> Prime Minister
                  has informed this House <lb/> that he has taken no steps to fill this va<lb break="no"/>cancy, nor is it his intention to take any <lb/> immediate steps
                  towards that end. In order <lb/> that I may not do him any injustice, let <lb/>
                  the quote from 'Hansard' of March 9, the <lb/> right hon. gentleman's answer to a
                  question <lb/> of the leader of the opposition: <lb/>
               </p>
               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> My hon. friend asks a second question. He <lb/>
                  wants to know whether any action is to be <lb/> taken to fill the vacancy in the
                  portfolio of the <lb/> Interior caused by the retreat of my hon. friend <lb/> from
                  Brandon (Mr. Sifton). He is entitled to <lb/> a full and categorical answer. No
                  action has <lb/> been taken, and it is not my intention now to <lb/> take any
                  action in the way of filling that port<lb break="no"/>folio. <lb/>
               </quote>
               <p>Now, it is because of that declaration on <lb/> the part of the Prime Minister
                  that I rise <lb/> to protest as a western representative, <lb/> against this
                  procedure. The idea of having <lb/> these great questions considered without <lb/>
                  having that portfolio filled is contrary to <lb/> the best judgment of the people
                  of western <lb/> Canada. The Prime Minister may say that <lb/> there has been no
                  undue delay in filling <lb/> that portfolio, that a longer time has elapsed <lb/>
                  in filling other vacancies in other cabinets. <lb/> But this vacancy at this
                  particular time is <lb/> unique in its character, and there are very <lb/> special
                  reasons why the portfolio should be <lb/> tilled at the earliest possible moment.
                  In <lb/> the first place, the resignation has taken <lb/> place during the holding
                  of a session of <lb/> parliament, and even before the estimates <lb/> of this
                  department have received the ap<lb break="no"/>proval of this House. Important
                     transac<lb break="no"/>tions have been carried out under this de<lb break="no"/>partment since the session of 1904, espe<lb break="no"/>cially in regard to
                  western Canada, which <lb/> transactions should be explained to this <lb/> House
                  by a responsible head of that de<lb break="no"/>partment. Then, we have the
                  Autonomy <lb/> Bill, a Bill of vital importance and affecting <lb/> the whole
                  future of the people of western <lb/> Canada. The people of that portion of the
                  <lb/> country demand that they shall have a <lb/> voice at the council board. The
                  right hon. <lb/> Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) must <lb/> know that no
                  acting Minister of the Inte<lb break="no"/>rior, no colleague of his holding
                  another <lb/> portfolio, can possibly discharge the duties <lb/> of the Minister
                  of the Interior to the satis <lb/> faction of the people of the west, espe<lb break="no"/>cially at this juncture ; for they need a man <lb/> there whom they
                  can hold directly and espe<lb break="no"/>cially responsible for his official
                  acts. The <lb/> territory from the great lakes to the Pacific <lb/> ocean, a
                  territory some 2,000 miles from <lb/> side to side, is to-day without cabinet
                     repre<lb break="no"/>sentation. Fancy for a moment the great <lb/> province of
                  Quebec in a similar position. <lb/> Suppose that, with its 351,000 square miles, <lb/>
                  <cb/> a large portion of it were still without <lb/> provincial autonomy; and
                  suppose that a <lb/> Bill were submitted to this parliament to <lb/> confer upon
                  the territory organized all the <lb/> powers of local self government : and sup<lb break="no"/>pose that there were no representative of <lb/> those people in the
                  council to maintain their <lb/> rights ;—would not there be strong expres<lb break="no"/>sions of indignation ? And would not those <lb/> expressions be
                  justified and be supported <lb/> by every other portion of Canada? And <lb/>
                  still, to-day, we have all the territory west <lb/> of the great lakes, almost a
                  million square <lb/> miles, inhabited by almost a million souls, of <lb/> whom
                  half are in the new provinces about to <lb/> be created. and as yet they are left
                  without <lb/> anybody to stand up for their rights and <lb/> see that even—handed
                  justice is meted out <lb/> to them. Now, there is another great ques<lb break="no"/>tion that demands a representative in the <lb/> cabinet council to-day and one
                  in which, <lb/> as a representative of Manitoba, 1 am espe<lb break="no"/>cially
                  interested; I refer to the extension <lb/> of the boundaries of Manitoba. I will
                  not <lb/> enter into the merits of that question to<lb break="no"/>day. I have
                  only to say that we have had <lb/> many requests made to this government by <lb/>
                  the people of Manitoba through their legis<lb break="no"/>ature, speaking with
                  unanimous voice, for <lb/> the extension of the boundaries of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. This is a most opportune time to <lb/> have that question
                  settled, now that the <lb/> new territories are having their boundaries <lb/>
                  fixed. Let any one look at the map, and <lb/> he will see the proposed new
                  provinces with <lb/> an area of about 250,000 miles each. Brit<lb break="no"/>ish
                  Columbia with 370,000 miles, Ontario <lb/> with 200,000. and Quebec with 351,000 ;
                  <lb/> and, in contrast with these, you find little <lb/> Manitoba cribbed, cabined
                  and confined <lb/> within an area of 73,000 square miles. The <lb/> right hon.
                  Prime Minister gave his reason <lb/> why he would not accede to the request of
                  <lb/> the Prime Minister of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to have only
                  one province. He said <lb/> in effect: Look at this one territory of <lb/> 500,000
                  square miles, and then look at On<lb break="no"/>tario and Quebec with so much
                  less. Well, <lb/> turn the right hon. gentleman's argument <lb/> against himself ;
                  look at little Manitoba with <lb/> an area of 73,000 square miles in contrast
                  <lb/> with each of these other provinces with an <lb/> area of 250,000 square
                  miles. Any person <lb/> with a spirit of fairness must resent such <lb/> treatment
                  of Manitoba at the hands of the <lb/> Prime Minister. And what is the reason <lb/>
                  for this refusal on his part to listen to the <lb/> unanimous demand of the people
                  of Man<lb break="no"/>itoba ? I am afraid the right hon, gentle<lb break="no"/>man
                  has not been as frank with this House <lb/> as he might have been. I am not sure
                  that <lb/> we have had the true reason expressed pub<lb break="no"/>licly by the
                  representatives of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment why this treatment is meted out
                  to <lb/> Manitoba in regard to her boundaries. The <lb/> Prime Minister says that
                  the government <lb/> cannot even accede to the request to extend <lb/> the
                  boundaries of Manitoba northward to <lb/> Hudson's Bay, but must consult Quebec, <lb/>

                  shall <lb/> have to look to the press of the right hon. <lb/> gentleman to find
                  out the reason. The hon. <lb/> member for South York (Mr. W. F. Mac<lb break="no"/>lean) has told us already that the press <lb/> supporting the right hon.

                  these newspapers speak by the book <lb/> or not. The Prime Minister has stated
                  that <lb/> he must not be held responsible for the <lb/> utterances of his party
                  newspapers. But, <lb/> when a paper like the ' Le Soleil ' will an<lb break="no"/>nounce itself as follows : <lb/>

                  is one of our public men <lb/> who was mainly responsible for the pas<lb break="no"/>sage of that law. These gentlemen will <lb/> hardly agree that it

                  gave them every assistance in his power <lb/> to gain their re-election, and he
                  has been <lb/> heralded everywhere as the great concili<lb break="no"/>ator, the

                  of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) or why <lb/> he did not consult on this educational
                  <lb/> clause the First Minister of the Northwest <lb/> Territories. Who then did

                  not, except the sub<lb break="no"/>committee which drafted the clause. It <lb/>
                  may turn out that until noon on the day <lb/> the Bill was introduced, the other
                     mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the cabinet knew nothing about <lb/> that clause. I

                  another company that exists <lb/> and is doing business in the city, the ob<lb break="no"/>jection that the city takes to the Bill is that <lb/> if the powers

                  follows that they will purchase the stock <lb/> of the other company and thereby
                  destroy <lb/> competition. I do not know what the pro<lb break="no"/>moter of the

                  <lb/> my protest on behalf of the city against <lb/> the preamble. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I understood that this <lb/>
                  Bill was held back for a length of time un<lb break="no"/>til some arrangement was

                  company had the right to <lb/> increase the rates.  The  authorities  of  the
                  <lb/> city believe that if you take away from the <lb/> city the competition that
                  exists to—day the <lb/> rates will go up.   The  whole  gist  of  the <lb/>
                  question is that this legislation aims at de<lb break="no"/>stroying the
                  competition, with the result<lb/>that rates are bound to be increased.  The
                  <lb/>city does not object to the two companies <lb/> making a reasonable pro-fit.
                  If the rates are <lb/> too low, surely they can get adequate rates. <lb/> In reply
                  to the hon. member for South <lb/> Lanark (Mr. Haggart), as to the resolution
                  <lb/> passed by the city council, or the promise <lb/> made by it, I understand
                  him to say that <lb/> the city  of  Ottawa had promised a monopoly <lb/> to the
                  Ottawa Electric Company.   It is <lb/> true a resolution was passed by the council
                  <lb/> of the city of Ottawa promising a monopoly <lb/> to the Ottawa Electric
                  Company.   I  think it <lb/> is open to the members of the Ottawa city <lb/>
                  council to change their minds on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion.   Immediately
                  after the resolution was <lb/> passed—and it may have been secured in <lb/> some
                  way,  although I am not suggesting <lb/> anything of that kind—―notice of
                     reconsider<lb break="no"/>ation was given, and it was pointed out by <lb/> the
                  solicitor of the company that the resolu <lb/> tion promised something that no
                     municipali<lb break="no"/>ty could give, that in common law it was im<lb break="no"/>possible  to  grant  a  monopoly  to  any  one <lb/> company.   An 
                  illustration  of  the  fact  that <lb/> it was against the common law was shortly
                  <lb/> afterwards afforded by something that hap<lb break="no"/>pened in the
                  adjoining municipality of Hull. <lb/> The  corporation  of  the  city  of  Hull 
                     endea<lb break="no"/>voured to give a monopoly to the Hull Com<lb break="no"/>pany and the Ottawa Company,  which  is <lb/> to-day  seeking  a  monopoly  in 
                  the  city  of <lb/> Ottawa,  entered  a  protest ;  an  appeal  was <lb/> taken to
                  the courts, and it was found to be <lb/> a violation of the common law.  The
                  result <lb/> is that to—day there is competition in the <lb/> city of Hull, where
                  an endeavour was made <lb/> to create a monopoly.   Now the point made, <lb/> as I
                  understand it,  by  the hon.  member for <lb/> South Lanark is  that  the  city 
                  of  Ottawa <lb/> had entered into a bargain, or made a pro<lb break="no"/>mise,
                  that they afterwards did not keep. <lb/> It is true this resolution was passed by
                  the <lb/> city council, but I do not think that should <lb/> govern parliament. 
                  If we consider that in <lb/> our judgment it is a wrong thing to inter <lb/>fere
                  with the vested rights of the city of <lb/> Ottawa, then I do not believe we
                  should pass <lb/> this legislation.  We should not interfere <lb/> with the rights
                  of the municipality. <lb/>

                  are clauses in the Bill <lb/> which are not objectionable, and when we <lb/> reach

                  Speaker,  I  would not rise to-night to ad<lb break="no"/>dress this House on this
                  question,  which <lb/> has been so well discussed this afternoon <lb/>—perhaps I
                  shall only be repeating very <lb/> many of the statements that have been <lb/>
                  already made—were it not that I felt it to <lb/> be an imperative duty.  There are
                  one or <lb/> two reasons why I believe it imperative that <lb/> I should have
                  something to say on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion.  I will endeavour to-night, in
                  the few <lb/> remarks which I make, not to discuss the <lb/> Bill.  There seems to
                  be a great tempta<lb break="no"/>tion to enter into a discussion of the Bill.
                  <lb/> When the proper time comes to discuss the <lb/> Bill, I hope to have an
                  opportunity of mak<lb break="no"/>ing a few remarks. But I will say right <lb/>
                  here that when the proper time comes my <lb/> effort will be to address this House
                  on that <lb/> question in a manner absolutely free from <lb/> offence to any creed
                  or any set of people <lb/> in this House or in this country.  I believe <lb/> that
                  this great question in connection with <lb/> the formation  of  these two
                  provinces in <lb/> the Northwest  is  more than a provincial <lb/> question ; it 
                  is  a  national  question ;  and <lb/> I  believe  that  whatever  men,  or
                  whatever <lb/> hon.  members  on  this  or  the  other  side <lb/> of the House
                  think, that is the way in which <lb/> we should endeavour to discuss it.   There
                  <lb/> are one or two reasons why I wish to tres<lb break="no"/>pass upon the time
                  of the House.   One is <lb/> that I represent a constituency of the west, <lb/>
                  which I can say—and I do not do it boast<lb break="no"/>fully—has to—day more
                  elevators and grows <lb/> more wheat, although it is somewhat of a <lb/> large
                  district, than any other section of a <lb/> similar size in the Dominion of
                  Canada. <lb/>One other reason why I would like to make <lb/> a few remarks is that
                  the present govern<lb break="no"/>ment were good enough to give us, before <lb/>
                  the last election,  increased representation. <lb/> In order that we might have
                  that increased <lb/> representation, it was necessary that the <lb/>
                  constituencies that already existed should <lb/> be divided.   I was particularly
                  favoured by <lb/> having the honour of contesting a portion <lb/> of the
                  constituency which has been repre― <lb/> sented by the hon. member for
                  Brandon <lb/>(Mr.  Sifton).   I  was  given  the  south  half. <lb/> In the south
                  half of that constituency, which <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">2550</fw> was controlled by and which always elected <lb/> my hon.
                  friend the member for Brandon <lb/> when he was able to bring those wonderful
                  <lb/> powers which he possessed to bear upon the <lb/> electorate, he was able to
                  secure a majority <lb/> of 200 or 300. To-day, after that power has <lb/> been
                  withdrawn, the same people who elect<lb break="no"/>ed him were good enough to
                  elect me by a <lb/> majority of a little over 500. Knowing, as <lb/> I do what
                  these same people think on this <lb/> great question, I feel it my duty to
                  trespass <lb/> upon the time of the House for a short <lb/> while. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, although I am new in <lb/> this parliament, I am not very new
                  in the <lb/> matter of years, and I am not very new in <lb/> my knowledge of the
                  political aspect of <lb/> this country and of my friends who sit on <lb/> the
                  other side of the House. Living so <lb/> near as I do to the hon. member for
                     Bran<lb break="no"/>don (Mr. Sifton), we became to same extent <lb/> at least
                  chums—I do not know if that is a <lb/> parliamentary expression, but it is at all
                  <lb/> events a somewhat endearing term. I do <lb/> not suppose the hon. gentleman
                  (Mr. Sifton) <lb/> wants my sympathy, but I cannot help be<lb break="no"/>ing a
                  little sensitive for him and I feel very <lb/> deeply the manner in which he was
                  treated <lb/> in connection with this Bill. Some time <lb/> ago, when we asked the
                  First Minister as <lb/> to when the member for Brandon might be <lb/> expected
                  back, we were told he was in the <lb/> south for his health. Soon after that Bill
                  <lb/> was introduced, and from a health point of <lb/> view it was very unfair to
                  compel the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior to make such a break <lb/>
                  neck journey to Ottawa, and after getting <lb/> here to force him to rush out on
                  the street <lb/> to ascertain what were the contents of the <lb/> Autonomy Bill
                  which had been introduced <lb/> to parliament. The Prime Minister told
                  us <lb/>to-day that the member for East Grey (Mr. <lb/> Sproule) had asked for
                  three weeks' delay <lb/> between the first and second readings of <lb/> this Bill,
                  but hon. gentleman will remember <lb/> with what derisive cheers from the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment supporters that request of the <lb/> member for East Grey
                  was met at the time. <lb/> The three weeks asked for by the mem<lb break="no"/>ber
                  for Grey have passed and although <lb/> this House of Commons has not been <lb/>
                  very busy, we are still waiting for the <lb/> second reading. To-day the honoured
                  leader <lb/> of the opposition endeavoured to get some <lb/> information from the
                  premier as to when <lb/> the second reading would be moved, and <lb/> when that
                  request was made a gentleman <lb/> on the Liberal benches remarked : You will
                  <lb/> know soon. Well, I for one, would like to <lb/> know how long that 'soon'
                  is. We have <lb/> the information now that the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr.
                  Sifton) was not consulted as to <lb/> this Bill, that the Minister of Finance
                  was <lb/>not consulted either, and that Mr. Haultain, <lb/> the Prime Minister of
                  the Territories was <lb/> not consulted as to the educational clauses. <lb/> The
                  Prime Minister tried to make out that <lb/> Mr. Haultain had been consulted, but I
                  <lb/> have too much confidence in the ability of <lb/>
                  <!--82<lb/>-->
                  <cb/> the right hon. gentleman to think that he <lb/> for one moment thought that
                  he was mak<lb break="no"/>ing the House believe any such thing. So <lb/> far as we
                  know at present, the Minister of <lb/> the Interior, the Minister of Finance, Mr.
                  <lb/> Haultain and the members of parliament <lb/> from the Northwest Territories
                  were not <lb/> consulted on this matter. Right here I <lb/> would like to say that
                  this afternoon <lb/> during the discussion of this great question, <lb/> not one
                  member from the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories supporting the government
                  was in <lb/> his place in the House. I do not know all <lb/> these members and
                  that statement may not <lb/> be correct, but I am told that it is a fact. <lb/>
                  Any way, whether they were here or not <lb/> they were absolutely silent on the
                  question <lb/> and I suppose the inference is they are <lb/> satisfied with what
                  has occurred. I have <lb/> not such a deep interest in the other mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the government as I have in the <lb/> member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton)
                  and there<lb break="no"/>fore I am not so concerned in the fact that <lb/> the
                  others were not consulted about this <lb/> matter, but I really do feel chagrined
                  that <lb/> the Minister of the Interior should have <lb/> been so slighted. There
                  are other gentle<lb break="no"/>ment in the cabinet, who, if they were con<lb break="no"/>sulted must have experienced an extraor<lb break="no"/>dinary
                  conversion from their views if they <lb/> gave their consent to such a measure as
                  <lb/> that now before the House. In 1896, when <lb/> the Manitoba school question
                  was before <lb/> parliament, the present Minister of Mili<lb break="no"/>tia (Sir
                  Frederick Borden) said : <lb/></p>

                     Speaker, in the province of New Brunswick we <lb/> have a law similar to that
                     of Nova Scotia. I <lb/> was here during part or the time in 1872-73-74 <lb/>
                     when the question of the New Brunswick school <lb/> was brought up by the
                     present Minister of <lb/> Marine and Fisheries, who invited us to inter<lb break="no"/>fere. Wisely, Sir, we abstained from interfer<lb break="no"/>ence, and what is the result to-day ? The re<lb break="no"/>sult is that in
                     New Brunswick the law is being <lb/> administered in a way that is satisfactory
                     to <lb/> all classes of the community. Suppose we had <lb/> listened to the
                     hon. gentleman who now fills <lb/> the position of Minister of Marine and
                        Fisher<lb break="no"/>ies, who so eloquently urged upon us the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of interfering with the legislation of New <lb/> Brunswick,
                     and had undertaken to interfere <lb/> with the laws of that province. Suppose
                     we <lb/> had interfered, what would have been the posi<lb break="no"/>tion in
                     that province to-day ? Think you that <lb/> you would have had the same
                     amicable and <lb/> friendly relations between that province and <lb/> this
                     Dominion that exists to-day ?  No, Sir. If <lb/> the hon. gentleman had
                     prevailed he would have <lb/> sown the seed of discord throughout this Domin<lb break="no"/>ion. As a result I say that to-day you have in <lb/> the
                     province of New Brunswick as happy a con<lb break="no"/>dition of things as
                     exists in the province of <lb/> Nova Scotia, so also in the province of Prince
                     <lb/> Edward Island. There is a Public School Act <lb/> and there is no

                  takes the stand for provincial <lb/> rights he thinks the minority should be <lb/>
                  considered, he thinks that before any great <lb/> change in the policy of the
                  country is made <lb/> there should be an investigation. He thinks <lb/> that if

                  own <lb/> interest and in the interests of all parts of <lb/> the Dominion. I have

                  pioneers in that western country ; <lb/> they have been pioneers in reference to
                  <lb/> the government of that western country. <lb/> In that case are they not
                  deserving of some <lb/> rights now ? When the First Minister <lb/> wanted to make
                  two provinces in the North<lb break="no"/>west he seems to have been determined on
                  <lb/> making them so large that even the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Calgary, who
                  lives in that district, <lb/> thinks they are too large and yet he did <lb/> not
                  even consult the Minister of the Inte<lb break="no"/>rior or the Minister of
                  Finance or I believe <lb/> the Minister of Militia, or several other <lb/>

                  replying to straight away questions <lb/> put from this side of the House, and say
                  so <lb/> little. It seemed to me that he absolutely <lb/> failed to give
                  information. I suppose, per<lb break="no"/>haps, that is part of the game and that
                  I <lb/> have not been here long enough to under<lb break="no"/>stand, but I think
                  on some points at least <lb/> we should have the information we asked. <lb/> He
                  said to-day that although this question <lb/> had been before the people for some
                  three <lb/> weeks the only fault found with it was in <lb/> connection with the
                  school clauses. This <lb/> House must remember that the people who <lb/> are most
                  interested in that clause are scat<lb break="no"/>tered over very many hundred
                  miles of <lb/> this country and it takes quite a long while <lb/> for mails to
                  reach them, but if that hon. <lb/> gentleman has not yet received any commu<lb break="no"/>nication from that country objecting to any <lb/> other clause
                  except the school clause, I <lb/> wish to read to-night a petition that has <lb/>
                  been received since the meeting of the <lb/> House this afternoon, which will show
                  that <lb/> there are others and perhaps just as great <lb/> objections to this
                  Bill. This petition is as <lb/> follows : <lb/>

                  country west of Lake Superior is not repre<lb break="no"/>sented to-day in the
                  Dominion government. <lb/> However great his ability may be, no man <lb/> on
                  either side of this House at such a time <lb/> in the history of the country as
                  this can <lb/> be Prime Minister and at the same time <lb/> perform with
                  satisfaction the duties of the <lb/> Minister of the Interior. I hold that this
                  <lb/> cannot be done, and I want to say further <lb/> that I do not want to
                  detract from any east<lb break="no"/>ern province. Nearly all of us who have <lb/>
                  been in that western country for 20, 25 <lb/> and 30 years, who have been
                  pioneers, <lb/> nothwithstanding that we have made that <lb/> country our home, we
                  are sons of the east <lb/>―I am sure this is true of the majority of <lb/> the
                  people of that country—and we are <lb/> loyal to the east. Personally, though I
                  have <lb/> been in the west for twenty-four years, I <lb/> never hear the word '
                  Nova Scotia ' spoken <lb/> but it fills me with pride. And I believe <lb/> that is
                  true of every easterner. Every <lb/> member of this House, I am sure, believes
                  <lb/> that if this Canada of ours is to be a great <lb/> country like the country
                  to the south of us, <lb/> great in population, in trade and in wealth, <lb/> the
                  resources upon which its progress must <lb/> be based lie west of Lake Superior.
                  We <lb/> have, perhaps, to take some of our lessons <lb/> from the east, but it we
                  are to become <lb/> great, if we are ever to have forty or fifty <lb/> millions of
                  inhabitants, it must be because <lb/> of the resources of the west. And yet that
                  <lb/> country is deprived of a man in the <lb/> council to represent our case as
                  it should <lb/> be represented. That is not a condition of <lb/> affairs that
                  ought to exist to-day. I think <lb/> I need not say more on the subject of the
                  <lb/> extension of the boundaries. If I were to <lb/> talk for an hour I could not
                  make myself <lb/> better understood than by the statement <lb/> that I believe it
                  is the right of Manitoba <lb/> to have her boundaries extended. And we <lb/>
                  should have at once a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, a man who can do
                  our business for us. <lb/> And I would like to make a suggestion<lb break="no"/>well, no ; I have no right to put it that way; <lb/> I would like to submit a
                  request—to the <lb/> First Minister that when he, in his own <lb/> good time,
                  appoints a Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior, he will appoint a man who is
                     res<lb break="no"/>ponsible to the people. We do not want a <lb/> man, however
                  great his ability may be, that <lb/> belongs to some constituency in which he
                  <lb/> is not directly responsible to the people. I <lb/> would like to see some
                  constituency in the <lb/> west opened up to test public opinion on <lb/> these
                  great questions. I think we are <lb/> ready for it. When this question was being
                  <lb/> settled for Manitoba the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Sir Wilfrid
                  Laurier) was very an<lb break="no"/>xious for investigation. Well, Mr. Speaker,
                  <lb/> don't you think that a very good way to <lb/> find out what the people think
                  upon this <lb/> question would be to throw open one of the <lb/> constituencies ?
                  We are not very particular <lb/> which constituency in the west these hon. <lb/>
                  gentlemen decide to open ; any of them will <lb/>

               </p>
               <p>only a few minutes of your time, Mr. Speaker, <lb/> in stating, as briefly as
                  possible my views on <lb/> the phase of the provincial autonomy ques<lb break="no"/>tion that is now before us. I was much <lb/> surprised to hear the Prime
                  Minister (Sir <lb/> Wilfrid Laurier) state this afternoon that <lb/> he believed
                  that the clauses of his Bill af<lb break="no"/>fecting education were the only
                  clauses not <lb/> satisfactory to the people of the Northwest <lb/> Territories.
                  If the Prime Minister believes <lb/> that he expresses the opinions of the people
                  <lb/> of the Northwest when he says that, except <lb/> for the educational
                  clauses, they are entirely <lb/> in accord with the Bill, I can only tell him
                  <lb/> that I believe that he is mistaken. What his <lb/> sources of information
                  may be, I do not <lb/> know. But this is one of the reasons, I <lb/> think, why we
                  should have a Minister of <lb/> the Interior to represent that country and <lb/>
                  express at the council board the wishes <lb/> of its people. Dealing with the
                  question <lb/> which involves such important questions, <lb/> such grave financial
                  responsibilities and con<lb break="no"/>trols such vast areas of land, and dealing
                  <lb/> also with the right of half a million people, <lb/> it seems perfectly plain
                  that those people <lb/> should be represented in the government. <lb/> I do not
                  consider that we are represented <lb/> at this time. And that is one of the ob<lb break="no"/>jections the people have to the present <lb/> situation. We in the
                  Northwest will not <lb/> be satisfied unless we get the handling of <lb/> our own
                  lands and our own minerals. I for <lb/> one believe that no compensation could be
                  <lb/> given by this government that would re<lb break="no"/>concile the people of
                  that country to being <lb/> deprived of this control, for this involves <lb/> far
                  more than dollars and cents to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. I wish to put myself on
                  record as say<lb break="no"/>ing that there are several clauses in the Bill <lb/>
                  as objectionable to our people as the clauses <lb/> dealing with education. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Hon. GEORGE E. FOSTER</persName> (North To<lb break="no"/>ronto). Mr. Speaker, the discussion of this <lb/> afternoon, I
                  believe, has not been without <lb/> its lessons for this House and the country.
                  <lb/> Any one of an observant turn of mind sit<lb break="no"/>ting in the gallery
                  or even on the floor of <lb/> this House, would have thought over a great <lb/>
                  many things, while many deductions from <lb/> the circumstances would have forced
                     them<lb break="no"/>selves upon his mind. Why is it, for in<lb break="no"/>stance, that when an important question of <lb/> this kind is being discussed we
                  are not <lb/> afforded even the courtesy of having res<lb break="no"/>ponsible
                  ministers—still ministers, however <lb/> long they may continue in their
                     positions<lb break="no"/>in their seats ? The conduct of the policy <lb/> of
                  the government of which they form, I <lb/> suppose, a responsible part is being
                  reviewed <lb/> by His Majesty's loyal opposition. I do not <lb/> think there is
                  any sufficient answer to that <lb/>
                  <cb/> question. I think these ministers ought to <lb/> be here. I think they owe
                  it to themselves, <lb/> to those they represent and to the country <lb/> at large
                  to be present in their seats. And <lb/> yet, as this discussion has gone on the
                     ob<lb break="no"/>servant person would have noticed that <lb/> at one time
                  there would be but one minister <lb/> in his seat, at another time two, sometimes
                  <lb/> even three, but the number always very <lb/> small. Now, it may be good
                  policy for hon. <lb/> gentlemen opposite to affect a show of <lb/> indifference,
                  and, perhaps, at the same <lb/> time to conceal their true feeling, which is <lb/>
                  not indifference, but a very genuine discom<lb break="no"/>fiture at the mistakes
                  they have made and <lb/> the position in which they find themselves. <lb/> Why is
                  it also that when a subject involving <lb/> so greatly, the interests of the
                  Northwest <lb/> is under review, we find almost all the <lb/> members on the other
                  side representing con<lb break="no"/>stituencies in the Northwest Territories
                     ab<lb break="no"/>senting themselves from their places ?  <lb/> Was it because
                  they have such superior <lb/> knowledge and such superior parts that they <lb/>
                  did not think it consistent with their high <lb/> qualities to listen to
                  animadversions and <lb/> to statements reflecting on a policy of the <lb/>
                  government or a Bill which vitally afects <lb/> themselves ? I do not think it
                  was. I think <lb/> that their modesty would not allow them <lb/> to come to any
                  such conclusion. Then <lb/> was it because they were supremely care<lb break="no"/>less and did not care a fig how things <lb/> went? I hardly think it was that
                  either. <lb/>Or was it because they were schooled to <lb/> silence and told to say
                  nothing and get <lb/> out of the House? Perhaps that would <lb/> come nearer the
                  right answer than either <lb/> of the other suppositions I have made. <lb/> These
                  hon. gentlemen opposite were wont <lb/> to be voluble enough. In 1896, their
                     ton<lb break="no"/>gues were not tied. When they were on <lb/> this side of the
                  House they had a volume <lb/> of speech and sound which was admirable, <lb/> long
                  continued and vehement it seemed <lb/> to come from inexhaustible sources. Why
                  <lb/> are those gentlemen so silent now ? Why <lb/> is it they have not a single
                  word to say in <lb/> their own defence? Why is it that res<lb break="no"/>ponsible
                  ministers who, I suppose, count <lb/> for something in the cabinet—some min<lb break="no"/>isters do count for something—why is it <lb/> that two of them at
                  any rate who counted <lb/> for something were forestalled deliberately <lb/>
                  before the Bill was brought down. The <lb/> others who remained, and who presum<lb break="no"/>ably did not count for much, were simply <lb/> taken in hand by
                  that autocrat, the First <lb/> Minister. His Bill was rushed in and he <lb/>
                  practically said to these gentlemen : there <lb/> it is before you and the country
                  ; you can <lb/> support it or not as you please. I make <lb/> bold to say, Mr.
                  Speaker, that never before <lb/> has any parliament witnessed such an <lb/>
                  exhibition. Like whipped children fearing <lb/> the lash, yet afraid to confess
                  their faults, <lb/> the members of the government, from the <lb/>

                  plural but in the <lb/> singular—or if the Prime Minister attempts <lb/> an
                  answer, it is an attempt not to give <lb/> the information but to evade the
                  questions <lb/> put to him. I put it to the right hon. <lb/> gentleman as a
                  serious sensible man : Is <lb/> it or is it not a question to which the op<lb break="no"/>position and the country have the right to <lb/> an answer, why he
                  rushed his Bill into <lb/> parliament as the measure of a united <lb/> government
                  when he knew that his two <lb/> most important ministers were diametri<lb break="no"/>cally opposed to one of the principal <lb/> clauses in that Bill,
                  and had placed them<lb break="no"/>selves on record as irrevocably pledged <lb/>
                  against it time and again ? Was not that <lb/> somewhat peculiar? One by one the
                     pre<lb break="no"/>tenses of the right hon. gentleman have <lb/> been struck
                  from him, and by this time he <lb/> stands before this House and country <lb/>
                  pretty bare. He is no longer the some<lb break="no"/>what picturesque object he
                  was a few <lb/> months ago. Shorn of his feathers and <lb/> his beautiful colours,
                  he is coming to be <lb/> known more and more for what he is and <lb/> what he has
                  proved himself. If in 1896, <lb/> my right hon. friend secured any popu<lb break="no"/>larity among the staunch stalwart Lib<lb break="no"/>erals of this
                  country, he secured it solely <lb/> because he then made himself the cham<lb break="no"/>pion of provincial rights. And if to-day <lb/> he has forfeited the
                  respect, esteem and <lb/> confidence of thousands and tens of thou<lb break="no"/>sands in this country, as he has, it is be<lb break="no"/>cause he has at last
                  come out in his true <lb/> colours as being the opponent and not the <lb/>
                  champion of provincial rights. It is be<lb break="no"/>cause he has reversed his
                  position. The <lb/> position of 1896' was apparently a brave <lb/> one. That of
                  1905 is an entirely dif<lb break="no"/>ferent one, and to it is due the loss <lb/>
                  of respect and confidence of which the <lb/> right hon. gentleman and his
                  colleagues <lb/> are only too well aware. The speech <lb/> which he delivered in
                  this House not <lb/> two weeks ago abounded in pretense <lb/> and assumption, but
                  when the facts come <lb/> to be known these are stripped from it <lb/> one after
                  the other. He declared that he <lb/> was about to put the crown of complete <lb/>
                  and absolute autonomy on these western <lb/> territories, and all his people
                  behind him <lb/> cried out amen, and rent the air with their <lb/> plaudits. But
                  five minutes after any one <lb/> of them that listened knew that the two <lb/>
                  most sparkling gems in that crown, the <lb/> control of education, the right to
                  the pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands, were missing and thus rendered <lb/> his
                  statement absolutely meaningless and <lb/> without foundation. In 1896, what was
                  <lb/> the plea of the right hon. gentleman ? It <lb/> was that he wanted to
                  consult the people <lb/> whose interests were chiefly affected. He <lb/> wanted to
                  get at the exact condition of <lb/>
                  <cb/>
                  <!--<p>Mr FOSTER.

                  things amongst the people of Manitoba in <lb/> order that he might find out the
                  exact <lb/> remedy to be applied. He wanted to know <lb/> exactly what the people
                  desired. He was, <lb/> as he had often boasted, a democrat up <lb/> to the hilt
                  and—he wished to find out ex<lb break="no"/>actly what the people required and
                  carry <lb/> out their will. What reason had he for <lb/> not giving autonomy a
                  year ago? Because <lb/> he wanted to wait until he had ten repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from that country in this House <lb/> instead of four. He wanted also
                  to have <lb/> the executive of the Northwest here in or<lb break="no"/>der that he
                  might confer with them. And <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>yet when I asked the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man tonight whether he
                  embodied in that <lb/> educational clause any of the fruits of that <lb/> wide and
                  thorough consultation of the <lb/> wishes of the 500,000 people of the North<lb break="no"/>west, what answer has he? He must <lb/> answer that he had not.
                  When I asked him <lb/> whether in that same clause be embodied <lb/> the results
                  of his conferences and inter<lb break="no"/>changes of opinion with the executive
                  of <lb/> the Northwest Territories, his reply and <lb/> that of Mr. Haultain taken
                  together show <lb/> that he did not. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>I ask him and ask hon. members from the <lb/> Northwest sitting on that side of
                  the House <lb/> if the educational clause embodied their last <lb/> thought, or
                  deepest conviction, or complete <lb/> assent, to what ought to be given to their
                  <lb/> people in the Northwest, and I have but to <lb/> ask the question to answer
                  it. Can the <lb/> right hon. Prime Minister say that he did ? <lb/> Yet in his
                  speech he declared that what he <lb/> had the benefit of was, not only the
                     consul<lb break="no"/>tation with, but the advice of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the Northwest. Let him <lb/> get up and answer now whether the
                     educa<lb break="no"/>tional clause embodied the advice, the last <lb/> thought,
                  and best thought of the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives from the Northwest. Let
                  any <lb/> representative from the Northwest get up <lb/> and say that it did so. I
                  challenge them <lb/> to-night—those that are here—I challenge <lb/> them. Does
                  that clause represent them ? <lb/> Did it represent them when it was brought <lb/>
                  down ? Does it represent them now ? <lb/> There is not a man of them that will get
                  up <lb/> on his legs and say that it does. All of the <lb/> preceding negotiations
                  of the Northwest in <lb/> reference to autonomy went on the as<lb break="no"/>sumption that the man chiefly to be em<lb break="no"/>ployed, the medium chiefly
                  to be considered, <lb/> the representative through whom all the <lb/> ideas should
                  filter to the government, <lb/> was the right hon. gentleman's Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior. Does he deny that ? <lb/> The records show it. The whole
                  course <lb/> of the administration shows it. It was <lb/> so in our time ; the
                  people from the <lb/> outside get to the inside of the cabinet <lb/> through an
                  accredited member of it. It is <lb/> more so now, because, at the instigation of
                  <lb/> my right hon. friend himself, the govern<lb break="no"/>ment have enlarged
                  and strengthened the <lb/> functions of the cabinet minister. Not only <lb/> have
                  they made each a cabinet minister as <lb/>

                  <lb/> to the country at large, but they have in<lb break="no"/>vested him with
                  what we may call a geo<lb break="no"/>graphical ministerial responsibility, and
                  <lb/> they have declared above board, honestly, <lb/> we suppose, earnestly, we
                  know, that the <lb/> new doctrine has been embodied in the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this country, that a minister is <lb/> not only responsible to the
                  whole country, <lb/> but he is especially responsible to the geo<lb break="no"/>graphical division which he is more inti<lb break="no"/>mately connected with.
                  Now, Sir, if that <lb/> were good for a Fisher, why is it <lb/> not good for a
                  Sifton ? If that were good <lb/> enough when you wanted some machinery <lb/> and
                  engineering in order to carry out a <lb/> piece of vile patronage, why is it not a
                  <lb/> thousand times better when the rights of <lb/> 500,000 free people in the
                  great and grow<lb break="no"/>ing Northwest are in question ? Good, when <lb/> you
                  want to suppress a Dundonald, but bad, <lb/> when you want to use it as the means
                  <lb/> for keeping these 500,000 people from get<lb break="no"/>ting their wishes
                  embodied in parliamentary <lb/> form. The pretense of absolute and com<lb break="no"/>plete autonomy has been completely <lb/> stripped off from the
                  right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman. These pretenses were lovely and <lb/>
                  beautiful when the speech was being de<lb break="no"/>livered, and all the men on
                  that side of the <lb/> House said 'amen' and rent the air with <lb/> their
                  plaudits. What do they think now, <lb/> that these pretenses are stripped off ? 
                     To<lb break="no"/>day the Northwest has no representative in <lb/> the cabinet.
                  To-day I cannot say that the <lb/> Northwest has any friend in the cabinet. <lb/>
                  You are not legislating here for the province <lb/> of Nova Scotia, you are not
                  legislating here <lb/> for the province of Prince Edward Island, <lb/> you are not
                  legislating here for the province <lb/> of New Brunswick, of Quebec, of Ontario or
                  <lb/> of British Columbia. Only in a general <lb/> way are you legislating for
                  these provinces, <lb/> and in this particular Bill that general way <lb/> is a
                  very small way indeed. Thus we, the <lb/> representative of these other provinces,
                  are <lb/> legislating for a great people now and an im<lb break="no"/>mensely
                  greater people hereafter, laying <lb/> down a hard granite mould, outside of <lb/>
                  which they cannot step or run in their great <lb/> growing life for all the years
                  that are to <lb/> come. Yet these gentlemen who stood up in <lb/> 1896 to demand
                  provincial rights, who stood <lb/> up in 1896 in strong demand that the people
                  <lb/> in the country for which that legislation <lb/> was demanded were the people
                  whose <lb/> wishes and will were to be found out—these <lb/> people to-day rush
                  into legislation without <lb/> consulting the accredited representative of <lb/>
                  the Northwest, who, I do not think, have <lb/> a single friend in the cabinet. Why
                  should <lb/> I think they have not a single friend in the <lb/> cabinet ? Who is a
                  friend ? The hon. Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior had his convictions. He
                  <lb/> made them known. The right hon. First <lb/> Minister knew them. But there
                  were other <lb/> men who said they had convictions. The <lb/> hon. minister who
                  sits alongside my right <lb/> hon. friend, the Postmaster General (Sir <lb/>
                  William Mulock), said in 1896 that he had <lb/>
                  <cb/> convictions. They were as strong as those <lb/> that were held by the
                  Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior. That hon. minister has been in the <lb/>
                  cabinet. He has seen his brother minister <lb/> who had convictions leave it for
                  these con<lb break="no"/>victions. He himself has subscribed to the <lb/> clause
                  which has made it necessary for his <lb/> brother minister, the Minister of the
                     In<lb break="no"/>terior, to leave the cabinet. Can we count <lb/> upon the
                  hon. Postmaster General as a <lb/> friend of the Northwest Territories ? We <lb/>
                  have got to say this, that the hon. Postmas<lb break="no"/>ter General agreed with
                  the legislation, <lb/> helped to frame it, stands by it, let his con<lb break="no"/>victions of the past be what they may have <lb/> been. We know the hon.
                  Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral to be a man who has ideals when they <lb/> are
                  pleasant, who has ideals, and high ones, <lb/> when he is aiming for power, but
                  who for<lb break="no"/>gets to practise them when once he gets <lb/> into power.
                  What have we to-day ?  My <lb/> right hon. friend has declared before this <lb/>
                  House that he does not propose to take into <lb/> consideration at present the
                  nomination of <lb/> a minister of the Northwest Territories. <lb/> How long are we
                  going to sit in this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment without having a minister for the
                  <lb/> Northwest Territories, without having the <lb/> cabinet filled up ? The hon.
                  Postmaster <lb/> General had ideals at one time. One ideal <lb/> was that you
                  should not keep offices <lb/> dangling before the minds and eyes of re<lb break="no"/>presentatives for fear you might influence <lb/> them corruptly.
                  What a splendid thing to <lb/> keep dangling to-day is the ministership for <lb/>
                  the Northwest Territories ? How effective<lb break="no"/>ly my right hon. friend
                  might use it, and <lb/> he knows how to use such things. He used <lb/> them with
                  Mr. Langelier, and all the world <lb/> knows it. He has been using them ever <lb/>
                  since, and all Canada knows it. How nice <lb/> it is to see him now holding this
                     Minister<lb break="no"/>ship of the Interior up before the gaze of <lb/> all
                  the members from the Northwest, as <lb/> much as to say—and it is not necessary
                  for <lb/> the right hon. First Minister to say it in <lb/> words—behold the
                  beautiful thing ! See the <lb/> patronage and power that are attached to <lb/> it!
                  Look at the splendour which crowns <lb/> it ! It is for one of you, which one I do
                  not <lb/> say ;  but it is certainly not going to the <lb/> chap who does not
                  stand by me. Yet the <lb/> hon. Postmaster General, who made a long <lb/> crusade
                  against that kind of thing at a <lb/> period when he had ideals, helps to forward
                  <lb/> the same gross and material conception as <lb/> an aid to twentieth century
                  statesmanship. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Where is the Minister of Finance ? He <lb/> too was a brother of the Minister of
                  the <lb/> Interior in these good old days when they <lb/> were straining for power
                  and when it was <lb/> popular to advocate provincial rights. Can <lb/> any
                  stronger statements be made by any<lb break="no"/>body than were made by the
                  Minister of <lb/> Finance ? Is that the reason why the Bill <lb/> should have been
                  brought down before the <lb/> Minister of Finance got here ? Any way <lb/> the
                  Bill is down and the education clause is <lb/> in it. Is the Minister of Finance a

                  Minister of the Interior ? Their opi<lb break="no"/>nions were the same, their
                  convictions were <lb/> the same, one has stood by his convictions <lb/> and gone
                  out—the other, where oh where is <lb/> he ? It is said that he may go out ; well,
                  he <lb/> may go out. And there is the Minister of <lb/> Customs, not in his seat
                  of course, but <lb/> the Minister of Customs has a record on <lb/> this very
                  question. In what thundering <lb/> tones in 1892 and 1896 and years inclusive,
                  <lb/> did he pulverize these Tories who were <lb/> against provincial rights.
                  Where is he to<lb break="no"/>day ? Is he a friend of the Northwest, or <lb/> does
                  he believe in the school clause as it is, <lb/> and has he been one of those who
                  has fa<lb break="no"/>voured it and brought it down, and so <lb/> must stand by
                  it. And the Minister of <lb/> Militia ; his record has been read. The <lb/>
                  statements he made in 1896 were as strong <lb/> as ginger ; were stronger in fact.
                  Does he <lb/> too acquiesce ? Now, there is the govern<lb break="no"/>ment for
                  you, with all its pretenses stripped, <lb/> with its professions of 1896
                  absolutely re<lb break="no"/>versed, flinging to the winds anything <lb/> smacking
                  of the democratic idea of con<lb break="no"/>sulting the people whose interests
                  are at <lb/> stake. And, like the autocratic Czar of <lb/> Russia, the Prime
                  Minister rushing his Bill <lb/> in before his ministers can get together to <lb/>
                  consult him, declaring the Bill to embody his <lb/> doctrine and the doctrine on
                  which he is <lb/> bound to stand. What is the weakness of <lb/> the Czar of Russia
                  to-day ? It is because <lb/> he does not consult the people ; it is worse <lb/>
                  than that : it is because while not consult<lb break="no"/>ing the people he
                  consults only the Grand <lb/> Dukes. The Prime Minister of Canada is in <lb/> the
                  same position to-day. The people, are <lb/> the 500,000, out in the west for whom
                  he <lb/> legislates. Who are the grand dukes ? We <lb/> know right well whom he
                  has not con<lb break="no"/>sulted, but do we know whom he has con<lb break="no"/>sulted if there has been any consulting. I <lb/> am bound to say that if anybody
                  is to be <lb/> consulted it is the members of this House <lb/> primarily, and it
                  is essentially the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the people of the great
                     North<lb break="no"/>west for whom we are legislating in this <lb/> matter.
                  When my friend the leader of the <lb/> opposition put his question and put his
                  case <lb/> today, every man in this House noticed <lb/> how he was answered. The
                  question was : <lb/> Why so much haste to get the Bill down <lb/> two days before
                  two of his most responsible <lb/> ministers could arrive here, when three <lb/>
                  weeks have since elapsed without a step <lb/> in advance ? That was a fair honest
                     ques<lb break="no"/>tion. What was the answer the right hon. <lb/> gentleman
                  gave ? Did he himself believe <lb/>in that answer ? Did any man who heard <lb/>
                  him believe in it ? He tried to make it ap<lb break="no"/>pear that this delay was
                  all due to the fact <lb/> that my hon. friend from Grey (Mr. Sproule) <lb/> asked
                  him not to be in too great a hurry to <lb/> bring on the second reading of the
                  Bill. I <lb/> ask the right hon. gentleman now: Is that <lb/> the reason of this
                  delay of three weeks ? <lb/> The right hon. gentleman knew it was not <lb/>
                  <cb/>
                  <!-- Mr. FOSTER. --> the reason when he stated it, and why <lb/> then make that
                  answer ? If that was sim<lb break="no"/>ply the reason, why all this travelling to
                  <lb/> and fro by the ministers for the last three <lb/> weeks ; why these frequent
                  consultations ; <lb/> why this disruption in the cabinet ; why <lb/> the rumour of
                  other ruptures; why this <lb/> government reduced to utter incapacity for <lb/>
                  three weeks ? Is it all because the member <lb/>for Grey asked the Prime Minister
                  to <lb/> postpone the second reading ? My right hon. <lb/> friend may take credit
                  to himself for hav<lb break="no"/>ing dodged the question, but he cannot <lb/>
                  take credit for having answered it. What <lb/> reply has the Prime Minister to the
                     ques<lb break="no"/>tion put to him as to whether he thought <lb/> it right to
                  go on in this matter in the <lb/> absence of any accredited representative <lb/>
                  from the Northwest Territories. Has he <lb/> given any answer ? There is none. I
                  call <lb/> the attention of the Prime Minister to the <lb/> fact that this is all
                  the worse because there <lb/> are now two departments of government <lb/> which
                  are in hypothec, so to speak ; they <lb/> are not being carried on by men
                     respon<lb break="no"/>sible to this House. One is under the <lb/> nominal
                  headship of my old friend Sir <lb/> Richard Cartwright, but Sir Richard Cart<lb break="no"/>wright is in another House, and the deputy <lb/> minister is not
                  physically able to transact <lb/> the business. That is not a live depart<lb break="no"/>ment, and we only needed to have the ex<lb break="no"/>hibition of
                  the Minister of Customs trying <lb/> to put through its simple estimates to tell
                  <lb/> us how little anybody else know about that <lb/> department. There is the
                  Department of <lb/> Public Works not under a responsible head. <lb/> I sympathize
                  as much as any one can with <lb/> the cause that prevents our friend the min<lb break="no"/>ister from being in this House, but the <lb/> business of this
                  country must go on, and <lb/> sickness, and death, cannot always be <lb/> pleaded
                  as an excuse for the public busi<lb break="no"/>ness not going one. It is high
                  time that <lb/> there should be a responsible minister in <lb/> this House in
                  charge of the Public Works. <lb/> I believe it is nominally under my hon. <lb/>
                  friend from London (Mr. Hyman). Will not <lb/> the Prime Minister now do a good
                  turn to <lb/> the hon. member from London, and do a <lb/> good turn to the public

                  London. The portfolio of <lb/> the Interior is vacant. To-night in this city,
                  <lb/> there are two or three hundred men from <lb/> all parts of the Dominion, and
                  especially <lb/> from the great Northwest, who are down <lb/> here to do business
                  with the Minister of <lb/> the Interior, and very important business <lb/> at
                  that. Can they do it ? No, it is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely impossible. Even this
                  House has not <lb/> been able to do anything in connection with <lb/> the Interior
                  Department for the last three, <lb/> or four, or five weeks. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman says he is trying to administer the <lb/> department. He may
                  be trying to do it, <lb/> but he will not think I am saying anything <lb/> out of
                  the way when I say that he is not <lb/> doing it, and it is practically impossible
                  for <lb/> him to do it. It is a very large department, <lb/> with great
                  ramifications. The right hon. <lb/> gentleman has all he can do without trying
                  <lb/> to master the details of that department. It <lb/>is impossible for him to
                  do it ; he cannot <lb/> undertake it and he cannot overtake it. Why <lb/> should
                  not my right hon. friend appoint <lb/> his Minister of the Interior and let him go
                  <lb/> to his constituency and come back here as <lb/> soon as possible in order
                  that the business <lb/> of this country may go on ? It will not <lb/> take long,
                  and it will serve another very <lb/> useful purpose, the purpose, namely, of <lb/>
                  testing the feeling of the Northwest itself <lb/> upon the measure which my right
                  hon. <lb/> friend has brought down. Will he do it ? <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. No. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I do not think he will ; <lb/>
                  but I think he ought to do it in the interest <lb/> of good government and also in
                  the in<lb break="no"/>terest of a full and free expression, in the <lb/> only way
                  in which it can be given, of the <lb/> people of the Northwest in regard to the
                  <lb/> measure which he has brought down. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>My right hon. friend accused the leader <lb/> of the opposition of treating this
                  subject <lb/> lightly. Well, I must say that I bent for<lb break="no"/>ward
                  quickly in my seat when I heard that <lb/> expression, to make sure that it was
                  the ex<lb break="no"/>pression actually used. If the treatment <lb/> of my hon.
                  friend the leader of the opposition <lb/> was light treatment, what does the
                  right. hon <lb/> gentleman think of his own treatment? <lb/> If the earnest,
                  honest, straightforward way <lb/> which my hon. friend beside me took to put <lb/>
                  his question and to ask for explanations was <lb/> light treatment, what was the
                  tone adopted <lb/> and the arguments used by the right hon. <lb/> gentleman
                  himself ? Surely my right hon.<lb/>friend must have been laughing inside of <lb/>
                  himself when he made that statement. Does <lb/> not my right hon. friend see this?
                  He took <lb/> his own method of getting his information; <lb/> he took his own
                  time to consult the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of his government―those whom he <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>chose to consult ; he took his own leisure<lb/>
                  <cb/> to frame a measure that should be ade<lb break="no"/>quate ; and so sure was
                  he that it was <lb/> adequate that he could not wait until the <lb/> second
                  reading to make his argument, but <lb/> made it on the introduction of the Bill.
                  <lb/> However, he had taken his ground, and was <lb/> determined to stand to
                  it—that was the <lb/> position of my hon. friend when he intro<lb break="no"/>duced this Bill three weeks ago. Now he <lb/> says that even his government is
                  not above <lb/> making changes if they are necessary, study<lb break="no"/>ing the
                  people and the expression of their <lb/> feelings, and trying to meet them if they
                  <lb/> possibly can. Should not that have been <lb/> done before ? The right hon.
                  gentleman <lb/> spoke of the gravity of the question. It is <lb/> a grave
                  question. I do not think we are go<lb break="no"/>ing to discuss this question,
                  whenever it does <lb/> come before us, in any other than an open, <lb/> honest and
                  straightforward manner, on its <lb/> merits. The merits of separate schools
                  are <lb/>not involved in this Bill. It is a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional
                  question, pure and simple, as it seems <lb/> to me. If we differ upon it, we will
                  differ <lb/> as gentlemen differ, not reproaching each <lb/> other for differences
                  of creed or race.  <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Hon. gentlemen do not <lb/> wish
                  to do that. They are opposed to such <lb/> a course as that. Very well ; they can
                  <lb/> have their way. If they wish the other way, <lb/> they can have it ; but if
                  they do wish it, <lb/> upon themselves will be the responsibility, <lb/> that is
                  all ; and there is this further to be <lb/> said, that although no man knew better
                  <lb/> than my right hon. friend the danger of ex<lb break="no"/>plosion, the
                  closeness and nearness with <lb/> which opinions on creed and race are held, <lb/>
                  and the danger that whenever you touch <lb/> them you will have harsh expressions,
                  which <lb/> will grate upon opposing ears—although no <lb/>man knew better than my
                  right hon friend, <lb/> for he has been through these from con<lb break="no"/>federation up, yet, when it was not called <lb/> for, when he himself disowned
                  it in the <lb/> first part of his speech, he forgot himself <lb/> in the latter
                  part and raised the question <lb/> pure and simple of public schools as opposed
                  <lb/> to separate schools. Now, if in the heat of <lb/> debate some harsh
                  expression is used, you <lb/> will probably find the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
                  and some of his followers saying : Oh, you <lb/> are raising the sectarian
                  discussion. The<lb/>sectarian discussion has been raised by my<lb/>right hon.
                  friend. He has challenged the <lb/> public school system of this country and of
                  <lb/> this continent. He did it gratuitously ; it <lb/> was absolutely unnecessary
                  ; although in <lb/> the first part of his speech he declared that <lb/> he was not
                  going to do it. Therefore if <lb/> there is any sinner, it is my right hon. <lb/>
                  friend ; and if there be further sinners, so <lb/> far as I am concerned, they
                  will be gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side of the House, and not <lb/>
                  myself at least, nor, I believe, gentlemen on <lb/> this side of the House.
                  Autonomy is a ques<lb break="no"/>tion which was bound to come up. No human <lb/>

                  does not cower before a pro<lb break="no"/>blem of that kind. It meets it in a
                  bold <lb/> and statesmanlike way. We who repre<lb break="no"/>sent the people of
                  different creeds and races <lb/> have to meet it in this House, and whilst <lb/>
                  we have our opinions and hold them strong<lb break="no"/>ly and express them
                  boldly, we will not, I <lb/> hope, offend even the most sensitive of those <lb/>
                  who do not agree with us on questions of <lb/> creed or race. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to carry <lb/> this further to-night. I am going
                  to reiter<lb break="no"/>ate what I think the right hon. gentleman <lb/> ought to
                  take into consideration. He ought <lb/> to fill up his vacant or dormant cabinet
                     posi<lb break="no"/>tions, especially the one in which is needed <lb/> a
                  representative of the Northwest people, <lb/> whose interests are being legislated
                  upon; <lb/> and I hope the right hon. gentleman will <lb/> revise the statement
                  which he made a few <lb/> days ago, that he does not propose to give <lb/> his
                  attention to that matter at the present <lb/> time. I think it ought to be done ;
                  we on <lb/> this side of the House think it ought to be <lb/> done ; I believe the
                  people of the great <lb/> Northwest think it ought to be done. De<lb break="no"/>prived of their own champion and repre<lb break="no"/>sentative in this matter,
                  they do at least <lb/> ask the government of the day to give them <lb/> another
                  representative through whom they <lb/> can voice their opinions. It is not enough
                  to <lb/> say to that great country and the million <lb/> of people who are there :
                  Give your views <lb/> to us, and we will take them into consider<lb break="no"/>ation. Everybody knows that even a repre<lb break="no"/>sentative cannot go
                  where a minister goes. <lb/> The formative process is in the cabinet itself, <lb/>
                  and it is difficult to decide upon what is <lb/> not formulated in the cabinet.
                  Therefore <lb/> I say the west needs its representative, <lb/> needs its champion.
                  How inadequate was <lb/> the argument of my right hon. friend that <lb/> there was
                  no objection to any part of this <lb/> Bill but one clause. Suppose we take that
                  <lb/> for granted, will not my right hon. friend <lb/> admit that that one clause
                  is the great clause <lb/> for this whole Dominion as well as for the <lb/>
                  Northwest ? If public opinion centres, with <lb/> unerring aim and unerring sense
                  of right, <lb/> upon the one great essential clause, is that <lb/> an argument for
                  saying that all the rest of <lb/> a multiplicity of enactments are satisfactory
                  <lb/> and find no dissentients in the Northwest <lb/> or anywhere else in this
                  country ? It is <lb/> simply that this one overshadows the others, <lb/> but that
                  there are others my right hon. <lb/> friend knows and he will know still better
                  <lb/> as this discussion goes on. He will find out <lb/> one thing I think and
                  that is that his fin<lb break="no"/>ancial terms, as he has placed them in this
                  <lb/> Bill, will bring upon him every province in <lb/> this Dominion. Already the
                  mutterings are <lb/> in that direction, already the tendency is <lb/> clearly
                  discernible. Take it on any ground <lb/>
                  <!--<p>Mr. FOSTER. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
                  you like and by the proportions which you <lb/> have meted out to the Northwest
                  and you <lb/> have gone beyond the financial conditions <lb/> of every other
                  province of this Dominion. <lb/> That is why the Minister of Finance, I think,
                  <lb/> should have been here and should have been <lb/> considered when this Bill
                  was in prepara<lb break="no"/>tion. But my right hon. friend will find <lb/> that
                  there are other clauses besides the edu<lb break="no"/>cational clause which will
                  be brought up. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now what has the right hon. gentleman <lb/> told us ? He gave us the wonderful
                     infor<lb break="no"/>mation the other day that amendments are <lb/> very often
                  made to Bills and that they are <lb/> very often made as the Bills go through
                  <lb/> committee. He did not say whether he was <lb/> going to amend the Bill or
                  not. To-day he <lb/> rather foreshadowed an amendment. The <lb/> right hon.
                  gentleman came out without its <lb/> being necessary or constitutional, three
                  <lb/> weeks, four weeks, five weeks, out of due <lb/> season and ahead of time,
                  burned all his <lb/> bridges behind him and made an impas<lb break="no"/>sioned
                  argument for the four chief points of <lb/> his Bill. He nailed his colours to the
                  mast, <lb/> and he declared that he would have the <lb/> courage once his
                  convistions were formed to <lb/> stand by those convictions. What said he <lb/> in
                  1895 ? <lb/>

               <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Well, Sir, to be wanting in courage is a grave

                  trust it will <lb/> express the sincere convictions which I <lb/> entertain. My
                  hon. friend (Mr. Foster) has <lb/> spoken of the leader of the government (Sir
                  <lb/> Wilfrid Laurier) as one who has been shorn <lb/> of his feathers ; he has
                  referred to him in <lb/> contemptuous terms as the erring cham<lb break="no"/>pion
                  of provincial rights. Now in the first <lb/> instance let me say that in so far as
                  my hon. <lb/> friend's allusion to the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment
                  (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) as one who has <lb/> been shorn of his feathers is
                  concerned, <lb/> our answer to him is this : We have heard <lb/> that statement,
                  not so eloquently put forth <lb/> but put forth very frequently in this House,
                  <lb/> and our answer is to appeal to the verdict <lb/> which the people of this
                  country have given <lb/> in 1896, have given again in 1900 and have <lb/> renewed
                  in the month of November last, <lb/> 1904. He has said that the leader of the
                  <lb/> government has lost the respect and the <lb/> confidence of the people of
                  this country. <lb/> I venture to make this statement, Mr. <lb/> Speaker, that the
                  leader of the government <lb/> has not lost the respect nor the confidence <lb/>
                  of any man in this country whose respect <lb/> and whose confidence he values. My
                  hon. <lb/> friend has gone on, leaving the path marked <lb/> out by the leader of
                  the opposition when he <lb/> began this discussion to-day, to challenge the <lb/>
                  government to appeal to the country at the <lb/> present time so as to see whether
                  or not, <lb/> under existing conditions, the conduct of the <lb/> government in
                  respect to this Northwest <lb/> Territories Bill will be approved of. I say <lb/>
                  Mr. Speaker, and I say it deliberately, and I <lb/> say it with the honest
                  conviction that .my <lb/> hon. friend from Toronto (Mr. Foster) will <lb/> agree
                  with me that designedly gentlemen <lb/> opposite, as representing the Conservative
                  <lb/> party, have appealed to passions, have arous<lb break="no"/>ed prejudices in
                  this country--<lb/>

               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. <lb/>

                  this Bill upon which they expect to rely. <lb/> But they will find that appeal in
                  the present <lb/> time to be nothing more than a broken reed <lb/> as was the case
                  in 1896 when they endea<lb break="no"/>voured to appeal to the passions and
                     preju<lb break="no"/>dices of the Catholics in this country. <lb/>

                  deliberately and of set <lb/> purpose '. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. I think that that state<lb break="no"/>ment goes a little beyond the bounds of par<lb break="no"/>liamentary decorum. <lb/>

                  of making the state<lb break="no"/>ment I will bring forward the proof. What <lb/>
                  is going on at the present time, in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, Mr. Speaker ?
                  What is being done ? <lb/> Petitions are being circulated emanating <lb/> from the
                  other side, addressed on the one <lb/> hand to the people of Ontario in the hope
                  <lb/> that they may arouse them against this <lb/> Bill on the ground that the
                  privileges of <lb/> the Northwest Protestants are being in<lb break="no"/>vaded.
                  And, on the other hand, what have <lb/> we going on ? Petitions emanating from
                  <lb/> the same source addressed to the Catholics <lb/> of the province of Quebec.

               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I do not think the <lb/>
                  hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. Fos<lb break="no"/>ter) ought to say
                  'untruthfully.' <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Let me explain. <lb/></p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. I ask my hon. friend <lb/> (Mr.
                  Fitzpatrick) if he will allow me to <lb/> explain. If ever I heard anything
                  plainly <lb/> and distinctly—and now, if I am wrong, I <lb/> will take it back—it
                  was the statement <lb/> made by the Minister of Justice that these <lb/> petitions
                  emanated from hon. gentlemen <lb/> on this side of the House. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. No, no. <lb/></p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. <lb/>

               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. If the hon. gentleman <lb/> did
                  not state that, then, my ears deceived <lb/> me. But, I most certainly, have
                  pretty <lb/> sharp ears. <lb/>

               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I think I am <lb/> showing
                  a great deal of good temper about <lb/> this matter. <lb/>

               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man objects—― <lb/>

               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> I will take my <lb/> seat
                  at once. <lb/>

               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I do not object. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. This is a personal <lb/>
                  matter, and it seems to me it is better to <lb/> thrash these things out on the
                  spot than <lb/> have any ill-feeling on the matter after<lb break="no"/>wards. I
                  distinctly say, that, so far as my <lb/> ears could gather the words of the hon.
                     gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, spoken distinctly and with a great <lb/> deal of
                  passion and earnestness, they were <lb/> that these petitions to which he
                  referred, <lb/> and one which he said he held in his hands, <lb/> emanated from
                  this side, and he pointed <lb/> to this side of the House. I ask him to <lb/> name
                  to this House and this country the <lb/> hon. gentleman on this side from whom
                  <lb/> these petitions emanated, or else to with<lb break="no"/>draw the statement.

               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I did not make <lb/> the
                  statement that the petitions emanated <lb/> from any hon. gentleman on the other
                  side <lb/> of the House. I did make the statement <lb/> that they emanated from
                  the other side--<lb/>

               <cb/>
               <p><persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. The hon. gentleman said <lb/>
                  they emanated from the same source as <lb/> the petitions from the province of
                     On<lb break="no"/>tario. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. The hon. gentleman (Mr. <lb/>
                  Fitzpatrick) is pretty badly in—― <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. It is because I am <lb/> so
                  badly in that my hon. friends opposite <lb/> ought to be more generous. It seems
                  to <lb/> me not quite fair that I should have to <lb/> answer four or five at a
                  time. When it is  <lb/> realized that I am endeavouring to come <lb/> after the
                  hon. member for North Toronto <lb/> (Mr. Foster) it seems to me that I ought <lb/>
                  to have the sympathy of every member <lb/> of this House. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. You have mine. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I am entitled to the <lb/>
                  hon. gentleman's (Mr. Foster's) sympathy, <lb/> because my task is no easy one. I
                  quite un<lb break="no"/>derstand that. Now, leaving that question <lb/> aside for
                  the moment I want to be precise <lb/> in the position I take, I want to be quite
                  <lb/> sincere about this, for it is a serious mat<lb break="no"/>ter. I hold the
                  Conservative party res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for the fact that two sets of
                     peti<lb break="no"/>tions are being circulated in this country <lb/> at
                  present—one addressed to the people of <lb/> Ontario for the purpose of creating
                  prejudice <lb/> in their minds against this Bill and the <lb/> other addressed to
                  the people of Quebec for <lb/> a like purpose. My hon. friend the member <lb/> for
                  North Toronto (Mr. Foster) charged us <lb/> with not having consulted the people
                  of the <lb/> Northwest who are most concerned in this <lb/> Bill. I say, and I say
                  it deliberately, that <lb/> an attempt is being made to prejudice the <lb/> people
                  of Ontario against this Bill. And <lb/> for what reason forsooth ? Because they
                  are <lb/> jealous that a Catholic happens to be con<lb break="no"/>nected with it.
                  <lb/>

               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. No. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. Read the Toronto <lb/>
                  'Telegram' and you will find the proof <lb/> of what I say. But, Mr. Speaker, it
                  is said <lb/> that this Bill was introduced into this House <lb/> without any
                  previous conference or con<lb break="no"/>sultation with the representatives of
                  the <lb/> people of the Northwest Territories who <lb/> are most concerned. Let me
                  say that every <lb/> line of this Bill was settled after previous <lb/> conference
                  with the people representing the <lb/> Northwest Territories, with the single
                     ex<lb break="no"/>ception of the educational clause--<lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I rather like to hear <lb/>
                  my hon. friends interrupt me. There must <lb/> be some reason for it. When I rose
                  in fear <lb/> and trembling to follow the Goliath of the <lb/> opposition, I did
                  not expect so much success. <lb/> As far back as 1902, Mr. Speaker, a Bill <lb/>
                  was prepared by the executive of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories in
                  anticipation of that au<lb break="no"/>tonomy which is now about to be granted.
                  <lb/> They prepared for the consideration of this <lb/>
                  <pb n="2575" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2575.jpg"/>

                  <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
                  <fw type="num">2576</fw> government the provisions under which they<lb/>wished to
                  be granted provincial status. That <lb/> Bill has been under consideration since.
                  <lb/> Not only that, but it was in the possession <lb/> of the present member for
                  Brandon (Mr. <lb/> Sifton) and we had the advantage of his <lb/> notes on that
                  Bill and his consideration of <lb/> it. The only exception was with respect to
                  <lb/> the clause regarding education. Let me <lb/> deal with that, and I want to
                  be precise. In <lb/> so far as that clause is concerned, there is<lb/>no direct
                  reference to it in the Bill as it<lb/>was submitted to us or in the Bill which was
                  <lb/> handed over to me by the hon. member for <lb/> Brandon (Mr. Sifton) previous
                  to his going<lb/>away on his last journey immediately before<lb/>the session. But
                  when that question came <lb/> up for consideration I myself had a con<lb break="no"/>ference with Mr. Haultain, and I want <lb/> now to say that in the
                  statement I am about <lb/>to make I have absolutely and exclusively <lb/>to trust
                  to my recollection of what took <lb/> place in that meeting. I have no notes of
                  <lb/> what occurred, but I feel certain I can put <lb/> almost in terms what
                  passed between us. <lb/> When that Bill was up for consideration it <lb/> was
                  necessary to refer to the educational <lb/> clause ; and on the Thursday preceding
                  <lb/> the day when the Bill was introduced <lb/> Messrs. Bulyea, Haultain, Read
                  and myself <lb/> with two or three other members of the <lb/> government—I forget
                  who they were—dis<lb break="no"/>cussed the measure. Then the question<lb/>arose
                  regarding schools, and I said to Mr.<lb/>Haultain, what are we to do with respect
                  to <lb/> this educational clause ? His answer to me <lb/> was that provision was
                  made for the school<lb/>question, so far as the Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies were concerned, by section two of the <lb/> Bill, section two being that
                  section which <lb/> makes applicable to the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories
                  the provisions of the British North <lb/> America Act, section 93 included. My
                  <lb/> answer to that was that in my judgment to <lb/> make the British North
                  America Act ap<lb break="no"/>plicable in these general terms would be <lb/>
                  fruitful of difficulties in the future, and I <lb/> had no desire to have a
                  repetition of the <lb/> Manitoba school controversy. I wanted to <lb/> make the
                  position of the people in the <lb/> Northwest with respect to educational mat<lb break="no"/>ters so clear and simple that any man might<lb/>understand the
                  clause when he read it. <lb/> I said that nothing should be left to
                  doubt, <lb/>uncertainty or misconception ; and in so far<lb/>as I am concerned,
                  that clause, in the terms<lb/>in which it is now drafted, was prepared <lb/>
                  merely for the purpose of giving to the <lb/> people of the Northwest Territories
                  those <lb/> things which they now have and it never <lb/> was intended to go one
                  inch beyond that. <lb/></p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. What does my
                  hon.<lb/>friend mean by that ? He says the intention<lb/>was to give the precise
                  rights which are<lb/>enjoyed at present. Of course that might<lb/>be susceptible
                  of two meanings, as my hon. <lb/> friend will rightly gather. He knows what <lb/>
                  I mean, and I would ask him to be a little <lb/> more precise. <lb/>
               </p>
               <!--  <p>Mr. FITZPATRICK. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
               <cb/>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. I do not think that <lb/>
                  this is the proper time to discuss that pro<lb break="no"/>vision of this Bill.
                  When the time comes, <lb/> it will be my duty to explain line by line <lb/> and
                  clause by clause this Bill from begin<lb break="no"/>ning to end, and I shall
                  endeavour to do so <lb/> to the best of my ability. But I think the <lb/> question
                  put by my hon. friend the leader of <lb/> the opposition is a perfectly fair one,
                  and I <lb/> shall answer it as briefly as I can without, <lb/> I trust, breaking
                  to too great an extent <lb/> the rules of the House. In 1875 the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of separate schools was settled so far <lb/> as the Northwest
                  Territories are concerned, <lb/> and so far as it could be settled under the <lb/>
                  provisional legislation of that time. Under <lb/> the Act of 1875 a system of
                  schools was <lb/> created by an ordinance of the Territories ; <lb/> and to that
                  system of schools so created, <lb/> certain pecuniary allowances were made. <lb/>
                  This Bill is intended for no other purpose, <lb/> in so far as I am concerned,
                  than to give <lb/> effect to that provision of the Act of 1875 <lb/> and the
                  conditions of the ordinances now in <lb/> force in the Northwest Territories.
                  <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>I am quite sure that I have trespassed on <lb/> the attention of the House far
                  beyond the <lb/> limits I originally assigned to myself, but I <lb/> would like to
                  say a word in conclusion. My <lb/>hon. friend the member for North Toronto <lb/>
                  (Mr. Foster) has spoken of the 500,000 peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the Northwest who
                  ought to be con<lb break="no"/>sulted. I have no desire to introduce un<lb break="no"/>necessarily controversial matter, but I ask <lb/> him in all
                  earnestness—and when I do so <lb/> I ask him to remember the speeches he made
                  <lb/> in this House in 1896 which I read then <lb/> and have read only quite
                  recently—I ask <lb/> him in all earnestness ; have we no regard <lb/> to pay in
                  the settlement of that delicate <lb/> question, to the opinion, the honest con<lb break="no"/>victions of over forty per cent of the popu<lb break="no"/>lation
                  of this Dominion ?  I say that there <lb/> are deep seated prejudices being
                  aroused, <lb/> passions being inflamed, and the desire, I <lb/> am quite
                  convinced, of every man in this <lb/> House is that peace should reign supreme
                  <lb/> throughout this land. All I say now, and <lb/> I speak for myself, is that
                  there can be no <lb/> peace except that peace which is based on <lb/> justice ;
                  there can be no peace expect that <lb/> peace which is based on equal rights and
                  <lb/> respect for the honest convictions of every <lb/> man in this country. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. W. H. BENNETT</persName>. (East Simcoe). <lb/> Mr.
                  Speaker, the government are at least <lb/> to be congratulated on the fact that at
                  <lb/> last they have found some hon. gentleman <lb/> ready to stand behind them
                  and perhaps it <lb/> may be that there is some truth in the <lb/> rumour that the
                  hon. Minister of Justice <lb/> (Mr. Fitzpatrick) is about to retire from the <lb/>
                  cabinet, and that to-night he is giving a <lb/> parting shot. Be that as it may
                  the hon. <lb/> Minister of Justice has appeared as he al<lb break="no"/>ways has
                  done in his favourite role of fan<lb break="no"/>ning and appealing to prejudices.
                  One <lb/> would imagine that the hon. Minister of <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">2578</fw> Justice had comported himself throughout <lb/> his
                  lifetime and particularly prior to his <lb/> advent to this House as a perfect
                     har<lb break="no"/>binger of peace, and that he had gone from <lb/> one end of
                  the country to the other in order <lb/> to pacify and alleviate the feelings of
                  those <lb/> who might have been influenced by reli<lb break="no"/>gious
                  prejudices. One would have supposed, <lb/> at least from the strong statements he
                  has <lb/> made to-night, that the hon. Minister of <lb/> Justice would be the last
                  man who would <lb/> desire to look back upon the recent history <lb/> of this
                  country. There was a general elec<lb break="no"/>tion in 1896 and it was found by
                  hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite to be a matter of life and <lb/> death.
                  From 1878 down to that time they <lb/> had attempted time and again on different
                  <lb/> issues to achieve office, but always with <lb/> the same result that they
                  had been repulsed <lb/> by the electors. Unfortunately, perhaps, <lb/> for the
                  peace of the country and for the <lb/> peace of the Conservative party, a question
                  <lb/> similar to the present one loomed up on the <lb/> political horizon. The
                  hon. Minister of <lb/> Justice went down through the province of <lb/> Quebec and
                  his complaint against the Tup<lb break="no"/>per government on that occasion was
                  that <lb/> the Tupper government had been recreant <lb/> to the cause of the Roman
                  Catholic part of <lb/> the population and he said that if he went <lb/> to Ottawa
                  he would go there—to be a Lib<lb break="no"/>eral ?—No, not a Liberal. To be a
                     Conser<lb break="no"/>vative ?—No, not a Conservative, but that <lb/> if
                  elected he would only support the party <lb/> which would support a Remedial Bill.
                  I <lb/> challenge the hon. minister to-night to deny <lb/> that statement. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. My hon. friend <lb/> from
                  North Toronto (Mr. Foster) used that <lb/> quotation with very much more force
                     be<lb break="no"/>fore, and I think I can stand a repetition <lb/>by my hon.
                  friend from East Simcoe (Mr. <lb/> Bennett)). <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. Well, the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man may affect that, but I challenge him <lb/> to deny the
                  statement that when he went <lb/> into the province of Quebec and was elected
                  <lb/> for the county of Quebec he did not think <lb/> it was wrong on his part to
                  pledge himself <lb/> to the hilt to the bishop of the diocese, that <lb/> if he
                  was elected to a seat in this House he <lb/> would not be a Conservative, not a
                  Liberal, <lb/> but he would be a Remedial Bill man, first, <lb/> last and always.
                  That was the pledge the <lb/> hon. gentleman made and the pledge upon <lb/> which
                  he was returned by the electors of <lb/> that riding. How did the hon. gentleman
                  <lb/> redeem his pledge ? He came into this <lb/> House, he secured or was
                  appointed to the <lb/> position of Solicitor General, and after the <lb/> pledge
                  that he had made to his party and <lb/> the pledge that he had made to his
                  electors <lb/> that Remedial Bill was thrown to the winds <lb/> and nothing
                  further was heard of it. But,<lb/>the day has come when the hon.
                  gentleman <lb/>has to meet his overdue note. That is what <lb/> it is.  <lb/>The
                  hon. gentleman has found out <lb/>
                  <cb/> that he cannot hoodwink the people of the <lb/> county of Quebec any longer.
                  Living as <lb/> he is living, not on what should be the <lb/> ground work of
                  statesmanship, but on reli<lb break="no"/>gious fanaticism—and that is what he is
                  liv- <lb/>ing on in the province of Quebec—he finds <lb/> that he is brought face
                  to face with the <lb/> question of this Northwest school Bill and <lb/> he is
                  bound to throw in his lot on the side <lb/> of the church, that is why the hon.
                     gentle<lb break="no"/>man is to-day posing as the advocate of <lb/> these
                  people in the Northwest Territories. <lb/> But, I tell the hon. Minister of
                  Justice that <lb/> in the province of Ontario and in every <lb/> province of this
                  Dominion there would be <lb/> little religious prejudice were it not for fire
                  <lb/> brands of the stamp of the hon. Minister of <lb/> Justice.  <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. Order. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. It does not make <lb/> any
                  difference. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>. The hon. gentleman (Mr. <lb/>
                  Bennett) will withdraw that remark, I hope. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. No, I am not sure that <lb/>
                  the hon. Minister of Justice has been a flam<lb break="no"/>ing torch in Quebec
                  nor has he been a <lb/> flaming torch perhaps from Quebec on the <lb/>minsterial
                  side because to-day the right hon. <lb/> Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier)
                     an<lb break="no"/>nounced that he was going to back down <lb/> from his
                  position. The hon. minister is <lb/> put in this position that after all these
                  <lb/> strong pledges and promises which have <lb/> been given, he and the right
                  hon. Prime <lb/> Minister are to-day endeavouring to cover <lb/> their retreat. I
                  had supposed that the hon. <lb/> Minister of Justice would have denied the <lb/>
                  charge that he had made a pledge to sup<lb break="no"/>port a Remedial Bill, but
                  as nothing has <lb/> been denied he stands confessed to the new <lb/> members of
                  the House at least as having<lb/>secured his election in the county of Que<lb break="no"/>bec by making a promise and a pledge to <lb/> the bishop of the
                  diocese and to the electors <lb/> of that riding that if he came here as their
                  <lb/> representative, and that if Sir Wilfrid Lau<lb break="no"/>rier—then plain
                  Mr. Laurier—became pre<lb break="no"/>mier, he, the Minister of Justice, would
                  <lb/> vote against him unless he produced and <lb/> formulated a Remedial Bill.
                  Yet, here the <lb/>hon. Minister of Justice sits, his pledge <lb/> made to the
                  people unredeemed and unful<lb break="no"/>filled, he coutinues in the emoluments
                  of <lb/> his office and being confronted with this <lb/> overdue note he is
                  endeavouring to get even <lb/> with his pledge. The hon. Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice talks about religious prejudice in the <lb/> province of
                  Ontario. Who is stirring up <lb/> religious prejudice in the province of Onta<lb break="no"/>rio to-day ? Who is stirring it up in this <lb/> House to-day ? Not
                  one word is said from <lb/> this side of the House on this question, but, <lb/>
                  when the Bill is introduced one of the sup<lb break="no"/>porters of hon.
                  gentlemen opposite, the hon. <lb/> member for North Simcoe (Mr. L. G. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy) rises up on his feet, denounces the <lb/>

                  <fw type="num">2580</fw> Bill and tells the right hon. Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter and the government that they shall not <lb/> have his support on this
                  question. What <lb/> attitude has the Toronto 'Globe' taken on <lb/> this question
                  ? What attitude has been <lb/> taken by Mr. Stapleton Caldecott, a gentle<lb break="no"/>man who a little time ago was nominated <lb/> in the city of
                  Toronto as the Liberal can<lb break="no"/>didate, but declined the honour ? It is
                  a <lb/> very doubtful honour to be nominated as a <lb/> Liberal candidate in the
                  city of Toronto. <lb/> And, to go further, Mr. Robinette, the can<lb break="no"/>didate for hon. gentleman opposite in Cen<lb break="no"/>tre Toronto, only a few
                  months ago, has <lb/> denounced the stand taken by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment
                  on this question. Still further, the <lb/> candidate of hon. gentlemen opposite in
                  <lb/> North Toronto, Mayor Urquhart, has also <lb/> denounced the position which
                  the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has taken on this question. The hon. <lb/> Minister
                  of Justice says that the right hon. <lb/> Prime Minister has not lost the respect
                  of <lb/> any of his former supporters. I say to <lb/> hon. gentlemen opposite, let
                  them bring on <lb/> a general election to-day in Ontario and <lb/> throughout the
                  whole Dominion, and they <lb/> will find whether or not he has lost the <lb/>
                  respect and support of the country. What <lb/> an exhibition this government is
                  to-day be<lb break="no"/>fore the people of Canada. Ministers are <lb/> in open
                  mutiny. The hon. Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance (Mr. Fielding), one of the
                  most promi<lb break="no"/>nent members of the cabinet, the gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has been named as the successor <lb/> of the Prime Minister when the
                  Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister shall see fit to drop out of his position. <lb/> is
                  insulted. He is on his way to the city, <lb/> but within two or three days of his
                  arrival <lb/> this Bill is brought down without his know<lb break="no"/>ledge,
                  consent or confirmation, and Sir, <lb/> while it was manliness on the part of the
                  <lb/> hon. ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sif<lb break="no"/>ton) to resent the
                  insult, apparently the <lb/> Minister of Finance likes to lick the hand <lb/> that
                  smites him. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>As to the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior <lb/> he is to be congratulated on his
                  position <lb/> and on the attitude which he has taken. In<lb break="no"/>sult
                  could not have gone further, and hon. <lb/> gentlemen opposite show their pique
                  and <lb/> resentment as soon as an hon. gentleman <lb/> on that side of the House,
                  be he a member <lb/> of the House or Minister of the Crown, turns <lb/> upon them.
                  What is being said to-day of <lb/> the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior ?  Look
                  <lb/> at the newspapers in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec. Do they
                  attribute to the hon. ex-Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior the fact that he
                  left<lb/>the government by reason of an honesty of <lb/> purpose and a regard for
                  principle ? Not <lb/> at all, but he is reported as having been <lb/> kicked out
                  of the government by reason of <lb/> scandals which it is said attach to him.
                  <lb/> Why does not the right hon. Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter display a more
                  noble and manly spirit <lb/> towards his late minister ? Why does he <lb/> not
                  stand up in his place and resent the im<lb break="no"/>putations that are being
                  cast upon the hon. <lb/> ex-Minister of the Interior ? Nay more, there <lb/>
                  <!-- <p>Mr. BENNETT. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
                  <cb/> are other hon. gentlemen on the other side <lb/> of the House. There is the
                  hon. member <lb/>for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) whose name is <lb/> associated with
                  'Le Nationaliste.' <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Why does he not rise in his place and im<lb break="no"/>peach the ex-Minister of
                  the Interior for <lb/> wrong-doing in connection with his depart<lb break="no"/>ment ? The fact is that this government is <lb/> all at sixes and sevens,
                  knowing not where <lb/> to turn or what move to make next. And <lb/> as to the
                  ministers from Ontario, with the <lb/> two old men of the sea in the Senate
                     Cham<lb break="no"/>ber and the two chloroformed ministers in <lb/> this
                  House—the Postmaster General and <lb/> the Minister of Customs—both Oslerized
                     be<lb break="no"/>cause they are over 60, what can the Libe<lb break="no"/>rals
                  of Ontario expect from them ? What <lb/> is the hon. member for Centre York (Mr.
                  <lb/> Campbell) doing on the present occasion ? <lb/> He was at a meeting in his
                  own riding the <lb/> other night, at which the government was <lb/> denounced on
                  all sides, but the member for <lb/> Centre York was afraid either to condemn <lb/>
                  the government or approve of their policy. <lb/> His cry was : Wait, wait ; you
                  will see <lb/> something will happen. To-day we have <lb/> an intimation of what
                  is going to happen. <lb/> I suppose it will be a repetition of the Re<lb break="no"/>medial Bill experience in 1896, of members <lb/> and ministers
                  opposite giving their pledges <lb/> that they are going to do this and that, and
                  <lb/> then doing the other thing. The debates on <lb/> the Manitoba question show
                  that the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the Northwest schools was a live <lb/>
                  question in 1896, and although the Minister <lb/> of Justice did not go so far as
                  to pledge his <lb/> word of honour that in the event of a Reme<lb break="no"/>dial
                  Bill not being passed he would oppose <lb/> any administration that might be
                  formed by <lb/> Mr. Laurier ; yet there were other members <lb/> who found their
                  way into this chamber by <lb/> giving pledges that when the question of <lb/> the
                  Northwest schools came up they would <lb/> stand for legislation similar to the
                  remedial <lb/> legislation for Manitoba. There is fear and <lb/> trembling among
                  them to-day. The Solici<lb break="no"/>tor General (Mr. Lemieux) came to parlia<lb break="no"/>ment on one of these pledges. <lb/>

               <p><persName ref="pers:BENN2">Mr. BENNETT</persName>. We all know that cer<lb break="no"/>tain influences were at work in the province <lb/> of Quebec in the
                  last election ; there was <lb/> the pledge that there should be separate <lb/>
                  schools in the Northwest, and I have no <lb/> doubt that was worked to the bitter
                  end ; <lb/> quietly no doubt ; much quieter than in the <lb/> case of the Remedial
                  Bill in 1896. Be that <lb/> as it may, here is a cabinet disjointed and <lb/>
                  disrupted, paralyzed before the people of <lb/> Canada for the last three weeks,
                  fighting <lb/> within and fears without, and its supporters <lb/> all muzzled
                  except the hon. member for <lb/> North Simcoe (Mr. Leighton McCarthy), <lb/> whom
                  I congratulate on his bravery in <lb/> standing up in defiance of the government,
                  <lb/> and the hon. member for South Wellington <lb/> (Mr. Guthrie), who has not
                  been seen since. <lb/> My fear is that if any other gentleman on <lb/> that side
                  were to make a similar statement, <lb/> the same fate might attend him. And what
                  <lb/> is the position of the hon. member (Mr. <lb/> Guthrie) to-day ? Here is the
                  Bill which <lb/> he was to support going to be emasculated, <lb/> nothing to be
                  left of it, and if the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman comes back to the House he
                  will have <lb/> to denounce the government for taking the <lb/> very vitals out of
                  his pet measure. And <lb/> where is the hon. member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia (Mr. Scott) ? He published in the <lb/> newspapers that he was favourable
                  to this <lb/> legislation, but to-night he is as silent as <lb/> the tomb. What a
                  humiliating spectacle! <lb/> Only the Prime Minister to speak, and <lb/> after him
                  the Minister of Justice ; and when <lb/> the Minister of Justice has had his say,
                  it <lb/> is the same parade of the stock in trade that <lb/> brought the Prime
                  Minister to the front in <lb/> the province of Quebec, and on which he <lb/> has
                  been depending ever since, and on which <lb/> he must always depend in order to

                  the Minister of Justice flew to his feet and <lb/> indulged in the most extreme
                  degree of <lb/> heat and passion. I would remind the hon. <lb/> minister that
                  there is a time to be bitter, as <lb/> there is a time to be tranquil. If, in the
                  <lb/> bitterness of his soul. the Minister of Jus<lb break="no"/>tice is forced to
                  rise up and denounce <lb/> the engendering of passion and prejudice <lb/> where
                  passion and prejudice did not exist, <lb/> I must refer him to his leader, the
                  Prime <lb/> Minister, for the ground upon which pas<lb break="no"/>sion and
                  prejudice is fostered. Eating<lb/>dead sea fruit is bitter work, and the bit<lb break="no"/><!--

                  of the eating lies with the Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of Justice to-day, and it is
                  made more <lb/> bitter because the bitterness of it is thrust <lb/> down his
                  throat by the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. The hon. gentleman has
                  appealed to <lb/> the verdict of the people in 1896. Will he <lb/> stand by the
                  verdict of the people in 1896 ? <lb/> Is he content to take that verdict upon the
                  <lb/> principles involved in this question ? But, <lb/> Sir, it is the verdict of
                  the people of to-day <lb/> that is wanting, and that verdict we have <lb/> not by
                  reason of the fact that this measure <lb/> was not submitted to the people, but
                  was <lb/> kept in the back ground when the govern<lb break="no"/>ment made their
                  appeal at the last general <lb/> election. The Minister of Justice has told <lb/>
                  us that in pursuing the course which he has <lb/> pursued, the Prime Minister has
                  not lost the <lb/> respect of a single person whose respect he <lb/> values.
                  Contrast that with the statement <lb/> of the Prime Minister, who said he accepted
                  <lb/> with sorrow and regret the resignation of <lb/> his Minister of the
                  Interior, and you will <lb/> see in it a direct contradiction of the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the Minister of Justice. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>The right hon. gentleman said, in ac<lb break="no"/>cepting the resignation of
                  the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior, on the first day of <lb/> the
                  month, that he had regret in accepting <lb/> it—that there were no causes of
                  difference <lb/> between them beyond the cause of differ<lb break="no"/>ence set
                  forth in the correspondence. Yet, <lb/> the hon. Minister of Justice would have
                  <lb/> this House believe that the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman did not
                  care for the support of the <lb/> hon. Minister of the Interior, and there<lb break="no"/>fore he dismissed him and sent him from <lb/> the cabinet doors.
                  There is a position of <lb/> inconsistency, Sir, which it is hard to re<lb break="no"/>concile. But when we talk of inflamma<lb break="no"/>tory
                  addresses, let us see the extraordinary <lb/> position in which this cabinet finds
                  itself <lb/> to-day. Upon this important question, <lb/> which has occupied more
                  or less off and <lb/> on the attention of this House since the <lb/> 21st day of
                  February last, when the Bill <lb/> was introduced by the Prime Minister, <lb/>
                  what intimation have we had from the <lb/> members of the ministry of their
                  individual <lb/> views pro or con? Although challenges <lb/> have been issued from
                  this side of the <lb/> House, they have not met with any res<lb break="no"/>ponse
                  except from the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who has posed as the Czar of
                  this <lb/> measure. Yes, they have. Through these <lb/> weary days of waiting, we
                  have heard <lb/> from the hon. Minister of the Interior, and <lb/> the moment he
                  spoke he condemned the <lb/> measure; and when after further weary <lb/> days of
                  waiting, enlivened possibly by the <lb/> eloquence the mental vision and the
                  mental <lb/> dexterity with which the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman evaded
                  the appeals to him from <lb/> this side of the House to explain, we <lb/> have at
                  last, at long last, Sir, been favour<lb break="no"/>ed with an expression of
                  opinion by the <lb/> hon. Minister of Justice. Sir, from all <lb/> that rumour has
                  brought to our ears, some <lb/>
                  <pb n="2583" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2583.jpg"/>

                  <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
                  <fw type="num">2584</fw> of us on this side of the House would not <lb/> have been
                  astonished if we had seen the <lb/> hon. Minister of Justice rise to disagree
                  <lb/> with the right hon. gentleman, and to <lb/> state that he was not entirely
                  in accord <lb/> with him; because rumour has been ban<lb break="no"/>dying about
                  strange things lately in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the name of the hon.
                     Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice. But that is indicative <lb/> only of the
                  tempest that is raging or the <lb/> fire that is burning within those doors. <lb/>
                  There was a burst out on the 2lst day of <lb/> February, when the Bill was
                  introduced, <lb/> and we have again had a burst out from <lb/> the Minister of
                  Justice in another way. <lb/> But I must refer again to what the hon. <lb/>
                  gentleman said, although the hon. member <lb/> for Simcoe has referred to it. The
                  hon. <lb/> Minister of Justice has stated that we <lb/> have appealed to
                  prejudice, that we have <lb/> circulated petitions and have dragged in <lb/> the
                  creedal question. Sir, I have been in <lb/> this House during the whole of this
                     dis<lb break="no"/>cussion since this Bill was introduced, and <lb/> I say that
                  on every occasion on which it has <lb/> been dealt with, it has been dealt with on
                  <lb/> this side irrespective of party, faction, sec<lb break="no"/>tion or creed.
                  There has been no question <lb/> raised upon which that charge could be <lb/>
                  visited upon any member on this side of <lb/> the House. But it has been said that
                  the <lb/> action of bodies or associations of persons, <lb/> and of individual
                  persons who have felt <lb/> themselves aggrieved, and who are exer<lb break="no"/>cising their prerogative in appealing to <lb/> parliament by petition, has been
                  engineered <lb/> and provoked from this side of the House. <lb/> I would ask the
                  Minister of Justice if he <lb/> considers that the action of the Liberal <lb/>
                  papers in Ontario has been engineered by <lb/> gentlemen on that side of the
                     House—whe<lb break="no"/>ther they are responsible for the position <lb/> which
                  the ' Globe ' has taken, and the pa<lb break="no"/>pers which profess independent
                  support of <lb/> hon. gentlemen opposite, in opposition to <lb/> this Bill. Would
                  he like to take one horn <lb/> of the dilemma or both? If we are res<lb break="no"/>ponsible for one, is it too much to say <lb/> that they are responsible for the
                  others ? <lb/> Then, Sir, there is in this measure that <lb/> which has provoked
                  some questions from <lb/> the leader of the opposition to-day ; and, <lb/> without
                  desiring or intending to take the <lb/> time of the House longer than a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments to run over the ground, I would <lb/> just like to point out
                  to you, Sir, the ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary position, chronologically, in <lb/>
                  which this government finds itself to-day, <lb/> face to face with the utterances
                  of the <lb/> Prime Minister himself. On the 21st day <lb/> of February there was
                  transacted here an <lb/> event for which this House had been wait<lb break="no"/>ing for some time. In the speech from <lb/> the Throne we had read that the
                     long-<lb break="yes"/> looked-for Bill granting autonomy to the <lb/> Northwest
                  Territories was to be brought <lb/> down. Questions were asked in the House <lb/>
                  as to when that might be expected. On <lb/>
                  <!--<p>Mr. BOYCE. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
                  <cb/> the 31st day of January, the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister was asked across
                  the floor of this <lb/> House when the hon. Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior might be expected to return, and the <lb/> hon. member for North Toronto
                  was in<lb break="no"/>formed by the Prime Minister that the <lb/> minister was
                  expected to return on the <lb/> 15th day of February. On the 10th day <lb/> of
                  February, as appears by ' Hansard,' the <lb/> question as to the absence of the
                  Minister <lb/> of the Interior and the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance was
                  again repeated by hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on this side of the House, and,
                  in <lb/> conjunction with other business, it is a <lb/> notable circumstance that
                  the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister was asked whether it was his inten<lb break="no"/>tion to introduce this Bill, and he stated <lb/> that the Bill
                  would be introduced, so far <lb/> as he then knew, on the 21st day of Feb<lb break="no"/>ruary; and significant was his remark, <lb/> when asked if the
                  Minister of the Interior <lb/> would be here, that ' the Prime Minister <lb/>
                  would be in his place'. The introduction <lb/> of the Bill took place on the 21st
                  day of <lb/> February. With regard to education, the <lb/> clause which the right
                  hon. gentleman <lb/> says is the only one to which there is op<lb break="no"/>position, the right hon. gentleman, in the <lb/> course of a deliberate speech,

               <p>This afternoon the right hon. gentleman <lb/> stated, and the hon. Minister of

                  not open to <lb/> the government to change this measure if <lb/> it thought fit so

                  explanation and the argu<lb break="no"/>ment in support of it which he then gave
                  the <lb/> House. If I understand the word ' decision ' <lb/>it means that first
                  there were conferences, <lb/> consultations, deliberations and a great deal <lb/>
                  of searching of hearts with respect to mat<lb break="no"/>ters then under

                  of the dream of the right <lb/> hon. gentleman. The Minister of the Inter<lb break="no"/>ior resigned, and there came one of those <lb/> eloquent silences
                  which have prevailed lat<lb break="no"/>terly over the government benches when
                  <lb/> awkward questions from this side of the <lb/> House have been asked. There
                  have been <lb/> silences when questions as to the absence <lb/> of ministers have
                  been asked, and questions <lb/> with regard to the intention to change that <lb/>
                  which the government had said was decided <lb/> upon, and there have been great
                  silences <lb/> to-night and this afternoon with regard to <lb/> the cogent
                  questions which have been asked <lb/> by the leader of the opposition. The
                  right <lb/>hon. gentleman is face to face with a pos<lb break="no"/>ition which is
                  not an enviable one and one <lb/> which he will find it difficult to reconcile
                  <lb/> with what has been said. There has been the <lb/> deliberation which he
                  admits, there has been <lb/> the knowledge of the existence of the fact<lb break="no"/>ional strife, knowledge of the existence <lb/> of that prejudice to
                  which in his speech he <lb/> referred ; there has been the argument and <lb/> the
                  positive assertion that the clause has <lb/> been introduced after mature
                  deliberation ; <lb/> there has been the first reading of the Bill, <lb/> its
                  printing and circulation, and then there <lb/> were rumours with regard to the
                  dissentions <lb/> which exist in the cabinet to-day. The <lb/> House and the

                  the government are with regard to this <lb/> important clause in that Bill. I
                  consider, <lb/> Sir, that they are entitled to know because <lb/> if the Prime
                  Minister of this country can <lb/> stand up in his place and pronounce for a <lb/>
                  certain state of things as the result of <lb/> deliberation, and state that that
                  is his dec<lb break="no"/>ision, and that is the law to-day, and then <lb/>
                  afterwards state or hint vaguely that <lb/>changes may take place and will not
                  deny <lb/> the suggestion that there may be a reference <lb/> to a judicial
                  tribunal, then I say the people <lb/>

                  <cb/> are entitled to know the reason for this <lb/> vaccillation. The position of
                  the government <lb/> upon this question is simply incomprehens<lb break="no"/>ible. It is simply impossible to ascertain <lb/> from its members where it
                  stands. The re<lb break="no"/>cord of ' Hansard ' shows that it stands in <lb/>
                  one place and that it is absolutely, irre<lb break="no"/>vocably or in the words
                  of the hon. member <lb/> for Wellington, unalterably committed to <lb/> one line
                  of policy. Then we have the dark <lb/> hints which have fallen from the lips of
                  the <lb/> Prime Minister, that there might be changes <lb/>—and changes with
                  regard to the very clause <lb/> of this Bill which he states was the subject <lb/>
                  of mature deliberation. There is a point <lb/> with regard to the resignation of
                  the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon, the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior (Hon. Mr. Sifton), to which I would <lb/> like to refer. The hon.
                  minister on that <lb/> day made an explanation of his reasons and <lb/> that
                  explanation is before the House. It <lb/> contains something to which I would

                  statements made by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister since that time. He says :

                  enunciated by the leader of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I would point out that
                  the quo<lb break="no"/>tations the right hon. gentleman has given <lb/> from the
                  utterances of hon. George Brown <lb/> will not gloss over the inconsistency he has
                  <lb/> shown or make more tenable the unstable <lb/> position he has taken. The

                  Prime Minister were in his place <lb/> to contrast the position he took in 1895
                  <lb/> and 1896, when he was on this side of the <lb/> House, with the utterance he
                  has recently <lb/> made. I would contrast the inflammatory <lb/> addresses which
                  he then made in this House <lb/> and on the hustings advocating provincial <lb/>
                  rights and non-interference with the acts <lb/> of provincial legislatures, with
                  his present <lb/> speeches. And I would refer the right hon. <lb/> gentleman to
                  the words of the Hon. George <lb/> Brown on the subject of the stability, and
                  <lb/> consistency that ought to be the ornament <lb/> and the crown of the Prime
                  Minister of a <lb/> country of the importance of Canada. In <lb/> 1896 the right
                  hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid <lb/> Laurier) took a certain position in order to
                  <lb/> obtain power. And now, after his third re<lb break="no"/>turn, we have him
                  laying down a policy <lb/> which is the absolute negation of that which <lb/> he
                  contended for in 1896. Let him consider <lb/> the words of Hon. George Brown :
                  'If, Sir, <lb/> a public man can avow certain principles, <lb/> agitate those
                  principles and seek to over<lb break="no"/>throw the government of the day to
                     estab<lb break="no"/>lish those principles, and, when he obtains <lb/> power
                  laughs at his professions and casts <lb/> his principles to the winds, he is
                  aiming a <lb/> blow at public morality.' <lb/>

                  late hour, I do not intend to take up much <lb/> of the time of the House. But, in
                  view of <lb/> the Bill introduced by the Prime Minister <lb/> on the 21st: of
                  February, in view of the <lb/> large number of inquiries that are being <lb/> made
                  from time to time concerning it, and <lb/> in view of the rumours that are in
                     circula<lb break="no"/>tion, I have not been in a position, up to <lb/> this
                  evening, to give a definite answer to <lb/> those who have asked me whether the
                     gov<lb break="no"/>ernment proposed to carry the Bill through <lb/> the House
                  as it has been introduced or not. <lb/> So, I wish to compliment the Minister of
                  <lb/> Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for being so frank <lb/> as he was this evening,
                  for he has stated <lb/> that when he framed this Bill he framed <lb/> it on the
                  line of the legislation already af<lb break="no"/>fecting the people of the
                  Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. That being true, I am in a posi<lb break="no"/>tion to state exactly what the government <lb/> propose to do in
                  the matter of this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. The Minister of Justice stated
                  that <lb/> there could be no peace except it were based <lb/> on justice. There
                  are a large number of <lb/> people in this country who do not believe <lb/> in the
                  present system in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories being carried out by
                  any law pass<lb break="no"/>ed by the Dominion parliament. I would <lb/> like to
                  ask him whether he believes that <lb/>

            </p>-->
                  <cb/> those who oppose this legislation are doing <lb/>what they ought not to do ?
                  And will he <lb/> say that there shall be no peace in this <lb/> country if his
                  so-called justice is not <lb/> meted out to the people of the Northwest ? <lb/>
                  The Minister of Justice is the man above <lb/> all others in this House who should
                  keep an <lb/> even temper, should calmly consider all <lb/> questions coming
                  before him and should <lb/> be particularly guarded in the remarks he <lb/> makes,
                  for it is to his department that the <lb/> people look for good advice based upon
                     calm<lb break="no"/>ness and judgment. I was sorry therefore, <lb/> to observe,
                  the tone of the hon. gentleman's <lb/> speech to-night. He has charged hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on this side with appealing to preju<lb break="no"/>dice. He
                  was not a member of this House <lb/> in the first session of 1896. Had he been,
                  <lb/> how would he have found his friends oc<lb break="no"/>cupied ? The
                  government of that day, after <lb/> introducing a Bill in this House, were try<lb break="no"/>ing to get it into committee to have it <lb/> considered on its
                  merits. But hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men opposite then on this side, showed
                  <lb/> no willingness to have this carried out. <lb/> They even remained for one
                  hundred and <lb/> twenty-nine hours without rest, keeping this <lb/> House in
                  session, for the purpose of pre<lb break="no"/>venting that Bill being considered
                  by the <lb/> House. And, on the one hand we found <lb/> members in the opposition
                  of that day <lb/> standing up and condemning the govern<lb break="no"/>ment
                  because the Bill went too far. On <lb/> the other hand some condemned it be<lb break="no"/>cause it did not go far enough. Still others <lb/> condemned the
                  financial arrangements as <lb/> unsatisfactory. But, on all sides, they <lb/> were
                  fanning the flames of prejudice, and <lb/> it was through the existence of these
                     pre<lb break="no"/>judices that they came into power in 1896. <lb/> So far as
                  the present opposition is concerned <lb/> nothing of this kind has been done. No
                  <lb/> man on this side, so far as I can learn, <lb/> has expressed his opinion in
                  regard to that <lb/> legislation. They have carefully waited <lb/> to see what the
                  government would do in <lb/> the matter—and rightly so. The leader <lb/> of the
                  government has told us that amend<lb break="no"/>ments may be introduced. But,
                  thank <lb/> goodness, the Minister of Justice, with his <lb/> frankness has stated
                  exactly the position <lb/> the government is in. And, when the First <lb/>
                  Minister proceeds with the second reading <lb/> of the Bill, I have no doubt that
                  the same <lb/> good judgment will be displayed and the <lb/> same calm criticism
                  given by the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, whether they agree or disagree with <lb/>
                  the Bill. Whatever hon. members on this <lb/> side may say will be in
                  parliamentary <lb/> form and will be the result of calm consi<lb break="no"/>deration and not of mere prejudice. The <lb/> Minister of Justice tried to work
                  up a <lb/> little agitation about the Toronto ' Tel<lb break="no"/>egram.
                  Everybody who knows the 'Tele<lb break="no"/>gram' knows that it is an independent
                  paper <lb/> with Conservative leanings. It is almost <lb/> as likely to condemn
                  the Conservative <lb/> party as to condemn the Liberal party. The <lb/>
                  Conservative party would not hold itself <lb/>

                  Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain. The Minister of Justice did not pay <lb/> much of a
                  compliment to the ex-Minis<lb break="no"/>ter of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) when he
                  <lb/> said that the draft Bill was submitted to <lb/> the government for its
                  consideration. If that <lb/> statement meant anything at all it meant <lb/> that
                  the draft Bill contained the very <lb/> sections the ex-Minister of the Interior
                  is <lb/> objecting to in the Bill introduced by the <lb/> leader of the House (Sir
                  Wilfrid Laurier). <lb/> I have read that draft Bill and I fail to <lb/> find in it
                  any similarity to the educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses in the Bill now
                  introduced. <lb/> That being true, the government could not <lb/> have consulted
                  the ex-Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior with respect to these educational
                  <lb/> clauses. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>I wish to say a word or two about these <lb/> gentlemen who resign from the
                  government. <lb/> It seems to me that if a question arises on <lb/> which the
                  difference of opinion between one <lb/> of the ministers and his colleagues is so
                  <lb/> clear that he feels it is his duty to resign, <lb/> then, he is not doing
                  his duty to his con<lb break="no"/>science, or to the people he represents, or
                  <lb/> to the people who agree with him, by sitting <lb/> silently in his place and
                  refraining from <lb/> taking any part in the discussion of that <lb/> question
                  when it comes up. It strikes me <lb/> that if I were in such a connection, I
                  would <lb/>lose no opportunity to make myself heard. <lb/>I would rise day after
                  day and, by my pro<lb break="no"/>tests seek to prevent the passing of the
                     legis<lb break="no"/>lation which seemed to me so far wrong. <lb/> Those hon.
                  gentlemen who have resigned <lb/> from the cabinet seem to think they do their
                  <lb/> duty when they make one speech explaining <lb/> their position. If there are
                  more ministers <lb/> in the cabinet who take the same view, <lb/> it seems to me
                  that, even though they differ <lb/> with their colleagues they might as well <lb/>
                  swallow the objectionable legislation holus <lb/> bolus and remain where they are.
                  <lb/>
               </p>
               <p>Now, a word about the petitions and I <lb/> am through. The Minister of Justice
                  (Mr. <lb/> Fitzpatrick) seems to lay great stress upon <lb/> the fact that certain
                  Conservatives sign <lb/> petitions in favour of this legislation. I <lb/> fail to
                  see why any Conservative in the <lb/> province of Quebec, or Nova Scotia, or in
                  the <lb/> Northwest Territories for that matter, if <lb/> he feels that the
                  legislation introduced by <lb/> the government of the day is legislation that
                  <lb/> should be approved, does any wrong by <lb/> petitioning the government in
                  favour of its <lb/> being made law. If the petition is a proper <lb/> one, one
                  that can be fairly presented to <lb/> this House, in what way does a Conservative
                  <lb/> violate good taste or any rule of this House <lb/> when he signs it ? But,
                  what is the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of what the hon. gentleman (Mr. Fitz<lb break="no"/>patrick) has stated ? He remembers quite <lb/> well the conduct of
                  his own friends in 1896 <lb/> —his own included—when they did not take <lb/> an
                  honourable stand on the school question. <lb/> They fanned the flame of prejudice,
                  and it <lb/>
                  <cb/> was only by doing so that they attained <lb/> power. A prominent legal
                  Liberal came to <lb/> this House in 1896 and advised his friends <lb/> here to
                  keep up the work of increasing popu<lb break="no"/>lar prejudice as the only means
                  by which <lb/> they could get into power. And, had it <lb/> not been for their
                  success in that work, they <lb/> would have been in opposition until this <lb/>
                  day. And I say, as a humble member of <lb/> this Conservative opposition, that, I
                  would <lb/> remain in opposition until doomsday rather <lb/> than obtain power by
                  such means. We <lb/> ought to be above that kind of thing, and <lb/> we are. We
                  have here a good country, a <lb/> great country, and our aim, instead of <lb/>
                  stirring contention should be to unite our <lb/> people and, as far as possible to
                  quench <lb/> these dangerous fires of popular prejudice. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. T. S. SPROULE</persName> (East Grey). I wish <lb/>
                  merely to refer to one or two statements <lb/> made in the course of this
                  discussion. The <lb/> first was a statement by the Prime Minister <lb/> (Sir
                  Wilfrid Laurier), who spoke of the hon. <lb/> member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule)
                  as <lb/> occupying a dual position, and in one capa<lb break="no"/>city stirring
                  up strife in the country, while <lb/> in the other he might be doing his duty as
                  <lb/> a member of this House. That can only <lb/> refer to one thing, to the
                  petitions which <lb/> are coming in and which hon. gentlemen <lb/> opposite have
                  been good enough to attribute <lb/> to myself as having sent them out. I ac<lb break="no"/>cept that ; and I gave the explanation. I <lb/> have never denied
                  or attempted to deny that <lb/> I did it nor do I make any apology for doing <lb/>
                  it. The Minister of Justice followed this up <lb/> by saying that the members of
                  the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion were deliberately and of set purpose <lb/> arousing
                  religious prejudices by distributing <lb/> petitions amongst the Protestants of
                  Ontario <lb/> for that purpose while, from the same <lb/> source, they were
                  distributing petitions to <lb/> the people of Quebec to arouse feeling <lb/>
                  amongst them. I took down the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's statement as he
                  made it. Have I re<lb break="no"/>corded it correctly ? <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. If the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule) says he took it down, I <lb/> suppose he took it
                  down correctly. But I <lb/> must say that I do not think he did. <lb/>
               </p>
               <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is the statement as <lb/>
                  I took it down. Had it not been that the  <lb/> Minister of Justice displayed so
                  much <lb/> warmth and declared that he could prove <lb/> his statement, while at
                  the same time flour<lb break="no"/>ishing a document as though it contained the
                  <lb/> proof, I would not have paid so much atten<lb break="no"/>tion to his
                  statement. But he made the <lb/> statement that these petitions emanated <lb/>
                  from the same source as the others. And <lb/> just before that he had attributed
                  the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of these petitions in Ontario to <lb/> myself.
                  Had he not thus, by implication at <lb/> least, attributed the distribution of
                  these <lb/> petitions to myself, I would not have paid <lb/> any attention to the
                  matter. If any one in <lb/> this House could know whether his allega<lb break="no"/><pb n="2591" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-15_Page_2591.jpg"/>

                  <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>
                  <fw type="num">2592</fw>tions are correct, it would be the member for <lb/> East
                  Grey (Mr. Sproule), and I rise to give <lb/> that the most emphatic contradiction
                     possi<lb break="no"/>ble. There is not a word of truth in the <lb/> statement.
                  I am not here to deny that peti<lb break="no"/>tions may have come in on the other
                  side <lb/> from the province of Quebec. About that <lb/> I know nothing. The
                  Minister of Justice <lb/> endeavoured to lead this House to believe <lb/> that
                  these petitions were distributed among <lb/> the Protestants of Ontario for the
                  purpose <lb/> of inflaming their passions, but that similar <lb/> petitions were
                  not distributed among the <lb/> Protestants of Quebec. I said last night, <lb/>
                  and I repeat, that the very same peti<lb break="no"/>tions which were distributed
                  in Ontario <lb/> were distributed throughout Quebec, and <lb/> many of them have
                  come back since signed, <lb/> not only by Conservatives, but by Reform<lb break="no"/>ers as well. If petitions did come from the <lb/> supporters of the
                  one party for and against <lb/> a certain measure, does it necessarily
                  follow<lb/>that the members of that party are working<lb/>these petitions for the
                  purpose of raising <lb/> sectional strife ? If it does, then let me <lb/> refer
                  the hon. gentleman to the fact that <lb/> supporters of the government in Ontario
                  are <lb/> petitioning today in hundreds of thousands <lb/> against the very Bill
                  the government has <lb/> before the House, and from the province of <lb/> Quebec
                  as well, and likewise the maritime <lb/> provinces. They are petitioning against
                  <lb/> this Bill, while, at the same time, supporters <lb/> of the government are
                  sending here peti<lb break="no"/>tions in favour of it—doing the very thing <lb/>
                  which the Minister of Justice tried to lead <lb/> this House to believe is so very
                  wrong. Be<lb break="no"/>cause petitions come against this Bill from <lb/>
                  Conservatives and also in favour of it, there<lb break="no"/>fore the
                  Conservatives must be doing some<lb break="no"/>thing that is radically wrong. But
                  the very <lb/> same thing applies to the opposite side. And, <lb/> as my hon.
                  friend from East Elgin has said: <lb/> Is it not the right of every British
                  subject to <lb/> petition the Crown and parliament ? Have <lb/> we not members
                  supporting the Conservative <lb/> party who are to-day supporting this Bill <lb/>
                  and others who are opposing it ? Have we <lb/> not among the members of the Reform
                  party <lb/> some who are petitioning for this Bill and <lb/> others against it ?
                  If that argument is <lb/> worth anything, it applies with equal force <lb/> to the
                  opposite side as well as to this side. <lb/> But, with respect to the petitions
                  that <lb/> have been circulated, the hon. Minister of <lb/> Justice made the
                  statement that they were <lb/> deliberately and intentionally put in cir<lb break="no"/>culation to arouse religious strife and pas<lb break="no"/>sion.
                  What justification has be for mak<lb break="no"/>ing that statement? Who is
                  responsible <lb/> for raising the religious strife and passion <lb/> that have
                  been imparted into this debate <lb/> during the present session? Was it the <lb/>
                  Conservative party ?—not by any means. <lb/> Who introduced the Bill? Was it not
                  the <lb/> Reform party? Who made an impassion<lb break="no"/>ed appeal along
                  religious lines? Was it <lb/> not the right hon. Prime Minister on the <lb/>
                  occasion of the introduction of the Bill and <lb/>
                  <!-- Mr. SPROULE. 
                  <lb/>
               
            </p>-->
                  <cb/> was it not a thing most unusual in this <lb/> House? It invited reprisals
                  from the <lb/> other side of the House. I can tell the <lb/> hon. Minister of
                  Justice when he says that <lb/> there will be no peace until it is fought out,
                  <lb/> and he added I throw down the gauntlet and <lb/> I invite this fight to come
                  on. He has thrown <lb/> down the gauntlet and I assure him that he <lb/> will not
                  be disappointed about the fight. <lb/> When it is over he can congratulate himself
                  <lb/> upon what he has done for the purpose of <lb/> promoting peace, harmony and
                  good feeling <lb/> amongst the citizens of this country. If <lb/> he succeeds in
                  doing it I will be very <lb/> much mistaken. He has thrown down the <lb/> gauntlet
                  to a class of people who will <lb/> stand up for their rights whether it pleases
                  <lb/> or displeases the Minister of Justice. There <lb/> is no doubt that from the
                  commencement <lb/> of this discussion, from the first word to <lb/> the last which
                  has been said on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject, there has not been displayed so
                  much <lb/> rancour as that which has been exhibited <lb/> by the hon. Minister of
                  Justice, and there <lb/> has not been heard as strong language as <lb/> that which
                  has come from the Minister of <lb/> Justice who ought to be the last man in <lb/>
                  this House to set such an example to the <lb/> parliament of Canada. If this
                  measure re<lb break="no"/>sults in arousing passions and creating <lb/> hard
                  feelings let me assure hon. gentlemen <lb/> opposite that upon them above all
                  others <lb/> must the responsibility rest. <lb/>
