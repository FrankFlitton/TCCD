 <!--<p>
     and I think I am right in the position which 
     <lb/>
     I have taken. It is a question as to whether 
     <lb/>
     or not I was right in the judgment which I 
     <lb/>
     exercised in the matter, but the charge 
     <lb/>
     which is made is a different thing, and it is 
     <lb/>
     a more serious matter. If there has been 
     <lb/>
     any official in the department who has given 
     <lb/>
     out that information, and it is known, either 
     <lb/>
     by the back or the front door, and if my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend from Algoma has any informa<lb break="no"/>tion in respect to any official doing that in 
     <lb/>
     violation of his instructions, I think it is 
     <lb/>
     due to me, due to the department, due to 
     <lb/>
     all concerned and due to the public, who 
     <lb/>
     have confidence in the officials of the De<lb break="no"/>partment of Railways and Canals, that he 
     <lb/>
     should give me, either publicly in this House 
     <lb/>
     or privately, the information as to who the 
     <lb/>
     man is or who the men are. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HAGGART. Just one word. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SPEAKER. Will the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man allow me ? I think the discussion has 
     <lb/>
     been running out of order. Several hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen have spoken twice on each side, 
     <lb/>
     and those who have spoken before will not 
     <lb/>
     have an opportunity again unless with the 
     <lb/>
     permission of the, House. The motion is 
     <lb/>
     that the House do now adjourn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. OSLER. Mr. Speaker, just one word. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. Minister of Railways and Canals 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Emmerson) states that these plans 
     <lb/>
     were at least one day deposited in the or<lb break="no"/>dinary manner and treated as ordinary 
     <lb/>
     plans. He says that he thinks it was the 
     <lb/>
     morning following that on which they were 
     <lb/>
     deposited that he gave instructions to have 
     <lb/>
     them sealed up. It is six months nearly 
     <lb/>
     since they were deposited, and the hon. 
     <lb/>
     minister's memory may be quite astray 
     <lb/>
     within a day or two, and it is quite possible 
     <lb/>
     the plans were kept in the department in 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary way for two or three days be<lb break="no"/>fore his instructions were given. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. EMMERSON. Will my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     pardon me for just a moment ? I have the 
     <lb/>
     right to assume that when Mr. Schreiber 
     <lb/>
     asked me that question he had not previous<lb break="no"/>ly to that moment shown any one these 
     <lb/>
     plans ; else, why would he come and ask 
     <lb/>
     me ? 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p> Mr. FOSTER. Nobody suggests that he 
     <lb/>did.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Sir WILFRID, LAURIER. Yes ; that is 
     <lb/>
     the suggestion which has been made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. OSLER. I assume that they were 
     <lb/>
     deposited in the office in the ordinary man<lb break="no"/>ner, and it is exceedingly likely that all 
     <lb/>
     sorts of people would want to see these 
     <lb/>
     plans. I fancy it is a common occurrence 
     <lb/>
     that people want to see plans the moment 
     <lb/>
     they are filed in the department, and if they 
     <lb/>
     were deposited in the ordinary way in the 
     <lb/>
     minister's office for three or four days, or 
     <lb/>
     it might be longer, it is more than likely 
     <lb/>
     that these plans were seen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion (Mr. Boyce) to adjourn, negatived.

     Mr. FOSTER. Before the Orders of the

            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. W. F. MACLEAN (South York). I wish 
     <lb/>
     to direct the attention of the House to a 
     <lb/>
     very important judgment delivered recently 
     <lb/>
     by the Supreme Court of Canada. The court 
     <lb/>
     pronounced on the contention of the western 
     <lb/>
     municipalities that the lands of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Pacific Railway were subject to muni<lb break="no"/>cipal taxation, and the holding was absolu<lb break="no"/>tely against the municipalities in that res<lb break="no"/>pect. I would suggest to the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     that when he is preparing any more mea<lb break="no"/>sures dealing with territorial autonomy he 
     <lb/>
     should have this judgment before him, be<lb break="no"/>cause there are laid down in it certain very 
     <lb/>
     important interpretations of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. It is well also that the general public 
     <lb/>
     should become acquainted with those inter<lb break="no"/>pretations in view of other questions which 
     <lb/>
     will be discussed in this House, and I there<lb break="no"/>fore ask the Prime Minister to have the judg<lb break="no"/>ment of the Supreme Court printed. From 
     <lb/>
     the copy of the decision I have been able 
     <lb/>
     to get, I read these extracts from words of 
     <lb/>
     the chief justice speaking the unanimous 
     <lb/>
     opinion of the court.
