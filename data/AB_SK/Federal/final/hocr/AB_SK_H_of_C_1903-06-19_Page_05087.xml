        <p>INQUIRIES, &amp; c.</p>
        <p>Mr. R. L. BORDEN (Halifax). I moved<lb/>
          some time ago for the correspondence be-<lb/>
          tween this government and the government<lb/>
          of the North-west Territories on the sub-<lb/>
          ject of provincial autonomy. I do not think<lb/>
          the papers have yet been brought down.<lb/>
          I also moved some time ago for a return<lb/>
          of all persons in the North-west Territories<lb/>
          who had been naturalized within a certain<lb/>
          period of years. I believe the return has<lb/>
          been sent forward, but it had not been<lb/>
        brought down.</p>
        <p>The MINISTER OF TRADE AND<lb/>
          COMMERCE. I will bring the matter to<lb/>
        the attention of the acting minister.</p>
