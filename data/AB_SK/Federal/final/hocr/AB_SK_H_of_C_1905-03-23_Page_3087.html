<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> unanimous as to its merits. Under those <br />
circumstances, it seems strange that we <br />
should wander away from British traditions <br />
and be seduced into favouring a system <br />
which, to my mind at any rate, presents <br />
some very serious objections. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I did not wish to take up more time than <br />
I should, but I wished to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fully</span>
my <br />
views to the House. I regret to have to <br />
say it, but there has been in the public dis- <br />
cussion of this question an endeavour to <br />
convey to the public that outside of all other <br />
considerations, outside of the constitutional <br />
question, which is a very grave one, it <br />
would be, from the point of view of exped- <br />
iency and policy, a great misfortune to see <br />
established in these provinces the schools <br />
of the Catholic minority. Are they then <br />
so inferior ? Are these schools productive <br />
of nothing but ignorance ? One is entitled <br />
to ask that question in view of what one <br />
reads and hears every day. Is that the <br />
fact? Well, in the United States where <br />
the natural rights of the parent to educate <br />
his child, the natural right of the citizen <br />
not to pay taxes for the support of schools <br />
to which he cannot send his children, is <br />
disregarded, what do we ﬁnd? The cal- <br />
culation has been made and the statistics <br />
are there to prove it. We ﬁnd that the <br />
Catholics, who cannot conscientiously send <br />
their children to these public schools, are <br />
obliged to expend, and do expend annually <br />
—what amount do you think ? Over $50,- <br />
000,000 a year in order to provide that ade- <br />
quate education for their children which <br />
their consciences oblige them to provide. I <br />
forget how many millions they expend in <br />
the city of New York alone. And they <br />
expend those millions to provide schools of <br />
their own with Catholic teachers. These <br />
schools are sometimes visited by impartial <br />
judges, and the education given in them is <br />
found just as good, and often better, than <br />
that given in the public schools. So that <br />
we have this spectacle in the United States, <br />
of a large portion of the people being obliged <br />
to pay taxes for schools to which they can- <br />
not send their children, and having to tax <br />
themselves further in order to provide <br />
schools which will satisfy the dictates of <br />
their conscience and enable them to exer- <br />
cise that right which is the natural un- <br />
deniable right of every parent, the right to <br />
educate his own children in the manner <br />
he thinks best. But under this tyranny <br />
exercised under the American constitution, <br />
they are obliged, in order to exercise that <br />
right, to pay double taxation. Is that what <br />
we want to see under the British ﬂag in <br />
Canada? I say it is not desirable that <br />
anything of the kind should exist in this <br />
country. And outside, of constitutional con- <br />
siderations—the value of which I acknowl- <br />
edge and to the opinions of those who hold <br />
them I pay every deference—I will always <br />
uphold the principle in discussion under the present Bill,namely, the
right of a parent <br />

And <br />
at the risk of being a little lengthy, will <br />
you allow me just to quote what the First <br />
Minister of England had to say with refer- <br />
ence to that phase of the question in dis- <br />
cussing the Educational Bill. Speaking of <br />
the religious question, Mr. Balfour said :— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 994 567 1761 2286">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I cannot leave this topic of the
necessity of <br />
the voluntary schools without saying that in <br />
my opinion they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are necessary</span>
also for another <br />
and a very different reason. What is the theory <br />
which, on both sides of the House as I think— <br />
I do not recognize any difference of principles <br />
between us—we ought to adopt with regard to <br />
denominational education in public schools. We <br />
do not insist, as everybody knows, upon teach- <br />
ing the children of this country any particular <br />
religion. We do insist upon teaching them a <br />
recognized arithmetic, a. recognized geography, <br />
history, &amp;c. In the one case we decline the <br />
responsibility, leaving the responsibility to the <br />
parents, and in the other we are agreed that <br />
the state may properly take the responsibility <br />
of saying to every parent, so far as secular <br />
education is concerned, your child shall learn <br />
what we think ﬁt to teach it. Of course the <br />
reason of this difference is known to all. We <br />
are agreed about secular education. We are not <br />
agreed about religious education. Whatever be <br />
the historic origin or the present state of <br />
things, we have, as a community, repudiated re- <br />
sponsibility for teaching the particular form <br />
of religion. We maintain the responsibility, we <br />
gladly assume the responsibility for teaching <br />
secular learning. As we have thus left to the <br />
parents the responsibility for choosing what <br />
religion their children are to learn surely we <br />
ought, as far as we can consistently with the <br />
inevitable limitations which the practical neces- <br />
sity of the case put upon us, make our system <br />
as elastic as we can in order to meet their <br />
wishes. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> And he goes on to explain exactly the <br />
position they take in England in regard to <br />
this difﬁcult matter and how they have <br />
solved it. I have read many of the speeches <br />
of English statesmen upon this Education <br />
Bill, a Bill which has afforded ground for <br />
so much discussion in England. I venture <br />
to say that there is not a word in those <br />
speeches that could not be uttered from the <br />
pulpit of any Catholic Church in my prov- <br />
ince and to every sentence of which every <br />
member of the congregation would not be <br />
prepared to say, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Amen.’</span> Which
shows <br />
how far they go in regard to religious liberty <br />
in educational matters on the other side <br />
oi the water. <br />
