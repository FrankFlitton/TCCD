<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I say that this
parliament should, according <br />
to that constitution, give to the minority <br />
in the new provinces the same rights and <br />
privileges that are given to the minorities <br />
in the new provinces of Quebec and Ontario. <br />
Sir, what seems to me this very proper <br />
legislation is opposed throughout the length <br />
and breadth of our country—no, I will not <br />
say that,—but in certain portions of our <br />
country—and in the name, I might almost <br />
say the sacred name, of provincial rights. <br />
But it is remarkable that the men who at <br />
this day, are insisting the most upon what <br />
they call provincial rights have taken no <br />
heed of the fact that, in the very letter of <br />
the constitution on which they rely there is <br />
an abbreviation of provincial rights wher- <br />
ever there exists in any province a system <br />
of separate schools. Provincial rights are <br />
the basis of our constitution. All parties now <br />
admit these rights and recognize them, what- <br />
ever may have been their position in the <br />
past. But, Sir, it is an old saying that <br />
there is no rule without its exception ; <br />
and, in the very letter of the constitution, <br />
an exception has been made concerning pro- <br />
vincial rights wherever there is a system <br />
of separate schools in any province. Now <br />
here is the law upon this point. The words <br />
which I use now may grate upon the feel— <br />
ings of some, may seem harsh to the ears <br />
of others, may seem harsh to my own ears, <br />
but, Sir, here is the law. Section 93 of the <br />
constitution says: <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> If the law stopped
there, if there were <br />
no other words to qualify this general pro— <br />

House would never have been introduced. <br />

are words which qualify the general pro— <br />
position : <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Here you have the
fact proclaimed, the <br />
principle laid down, that wherever there is, <br />
in any province, a system of separate schools, <br />
the provincial rights are abbreviated and <br />
the legislature can do nothing to preju- <br />
dicially affect the rights of the minority <br />
who have the benefit of this clause. But, <br />
though these facts are plain, still, at <br />
the present moment, they seem to be <br />
ignored ; and, even&nbsp;on the ﬂoor of this <br />
House the attempt is sometimes made to <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Sir, I am to-day as
ﬁrm a believer as I ever <br />
was in the doctrine of provincial rights. I take <br />
as much pride as ever I did in belonging to the <br />
great party which in the past carried that doc- <br />
trine to a successful issue, an issue, indeed, so <br />
successful that we rank among the advocates of <br />
that doctrine to-day the most prominent of the <br />
men who opposed it in the past. And when the <br />
historian of the future shall refer to the ﬁrst <br />
twenty years of confederation, the brightest <br />
page he will have to record will be the page in <br />
which he will trace the efforts of the Liberal <br />
party to maintain inviolate and intact the liber- <br />
ties and independence of the local legislatures. <br />
And I am proud to say that among the names <br />
which shall de revered in the hearts of their <br />
countrymen, as the names of those who stood <br />
foremost in the ﬁght, will be the names of <br />
Edward Blake and Oliver Mowat. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> My hon. friend
stopped there. Had he <br />
read a little further, he would have found <br />
that I qualiﬁed the statement I made by <br />
saying that, in the matter of education, <br />
provincial rights were not supreme, but <br />
they are abbreviated by the very letter of <br />
the constitution. I continued as follows: <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_16" title="bbox 992 1363 1746 1717">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I agree with the
Prime Minister in this <br />
view, that it would have been wiser for the <br />
fathers of confederation to have adopted the <br />
American principle of local independence. But <br />
such, after all, is not the principle which has <br />
been adopted. On the contrary, the principle <br />
of our constitution is this&nbsp;: that while in all <br />
other matters the powers of the local legis- <br />
lature are almost independent, in the matter <br />
of education, a supervisory power has been <br />
given to this government, in so far as sep— <br />
arate schools are concerned. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> So that, in 1893 I
held the views I now <br />
hold, and I am acting exactly in accordance <br />
with the opinions I proclaimed twelve years <br />
ago and which so far as I remember, I have <br />
always held. This being well established, <br />
this being I believe, impossible of denial— <br />
that the rights of a province are abbreviated <br />
whenever there is a system of separate <br />
schools—yet we are told that this cannot be <br />
adopted because the provinces referred to in <br />
this legislation are not now provinces, but <br />
are simply territories. If I understand that <br />
argument correctly it means that if the <br />
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan al- <br />
ready existed and were to come to—day <br />
and ask to enter confederation, they would <br />
come with their system of schools, and that <br />
system would apply mechanically and par- <br />
liament would be forced to give it to them; <br />
but as they come as territories, they are <br />
not to have the same privileges as they <br />
would have had. coming as provinces. Now, <br />
in the name of common sense, what does <br />
it matter, so far as law and order is con- <br />
cerned, whether these territories are now ter— <br />
ritories or are now provinces? If under the <br />
