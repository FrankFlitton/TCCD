conces- <br />
sion in regard to education, but in connec- <br />
tion with this very important subject I <br />
have had occasion to look over the English <br />
educational law and the debates which have <br />
taken place on the Bill of 1902, and it is <br />
amazing, it is edifying to see to what extent <br />
they have gone in England in order to main- <br />
tain the principle of religious liberty in con- <br />
nection with schools. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> course
as every <br />
one knows, denominational education exists <br />
in England ; there are there denominational <br />
schools such as exist here, but denomina- <br />
tional schools helped by the state, supported <br />
by the state, and in the educational Bill of <br />
1902 they have gone to a great length, they <br />
have improved the system in every way but.<br />
they have stuck with admirable tenacity to <br />
the principle that there shall be no schools <br />
without some kind of religion. There are <br />
board schools in England. where secular <br />
matters are taught. subject to what <br />
is known as the Cowper-Temple clause <br />
which provides that there will be re-<br />
ligious education but not of any par- <br />
ticular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">denominational</span>
character. They <br />
have not wished even in the board <br />
schools to exclude the religious principle. <br />
In the voluntary schools denominational <br />
education is provided and encouraged by the <br />
state, and, always faithful to the principle <br />
of liberty of conscience, there is in the vol-<br />
untary schools a conscience. clause which <br />
exists since the educational law of 1870 and <br />
which provides that any pupil attending a <br />
school, may, if his conscience or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span><br />
science of his parents require it, absent <br />
himself during religious instruction. In <br />
England they have stood ﬁrm throughout <br />
all educational changes to the principles of <br />
absolute religious equality in the schools <br />
and true to the principle of religious teach- <br />
mg. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> the schools that we have in Quebec, and <br />
that exist in Ontario, have come the most <br />
famous men whom we have had in the world <br />
during the last century. These schools ‘have <br />
produced men like Washington, Jefferson, <br />
Colquhoun and Webster, and many others <br />
who have not been followed by men of equal <br />
value in the public life of the United States. <br />
And even those state schools which origin- <br />
ated in New York in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1842</span> and
have since <br />
spread over the whole republic, are in a ten- <br />
tative state; they are on trial. Have they <br />
given absolute satisfaction? Far from it, <br />
they are only on trial and many people have <br />
condemned that system of schools, have <br />
found it insufﬁcient, inadequate to meet the <br />
wants of the nation. I have taken the <br />
trouble to ﬁnd out What the judgment in the <br />
United States upon that system of schools <br />
has been, the judgment of men whose opin- <br />
ion is worth considering. not men of my <br />
own creed, but men of other creeds, and I <br />
ﬁnd that opinion is very much divided as <br />
to the value of these schools. If anybody <br />
has any doubt as to the matter, he should <br />
read the ‘ New York Herald’ of October 20, <br />
1871, in which are given the results of an <br />
inquiry made by no less a person than Pro- <br />
fessor Agassiz of the value in 1871 of the <br />
new educational system established in the <br />
United States. Speaking of the New York <br />
Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1842</span> which was the
beginning of the <br />
new system, an eminent American publi- <br />
