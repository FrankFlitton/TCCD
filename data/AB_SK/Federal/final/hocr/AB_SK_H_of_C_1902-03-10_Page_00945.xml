        <p>Mr. FRANK OLIVER (Alberta). It would<lb/>
          be uncourtcous on the part of the mem-<lb/>
          bers from the North-west, opportunity being<lb/>
          given them, if they did not respond and<lb/>
          acknowledge the very kind advice that has<lb/>
          been tendered to them as to the attitude they<lb/>
          should assume on public questions. I am<lb/>
          glad to hear the hon. member who has just<lb/>
          sat down (Mr. Brock) and so many other<lb/>
          hon.members, lecture those of us who come<lb/>
          from the North-west on the principles of<lb/>
          patriotism. Since when did we of the<lb/>
          North-west require to be lectured on the<lb/>
          principles of patriotism, of Canadian nation-<lb/>
          alism? Our presence in the North-west is<lb/>
          evidence of our naitionalism? Otherwise<lb/>
          we would be along with the million<lb/>
          and more of our countrymen who<lb/>
          are residents in the United States to-day.<lb/>
          Those of us who are in the North-west are<lb/>
          there because we are patriotic Canadians,<lb/>
          because we are nationalists in the large<lb/>
          and complete sense of the term, rather than<lb/>
          for any other reason. We do not have to<lb/>
          be taught nationalism at the hands of any-<lb/>
          one, no matter how highly respected he may<lb/>
          be in this House or elsewhere. Particularly<lb/>
          let me say that we do not require to be lec-<lb/>
        tured on the duty of holding a broad national</p>
