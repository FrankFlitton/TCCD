<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It was the case of the Attorney General
of <br />
Quebec against the Attorney General of the <br />
Dominion. It was held in the province of <br />
Quebec, that, under section 109, the lands <br />
in dispute reverted to the Crown in right <br />
of the province. In the courts of the pro- <br />
vince of Quebec they held that upon the <br />
ground that, as the province had the ex- <br />
clusive right to legislate in regard to pro- <br />
perty and civil rights, it followed as a con- <br />
sequence that it might have legislated <br />
equally in regard to these lands, and con- <br />
sequently that these lands were the pro- <br />
perty of the province. And that judgment <br />
went through the courts and was main- <br />
tained in the Privy Council. Then there <br />
was the Mercer case in Ontario. I speak <br />
of that frmi memory only and under cor- <br />
rection. The last court of appeal in On- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tario</span> held that escheated lands
fell to the <br />
Dominion, if I mistake not—the contrary <br />
of what our own Court of Appeals held. <br />
But the matter went to the Privy Council, <br />
and the Privy Council held that in the case <br />
of an escheat, the province had the right to <br />
the land under section 109. And, in the case <br />
of the St. Catharines Milling Company vs. <br />
the Queen, a case that lawyers will remem- <br />
ber, the question involved was as to an In- <br />
dian reservation which had been abandoned <br />
by the Indians. The Privy Council held <br />
that, under section 109 of the Confederation <br />
Act, these lands, abandoned by the Indians <br />
who were under control of the Dominion <br />
government and under the legislative con- <br />
trol of the Dominion parliament, fell into <br />
the provincial domain under section 109. <br />
The latest case I have is the case of the <br />
Attorney General of British Columbia vs. <br />
the Attorney General of Canada, in which <br />
the question arose in a still more pointed <br />
manner and in which, I think, the Privy <br />
Council went even further. In that case, <br />
as hon. members will remember, British <br />
Columbia had conceded to the Dominion <br />
government a forty-mile strip upon the line <br />
of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for a con- <br />
sideration, I believe, of $100,000 a year. <br />
That was an absolute cession of the lands. <br />
Gold was found in that forty-mile strip, <br />
and the question arose as to whether the <br />
Dominion power or the provincial power <br />
had a right to that gold and the royalties <br />
upon it—which of the Powers owned the <br />
mineral wealth. In that case, if I remember <br />
aright, the Lords of the Privy Council held <br />
that the words ‘ British Columbia ’ must be <br />
read into section 109 of the Confederation <br />
Act—that not only the four provinces then <br />
parties to the confederation compact, but, <br />
said the Lords of the Privy Council you <br />
must read into section 109 the names of <br />
British Columbia and all the provinces that <br />
have since been added to the Domin- <br />
ion, and the right to this gold and <br />
the royalties upon it is in the Crown <br />
in right of the province. So I am <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> correct, I think, in saying that
jurispru- <br />
dence seems to favour the view that section <br />
109 is of a most general character, and <br />
that all lands belonging to the Crown, fall <br />
to the Crown in right of the province the <br />
moment that province is created. It was <br />
so understood in regard to the provinces <br />
that entered the Dominion since confeder- <br />
ation. It was so understood in regard to <br />
British Columbia. There was no special <br />
mention of the lands in the Order in Coun- <br />
cil by which the gates were opened to that <br />
province for its entry into confederation. <br />
There was no mention of lands in the Order <br />
in Council under which Prince Edward Is- <br />
land came into confederation. But, in the <br />
case of British Columbia these lands, by <br />
the very vigour of the Confederation Act <br />
were supposed to remain the property of <br />
the province, and, in the case of Prince Ed- <br />
ward Island, where there were no public <br />
lands, the Dominion had to agree to a cer- <br />
tain sum to be given to the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span>
<br />
lieu of public lands. So. I say, by com- <br />
mon understanding of section 109 and the <br />
interpretation put upon that section since <br />
our constitutional questions have arisen, it <br />
would seem to be evident that public lands, <br />
by the very terms of the constitution be- <br />
longed to the province the moment they <br />
enter confederation. And I see no reason <br />
for departing from that rule in regard to <br />
the province created out of a portion of the <br />
Northwest Territories. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MONK. I do not know that that <br />
makes any difference. And as regards the <br />
observation of the Solicitor General (Mr. <br />
Lemieux) that we purchased the lands, I <br />
do not think that that proposition is well <br />
founded. Even had we purchased the <br />
lands, they are not vested in the Dominion <br />
government, they are the property of the <br />
Crown, the property of the King. And un- <br />
der our confederation scheme, all public <br />
lands situated within the province continue <br />
to belong to the King in right of the pro- <br />
vince. As a matter of fact, We did not <br />
purchase the landed rights. There was an <br />
amount given to the Hudson Bay Com- <br />
pany in consideration of the abandonment <br />
of its rights in that territory. But those <br />
rights were not rights in the lands, but <br />
hunting rights and commercial rights under <br />
charters obtained long ago under Charles <br />
II. But I do not think that those charters <br />
conferred any special title in the lands. So <br />
I do not think the hon. gentleman is right <br />
in saying what he does as to the purchase <br />
of the lands. The same remarks apply to <br />
that section of the Act in which we enjoin <br />
upon the province that it shall not interfere <br />
with the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. I ven- <br />
ture the opinion that that is not intra vires. <br />
We can create a province, but we have no <br />
