themselves, this parliament has no right to <br />
exercise control over them, no right to exer- <br />

but it has no right to give commands. But <br />
we are not dealing with the future. When <br />
the Territories have a sufficient population <br />

must decide for themselves whether they will <br />

I refer to a very distinguished judge, to Mr. <br />

in the Supreme Court in which he pronoun- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Clement, an eminent constitutional <br />
writer, at page 370 of the 2nd edition of <br />
his book has also dealt with this subject. <br />
I desire to make this question plain inas- <br />
much as my right hon. friend has based <br />
his constitutional argument upon the per- <br />
manence of those institutions upon the <br />
theory that, forsooth, because a certain <br />
enactment was passed in 1875 when there <br />
were only 500 people west of Manitoba, <br />
that provision must be, by the decree of <br />
this parliament, permanently impressed <br />
upon those territories although they
now <br />
contain a population of 500,000. Here are
<br />
the words of Mr. Clement : <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> —to the present, the Dominion
parliament <br />
has had the power to legislate for the
North- <br />
west Territories in reference to all
matters <br />
within the ken of a colonial legislature; and <br />
although large powers of local self-govern- <br />
ment have been conceded to the inhabitants of <br />
these territories they are held at the will of <br />
the parliament of Canada. To what extent <br />
that parliament will interpose in reference to <br />
matters over which legislative power has been <br />
conferred on the Northwest Assembly, depends <br />
on 'conventions' not capable of accurate <br />
deﬁnition. No doubt before very long a new <br />
province or provinces will be formed out of <br />
these territories. The position, therefore, is so <br />
evidently temporary that it is difficult to de- <br />
cide to what extent of detail one should go in <br />
discussing the present position of the North- <br />
west Territories. <br />
