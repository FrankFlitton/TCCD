people, <br />
and which will require large expenditure— <br />
that the terms which have been accorded <br />
the other provinces would not be satisfac- <br />
tory or suitable terms for these new pro- <br />
vinces of the Northwest. The conditions <br />
are different; the terms must" be differ- <br />
ent; the terms are different, and in so far <br />
the terms are satisfactory. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> As to the ownership of the lands; it has <br />
been urged that these lands are the property <br />
of the province, should remain the property <br />
ofthe province and should be administered <br />
by the province for the beneﬁt of the re-<br />
venue of the province. It matters not to <br />
me what the legal rights of the province <br />
or the Dominion respectively are in that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case.</span> The lands belong to Canada
whe- <br />
ther <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administered</span> by the
province or by <br />
the Dominion; the settlement of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span>
lands <br />
is for the beneﬁt of all Canada. Whatever <br />
method of administration will give us the <br />
best results in the way of the settlement <br />
of these lands is the policy that is best not <br />
only for the Dominion but for the province. <br />
As a representative of the west, I believe <br />
the idea of using the lands of the west <br />
as a source of provincial revenue would be <br />
a very great detriment to these new pro- <br />
vinces and to the country at large. I am <br />
aware that the provinces must have re- <br />
.venue, and failing any other source I would <br />
say: Certainly we must have revenue from <br />
the lands. But if we can get adequate <br />
revenue from other sources than the lands, <br />
then we certainly do not want the lands <br />
used as a source of revenue. I can easily <br />
understand that with a change of policy <br />
on the part of the federal government, a <br />
change of policy back to What it was say <br />
twenty years ago, when it was believed to <br />
be the proper policy to take everything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
could be taken _out of the land in the way <br />
of cash payment; then possibly it would <br />
be better that the lands should be in the <br />
hands of the province rather than in the <br />
hands of the Dominion. But, so long as <br />
we have a land policy the basic idea of <br />
which is the land for the settler, it is cer- <br />
tainly better for us and for the Dominion <br />
that the lands should be administered by <br />
the federal authorities. One hon. gentle- <br />
man said, that the lands could be better <br />
administered by the province than by the <br />
Dominion because the people of the pro- <br />
vince were closer on the ground and the in- <br />
terests of the province he‘said, were just <br />
the same as the interests of the Dominion. <br />
I beg to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ;</span> their interests
are not the <br />
same. The interest of a province in the <br />
land is in the revenue it can derive from the <br />
sale of the lands; the interest of the Do- <br />
minion in the lands is in the revenue that <br />
it can derive from the settler who makes <br />
that land productive. This Dominion of <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> without selling an acre. The increase in <br />
our customs returns, the increase in our <br />
trade and commerce, the increase in our <br />
manufactures is to a very large extent due <br />
to the increase in settlement on the free <br />
lands of the Northwest Territories. The <br />
prosperity this Dominion is enjoying to-day <br />
is to a very large extent due to the fact <br />
that the lands of the Northwest Territories <br />
have been given away and that people have <br />
taken them. I say that the interest of the <br />
Dominion is to secure the settlement of the <br />
lands, and whether with a price or without <br />
a price makes little or no difference. It <br />
is worth the while of the Dominion to spend <br />
hundreds of thousands of dollars in pro- <br />
moting immigration to that country and to <br />
spend thousands and thousands of dollars <br />
in surveying and administering these lands, <br />
and then to give them away. But the <br />
province is not in that position. The pro- <br />
vince derives no revenue from the customs <br />
duties or from the wealth which the settler <br />
creates. Every settler who goes on land <br />
in the Northwest Territories is a bill of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expense</span> to the provincial
government. <br />
That settler requires a road made, he re- <br />
quires a school supported, he requires the <br />
advantages of municipal organization, and <br />
these have to be provided for him out of <br />
the funds of the provincial government, so <br />
that asa matter of fact the tendency of the <br />
provincial government is to get such <br />
money as it can out of the land and to pre- <br />
vent settlement from spreading any further <br />
than can be helped. On the other hand, <br />
the interest of the Dominion is to get the <br />
settlers on the land, to scatter them far and <br />
wide so long as they are good settlers <br />
and they get good land. That is the posi- <br />
tion as it strikes us in the Northwest, and <br />
when we have secured a ﬁnancial arrange- <br />
ment with the Dominion government that <br />
gives us adequate consideration for our <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lands—I</span> mean to say, gives us an
adequate <br />
revenue as compared with the other pro- <br />
vinces at any rate; gives us a revenue that <br />
instead of decreasing will increase as our <br />
needs increase; gives us a revenue that is <br />
proportionate not only to our population as <br />
it will be but to the area over which that <br />
population will spread—when we have secur- <br />
ed an arrangement such as that, we have <br />
secured a very satisfactory arrangement; <br />
at least as satisfactory as we can expect <br />
to secure. <br />
