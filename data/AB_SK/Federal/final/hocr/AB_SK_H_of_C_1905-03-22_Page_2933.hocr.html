<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> who should have a sacred regard for pro- <br />
vincial rights, they are my friends <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
the <br />
province of Quebec, who of all men, have <br />
been in the past most jealous of the liberties <br />
of their province. It was in that school <br />
that my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid <br />
Laurier) learned long ago the lesson which <br />
he seems to have somewhat forgotten to-day. <br />
In the province of Quebec, there is and there <br />
is rightly, a strong spirit in favour of pro- <br />
vincial rights. And it is because I inter- <br />
pret the constitution in the light of that <br />
spirit that I take the stand upon this ques- <br />
tion which I take to-day. Let me illustrate <br />
my meaning by one further statement. If <br />
any hon. member of this House or any man <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> country should seek to
insert in this <br />
Bill a provision forbidding the establish- <br />
ment of separate schools in the Northwest, <br />
I would combat that proposal to the end, <br />
because I would consider it as absolutely <br />
in the conﬂict with the provincial rights <br />
which I desire to see maintained. I take <br />
this stand because I believe that not only <br />
in the light of the constitution, but in the <br />
light of the highest wisdom and statesman- <br />
ship, education should be left absolutely to <br />
the control of the people of the new prov- <br />
inces. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Sir, in 1896—to refer again for one
moment <br />
to the Manitoba school question—the consti- <br />
tution had been interpreted by the highest <br />
courts of the land. One decision had de- <br />
clared that Manitoba had absolute jurisdic- <br />
tion over education, except as controlled by <br />
section 22 of the Manitoba Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(And,</span>
in <br />
referring to the Manitoba Act, let us remem- <br />
ber that it has all the force of imperial legis- <br />
lation because it was found necessary, al- <br />
most immediately to have it validated by <br />
imperial statute and it was validated by the <br />
British North America Act of 1871.) Another <br />
decision declared that parliament had power <br />
to enact remedial legislation. A remedial <br />
order was made by the Conservative govern- <br />
ment; and a remedial measure was intro- <br />
duced into this parliament by that govern- <br />
ment. My right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid <br />
Laurier) fought against it. At his right <br />
hand he had Mr. Tarte, who then represent- <br />
ed in this House the constituency of L’Islet, <br />
who I believe, expressed sincerely the strong <br />
views he entertained on this question. At <br />
his left, was Mr. Dalton McCarthy, to <br />
whom at least the same tribute is due. And <br />
between these was the right hon. gentleman <br />
(Sir Wilfrid Laurier), willing to accept the <br />
support of both. Like the three Romans <br />
who went forth to hold the bridge, these <br />
gentlemen went forth to hold the breach. <br />
Mr. McCarthy had upon his shield the de- <br />
vice, ‘No coercion; provincial rights.’ Mr. <br />
Tarte had upon his shield the device ‘The <br />
rights of minorities; equal justice to all.’ <br />
The right hon. gentleman had on one side of <br />
his shield the device of Mr. McCarthy, and on <br />
the other the device of Mr. Tarte,—I do not <br />
know which side he called the silvern and <br />
which side he called the golden; at all <br />
events the shield was thus exhibited. The <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> general election came on, and, as I have <br />
said, the Conservative administration <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
<br />
defeated. In the maritime provinces a <br />
strong campaign was made, especially in the <br />
province of Nova Scotia, by my hon. friend <br />
the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding), with <br />
the war-cry ‘provincial rights; no coercion <br />
of Manitoba.’ In the west the same cam- <br />
paign was carried on by my hon. friend the <br />
ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sifton).</span>
In <br />
Haldimand, in Winnipeg and in many other <br />
places throughout the west, ‘ No coercion of <br />
Manitoba’ was the battle cry of that hon. <br />
gentleman, the ally and friend of the right <br />
hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). <br />
And, Sir, what was all the storm about at <br />
that time? Had there been any attempt <br />
to violate the constitution? No; it was <br />
simply a question of policy. The highest <br />
court of the realm had declared the right <br />
of this government to make a remedial order <br />
and of this parliament to enact remedial <br />
legislation. Undoubtedly, remedial legisla- <br />
tion was within the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> of
the constitution. <br />
Well, by an overwhelming majority, the <br />
people of Canada rendered this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">verdict,</span>
a <br />
verdict which has been twice conﬁrmed, if <br />
conﬁrmation were needed—in 1900 and in <br />
1904. That verdict declared that even with- <br />
in the terms of the constitution there should <br />
be no coercion of a province in respect of its <br />
control over educational matters. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Sir, the Conservative party was not un- <br />
animous on the question at that time. It was <br />
in the very nature of things that it would <br />
not be unanimous. Nor was there absolute <br />
unanimity among the Liberals of that day. <br />
The great majority of the Conservatives <br />
believed in the constitutional rights of the <br />
minority, and they stood by those rights at <br />
great risk and great cost to themselves. <br />
Men supported that Remedial Bill who knew <br />
that their action in so doing would debar <br />
them from future participation in the public <br />
life of Canada. The sacriﬁce was great, but <br />
it was not too great for many members <br />
who sincerely believed in the wisdom of <br />
enacting that legislation, who even went <br />
further and believed it to be the absolute <br />
duty of parliament to enact that legislation <br />
as proposed by the Conservative adminis- <br />
tration. And there were equally sincere <br />
men in the ranks of the Conservative party <br />
who combated that proposal, and, in the <br />
end, their position was sustained by the <br />
verdict of the country, brought about, in <br />
very great measure I believe, by the elo- <br />
quent addresses of my right hon. friend <br />
(Sir Wilfrid Laurier) in favour of provincial <br />
rights—addresses which were re-echoed in <br />
Ontario, in the maritime provinces and in <br />
the west by the Minister of Finance (Mr. <br />
Fielding) by the Postmaster General (Sir <br />
William Mulock), by the ex-Minister of the <br />
Interior (Mr. Sifton), by the Minister of <br />
Customs (Mr. Paterson) and many other <br />
gentlemen on that side of the House. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well, after the elections my right hon. <br />
friend stood forth as the champion of the <br />
