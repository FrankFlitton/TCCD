<br />
are to be created under a section-of that <br />
Act of 1871, passed mainly in order to vali- <br />
date our own Manitoba legislation, and to <br />
the second section of which Act I wish to <br />
call your attention particularly. The sec- <br />
ond section of the Imperial Statutes of 1871 <br />
amending the Confederation Act says: <br />

forming for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> time being part
of the Domin- <br />

make provision for the constitution and ad- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now,</span>
that section is of some length. It <br />
is the only section under which we are em- <br />
powered to act. It is in virtue of the powers <br />
conferred upon us by the imperial parlia- <br />
went by this section that we are creating <br />
this province. It is known, Mr. Speaker, to <br />
many members of this House that a popular <br />
impression exists to the effect that this <br />
parliament has the power of creating pro- <br />
vinces and that at the time of the creation <br />
of provinces it can give those provinces such <br />
a constitution as it thinks ﬁt. That is <br />
the popular impression and that impression <br />
is created no doubt in the minds of many <br />
by the reading of this section. But is that <br />
proposition well founded ? I think not; I <br />
do not think there is anything in this sec- <br />
tion which authorizes us, in creating a pro-<br />
vince, to give any constitutional aspect to <br />
that province. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> are not called
upon to <br />
give it a constitution, we simply perform, if <br />
I may use that expression. a creative Act; <br />
we create the province, the constitutional <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of 1867 provides the rest.
That is how <br />
 I read this section. It is true that in this <br />
section the words ‘establish‘ and then ‘con- <br />
stitute.’ and then ‘administer' are used. <br />
But what do these words mean? There is <br />
one thing it seems to me that they do not <br />
mean. It is this, that in creating a province <br />
we can in any way vary the terms relating <br />
to the powers of that province that have been <br />
laid down in a uniform and deﬁnite man— <br />
ner by our Constitutional Act of 1867, and <br />
that is the reason which no doubt has led <br />
many and has induced probably the leader <br />
of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) to ar- <br />
rive at the conclusion that we have no power <br />
in creating a province to make any dispos- <br />
ition in regard to that province as far as edu- <br />
cational matters are concerned, because if <br />
when creating a province we can give to that <br />
province a particular educational system we <br />
can equally confer upon this province other <br />
powers, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instance.</span> those
which are men-<br />
tioned in section 92 of the Constitutional <br />
Act. We could deprive the province of a <br />
part of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> powers. We can
confer upon <br />
the province powers which it has not under <br />

and that is, no doubt, the reason <br />
which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> led many to conclude
that <br />
we have no power under section 2 which I <br />
have just read to the House but that of <br />
creating a province, automatically come in- <br />
to force and are applied the dispositions of <br />
the Confederation Act limiting strictly the <br />
powers of the province and on the other <br />
side deﬁning the extent of the powers of <br />
the Dominion parliament. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> What is the sense which one must attri- <br />
bute to the words ‘ establish, constitute and <br />
administer.’ To my mind it is clear that <br />
these words were used by the draughtsman <br />
for the purpose of giving to the Dom- <br />
inion parliament, when carving provinces <br />
out of the Northwest Territories. the powers <br />
necessary to perform fully all the functions <br />
of the creative act. We decree for instance <br />
that a province will be established. The <br />
word ‘constitute ’ means that we deﬁne the <br />
limits of the province, that we declare what <br />
it will comprise. when it will come into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-</span>
<br />
istence and other details which are all com- <br />
prised in the word ‘ constitute,’ and we fur- <br />
ther have the power to administer that pro- <br />
vince until these automatic provisions of <br />
the Confederation Act come into operation, <br />
by which a power superior to our own has <br />
provided what will be the political constitu- <br />
tion of the province. Otherwise if you once <br />
pretend that the words of the statute con- <br />
fer upon this parliament the power <br />
to modify in any way, what will be <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> constitution and
the att-<br />
tribution of the new provinces, where <br />
will you end ? Suppose to-morrow we <br />
should carve a province out of the Yu- <br />
kon. could we, in creating that province, <br />
declare that the minerals shall remain the <br />
property of the Dominion power? Could <br />
we declare that the lands would remain in <br />
our possession ? I hold we could not, and <br />
that the only power we have is to create the <br />
province ? That however is my own indi- <br />
vidual opinion. It is the opinion of a law- <br />
yer, and we all know that lawyers differ <br />
very considerably, particularly on consitu- <br />
tional points. For instance my hon. friend <br />
the leader of the opposition, in deﬁning the <br />
constitutional position he takes with regard <br />
to this Bill, gave it as his opinion. if I mis- <br />
take not. that section 3 of the Confedera-<br />
tion Act does not apply to the new provinces <br />
coming into the Dominion without any pre- <br />
vious provincial organization, and conse- <br />
quently did not apply to provinces created <br />
by ourselves under the Imperial Act of 1871 <br />
and carved out of the Northwest Territories. <br />
I cannot, after a careful examination of <br />
section 93, agree in that conclusion, although <br />
I believe it is shared by gentlemen eminent <br />
in the legal profession. I believe that at <br />
the moment a province is created, even if <br />
it did not possess beforehand full legis- <br />
