govern- <br />

cation question, but they shall do that sub- <br />
ject to the restriction that secures the rights <br />
of minorities as it is embodied in the consti- <br />
tution that was given to us. The whole <br />
spirit of that, I say, is in the direction of se- <br />

curing the rights of the minorities. It was <br />
a confederacy of independent provinces that <br />
was being formed. It was necessary to <br />
secure unity in order that we might have <br />
progress and harmony and in order that we <br />
might become a nation. Therefore it was, <br />
that, finding that there were deep feelings <br />
on the subject in some of the provinces <br />
which entered confederation at that time, <br />

concessions in reference to the matter of <br />
education were given and secured to two <br />
of the provinces. More than that it was <br />
enacted that as respects other provinces en- <br />
tering the union, minorities having had edu- <br />
cational privileges or rights prior to their <br />
union should have these conserved to them. <br /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W</span>hat has been the result of
that? Why, <br />
Sir, the fathers of confederation, or some <br />

of them, said it would be impossible to <br />
form a confederation under any other con- <br />
ditions or stipulations. The Hon. George <br />
Brown, who had always been a consistent <br />
opponent of separate schools, waived his <br />
objections in order to accomplish what he <br />
considered the great good of uniting the <br />
various provinces of British North America <br />
into a grand confederacy which would be- <br />

come, as it has become, the brightest gem <br />
in the British Crown; and it is proper to <br />
consider the question before us now in the <br />
light of promoting the unity, concord, har- <br />
mony, peace, prosperity and progress of <br />
these united provinces which form the Dom-<br />
inion of Canada. <br />It has been said that the position taken <br />by the government in this matter is wholly <br />contrary to the position which they took in <br />the year 1894 on the Manitoba school ques- <br />tion—that then the Liberal party stood for <br />provincial rights. I think it was the hon. <br />member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) <br />who, the other night, in that aggressive <br />speech of his. pointed out that the Prime <br />Minister, the Postmaster General, the Min- <br />ister of Finance, had all gone through the <br />country proclaiming that—strong upon it; <br />yes, and that the Minister of Customs had <br />thundered in that direction. Well. Mr. <br />Speaker. just by way of passing, I call to <br />your attention how a noted orator like even <br />my hon. friend from North Toronto is apt <br />to make an inapt illustration. The idea of <br />treating the Minister of Customs’ usually <br />placid, calm utterances as thunderings must <br />seem to everybody as very inappropriate <br />indeed. <br />Mr. FOSTER.&nbsp; I apologize.&nbsp;  <br />Mr. PATERSON.
