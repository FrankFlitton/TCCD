<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Regarding the amendment proposed by Mr. <br />
Birkett, then member for Ottawa, let me <br />
draw attention to the fact that the Bill went <br />
through committee in Mr. Birkett’s absence. <br />
I am not making any charge or ﬁnding fault <br />
with him, but merely stating that he was not <br />
present when the Bill went through com- <br />
mittee. When it came before the House and <br />
he saw that the Bill was likely to carry, <br />
the amendment he proposed was conceded <br />
by the city only because they thought they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span> not get better. But the
point of the <br />
present Bill and the subject now really be- <br />
fore the House, is whether this House shall <br />
pass a Bill to enable the Ottawa Electric <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Company</span> to abolish competition.
So far as <br />
the mayor’s statement in the committee is <br />
concerned, it is well known that immediate- <br />
ly after the meeting of that committee, the <br />
city council was called togther, and, by a <br />
vote of nineteen to ﬁve, decided to oppose <br />
the adoption of the maximum rate of the <br />
Consumers’ Electric Company. So, we have <br />
to-day before us not the question whether <br />
this was acceptable to the mayor, or whe- <br />
ther it was acceptable to the corporation <br />
of a previous year, but we have the state- <br />
ment of the corporation of Ottawa that <br />
they are opposed to the abolishing of com- <br />
petition, which is the principle underlying <br />
this Bill. And I think that the promoter <br />
or the Bill, if he would tell us all he knows <br />
about it, would say that the idea of in- <br />
creasing the capital is that the company may <br />
be able to absorb the Consumers’ Electric <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Company</span> and thereby destroy
competition. <br />

Might I inquire from the hon. <br />
member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) why <br />
it is necessary for this company to come <br />
here for legislation ? If they wish to over- <br />
ride the city of Ottawa why do they not go <br />
to the provincial legislature of Ontario? <br />

(Carleton, Ont.) I <br />
have pointed out that it is not a question <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Would he tell me that when you would say <br />
to Ontario and Quebec: You shall have your <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Well, I ask him why he conveniently <br />
leaves out of sight in that illustration, the <br />
cases of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and <br />
Prince Edward Island? He himself, has <br />
pointed out in an earlier passage of his <br />
speech—indeed to-day he has gone into the <br />
historical aspect of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter—that</span>
these <br />
clauses, so far as Ontario and Quebec are <br />
concerned, were introduced into the British <br />
North American Act by virtue of a compact, <br />
and that no such compact existed in respect <br />
to the three maritime provinces. Well, if my <br />
right hon. friend will show me that the case <br />
of these proposed provinces—because they <br />
are not yet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces—comes</span>
nearer to the <br />
case of Ontario and Quebec than it does to <br />
the case of the maritime provinces, if he is <br />
able to show me that there is in respect to <br />
these proposed provinces any such compact <br />
as that which was made before confederation <br />
between Ontario and Quebec, I will then <br />
readily and gladly accept his illustration; <br />
but until he does so I contend that his illus- <br />
tration is of not the slightest value. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to section <br />
16, because it is opposed to the spirit <br />
and the letter of the constitution. I am <br />
opposed to the substituted section because <br />
it is not different in principle from that <br />
for which it is substituted; and indeed it is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficult</span> to understand why there
have been <br />
three weeks of delay, why there have been <br />
three weeks of negotiation, why there have <br />
been three weeks of turmoil, why this mea- <br />
sure has been postponed from the 21st of <br />
February up to the present time, simply <br />
for the purpose of bringing down to parlia- <br />
ment as a substitute that which is to all in- <br />
tents and purposes, in principle and for the <br />
most part in detail, exactly the same as <br />
the original section. Is this the result of <br />
the efforts of the ex-Minister of the Interior? <br />
Is it for this that he resigned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span>
? Is it <br />
to accomplish this that he laid down the <br />
seals of ofﬁce and placed himself before the <br />
people of this country as the champion of <br />
provincial liberties ? Is this the result of <br />
the unceasing and untiring efforts of the <br />
seven hon. gentlemen from the Northwest <br />
Territories who sit on the other side of the <br />
House ? Sir, the mountains have been in <br />
labour, and a ridiculous mouse has been <br />
brought forth. What does section 16 as <br />
proposed to be amended accomplish? It <br />
sterotypes for ever the ordinances and laws <br />
of the Northwest Territories in a portion of <br />
the country where extraordinary progress <br />
and development must be expected. I ven- <br />
ture to think that an Act of this kind will <br />
be productive of more harm in that por- <br />
tion of the country than anywhere else in <br />
