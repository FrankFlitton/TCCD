<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> for Heaven’s sake let us as two-hundred
and <br />
ﬁfteen intelligent men, put our heads to- <br />
gether this night and settle this question of <br />
education in the Northwest Territories. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I was looking over the several ordinances
<br />
of the Northwest Territories the other day. <br />
They are rather voluminous, I have not had <br />
time to study them since I received them, <br />
but while not pretending to say that there <br />
is anything in what I am about to say to <br />
cause any hon. gentleman to change his mind <br />
about the true purport of this Bill, still it <br />
is possible there are some who do not under- <br />
stand hon. gentlemen opposite as well as we <br />
do and have less conﬁdence in them than we <br />
have. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Some</span> people outside, in
the country, <br />
if they should read these ordinances might <br />
be suspicious. Clause 10 provides: <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_2" title="bbox 188 944 947 1152">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> All general regulations respecting the
inspec- <br />
tion of schools, the examination, training. <br />
licensing, and grading of teachers, courses of <br />
study. teachers’ institutes, and text and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refer-</span> <br />
ence books shall before being adopted or <br />
amended be referred to the council for its dis- <br />
cussion and report. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_3" title="bbox 189 1187 947 1284">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> A rather important clause you would think
<br />
covering almost everything touching edu- <br />
cation. Clause 11 provides : <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_4" title="bbox 186 1316 946 1519">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The council shall consider such matters
as <br />
may be referred to it as herein before provided <br />
for by the commissioner, and may also consider <br />
any question concerning the educational system <br />
of the Territories as to it may seem ﬁt, and <br />
shall report thereon to the Lieutenant Gover- <br />
nor in Council. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 181 1550 946 2558">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Still further powers. I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> wish to <br />
misrepresent a single word, and therefore <br />
call attention to the fact that this education- <br />
al clause with these broad powers is really <br />
an educational adviser to the educational <br />
commissioners of the Territories. I do not <br />
pretend to say, and hope I shall not be <br />
accused afterwards of misleading the House <br />
by trying to make hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span>
believe, <br />
that this council has power to do every- <br />
thing that it has power to report upon. But, <br />
when we ﬁnd a member of the government <br />
given an advisory clause in some special <br />
line like education, we can well believe that <br />
he would feel bound, except for very good <br />
reasons to the contrary, to follow the ad- <br />
vise they gave. As the present Prime Min- <br />
ister of Ontario, Mr. Whitney, said in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad-</span><br />
vocating an advisory board: he said the <br />
minister will not be bound to take their <br />
opinion, but he should be assuming a grave <br />
responsibility if he ventured to differ from <br />
the educational board selected for him. So, <br />
with regard to the educational clause of <br />
the Northwest Territories, I do not say that <br />
their ﬁndings are absolutely conclusive but <br />
I do say that they are entitled to the great- <br />
est weight. and that in the practical carry- <br />
ing out of education they would be found <br />
to have tremendous weight. And how is <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> this clause composed ? Let me read the <br />
section on that point : <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> There shall be an educational council
consist- <br />

Lieutenant Governor in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council,</span>
who shall re- <br />

Governor in Council shall decide. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 978 520 1755 1563">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, Sir, I make no comment; I ﬁnd no <br />
fault. Still, we ﬁnd an ordinance of this <br />
kind appointing a board of ﬁve, of whom <br />
two at least must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be--the</span> whole
ﬁve may <br />
be Roman Catholics. And we have been <br />
told of the schools of that part of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cou</span>n<br />
try that there are, as I understand, ten or <br />
twelve separate schools and 1,000 or 1,200 <br />
public schools. for the population is over- <br />
whelmingly Protestant. Is it any wonder <br />
that some people dislike crystallizing into <br />
law for all time to come this provision for <br />
a board of ﬁve members two of Whom at <br />
least must be Roman Catholics? Without <br />
a word derogatory to my Roman Catholic <br />
friends or to any gentleman in the ministry,  <br />
let me assume that one of the three non- <br />
Catholics takes no more interest in educa- <br />
tion than one of the Protestant members of <br />
the sub-committee, Sir William <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mulock,</span>
did <br />
in the present Bill, and where would the <br />
rights of the Protestant majority be ? We <br />
have a mixed population there. Give the <br />
Roman Catholics all, and more than all, <br />
they are justly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled</span> to,
because they <br />
are a minority. But surely it the tables <br />
were turned my Roman Catholic friends <br />
would object to have it provided for all <br />
time to come that two of the members of <br />
the educational council must be members <br />
of the opposite faith. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. A. LAVERGNE. If the hon. gentle- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. NORTHRUP. I was very careful, in <br />
introducing the subject, to explain the <br />
powers that they had not, so that I might <br />
not be accused of misleading the House. <br />
So, I think I am justiﬁed in what I said, <br />
that, while I do not claim that this council <br />
has the power to crystallize into law what <br />
they wish on these subjects, yet the com- <br />
missioner of education must be expected <br />
to be guided to a large extent by the deci- <br />

trust. <br />
