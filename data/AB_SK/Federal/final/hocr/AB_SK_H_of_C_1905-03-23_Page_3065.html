for me to explain, as brieﬂy as possible, the <br />
reasons which have led me to oppose the <br />
amendment which has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offered</span>
to the <br />
main motion for the second reading of this <br />
Bill. I Will do so as brieﬂy as I possibly <br />
can. I feel very little guilt in connection <br />
with what, to my mind, has been a very <br />
needless agitation over this question. After <br />
the general election of 1896 the Conserva- <br />
tive party held a meeting in the city of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Montreal,</span> of which some notice
was taken <br />
in the Montreal ‘Gazette’ on the following <br />
morning. At that meeting, held subsequent <br />
to the general election, I declared for my <br />
part I would not in the future discuss the <br />
school question. I have adhered to that <br />
resolution, and on no occasion, at any meet- <br />
ing which I have attended, and I have at- <br />
tended a great many in the province of <br />
Quebec and elsewhere, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> I
ventured to <br />
mention that much vexed question. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It has been discussed in my presence by <br />
representatives of both parties, but I have <br />
stood ﬁrm to my resolution. I have not <br />
discussed it on any occasion; and if, in- <br />
deed, it were not necessary that I should <br />
state What are the reasons which have sep-<br />
arated me on some points from the major- <br />
ity of those who sit on this side of the <br />
House, I would be perfectly satisﬁed to <br />
give a silent vote on this question ; because, <br />
Sir, I consider that it is an unfortunate <br />
thing that, this question has been discussed <br />
with so much passion in public. I believe <br />
that many of the mischievous—I cannot <br />
call them by any other term—mischievous <br />
utterances which have been made on the <br />
subject of these Bills, have been the result <br />
of ignorance as to the real state of affairs <br />
in connection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the proposed
legislation; <br />
and I sincerely believe that when the ques- <br />
tion has been fully looked into—I agree to <br />
that extent with my hon. friend the Min- <br />
ister of Finance—and all sides of it proper- <br />
ly weighed, at any rate as regards the edu- <br />
cational aspect of the question, the people <br />
of Canada will come to the conclusion that <br />
in the concessions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granted,</span> and
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁort</span> <br />
made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by this</span> parliament to
create condi— <br />
tions of justice and equity in the North- <br />
west, the practical result is not one of very <br />
great importance. That, at any rate, is my <br />
view of the subject. It is, I admit, an im- <br />
portant subject in the principles which are <br />
to govern us in our decision of the question. <br />
It is important, no doubt, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one,</span>
should <br />
state for what reason one gives a vote <br />
which may appear strange ; but at the same <br />
time I think a great deal too much has been <br />
made of the extent to which parliament has <br />
been asked to go in connection with this <br />
legislation. Let me at once call the atten- <br />
tion of the House to the seriousness of a <br />
statement made last night by the Minister <br />
of Finance. To my mind this is a question <br />
upon which every man can have a free and <br />
independent opinion without in any way <br />
alienating his co-religionists of different <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> creed. I am pleased to say, and I desire <br />
to acknowledge, that in the words that fell <br />
from the hon. leader of the opposition last <br />
night—and I followed him very attentively <br />
—there was not one word which it seems <br />
to me could shock any man of any creed in <br />
the province of Quebec or elsewhere. He <br />
was led by logical deductions to the conclu- <br />
sions at which he arrived; and, Sir, I am <br />
proud to say, so far as I may represent <br />
public opinion in my own province, that <br />
there is one thing which we learn early in <br />
our schools, and that is, to respect abso- <br />
lutely the convictions of all of our fellow <br />
citizens. I am sorry to say that I do not <br />
think that part of our curriculum is to be <br />
found in all the other schools of the coun-<br />
try. But when the Minister of Finance <br />
went so far as to say that in the event of <br />
the Prime Minister not being able to carry <br />
this measure through the House, and of my <br />
hon. friend the leader of the opposition <br />
being called upon to form a cabinet, the <br />
cabinet which he would form would neces- <br />
sarily have a purely religious colour, and <br />
would be a Protestant administration, I do <br />
think my hon. friend the Minister of Fin- <br />
ance went quite beyond the bounds which <br />
anything which my hon. friend the leader <br />
of the opposition said could in any sense <br />
justify. <br />
