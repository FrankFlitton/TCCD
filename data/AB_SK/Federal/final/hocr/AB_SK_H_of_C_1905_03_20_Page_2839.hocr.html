At what stage would it be premature for <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> hon.
gentleman to approve of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plans</span>
<br />
or to investigate them ? Can it be said to <br />
be contemplated by section 122 of the Rail- <br />
way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> that
the minister, the moment he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gets</span> the plans
that are to be prepared <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span>
<br />
that section, can seal them up so that neither <br />
he, nor his colleagues, nor parliament, nor <br />
the railway company themselves can see <br />
them or inspect them ? If that be so for a <br />
period of seven months, why may it not be <br />
so for ten years ? I hope the hon gentle- <br />
man will accede to the reasonable request <br />
from this side of the House, and will show <br />
cogent reasons why, at any rate, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span>
<br />
not loosen, with regard to these particular <br />
plans, that principle which he says has been <br />
inaugurated in his department, and that he. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. FOSTER. Just one
word more, if <br />
the House will allow me. If the First Min- <br />
ister were here I would make an appeal to <br />
him with reference to the principle involved <br />
in this matter; as he is not here, and the <br />
Minister of Finance I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine,
is</span> leading <br />
the House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>
will say to him that I think it <br />
would be a pity if afﬁrmation were to be <br />
made that the House assembled here has <br />
not a right to have a document such as this <br />
brought down if it wishes it. If this motion <br />
is negatived, of course it will afﬁrm that <br />
principle. I call the attention of the Min- <br />
ister of Finance to the fact that I do not <br />
think any real reason has been given why <br />
the public interest would be harmed if they <br />
were brought down at once. Then if we <br />
have not a reason given, is it not rather peri- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lous</span> to
afﬁrm a principle which in effect <br />
would be this, that the House is not master <br />
of the documents which one of its servants, <br />
in the form of a member of the government. <br />
has in his possession, and has kept sealed <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> his
possession for months? <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. FIELDING. I am
afraid that I can- <br />
not agree with my hon. friend that the <br />
House is about to afﬁrm any dangerous prin- <br />
ciple. Certainly that is not our intention ; <br />
nor is it the intention of this House to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂirm</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
principle that parliament has not a right <br />
to every public document in relation to all <br />
public affairs. But it is a question of dis— <br />
cretion. It is a constant practice for a min- <br />
ister, here and elsewhere, when a motion is <br />
made for papers, to say that in his judgment <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is not wise
to submit those papers to the <br />
House. <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_13" title="bbox 986 311 1752 1030">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. FIELDLING. The
minister has given <br />
a reason. My hon. friend may not accept the <br />
reason. For myself I would say that any un- <br />
ﬁnished transaction might not necessarily <br />
be a proper matter to submit to the House. <br />
Any matter which is pending and left un- <br />
ﬁnished might properly be withheld from the <br />
knowledge of the public until the discussion <br />
is completed. In that aspect of the question, <br />
the minister does not say that the House has <br />
no right to these papers, he simply says that <br />
in his judgment, and for the reasons he has <br />
given, he thinks it would not be wise to <br />
bring these papers down at the present time. <br />
There is no danger in afﬁrming a principle <br />
of that character. We are only afﬁrming <br />
what is done in all parliaments under the <br />
British system for reasons which, in the <br />
mind of the minister, he deems to be sufﬁci- <br />
ent. Sometimes hon. gentlemen might re- <br />
gard them as insufficient, but that is always <br />

moving the adjournment, if any hon. gentle- <br />
man has nothing else to bring up, I desire <br />
to submit some papers to the House. I lay <br />
on the table a copy of the School Ordinances <br />
of the Northwest Territories, chaps. 29, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">30</span>
<br />
and 31, passed in 1901. I also lay on the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">table</span> a
memorandum giving a summary of <br />
legislation relating to subsidies to the pro- <br />
vinces. These are documents which have been <br />
asked for by hon. gentlemen opposite. They <br />
are both printed, and will be in the distri- <br />
bution office to-night or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-morrow</span>
morning. <br />
I have sufficient copies to-night to hand a <br />
few around. I also submit a statement <br />
showing the areas of the provisional dis- <br />
tricts of the Northwest Territories, and <br />
other information with respect to lands in <br />
the Northwest Territories, numbers of Set- <br />
tlers and so forth, these being papers which <br />
were asked for. They are not in printed <br />
form, and I think it would be better to sus- <br />
pend the rule at once and ask the House to <br />
agree to have them printed. I would there- <br />
fore move that the rule be suspended for the <br />
purpose of having these printed. <br />
