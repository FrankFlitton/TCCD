     ada he will find that the people of this Do<lb break="no"/>minion will not stand for interference with 
     <lb/>
     the autonomy of the provinces, will not 
     <lb/>
     stand for broken pledges, will not stand for 
     <lb/>
     the shackling of these great provinces of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest with onerous restrictions as 
     <lb/>
     to education and the administration of their 
     <lb/>
     public lands. Why have we no Minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Interior to-day? Why is the govern<lb break="no"/>ment afraid to appoint a Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior and send him for election to the 
     <lb/>
     people of the west? I have not the assur<lb break="no"/>ance which some gentlemen on the other 
     <lb/>
     side have to say that they speak for the 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest Territories when 
     <lb/>
     they have no mandate to speak on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion ; I do not pretend to speak for the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest Territories except to 
     <lb/>
     say that they want to be left alone to at<lb break="no"/>tend to their own business, but I do believe 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     will treat this government as it deserves to 
     <lb/>
     be treated for interfering with their pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. The government does not 
     <lb/>
     dare to appoint a Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     because they know that the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest would reject him by an over<lb break="no"/>whelming vote. The Prime Minister is not 
     <lb/>
     here to-night, but in times past he has 
     <lb/>
     learned something from this side of the 
     <lb/>
     House, and I invite the Minister of Cus<lb break="no"/>toms and the Minister of Finance who are 
     <lb/>
     now present to tell the Prime Minister that 
     <lb/>
     it is his duty to appoint a Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior and to test the feelings of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the west on this question. That is 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional way to proceed, but these 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen do not want things done con<lb break="no"/>stitutionally. They had not much respect for 
     <lb/>
     the constitution when, the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance being absent in England, they intro<lb break="no"/>duced without his knowledge this Bill which 
     <lb/>
     deals with great financial issues seriously 
     <lb/>
     affecting the Dominion. They had not much 
     <lb/>
     respect for the constitution when in the 
     <lb/>
     absence of their Minister of the Interior, 
     <lb/>
     who is specially charged with matters per<lb break="no"/>taining to the west, they drafted and pro<lb break="no"/>posed in parliament this measure which 
     <lb/>
     vitally concerns the people whose interest 
     <lb/>
     he was specially charged to guard. Let 
     <lb/>
     them appoint their Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     and they can soon find out whether we are 
     <lb/>
     right or they are right. Sir, as a man try<lb break="no"/>ing to do the honourable thing and repre<lb break="no"/>senting an honourable constituency, I have 
     <lb/>
     no course left to me but to vote for the 
     <lb/>
     amendment of the leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
     In doing so, I believe I am voicing the opin<lb break="no"/>ions of the Reformers as well as the Con<lb break="no"/>servatives, of the respectable Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lics as well as the respectable Protestants 
     <lb/>
     of my county. If I do that I am doing my 
     <lb/>
    whole duty, and, Sir, if the members of this 
     <lb/>cabinet would study more what the people 
     <lb/>want and not what may suit the political 
     <lb/>exigencies of the moment they would be 
     <lb/>representing the people of Canada better 
     <lb/>than they are to-day.

     <lb/>
     hon. member for Lincoln and Niagara re<lb break="no"/>minded us, last evening, several times in the 
     <lb/>
     course of his speech that he comes from 
     <lb/>
     that part of Canada surnamed the Garden 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario. It was necessary that he 
     <lb/>
     should do so, as his violent delivery and 
     <lb/>
     forcible language might have led us to 
     <lb/>
     believe that he was not a resident of that 
     <lb/>
     rich and beautiful country surrounding St. 
     <lb/>
     Catharines, but rather that his mind had 
     <lb/>
     been impressed by the sight of Niagara's 
     <lb/>
     surging waters and his ears filled with the

     uproar of the great falls. That kind of 
     <lb/>
     music apparently suits his taste much better 
     <lb/>
     than the sweet pastoral melodies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member having taunted the hon. 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General for his violent reply to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member froom North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster), unfortunately proceeded to follow 
     <lb/>
     in his steps, and even went much farther. 
     <lb/>
     During the whole evening he assailed in an 
     <lb/>
     unwarrantable manner the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, the Minister of Finance, and the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Justice, and even the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). Are we not justi<lb break="no"/>fied in giving him one bit of advice : Doctor, 
     <lb/>
     cure thy own ills ?   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This question, Mr. Speaker, is one of 
     <lb/>
     justice. Justice is not the outcome of 
     <lb/>
     human passion, but rather of reason. Of 
     <lb/>
     old, it was represented under the form of a 
     <lb/>
     woman whose eyes were bandaged, which 
     <lb/>
     meant that she should not be influenced 
     <lb/>
     by the clamour from the street. And when 
     <lb/>
     I heard hon. members on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House claim that the majority wanted 
     <lb/>
     so and so, and the minority so and so ; 
     <lb/>
     that petitions in support of their views were 
     <lb/>
     more numerous than those in the op<lb break="no"/>posite sense ; when I heard them state in 
     <lb/>
     this parliament, the highest court in the 
     <lb/>
     country, that it was not a question of de<lb break="no"/>ciding who was right and who was wrong, 
     <lb/>
     but a question of deciding who had the 
     <lb/>
     majority, I said to myself : Have they 
     <lb/>
     forgotten that this is the twentieth century; 
     <lb/>
     that the old principle 'Force above right,'- 
     <lb/>
     no longer rules in this country, especially 
     <lb/>
     since the establishment of the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     of 1867. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster) ventured to make some charges 
     <lb/>
     against the province of Quebec ; he accused 
     <lb/>
     her of not showing in practice that toler<lb break="no"/>ation of which she boasts so highly, and 
     <lb/>
     he claimed that the Protestant population 
     <lb/>
     was not free as regards education. And on 
     <lb/>
     what grounds has he brought forth such a 
     <lb/>
     charge ? On the fact that in our schools 
     <lb/>
     the Catholic religion is taught, while the Pro<lb break="no"/>testant religion is taught in the school of 
     <lb/>
     the minority. Does the hon. member know 
     <lb/>
     who is responsible for that system ? It 
     <lb/>
     has not been forced upon the minority ; 
     <lb/>
     the minority wanted it. The Protestant 
     <lb/>
     minority in the province of Quebec wanted 
     <lb/>
     that system to be established, they cannot 
     <lb/>
     complain therefore that the majority are 
     <lb/>
     not always tolerant, as claimed by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Toronto North. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On the other hand, the hon leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition showed sympathy for the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec ; unfortunately that 
     <lb/>
     sympathy was not at all of the practical 
     <lb/>
     order. The hon. gentleman did not state 
     <lb/>
     that he was not in favour of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. But he has these two objections to 
     <lb/>
     make ; First. the constitution will not al<lb break="no"/>low us to alter the terms of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act ; secondly, under the 
     <lb/>
     federal constitution the Catholic minority 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3451</fw>
     <fw type="num">3452</fw>


     has no rights in the new provinces. Such 
     <lb/>
     is the stand taken by the hon. leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition. 
     <lb/>
  
</p>

            <p>The hon. gentleman's contentions seems 
     <lb/>to me indefensible. That is the true specially 
     <lb/>as regards his first proposition, viz., that 
     <lb/>parliament has no right to step in and alter 
     <lb/>the terms of the British North America 
     <lb/>Act. Indeed, the hon. gentleman who sits 
     <lb/>at his left (Mr. Foster) was unwilling to 
     <lb/>urge that point. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With a view to find out what rights we 
     <lb/>enjoy, is it not necessary that we should 
     <lb/>consult history ? 'History,' says Laurent, 
     <lb/>'shows us the meaning and the scope of 
     <lb/>statutory enactments.' The problem which 
     <lb/>we have to solve has already been solved, 
     <lb/>and solved by Sir John Macdonald himself 
     <lb/>in 1870. But, even before his time, the prob<lb break="no"/>lem had been solved by the great neighbour<lb break="no"/>ing republic and that as early as 1820. Of 
     <lb/>course, in order to draw correct inferences 
     <lb/>from the history of the United States, we 
     <lb/>should take into account the similarity of 
     <lb/>circumstances, as also the difference between 
     <lb/>the constitutions of both countries. The 
     <lb/>United States, in the same way as Canada, 
     <lb/>have territories, and these territories will 
     <lb/>have, some day or other, to be admitted into 
     <lb/>the union. But the difference between our 
     <lb/>constitution and that of our neighbours on 
     <lb/>that point is quite marked. Not only has 
     <lb/>the federal constitution been worked out by 
     <lb/>the people of the United States, but the con<lb break="no"/>stitution of each separate state is also the 
     <lb/>creation of the peoples of these various 
     <lb/>states. Here, on the contrary. not only is 
     <lb/>the federal constitution a gift of the imperial 
     <lb/>parliament, but even the constitutions of 
     <lb/>the provinces of Quebec and Ontario have 
     <lb/>been granted by that same authority. In 
     <lb/>the same way, the constitution of these new 
     <lb/>provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan will 
     <lb/>have been granted to them by us. Now, 
     <lb/>Mr. Speaker, although, under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances, the position of the various states 
     <lb/>is much stronger than that of the federal 
     <lb/>power : although the people of each state 
     <lb/>have the right to adopt their own constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, however, in 1820, when the state of 
     <lb/>Missouri asked for admission into the union, 
     <lb/>with a constitution providing that slavery 
     <lb/>might be maintained for ever within its 
     <lb/>territory, Congress refused to admit that 
     <lb/>state into its union unless a contrary pro<lb break="no"/>vision was inserted. The advocates of Mis<lb break="no"/>souri objected : You are interfering with the 
     <lb/>principle in state sovereignty ; you are inter<lb break="no"/>fering with the principle in virtue of which 
     <lb/>the people of each state are entitled to frame 
     <lb/>their own constitution. The wise men of 
     <lb/>the Republic answered : Above the principle 
     <lb/>of state sovereignty there stands the still 
     <lb/>more sacred principle of individual freedom. 
     <lb/>Let me. Mr. Speaker. quote on this point 
     <lb/>an extract from Storey's book on the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Constitution. volume 11. page 220 :

     State of Missouri into the union, an attempt 
     <lb/>
     was made to include a restriction. prohibiting 
     <lb/>
     the introduction of slavery into that State, as 
     <lb/>
     a condition of the admission. On that occasion 
     <lb/>
     the question was largely discussed, whether 
     <lb/>
     "Congress possessed a constitutional authority 
     <lb/>
     to impose such a restriction, upon the ground 
     <lb/>
     that the prescribing of such condition is in<lb break="no"/>consistent with the sovereignty of the State 
     <lb/>
     to be admitted, and its equality with the other 
     <lb/>
     States. The final result of the vote which 
     <lb/>
     authorized the erection of that State, seems to 
     <lb/>
     establish the rightful authority of Congress 
     <lb/>
     to impose such a restriction, although it, was 
     <lb/>
     not them applied. In the act passed for this 
     <lb/>
     purpose, there is an express clause, that in 
     <lb/>
     all the territory ceded by France to the United 
     <lb/>
     States under the name of Louisiana, which lies 
     <lb/>
     north of 36° 30' N. latitude, not included within 
     <lb/>
     the limits of the State of Missouri, slavery 
     <lb/>
     and involuntary servitude, otherwise than in 
     <lb/>
     the punishment of crimes, whereof the parties 
     <lb/>
     shall have been duly convicted, shall be, and 
     <lb/>
     is hereby for ever prohibited. An objection of a 
     <lb/>
     similar character was taken to the compact 
     <lb/>
     between Virginia and Kentucky, upon the 
     <lb/>
     ground that it was a restriction upon State 
     <lb/>
     sovereignty. But the Supreme Court had no 
     <lb/>
     hesitation in overruling it. considering it as 
     <lb/>
     opposed by the theory of all free governments, 
     <lb/>
     and especially of those which constitute the 
     <lb/>
     American Republic.

     The decision rendered in the case of Mis<lb break="no"/>souri has been at all times considered as 
     <lb/>
     the policy of the United States. Neverthe<lb break="no"/>less. Mr. Speaker, under the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the United States. all that Congress has a 
     <lb/>
     right to do is to admit a state into the 
     <lb/>
     union. Such is not the case as regards our 
     <lb/>
     constitution. The British North America

     When the province of Manitoba was ad<lb break="no"/>mitted into the Dominion, the public men

     jesty declares that an address on behalf of 
     <lb/>
     the parliament of Canada will suffice. In 
     <lb/>
     that case. therefore, no agreement has been 
     <lb/>
     entered into between the parties, for the 
     <lb/>
     making of an agreement implies two parties. 
     <lb/>
     Why have we this omission in the latter 
     <lb/>
     case? For this reason that when these ter<lb break="no"/>ritories were admitted into the Dominion, 
     <lb/>
     they were not organized, they were with<lb break="no"/>out a constitution, while British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     and Prince Edward Island had each a con<lb break="no"/>stitution and a regularly organized govern<lb break="no"/>ment. These provinces were fully organ<lb break="no"/>ized when they entered confederation ; but 
     <lb/>
     such was not the case with the Territories. 
     <lb/>
     it was therefore necessary that the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion parliament should acquire the right to 
     <lb/>
     lay down the terms on which these terri<lb break="no"/>tories might be admitted into the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
     It was realized that section 146 was not 
     <lb/>
     up to the requirements. In the year 1870, 
     <lb/>
     Sir John Macdonald, perceiving this inad<lb break="no"/>equacy. recommended that the home gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should help out the Dominion parli<lb break="no"/>ament by granting it greater powers than 
     <lb/>
     had been vested in it by the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     1867. The words 'terms and conditions' 
     <lb/>
     might well apply to an agreement. but not 
     <lb/>
     to the drafting of a constitution suitable 
     <lb/>
     to unorganized Territories. Section 146 
     <lb/>
     which met the case as regards provinces 
     <lb/>
     having a distinct individuality, was no long<lb break="no"/>er sufficient when Territories such as those 
     <lb/>
    in the Northwest were to be taken in. 
     <lb/>Such is Sir John Macdonald's contention, 
     <lb/>set forth in his memorandum dated Decem<lb break="no"/>ber, 1870. I quote:

     Well, that clause providing for the creation

     <lb/>
     Sir John Macdonnld, in the words just

     quoted, and contained in the very Act which 
     <lb/>
     confirms that of 1870 to restrict the powers 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba. that provision, as all will see, 
     <lb/>
     is very broad in its wording. The imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament was aware of what had occurred 
     <lb/>
     in the case of Manitoba. It was stated at 
     <lb/>
     the same time in section 5 of the same Act. 
     <lb/>
     that the Manitoba Act 'would be and was

     <lb/>
     it was not void. as had been contended ; and

     with a knowledge of these facts, parliament, 
     <lb/>
     in the broadest terms, authorizes parliament 
     <lb/>
     to establish new provinces. If the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     parliament desired that we should not have 
     <lb/>
     the right to restrict the powers of the new

     a distinguished lawyer, professor of consti<lb break="no"/>tutional law, who made an eminently patri<lb break="no"/>otic speech the other evening, has thought 
     <lb/>
     fit to uphold the first contention of the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition. He claimed 
     <lb/>
     that parliament had not the power to res<lb break="no"/>trict provincial rights. He said "When I 
     <lb/>
     consider the wording of the Act of 1871, I 
     <lb/>
     am forced to the conclusion that, in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with the construction generally put on 
     <lb/>
     it, this clause would give parliament un<lb break="no"/>restricted powers ; however, on closer con<lb break="no"/>sideration, I come to a different conclusion. 
     <lb/>
     He takes up, to begin with, the words : ' To 
     <lb/>
     constitute and establish.' These are not 
     <lb/>
     the words used in the Act; in the French 
     <lb/>
     as well as in the English copy the word 
     <lb/>
     ' constitution' is used. According to the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Jacques Cartier, consti<lb break="no"/>tute' would mean to fix the boundaries of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces and to decide on the date of 
     <lb/>
     their admission into the Dominion, and also 
     <lb/>
     to manage their affairs up to the date of the 
     <lb/>
     coming in force of the constitution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, such a construction is in con<lb break="no"/>tradiction with the meaning given to the 
     <lb/>
     word 'constitution' in chapter 5 of the 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act. It is seen there 
     <lb/>
     that provincial constitution applies to the 
     <lb/>
     executive and the legislative power. Should 
     <lb/>
     there be any doubt on this point, we might 
     <lb/>
     consider the other terms used in section 2. 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1871. which enables us not 
     <lb/>
     only to enact provisions for the constitution 
     <lb/>
     and government of the provinces. but also 
     <lb/>
     'for the passing of laws concerning peace. 
     <lb/>
     order and good government'; which evi<lb break="no"/>dently apply to the legislative power. If we 
     <lb/>
     were merely to admit these new provinces 
     <lb/>
     into confederation under the provisions con<lb break="no"/>tained in the British North America Act for 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec, they would be without 
     <lb/>
     a constitution, since they have not any as 
     <lb/>
     was the case with the province which came 
     <lb/>
     into confederation in 1867. New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia. British Columbia and Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island had their constitution just 
     <lb/>
     the same as Ontario and Quebec. But in 
     <lb/>
     this case it is necessary to decide on the 
     <lb/>
     terms of the constitution of these new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, since they are without a constitu<lb break="no"/>tion at the time we are granting them pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Other objections are made : If you are en<lb break="no"/>titled. they say. to interfere with some of' 
     <lb/>
     their rights, why not with all? Has not 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament enacted laws con<lb break="no"/>cerning property in connection with rail<lb break="no"/>ways, nlthough that is a matter which comes 
     <lb/>
     within the purview of the provinces. Why 
     <lb/>
     should we have all these Dominion laws 


            <pb n="3457" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3457.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3457</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">MARCH 30, 1905</fw>
            
   

     relative to property ? Because they were 
     <lb/>
     needed in order to ensure the successful 
     <lb/>
     working of the laws enacted by the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion parliament. I might quote other ex<lb break="no"/>amples. Courts have decided in many in<lb break="no"/>stances that we could legislate incidentally 
     <lb/>
     011 the matters enumerated in section 92 
     <lb/>
     although these matters are left exclusively 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is another argument, and I am glad 
     <lb/>
     that the hon. member for Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Monk) has brought it up. He claims 
     <lb/>
     that there should have been no inequality 
     <lb/>
     between the 'arious provinces. But do we 
     <lb/>
     not find in the constitution provisions made 
     <lb/>
     for the protection of minorities? Does not 
     <lb/>
     section 80 enact that twelve counties in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec are in a way set apart 
     <lb/>
     for the English-speaking minority, and that 
     <lb/>
     the limits of these counties shall not be 
     <lb/>
     changed without the consent of the major<lb break="no"/>ity of the representatives of these counties? 
     <lb/>
     That is a restriction on behalf of the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish-speaking and Protestant minority of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec. a restriction which is 
     <lb/>
     not found in the case of any other province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the provinces other than Quebec. the 
     <lb/>
     use of the French language is not official, 
     <lb/>
     nevertheless we find here a provision stat<lb break="no"/>ing that in the province of Quebec, the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish language shall be on the same footing 
     <lb/>
     as the French. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The imperial parliament having made all 
     <lb/>
     these various restrictions, without thinking 
     <lb/>
     that they .were interfering with provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights, are we not thereby justified in fol<lb break="no"/>lowing the same rule as regards the protec<lb break="no"/>tion to the minority in the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But that has not been sufficient to allay 
     <lb/>
     the fears of some of our hon. friends on the 
     <lb/>
     other side. and the member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule) sent in haste a telegram to a 
     <lb/>
     high legal authority in Toronto; he asked 
     <lb/>
     the opinion of a leading lawyer. Mr. Chris<lb break="no"/>topher Robinson, as to the meaning of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 of, our constitution. Mr. Robinson 
     <lb/>
     made his opinion known, and if the member 
     <lb/>
     for East Grey had been a lawyer, and not a 
     <lb/>
     doctor. he would have soon realized that 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Robinson V'as making fun of him when 
     <lb/>
     he answered that the power of parliament 
     <lb/>
     was not beyond quest-ion. Now. is there 
     <lb/>
     anything on earth that is beyond question, 
     <lb/>
     or which a lawyer may question? Have 
     <lb/>
     not books been written denyingr the exist<lb break="no"/>ence of God : have not even some philoso<lb break="no"/>phers turned out volumes expressing doubt 
     <lb/>
     as to their very existence ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, the power of parliament hav<lb break="no"/>ing thus been vindicated, the stand taken by 
     <lb/>
     the hon. leader of the opposition appears 
     <lb/>
     in a new light. While he states that sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 has no application, his colleague 
     <lb/>
     from the province of Quebec asserts that it 
     <lb/>
     has. Under these circumstances. the coun<lb break="no"/>try faces a conflict of opinions, a difficulty 
     <lb/>
     which should be solved by parliament in 
     <lb/>
     order to avoid all trouble. So that, if the 
     <lb/>
     hon. leader of the opposition is not in a po<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3457</fw>
     <fw type="num">3458</fw>
 

     sition to satisfy the House that his first 
     <lb/>
     proposition is well founded, we have to 
     <lb/>
     come to the conclusion that he is not de<lb break="no"/>sirous of seeing the question settled. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So much has been said about this section 
     <lb/>
     93 that I need not quote it, every one of us 
     <lb/>
     knows it by heart. However, I shall ven<lb break="no"/>ture to say one word as to its construction. 
     <lb/>
     There are two ways of interpreting a stat<lb break="no"/>ute: liberally, and literally. If I give it its 
     <lb/>
     liberal interpretation there can be no doubt 
     <lb/>
     that the first clause of section 93 applies 
     <lb/>
     under the circumstances. Mr. Robinson. in 
     <lb/>
     giving the aforementioned opinion claimed 
     <lb/>
     that no part of section 93 applied. If that 
     <lb/>
     section has no application, then it will be 
     <lb/>
     contended that section 92 settles the point. 
     <lb/>
     Notwithstanding my deep respect for Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Robinson. 1 have no hesitation in saying 
     <lb/>
     that his view of the case is evidently wrong. 
     <lb/>
     The Privy Council have decided so in the 
     <lb/>
     case of Brophy versus the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     of Manitoba. The Manitoba Act contains 
     <lb/>
     a clause corresponding to clause 2 of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill now before us, in regard to which the 
     <lb/>
     Privy Council made the following comment. 
     <lb/>
     page 212 L. R., 1895 : 
     <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     The second section of the Manitoba Act en<lb break="no"/>acts that after the prescribed day of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act shall, 'except those

     So that should section 16 of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     disappear. section 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act would still be applicable, in 
     <lb/>
     virtue of section 2 of the Bill, to which no 
     <lb/>
     exception is taken. What the learned 
     <lb/>
     lawyer. Mr. Robinson. must have meant 
     <lb/>
     was that subsection 1 and 3 of section 93

     were not applicable.

            </p>

            <p>
     We should put a liberal construction on 
     <lb/>
     that statute. Maxwell. in his work 'on 
     <lb/>
     statutes,' lays down the following rule: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Except in some few cases where a statute 
     <lb/>
     has fallen under the principle of excessively 
     <lb/>
     strict construction, the language of a. statute 
     <lb/>
     is generally extended to new things which 
     <lb/>
     were not known and could not have been con<lb break="no"/>templated by the legislature when it was 
     <lb/>
     passed. This occurs when the Act deals with 
     <lb/>
     a genus, and the thing which afterwards comes 
     <lb/>
     into existence is a species of it. Thus, the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of Magna Charta which exempts 
     <lb/>
     lords from the liability of having their carts 
     <lb/>
     taken for carriage was held to extend to 


            <pb n="3459" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3459.jpg"/>

     degrees of nobility not known when it was

     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     If we apply that rule of interpretation, 
     <lb/>
     taking into account the fact that no pro<lb break="no"/>vision has been made specially for the 
     <lb/>
     Territories, then we reach the conclusion 
     <lb/>
     that the word ' province ' is applicable also 
     <lb/>
     to the Territories which we acquired in 
     <lb/>
     1870. Now, that power granted by section 
     <lb/>
     93 is not unlimited ; it is restricted by sub<lb break="no"/>section 1 and 3. Such is the meaning of 
     <lb/>
     that section when liberally interpreted ; 
     <lb/>
     and even if we should interpret it literally, 
     <lb/>
     it is still open to the same construction. 
     <lb/>
     'Words should here engross our attention. 
     <lb/>
     Warfare is being carried on about the 
     <lb/>
     words 'province,' 'legislature,' and 'date 
     <lb/>
     of union.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is contended that the word province 
     <lb/>
     does not include territory. The definition 
     <lb/>
     of that word is not given in the English 
     <lb/>
     statutes, but it is given in ours. The Can<lb break="no"/>adian legislature has stated what is the 
     <lb/>
     meaning of the word 'province.' We read in 
     <lb/>
     our statute-book what should be understood 
     <lb/>
     by the word 'province.' Subsection 13 of 
     <lb/>
     section 7 of our interpretation Act says : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The expression 'province' includes the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories and the district of Keewatin.

            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     It is thus seen that the word 'territory' 
     <lb/>
     is synonomous to ' province ; ' even the word 
     <lb/>
     'district' is covered by its meaning, as in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Keewatin, for instance. Hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on the other side contend that 
     <lb/>
     the schools of the Northwest cannot be con<lb break="no"/>sidered as actual statutory enactment, that 
     <lb/>
     they are mere ordinances voted by a mere 
     <lb/>
     council. Let us see what is the meaning 
     <lb/>
     of the word 'legislature' according; to the 
     <lb/>
     Interpretation Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I shall read subsection 14, of that same 
     <lb/>
     section 7 :

     the Lieutenant Governor in Council and also

     the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest

     Therefore, Sir, 'province,' 'territory,' le<lb break="no"/>gislature' and 'assembly' have the same 
     <lb/>
     meaning for us inhabitants of Canada. In 
     <lb/>
     fact, the definition which I have just given 
     <lb/>
     is in accord with the principles laid down 
     <lb/>
     by the Interpretation Act of 1889 in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, as regards the word legislature. It 
     <lb/>
     is as follows : Any authority other than 
     <lb/>
     the imperial government empowered to pass 
     <lb/>
     laws within the British possessions. So 
     <lb/>
     that, according to the imperial interpreta<lb break="no"/>tion Act itself, the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     were governed by a legislature and the 
     <lb/>
     laws passed by that body are the laws of 
     <lb/>
     a legislature. Let us now pass on to the 
     <lb/>
     word 'union.' That word may mean Can<lb break="no"/>ada or the Confederation. It is the latter 
     <lb/>
     meaning which should be given to the word.

     As to the term 'date of union', its meaning

     for the four provinces is the first of July, 
     <lb/>
     1867. For the others, it means the date

     Mr. Speaker, in voting for the Bill which 
     <lb/>
     is now submitted by the government, we 
     <lb/>
     are not, as I am aware, granting very much 
     <lb/>
     to the minority in the provinces of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. We are only confirming the 
     <lb/>
     present state of things. That state of 
     <lb/>
     things may not be very satisfactory ; but 
     <lb/>
     legislators are often obliged to take cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances into account. To those who 
     <lb/>
     may taunt him for not granting any more, 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister may say. like Solon : 
     <lb/>
     I have not given them the best laws, but 
     <lb/>
     I, have given them the best laws they were 
     <lb/>
    capable of standing. Mr. Speaker, since 
     <lb/>the outset of this debate, we have had 
     <lb/>surprise after surprise. Hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>on the other side are not generally very well 
     <lb/>disposed towards the provinces, while the 
     <lb/>Liberal party has always upheld their au<lb break="no"/>thority and sought to vindicate their rights. 
     <lb/>The other day, the hon. member for South 
     <lb/>York, (Mr. Maclean) assailed the right hon. 
     <lb/>Prime Minister, called him a tyrant and 
     <lb/>what not. It is not many years since I 
     <lb/>entered this House, but I have in the mean<lb break="no"/>time became acquainted with the true in<lb break="no"/>wardness of the feeling of hon. members on 
     <lb/>the other side. as regards provincial rights. 
     <lb/>In 1902, in the course of a debate, the hon. 
     <lb/>member for South York spoke as follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I say that the interpretation of the law that 
     <lb/>
     has been given by the English Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the distribution of rights as be<lb break="no"/>tween the provinces, and the federal power, 
     <lb/>
     has been against the interest of the country 
     <lb/>
     as; a whole. That I regret, I agree with the 
     <lb/>
     honourable member for Lanark (Hon. Mr. Hag<lb break="no"/>gart) that some day we will have the whole 
     <lb/>
     jurisdiction in this parliament and in some way 
     <lb/>
     we will work it out, and in some way we will 
     <lb/>
     increase the federal power and wipe out gradu<lb break="no"/>ally the provincial power. I take issue directly 
     <lb/>
     with the honourable gentlemen who oppose 
     <lb/>
     that view, I say that provincial government 
     <lb/>
     and the enlargement of provincial rights has 
     <lb/>
     not been in the interest of this country, and I 
     <lb/>
     say that Sir John A. Macdonald was right,

     There is also the question of vested<lb/>rights. In 1875, parliament passed a law 
     <lb/>
     granting a temporary constitution to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories, and by that consti<lb break="no"/>tution parliament declared that certain 
     <lb/>
     rights granted to the minority would be 
     <lb/>
     for ever assured to them. The rights of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority were recognized by re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of a different religious belief, 
     <lb/>
     and it was Mr. Blake himself who brought 
     <lb/>
     up the question. That same policy was 
     <lb/>
     confirmed, in 1880, by the Conservative gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the time. It was enacted once 
     <lb/>
     more that the Catholic population would 
     <lb/>
     have their separate schools, and parliament 
     <lb/>
     is to-day bound in honour to continue that 
     <lb/>
     system. The government itself through its 
     <lb/>
     oflicers has declared that the Dominion of 
     <lb/>
     Canada had guaranteed that right to the 
     <lb/>
     minority. I find the proof of this in a 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet published by the Department of 
     <lb/>
     Agriculture for the information of those

    who wish to settle in the west. The fol<lb break="no"/>lowing is an extract :

     Mr. Speaker, in the course of this debate. 
     <lb/>
     we have often heard about provincial rights; 
     <lb/>
     but we have heard very little about other 
     <lb/>
     rights of much more value, I mean indi<lb break="no"/>vidual rights. Among those privileges 
     <lb/>
     which, in England, Simon de Montfort and 
     <lb/>
     the other Norman barons forced King John 
     <lb/>
     to grant them in that Magna Charta so dear 
     <lb/>
     to the English heart, was not personal li<lb break="no"/>berty the most precious of all ? And why 
     <lb/>
     was that personal liberty so dear to the 
     <lb/>
     English people ? It was because they, even 
     <lb/>
     at that time nnde'stood the true principles

     which have since prevailed in the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of progressive nations. However, we 
     <lb/>
     still find to-day people who are prone to re<lb break="no"/>turn to the old notions which were current 
     <lb/>
     in the days of tyranny. 'I have here a letter 
     <lb/>
     published in one of the city newspapers 
     <lb/>
     against separate schools, under the signature 
     <lb/>
     of a man of some education. In support of 
     <lb/>
     his view, he quotes Aristotle. in the follow<lb break="no"/>ing words : 'The state, as regards its citi<lb break="no"/>zens. plays the part of an educator, It 
     <lb/>
     strives to regulate their actions. The most 
     <lb/>
     despicable of states is that which lets each 
     <lb/>
     one live according to his fancy... Edu<lb break="no"/>cation should be public and common '. Such, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, was the tyrannical system of 
     <lb/>
     the Ancients. The Spartans, in the interest 
     <lb/>
     of the commonwealth, deprived the head of a 
     <lb/>
     family of his children when they were seven 
     <lb/>
     years old; a kind of broth was to be the 
     <lb/>
     only nourishment of all; strict regulations 
     <lb/>
     were enacted on all subjects. The indivi<lb break="no"/>dual was nothing ; the commonwealth was 
     <lb/>
     all. As a result, Sparata ruled over Greece, 
     <lb/>
     but left a hateful name in history. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     However, there appeared a man in the 
     <lb/>
     world's history who changed all these con<lb break="no"/>ditions. He abolished slavery ; he declared 
     <lb/>
     that personal liberty was a boon of greater 
     <lb/>
     value than political rights. Of what use is 
     <lb/>
     it to me to have a vote in parliament, if I 
     <lb/>
     am not the master in my own house, the 
     <lb/>
    master on my own property. if I have not 
     <lb/>
     control over my children ? The father of a 
     <lb/>
     family is intent in transmitting to his child 
     <lb/>
     not only his name and his property, but also, 
     <lb/>
     and particularly, his traditions, those beliefs 
     <lb/>
     which were imparted to him on his mother's 
     <lb/>
     knee. That is the most sacred inheritance. 
     <lb/>
     Personal liberty has precedence over pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     How could a nation be happy if that liber<lb break="no"/>ty is not safeguarded '3 That principle had . 
     <lb/>
     been well grasped by the fathers of cow 
     <lb/>
     federation. Anxious as they were to gua 
     <lb/>
     rantee the rights of the individual, they

     chose that system of federal union.

     Mr. Speaker, was it not to preserve for each 
     <lb/>
     one of us. his tongue, his faith, in a word 
     <lb/>
     his individuality ? These great men believed 
     <lb/>
     that if Providence had allowed the repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives of the two greatest nationalities

     in Europe to be partners in the ownership 
     <lb/>
     of these lands. it was not for us to pretend 
     <lb/>
     to be wiser. They believed that happiness 
     <lb/>
     reigns in a country when the individual 
     <lb/>
     rights of each citizen are safeguarded. They 
     <lb/>
     believed that the Roman wisdom of the En<lb break="no"/>glishman, combined with the Athenian

     Mr. Speaker. I have listened with pleasure

     to the argument of my hon. friend (Mr.

     L. P. Demers) who has just taken his seat ;  
     <lb/>
    and although I would be very happy to ad<lb break="no"/>dress the House in the beautiful language 
     <lb/>in which he has done, I crave the in<lb break="no"/>dulgence of my colleagues if I speak the 
     <lb/>language of the majority. In listening to 
     <lb/>my hon. friend I have been astonished to 
     <lb/>observe the conclusions at which he has 
     <lb/>arrived. My hon. friend has discussed only 
     <lb/>one phase of the measure now before the 
     <lb/>House, which indicates, I suppose, the great 
     <lb/>interest that is taken in the clause respect<lb break="no"/>ing the schools, while as a matter of fact 
     <lb/>there are other things to be considered. My 
     <lb/>hon. friend commenced his remarks by cast<lb break="no"/>ing reflections upon those who preceded 
     <lb/>him. He endeavoured to make political 
     <lb/>party capital of the question which is now 
     <lb/>being debated in parliament. It is true, 
     <lb/>it is a political question ; but we were 
     <lb/>told, at the commencement of the discussion 
     <lb/>of this measure, that we had to stand upon 
     <lb/>very high ground, because it was a very 
     <lb/>important and very dangerous question to 
     <lb/>discuss. My hon. friend, in the beginning 
     <lb/>of his remarks referred to the educational 
     <lb/>system in the republic to the south of us ; 
     <lb/>he then spoke about the Educational Act 
     <lb/>of Manitoba ; he went on to say that this 
     <lb/>was a question of justice ; and, after speak<lb break="no"/>ing on the interpretation of our constitution, 
     <lb/>he concluded by saying that he would not 
     <lb/>be able, by the vote which he intends to 
     <lb/>give, to render to those who are interested 
     <lb/>in this measure, all that he would like to 
     <lb/>give them, but that he would do the best 
     <lb/>he could. My hon. friend, in speaking about 
     <lb/>the constitution, reminded me of an old 
     <lb/>saying of an American politician, that pat<lb break="no"/>riotism is the refuge of scoundrels. Here I 
     <lb/>am afraid we have been playing a great 
     <lb/> deal with the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>Although my right hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>the government stood upon the rock of the 
     <lb/>constitution when he spoke on the 21st of 
     <lb/>February, and although my hon. friend the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition also stands on 
     <lb/>the rock of the constitution, to my mind that 
     <lb/>rock is not very solid ; and since 1896, the 
     <lb/>less we speak about the British North 
     <lb/>America Act the better. To show how little 
     <lb/>we can depend upon the rules which were 
     <lb/>laid down at the time the British North Am<lb break="no"/>erica Act was passed, my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>St. John and Iberville (Mr. Demers) said 
     <lb/>a few moments ago that you would find 
     <lb/>in that Act that in the province of Quebec 
     <lb/>there must for ever be twelve counties re<lb break="no"/>presented by Protestants. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEME3">Mr. L. P. DEMERS</persName>. I beg pardon. I 
     <lb/>
     did not say that. I said that so long as 
     <lb/>
     the majority of those twelve counties did 
     <lb/>
     not want to change the boundaries of those 
     <lb/>
     counties the majority of the province could 
     <lb/>
     not change them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. That is better. I 
     <lb/>
     thought my hon. friend said the opposite, and 
     <lb/>
     I was going to say that this would not

     amount to a great deal, as the population is 
     <lb/>
     changing ; and although a provision was 
     <lb/>
     not made for the province of Ontario, the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians are conquering some 
     <lb/>
     counties in that province without having 
     <lb/>
     recourse to the British North America Act. 
     </p>

            <p>Now, Sir, there are other questions in<lb break="no"/>volved in the Bill before the House. Many 
     <lb/>speeches have been made and many things 
     <lb/>have been written since it was introduced 
     <lb/>into this House, and I would have been 
     <lb/>very glad to have heard my hon. friend 
     <lb/>speak on some of these matters. There are 
     <lb/>the creation of the two provinces, the deli<lb break="no"/>mitation of the provinces, the question of the 
     <lb/>lands, and the school question. It is most 
     <lb/>extraordinary that since this Bill was 
     <lb/>brought before parliament we have heard 
     <lb/>very little of the other matters ; we have 
     <lb/>heard more of the school question than of 
     <lb/>anything else. Well, Sir, I intend to say 
     <lb/>just a word or two on the other points. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the delimitation of the 
     <lb/>provinces, I would prefer to leave that 
     <lb/>to the members who are most interested. 
     <lb/>I admit at once that I do not know enough 
     <lb/>of the geography of those two provinces to 
     <lb/>say whether the delimitation made by the 
     <lb/>right hon. leader of the government is a 
     <lb/>good one or not. I may say, however, that 
     <lb/>I was satisfied to have the territory made 
     <lb/>into two provinces instead of one, although 
     <lb/>personally I would have been gratified to 
     <lb/>see the province of Manitoba enlarged. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the lands, if we were 
     <lb/>following the constitution to the letter, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to clause 109 of the British North 
     <lb/>America Act, we would have to give to the 
     <lb/>provinces the control of their public lands ; 
     <lb/>but since we do not intend to follow the 
     <lb/>British North America Act all through, I am 
     <lb/>prepared to let it go by so far as the lands 
     <lb/>are concerned, and to say that I approve of 
     <lb/>the position taken by the government. At 
     <lb/>first I was not in favour of that. My 
     <lb/>view is confirmed, not so much by the 
     <lb/>British North America Act as by the fact 
     <lb/>that we have paid a very large sum of 
     <lb/>money for those lands, and that we are 
     <lb/>spending a great deal of money every year 
     <lb/>to bring in immigrants to settle upon them, 
     <lb/>and neglecting the vacant lands in the older 
     <lb/>provinces—I refer especially to the province 
     <lb/>of Quebec. But having thought the matter 
     <lb/>over, and, I may say without any false- 
     <lb break="yes"/>modesty, influenced by some of the speeches 
     <lb/>made in this House, I concluded that it 
     <lb/>would be in the best interest of Canada 
     <lb/>for this parliament to hold its hands upon 
     <lb/>those lands in the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>We expect to have in that country a very 
     <lb/>large population ; we are inviting people 
     <lb/>from all parts of the world to come there, 
     <lb/>and we do not choose carefully enough the 
     <lb/>immigration that is going on in. But we 
     <lb/>seem to be in a hurry to have those immense 
     <lb/>tracts of land opened up to cultivation. 
     <lb/>We do not know what spirit will in a

     few years hence animate those new popu<lb break="no"/>lations which are coming into the North<lb break="no"/>west of Canada although we expect, by 
     <lb/>
     wise laws, to make them satisfied to 
     <lb/>
     live under the flag under which we are 
     <lb/>
     so happy to live. Yet, I repeat, in my view 
     <lb/>
     it was an act of wisdom on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the government and in the best interests of 
     <lb/>
     Canada to retain the public lands under 
     <lb/>
     the control of this parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the financial aspect of 
     <lb/>
     this measure, I remember hearing my right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend say that it was natural that we 
     <lb/>
     should be as generous as possible to those 
     <lb/>
     new provinces. I share his view. We are 
     <lb/>
     generous. My impression is that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories will be, from 
     <lb/>
     a monetary point of view, in a better posi<lb break="no"/>tion, when enjoying their provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy, than they were ever in before. If

     This is to become in time, when the popu<lb break="no"/>lation shall have reached 800,000 souls, $2,<lb break="no"/>207,875 for each province or $4,415,750 for

     the two.

            <p>
     I now come to the question which is 
     <lb/>
     creating—and I think very unnecessary—so 
     <lb/>
     much turmoil in the Dominion. I refer to 
     <lb/>
     the question of the schools. It is not my 
     <lb/>
     intention to dwell at any great length on 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, as it seems to me everything that pos<lb break="no"/>sibly could be said in that connection, on 
     <lb/>
     both sides of the argument, has been said 
     <lb/>
     by those who preceded me. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from St. John and Iberville (Mr. Demers), 
     <lb/>
     who has just discussed this question with 
     <lb/>
     much ability, laid great stress upon the 
     <lb/>
     word ' province ' and the word ' territory ' 
     <lb/>
     and even the word ' district,' in considering 
     <lb/>
     whether clause 93 was applicable or not to 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces about to be created. On 
     <lb/>
     this same question, a very able argument 
     <lb/>
     was made by my right hon. friend, and also 
     <lb/>
     strong arguments were made by my hon.

     friend the leader of the opposition and 
     <lb/>
     others who followed, notably the member 
     <lb/>
     for North Toronto (Mr. Foster). But there 
     <lb/>
     is one principle which it seems to me has 
     <lb/>
     been lost sight of, and yet which I think 
     <lb/>
     should govern us in discussing this measure, 
     <lb/>
     and that is that constitutions are made 
     <lb/>
     for men and not men for constitutions. And 
     <lb/>
     standing here as a representative of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, I ask myself should I confine my en<lb break="no"/>deavours to discover a literal interpretation 
     <lb/>
     of that clause 93 of the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act, or should I rather not look 
     <lb/>
     higher and think of the future, not only 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories, but of the 
     <lb/>
     whole Dominion? Should I not rather re<lb break="no"/>gard our constitution as having been framed 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of working out the destinies 
     <lb/>
     of this country in the most satisfactory 
     <lb/>
     manner possible and of being interpreted 
     <lb/>
     in that spirit rather than of being inter<lb break="no"/>preted in that narrow spirit which would 
     <lb/>
     set the letter of the law above its inten<lb break="no"/>tion and make the future harmony and 
     <lb/>
     greatness of this country subordinate to the 
     <lb/>
     mere wording of a certain clause. My right 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend, when he brought down the mea<lb break="no"/>sure, made a speech which was an admir<lb break="no"/>able one from my point of view. He said 
     <lb/>
     we are bringing those two provinces into 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion by the means furnished us 
     <lb/>
     by the British North America Act in its 
     <lb/>
     clause 146. He also spoke about clause 93, 
     <lb/>
     but in the Bill itself he furnished the best 
     <lb/>
     argument which I think could be brought, 
     <lb/>
     following the ideas which I intend to follow 
     <lb/>
     during my remarks. In this connection I 
     <lb/>
     want to ask my hon. friend from St. John 
     <lb/>
     and Iberville (Mr. Demers), who has just 
     <lb/>
     told us that the First Minister could not 
     <lb/>
     do everything he wanted to do, but did as 
     <lb/>
     much as he could, why he did not impress 
     <lb/>
     upon my right hon. friend the desirability 
     <lb/>
     of keeping the Bill intact as it was intro<lb break="no"/>duced. I am now speaking about clause 
     <lb/>
     16. We have heard a great deal about that 
     <lb/>
     clause. It was that clause which brought 
     <lb/>
     about the resignation of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Brandon (Mr. Sifton), and we have 
     <lb/>
     heard a great many speeches about the posi<lb break="no"/>tion taken with regard to the same clause 
     <lb/>
     by my hon. friend the Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Fielding) and some other ministers 
     <lb/>
     whose names were not mentioned. I do 
     <lb/>
     not propose to discuss why the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman the First Minister did not wait for 
     <lb/>
     the arrival of the member for Brandon 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sifton) or the Minister of Finance (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fielding) before bringing in his Bill. That 
     <lb/>
     is none of my business. I take it for 
     <lb/>
     granted that when the government came 
     <lb/>
     down on the 21st February and put before 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons a project of law, 
     <lb/>
     that measure was the result of the delib<lb break="no"/>erations of the Dominion cabinet. And I 
     <lb/>
     repeat that I listened with pleasure to the 
     <lb/>
     speech of my right hon. friend when he in<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="3467" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3467.jpg"/>

troduced that Bill. I go further. Being 
     <lb/>
     convinced that the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fitzpatrick) had had a great deal to do with 
     <lb/>
     the framing of this clause 16, and recog<lb break="no"/>nizing in the manner in which that clause 
     <lb/>
     was drafted the high qualifications which 
     <lb/>
     we all know that hon. gentleman to possess, 
     <lb/>
     I thought that I recognized in it a kind of 
     <lb/>
     vindication of the position taken by the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party in 1896 upon a similar question. 
     <lb/>
     To my mind it was the only thing the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman could do. and I shall say 
     <lb/>
     why. In the discussion which is taking 
     <lb/>
     place, I was not here one evening when 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fitzpatrick) took some part in it and made 
     <lb/>
     some remarks, which of course do not give 
     <lb/>
     any idea of what he will say when he 
     <lb/>
     speaks at length on the measure. But some 
     <lb/>
     hon. members have said that clause 93 of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act settles the 
     <lb/>
     case. I think that is pretty well the opin<lb break="no"/>ion expressed by my hon. friend from St. 
     <lb/>
     John and Iberville (Mr. Demers). The mo<lb break="no"/>ment a territory becomes a province. they 
     <lb/>
     argue, it comes in with whatever system 
     <lb/>
     of education it enjoys at the time of the 
     <lb/>
     union. Others take the opposite view and 
     <lb/>
     say that clause 93 does not go so far. And 
     <lb/>
     I imagine that it was in order to dispel any 
     <lb/>
     doubt on that point. that the Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice drafted this clause 16 as it appears 
     <lb/>
     in the original Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There is undoubtedly a law concerning 
     <lb/>
     education in the Northwest Territories to-day. 
     <lb/>
     They certainly have not got an educational 
     <lb/>
     system by tolerance. They have it by 
     <lb/>
     right. There is to-day in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories a law governing education which 
     <lb/>
     was enacted and granted them by the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada in 1875. Clause 11 of 
     <lb/>
     that Act of 1875. and 14 of Revised Statutes 
     <lb/>
     of 1886 reads as follow: :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The Lieutenant Governor in Council shall

     <lb/>
     district or portion of the Territories or of any 
     <lb/>
     less portion or subdivision thereof, by whatever

     <lb/>
     schools therein as they think fit, and make the

    therefor and also that the minority of the rate<lb break="no"/>payers therein, whether Protestant or Roman 
     <lb/>    Catholic. may establish seperate schools there<lb break="no"/>in. and in such case the ratepayers establishing

     ment. It is the law which everybody

     throughout the world, going to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, was supposed to know. 
     <lb/>
     Everybody was supposed to kn0w that

     those in the province of Quebec or those 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Ontario. Now, I take 
     <lb/>
     section 16 of the Bill—

     (Mr. Bergeron) leaves the part of the sub<lb break="no"/>ject he is discussing, I desire, with his per<lb break="no"/>mission, to ask a question. Does be con<lb break="no"/>tend that clause 11 gives to the minority 
     <lb/>
     the same rights as were given by the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America Act to the minority in 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. As a matter of law?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FITZ1">Mr. FITZPATRICK</persName>. It is clause 11 of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I contend that, in re<lb break="no"/>lation to the question before the House, 
     <lb/>
     this was the law and is the law. And, 
     <lb/>
     while I am prepared to rely upon my own 
     <lb/>
     opinion in that matter, I would refer to 
     <lb/>
     the Bill brought down by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) in support of 
     <lb/>
     my position. What is clause 16 of the 
     <lb/>
     Bill now before us ? It is in effect a re<lb break="no"/>enactment of the section of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. It was put in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     as originally presented by the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister as a matter of precaution—in case 
     <lb/>
     any person might otherwise carry the mat<lb break="no"/>ter to the courts and plead that we had 
     <lb/>
     not made it apply to those new provinces 
     <lb/>
     by an Act of the parliament of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Now, section 16 says:

            <p>
     It has been said in this House in the 
     <lb/>
     course of this debate—I cannot remember by 
     <lb/>
     whom—that it was an evidence of great 
     <lb/>
     generosity on the part of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories that, in 1875 the 
     <lb/>
     Mackenzie government then in power in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion, granted separate schools for 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest. Well, Sir, I do not give 
     <lb/>
     any member of this House new information 
     <lb/>
     when I say that in 1875 the majority of 
     <lb/>
     the inhabitants of the Northwest Territo<lb break="no"/>ries were French Canadians and Catholics. 
     <lb/>
     That being the case, it was merely an act 
     <lb/>
     of justice to give them the schools they 
     <lb/>
     wanted.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now. I shall be told that there were or<lb break="no"/>dinances passed after the Act of 1875. So 
     <lb/>
     there were. I will take these up in their 
     <lb/>
     order. In 1885 there was an ordinance 
     <lb/>
     passed effecting the organization of the 
     <lb/>
     school system. When I quote that ordi<lb break="no"/>nance it will be seen that its effect was 
     <lb/>
     to establish such a system as we have in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. In that province 
     <lb/>
     we have a council of public instruction

     half of Catholics. the Protestant managing 
     <lb/>
     the affairs of their schools and the Catho<lb break="no"/>lics managing the affairs of their schools. 
     <lb/>
     This is a system of separate schools not 
     <lb/>
     merely in name, but in fact.

     This was the ordinance of 1885. When 
     <lb/>
     this was passed, the law of 1875 was still 
     <lb/>
     the law. and this ordinance was merely 
     <lb/>
     providing an organization for carrying that 
     <lb/>
     law into effect. How long did it last? 
     <lb/>
     Unfortunately, in the Northwest as in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba and elsewhere the new-comers, honest 
     <lb/>
     men, no doubt, and sincere in their con<lb break="no"/>victions. by degrees have taken away nearly

     Why call it a separate school? Is this 
     <lb/>
     not irony ? Why not have only the one 
     <lb/>
     school? Was it for the sake of giving 
     <lb/>
     some gentlemen an opportunity of saying 
     <lb/>
     that by voting for the amendment of my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend they are keeping separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the Northwest? It has only 
     <lb/>
     to be read to be understood. That was 
     <lb/>
     done on the 31st of December, 1902, and 
     <lb/>
     it was the law and in fact it is the law

     The very same thing. It was called

     a public school, and I am not <choice><corr>sur<lb break="no"/>praised</corr><sic>surprised</sic></choice> that my hon. friend the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) and even

     the ultra-Protestant member for Brandon,

     (Mr. Sifton) have changed their minds after

     their little stampede. The opinions of those

     in- this House who do not believe in separate

     schools, who were honest about it, I respect 
     <lb/>
     just as much as I want them to respect 
     <lb/>
     mine.  I know as a matter of fact that there 
     <lb/>
     are men who are sincerely convinced that 
     <lb/>
     public schools would be better, just as I am 
     <lb/>
     convinced that it is imperative that separate

     the intention of which was, as a matter of

     fact, to abolish separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. If it were not so, 
     <lb/>
     it was because, as has been said by the

     hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) they 
     <lb/>
     were not the law. The law was still in 
     <lb/>
     force. The Act of 1875 was not repealed, 
     <lb/>
     but for all practical purposes separate 
     <lb/>
     schools no longer existed in the Northwest

     read a few moments ago. There is no ques<lb break="no"/>tion that the Privy Council made a remon<lb break="no"/>strance against those ordinances to the 
     <lb/>
     council of the Northwest Territories. There 
     <lb/>
     is no question that a demand was made not 
     <lb/>
     to put in force those ordinances of 1892, the 
     <lb/>
     effect of which, as a matter of fact, was 
     <lb/>
     to abolish separate schools in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. What was the answer ? Noth<lb break="no"/>ing was done.

     to all these prayers, they knew that these

     as well accept the truth of the doctrine that 
     <lb/>
     under a constitutional government it is

     the majority that rules. That is why, I

     think, it is very dangerous to put on the

     the ordinances of 1892 could not be disal<lb break="no"/>lowed because it was too late when the

     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I think that in that re<lb break="no"/>spect my hon. friend is entirely mistaken. 
     <lb/>
     The government simply refused to disal<lb break="no"/>low the ordinances. They never pretended 
     <lb/>
     that they had no right to disallow the or<lb break="no"/>dinances, but they simply said in the report 
     <lb/>
     that my hon. friend has just read that they 
     <lb/>
     did not consider it advisable to disallow 
     <lb/>
     the ordinances. They never pretended for 
     <lb/>
     a moment that they had not the right to 
     <lb/>
     disallow them.

     what I have read. I read from the com<lb break="no"/>plaint of the minority the first time its 
     <lb/>
     representatives appeared before the Can<lb break="no"/>adian Privy Council to complain of the in<lb break="no"/>justice done them. The ordinance of 1892 
     <lb/>
     that they complained of was a re-enactment 
     <lb/>
     of a previous ordinance passed in 1891 and 
     <lb/>
     they were told that it was too late to dis<lb break="no"/>allow the ordinance of 1891.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. No, but they were told 
     <lb/>
     that even if the ordinance of 1892 were dis<lb break="no"/>allowed, yet, as the ordinance of 1891 was 
     <lb/>
     still in force and it was too late to disallow 
     <lb/>
     it, no good would result from the disallow<lb break="no"/>ance of the ordinance of 1892.

     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. Because an appeal in

     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. It was not a question

     disallowance go together and you cannot dis<lb break="no"/>associate them. At all events the result 
     <lb/>
     was that the ordinance of 1892 remained in   
     <lb/>
     force. But why are my hon. friends oppo<lb break="no"/>site plying me with all these questions and   
     <lb/>
     all these objections. What is their object 
     <lb/>
     in that ? I am afraid that it is politics which   
     <lb/>
     prompts these interrogations, and I hope 
     <lb/>
     that politics will be excluded from this dis<lb break="no"/>cussion, I trust to be able to treat of this 
     <lb/>
     matter aside altogether from petty politics.   
     <lb/>
     It is too serious a question with me to allow   
     <lb/>
     political considerations to enter into it and 
     <lb/>
     I am afraid that these gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     have the idea that later on they will be able   
     <lb/>
     to say: the Conservatives were in power 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3475</fw>
     <fw type="num">COMMONS</fw>
    

     and they did not do justice to the minority. 
     <lb/>
     Well, Sir, if the Conservatives did wrong
     <lb/>
     they have had their day of reckoning, and if 
     <lb/>
     the Conservatives did wrong that is no 
     <lb/>
     reason why a Liberal government in power 
     <lb/>
     should perpetuate injustice. I have read the 
     <lb/>
     reasons which were given for not disallow<lb break="no"/>ing the ordinance of 1892, and I would hesi<lb break="no"/>tate long before I would come to the belief 
     <lb/>
     that Sir John Thompson would sacrifice the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic minority of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. I believe he would have come to 
     <lb/>
     their relief unless good and strong reasons 
     <lb/>
     prevented him. Sir John Thompson was 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Justice at the time, and I take 
     <lb/>
     it for granted that he studied the case care<lb break="no"/>fully, and I believe if he had been able to 
     <lb/>
     disallow the Act of 1892, or if its disallow<lb break="no"/>ance would have been of any avail to the 
     <lb/>
     minority, Sir John Thompson would have 
     <lb/>
     disallowed it. But the ordinance of 1891 
     <lb/>
     remaining in force, and it being too late 
     <lb/>
     to disallow it, no good would be accomplish<lb break="no"/>ed by disallowing the ordinance of 1892. 
     <lb/>
     What is the use of splitting hairs on a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of this kind ? I want to take a large 
     <lb/>
     view of it ; I want to see what has happen<lb break="no"/>ed ; I want to know where we find ourselves 
     <lb/>
     to-day and to what cause our grievance may 
     <lb/>
     be attributed. There is no doubt that since 
     <lb/>
     1892 there are no separate schools in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. Whether that be 
     <lb/>
     the fault of the Liberals or the fault of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservatives does not amount to anything 
     <lb/>
     in the present discussion; that will have to 
     <lb/>
     be settled before the electorate. Our duty 
     <lb/>
     here is to make laws and just laws. Per<lb break="no"/>haps it is, that because the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     government may have been guilty of neglect 
     <lb/>
     of duty in this particular, that when the 
     <lb/>
     present Bill was introduced into the House 
     <lb/>
     of Commons it contained the original clause 
     <lb/>
     16, which was an intimation to me that at 
     <lb/>
     least this government was doing its duty— 
     <lb/>
     it did not do it long though. Let us refer 
     <lb/>
     for a moment to the ordinance of 1891. The 
     <lb/>
     rights and privileges of the minority in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories were not taken away 
     <lb/>
     abruptly; there was a gradual encroach<lb break="no"/>ment until we reached chapter 29 of the 
     <lb/>
     ordinance of 1891, the third paragraph of 
     <lb/>
     which reads as follows :

    Brodeur) asked for as to chapter 29 of the 
     <lb/>ordinances, which is the law in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to-day. I have read to the House 
     <lb/>clause 16 of the original Bill as submitted 
     <lb/>to parliament by the Prime Minister. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Clause 16 to my mind was what it should 
     <lb/>have been, and I would have supported it, 
     <lb/>because it was giving the minority in the 
     <lb/>Northwest justice. or course, I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing for myself and expressing my own views. 
     <lb/>I am in favour of separate schools; I be<lb break="no"/>lieve in separate schools—not merely in 
     <lb/>the word 'separate,' but in the tuition which 
     <lb/>children get in separate schools. I want 
     <lb/>religion to be taught in the schools. I want 
     <lb/>the child to hear of God and to pray in the 
     <lb/>school—not all the time; but I want it to 
     <lb/>be understood that the name of God shall 
     <lb/>he mentioned there. I have heard men 
     <lb/>who are very sincere say: 'You are a 
     <lb/>broad minded man; why not let all the 
     <lb/>children go to the same school together, with 
     <lb/>the national flag floating from the top of 
     <lb/>the building? Of course, there would be 
     <lb/>no prayer in the school, because it would 
     <lb/>offend the Roman Catholics, the Methodists, 
     <lb/>the Presbyterians or the Baptists. There 
     <lb/>would be no religion taught. The children 
     <lb/>would simply go there and learn what is 
     <lb/>necessary to earn their living. They would 
     <lb/>play together, and would grow up to re<lb break="no"/>spect each other.' I do not believe'in that 
     <lb/>kind of school, and I do not believe that is 
     <lb/>true. I remember that when I was attend<lb break="no"/>ing college there were some Americans

     though we commenced by playing, we would 
     <lb/>
     finish up by fighting. My hon. friends op<lb break="no"/>posite know the college—it is the Jesuits' 
     <lb/>
     College. They have now a separate college 
     <lb/>
     for English boys. The cause of difference 
     <lb/>
     between the boys was not religion only; it 
     <lb/>
     may have been something else ; but, at any 
     <lb/>
     rate, we fought together. As men we are 
     <lb/>
     surrounded by friends who have been 
     <lb/>
     brought up in different schools, and we 
     <lb/>
     appreciate one another ; but that appreciation 
     <lb/>
       is not developed in children. A man 
     <lb/>
     appreciates   another man certain qualities 
     <lb/>
     for which he respects him, but a child can<lb break="no"/>not do that. I do not want to convert any<lb break="no"/>body to my opinions, because I know that 
     <lb/>
     those who have opposite opinions are as 
     <lb/>
     sincere and honest in holding them as I am 
     <lb/>
     in holding mine. But I am explaining my 
     <lb/>
     opinions; and, holding them, when clause 
     <lb/>
     16 of this Bill was brought down I hailed 
     <lb/>
     it with pleasure, and I was happy at the 
     <lb/>
     deliverance which my right lhon. friend 
     <lb/>
     made on that occasion. It did not last, 
     <lb/>
     however. Why did it not last ? My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from St. John and Iberville (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Demers) says we are not doing what we 
     <lb/>
     would like to do ; we would like to do more, 
     <lb/>
     but we do what we can in a country like 
     <lb/>
     this. This is not the way our forefathers 
     <lb/>
     talked. This is not the way the men who 
     <lb/>
     built up Canada talked. When Sir John 
     <lb/>
     A. Macdonald, in 1863, voted for separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the province of Ontario, the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Canada at that time, he was not 
     <lb/>
     doing what he himself preferred, for he 
     <lb/>
     was in favour of public schools; but he 
     <lb/>
     did so because he thought it was the best 
     <lb/>
     thing that could be done in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Canada at that time, on account of the 
     <lb/>
     different nationalities and creeds in Upper 
     <lb/>
     and Lower Canada. We have often seen 
     <lb/>
     occasions of the same kind. Shall I speak 
     <lb/>
     of something nearer to us ? In 1896 we 
     <lb/>
     had before parliament a question very much 
     <lb/>
     like the present one. except that we were 
     <lb/>
     dealing with a state of things which was 
     <lb/>
     existing at that time, whilst at present we 
     <lb/>
     are creating a state of things. In 1896 the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba school question was before parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. It had been before the country since 
     <lb/>
     1890. I heard the other day the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) boast of hav<lb break="no"/>ing had a great deal to do with the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba school business. I was sorry to hear 
     <lb/>
     him talk like that, although he gave some 
     <lb/>
     reasons, in a very clever way, which hid, 
     <lb/>
     if I may use the word, the odious part of 
     <lb/>
     the business. He declared that the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools were not eflicient, that they were 
     <lb/>
     not what they should have been, and that 
     <lb/>
     money was squandered on them. I need 
     <lb/>
     not tell the House that those statements 
     <lb/>
     have been refuted time and time again. 
     <lb/>
     There may have been some abuses, as there 
     <lb/>
     are in most things. but on the whole the 
  

    
            <pb n="3479" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3479.jpg"/>

     separate schools in Manitoba were good 
     <lb/>
     schools and the teachers were good teachers. 
     <lb/>
     In most cases, the people not having the 
     <lb/>
     means to pay teachers, the parish priests 
     <lb/>
     were the teachers, and we know that they 
     <lb/>
     are men of education. My hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Brandon knows that politics had a great 
     <lb/>
     deal more to do with the abolition of those 
     <lb/>
     schools than the question of their efliciency. 
     <lb/>
     There was some railway business which 
     <lb/>
     put the government into a very bad position. 
     <lb/>
     and something was needed to divert public 
     <lb/>
     opinion from the deeds of the ministers. 
     <lb/>
     Our friend Mr. Dalton McCarthy had gone 
     <lb/>
     on a tour through the province of Manitoba. 
     <lb/>
     He was dissatisfied because Sir John Thomp<lb break="no"/>son had been chosen as Minister of Justice. 
     <lb/>
     He had hopes of being offered that position, 
     <lb/>
     although he might have refused it, and he 
     <lb/>
     went to Manitoba and inflamed the passions 
     <lb/>
     of the people. He told them that some<lb break="no"/>thing should be done to deliver them from 
     <lb/>
     the influence of the hie 'archy. It was there 
     <lb/>
     that be commenced his fight against the 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy, and questions of that sort will 
     <lb/>
     always greatly inflame public opinion. In 
     <lb/>
     a short time the hon. member for Lisgar 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Greenway), who was at the head of 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba government, and the lion. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) deprived 
     <lb/>
     the minority of that province of what they 
     <lb/>
     were entitled to. We have been told that 
     <lb/>
     the question in Manitoba was not the same 
     <lb/>
     question that we are discussing to-day—that 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba, the provincial government had 
     <lb/>
     given separate schools and that the provin<lb break="no"/>cial government withdrew separate schools 
     <lb/>
     and the official use of the French language ; 
     <lb/>
     and that was provincial rights. The minori<lb break="no"/>ty complained. I need not give the whole 
     <lb/>
     history of the case. The question came be<lb break="no"/>fore parliament; and I may say in passing 
     <lb/>
     that the Northwest ordinanCc was passed 
     <lb/>
     while we were in the midst of that turmoil. 
     <lb/>
     The question was before the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     and before the courts. We were taunted on 
     <lb/>
     the stump everywhere- because the Conserv<lb break="no"/>ative government had not disallowed the 
     <lb/>
     Act of the legislature of Manitoba. My 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend the leader of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment was sitting on this side of the House 
     <lb/>
     at that time, when the Hon. Edward Blake 
     <lb/>
     moved a resolution declaring that it would 
     <lb/>
     be wise for the Dominion government not 
     <lb/>
     to use the right of veto in cases involving 
     <lb/>
     religion or nationality, and that resolution 
     <lb/>
     was looked upon as such a wise one that 
     <lb/>
     Sir John A. Macdonald, sitting Where my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend does now, rose and said: 
     <lb/>
     'This is a motion which should have the 
     <lb/>
     unanimous support of the House' ; and it 
     <lb/>
     had. This is why that Act was not vetoed. 
     <lb/>
     At that time my right hon. friend and his 
     <lb/>
     friends in the province of Quebec said that 
     <lb/>
     the government did not act because it 
     <lb/>
     was under the heel of the Orangeinen of 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And it was said in Ontario that the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was under the heel of the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     in the province of Quebec. This lasted from 

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3479</fw>
     <fw type="num">3480</fw>

     1890 to 1896. The constitutionality of the 
     <lb/>
     Act of the Manitoba legislature abolishing 
     <lb/>
     the separate schools had gone before the 
     <lb/>
     Supreme Court of Canada and the Privy 
     <lb/>
     Council, and the Privy Council in its first 
     <lb/>
     judgment declared that the Act was intra 
     <lb/>
     vires the Manitoba legislature. Again there 
     <lb/>
     was an appeal to the Privy Council, and that 
     <lb/>
     court declared that although the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     legislature had the right to pass a law taking 
     <lb/>
     away the schools of the minority in that 
     <lb/>
     province, the minority had a grievance, and 
     <lb/>
     it was within the rights and the powers of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government to come to its 
     <lb/>
     rescue and remove that grievance. Then we 
     <lb/>
     had the Remedial Bill submitted to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament, and we all know what 
     <lb/>
     happened. When my right hon. friend moved 
     <lb/>
     the six months hoist, we were at the end of 
     <lb/>
     the session. But when the second reading 
     <lb/>
     of that Bill was proposed and carried by 
     <lb/>
     a majority of the House, who were the mem<lb break="no"/>bers that voted for it? Who were those 
     <lb/>
     who voted to do justice to the minority of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and to stand upon the rock of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution ? It was, Mr. Speaker, the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party which took that stand. 
     <lb/>
     And I say it to the honour of the Protestants 
     <lb/>
     and the Orangemen of Ontario and the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces, that they voted to do justice 
     <lb/>
     to the Catholic minority. I remember well 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fairbairn, an old representative of the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario, declaring in this House. 
     <lb/>
     that although he was an old Orangeman he 
     <lb/>
     was going to vote in favour of the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority because he had sworn to be a de<lb break="no"/>fender always of minorities, whether Catholic 
     <lb/>
     or Protestant. I am reminding the House of 
     <lb/>
     these facts in order that, in these days, when 
     <lb/>
     we read so much in the newspapers about 
     <lb/>
     the intolerance on this side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     I may give my testimony on behalf of the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative English Protestants of this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion. In my opinion, the news<lb break="no"/>papers are in many instances doing 
     <lb/>
     more harm than good and inflaming 
     <lb/>
     passions and prejudices where it should 
     <lb/>
     be their endeavour to allay them. I 
     <lb/>
     have seen caricatures published of my 
     <lb/>
     right hon. friend which did not at all meet 
     <lb/>
     my approval and I have also seen caricatures 
     <lb/>
     of some of my hon. friends on this side which 
     <lb/>
     I think were altogether out of place. I regret 
     <lb/>
     these methods. I regret this holding up of our 
     <lb/>
     public men to undeserved ridicule and oblo<lb break="no"/>quy, because it cannot fail to have a mis<lb break="no"/>chievous effect on the people. I can sympa<lb break="no"/>thize with my right hon. friend in his pre<lb break="no"/>sent position. I can appreciate the difficulty 
     <lb/>
     in which he found himself. when the ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) came 
     <lb/>
     back and took him by the throat and pos<lb break="no"/>sibly threatened to inflame public opinion. I 
     <lb/>
     can well understand that my right hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     then found himself between two fires. 
     <lb/>
     On the One side was the persistent Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick). who stuck, 
     <lb/>
     and rightly stuck, to his clause. On the 
     <lb/>
     other was the Minister of the Interior (Mr.

     Sifton), who in all probability was going 
     <lb/>
     around to members of parliament—good men. 
     <lb/>
     honest men, against whom I have not a 
     <lb/>
     word to say, for I have nothing to say against 
     <lb/>
     men who may have different opinions from 
     <lb/>
     mine—going around to members not only 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest but others. and saying 
     <lb/>
     to them: You cannot accept this; this 
     <lb/>
     will give clerical schools: this is putting 
     <lb/>
     for ever the majority of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories under the shackles of the hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     of Rome. Then, my right hon. friend no 
     <lb/>
     doubt felt convinced that in order to have 
     <lb/>
     peace he must accept the amendment now 
     <lb/>
     proposed. I remember hearing him very 
     <lb/>
     often say in this House that he never said 
     <lb/>
     anything until he had pondered it well, but 
     <lb/>
     that when he did, he stuck to what he said. 
     <lb/>
     He has not done so in this instance, and I 
     <lb/>
     am sorry for it. What is the proposal be<lb break="no"/>fore us now ? Those who want public 
     <lb/>
     schools are all right, public schools by 
     <lb/>
     this proposal will be established in the 
     <lb/>
     Territories for ever. But in what posi<lb break="no"/>tion will be those who are in favour of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools, who want to go home and 
     <lb/>
     say: I have supported separate schools; I 
     <lb/>
     voted against the amendment of the leader 
     <lb/>
     of the opposition because he said let us leave 
     <lb/>
     those new provinces to construe the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act as they desire and estab<lb break="no"/>lish what system of schools they choose. 
     <lb/>
     Some of my hon. friends will say: We could 
     <lb/>
     not accept that amendment of the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition and therefore we voted for 
     <lb/>
     the amendment of the right hon. gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     But what is the amendment of the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman, and what is it going to give 
     <lb/>
     the minority of the Northwest Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     Here is the amendment : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Section 93 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     1867, shall apply to the said province, with the 
     <lb/>
     substitution for subsection one of said section 
     <lb/>
     93, of the following subsection :

     shall be held to mean the date at which this 
     <lb/>
     Act comes into force. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That means that there shall be given to 
     <lb/>
     the minority in the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     all the separate schools they want, so long 
     <lb/>
     as are instituted in those provinces the

     Protestant or public schools granted under

            <p>
     What are these schools? There are the

     public schools established by law by the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1875 passed by a Liberal government. 
     <lb/>
     then re-enacted in 1885. obliterated in 1892

     the schools which the minority will have in

     the Territories the moment this Bill passes. 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that there is 
     <lb/>
     something higher than office. In 1896 the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative party went down to its defeat 
     <lb/>
     because it stood by a principle. It has been 
     <lb/>
     badly rewarded.

     my right hon. friend has yielded to what he

     thought was a threatening majority. Well, 
     <lb/>
     what kind of schools is he going to give 
     <lb/>
     the minority in the Northwest Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     Let me show by some hon. gentleman opposite 
     <lb/>
     what they are. What did the hon. Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance (Mr. Fielding) say? It was a 
     <lb/>
     sight for the gods to see how zealous were 
     <lb/>
     some of these gentlemen after they came 
     <lb/>
     back to the fold. The Minister of Finance 
     <lb/>
     does not think that the constitution compels 
     <lb/>
     us to give a system of schools to the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories.

     not use the word 'Protestant.' But I in<lb break="no"/>fer from the way he treated the matter that 
     <lb/>
     he referred to what I have been accustomed 
     <lb/>
     to hear called Protestant schools. Because 
     <lb/>
     to me schools where you do not speak of 
     <lb/>
     God are Protestant schools.

     it often in electioneering—when they speak

     of the public schools they call them 'les

     ecoles Protestantes.' So, as I have been 
     <lb/>

     the same as it means, perhaps, to the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance or my hon. friend from

     the far west to-day a system which is practi<lb break="no"/>cally a national school system, and that the

     only point of difference between us is with re-   
     <lb/>
     spect to that small matter of a half hour of 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction, I think the great mass of 
     <lb/>
     the Protestant people of Canada will say that 
     <lb/>

     Well, I am not talking for those who are

     in favour of public schools when I call the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House to these views. I 
     <lb/>
     want this speech to be translated and to go 
     <lb/>
     through the province of Quebec because my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friends who are from that province will 
     <lb/>
     go back to the people and say: We voted 
     <lb/>
     against the amendment of the hon. leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition, we were opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     amendment the object of which was to keep 
     <lb/>
     the minority out of their schools ; we voted 
     <lb/>
     for the party that has at its head the men 
     <lb/>
     who want to render justice to the minority ; 
     <lb/>
     we voted for the motion of the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     leader of the government. That is why the 
     <lb/>
     hon. Minister of Finance has'said that these 
     <lb/>
     schools to all intents and purposes are 
     <lb/>
     national, non-sectarian schools. The Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance has said something in

     I believe there is a great deal in that. My

     hon. friend was not in at the commencement 
     <lb/>
     of my remarks but I said myself that I did 
     <lb/>
     not care so much what the constitution did 
     <lb/>
     as to provide such a solution of this matter 
     <lb/>
     as would contribute to the peace of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces which it is now proposed to admit to 
     <lb/>
     the confederation. I might also read what 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Minister of Customs (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Paterson) has said. His remarks were about 
     <lb/>
     on the same line as those of my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance. He also tried to 
     <lb/>
     impress the House with the idea that we 
     <lb/>
     have virtually national schools in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories and that we have no more 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in the proper sense of the 
     <lb/>
     word. I need not read what he said be 
     <lb/>
     cause what he said has been repeated in 
     <lb/>
     some other places and it is already in ' Han<lb break="no"/>sard.' My hon. friend the Minister of Fi<lb break="no"/>nance said one thing which I commend to 
     <lb/>
     the attention of the House and of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. He spoke about good faith. He said 
     <lb/>
     that in keeping that national school system 
     <lb/>
     we have to allow a half hour for religious 
     <lb/>
     instruction because we have moral obliga<lb break="no"/>tions towards the minority. That is right. 
     <lb/>
     I believe that to be the case but in such a 
     <lb/>
     matter as that I would go a great deal 
     <lb/>
     farther than the law. In a country like 
     <lb/>
     this we cannot have too much tolerance 
     <lb/>
     wherever it is honourable and feasible. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the member for Brandon (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sifton) has said many things which I would 
     <lb/>
     like to touch upon but I do not wish to

     This is not said in an ungenerous spirit.

     Amongst our people an English school is a

     that way ; not in the improper sense of the

     word at all. We do not use the word ' Pro<lb break="no"/>testant ' in a bad sense because there are 
     <lb/>
     many good Protestants as there are good 
     <lb/>
     Catholics. The Archbishop uses that word

     the government because he could not agree

     <lb/>
     the provision as to separate schools which

     the government had not changed their policy

     If we are to believe what the ex-minister

     separate schools which any class of persons

     Commenting on this clause, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Sifton) is speaking to the ele<lb break="no"/>ment of our population who are opposed to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools ; he is making an apology 
     <lb/>
     for the amended clause, and he says :

     this section to preserve—and it is an important

     thing—let us not exaggerate or minimize, let

     us know exactly what we are doing—I think

     that this is what we are doing and all that we

     have their school, a separate school in name,

     4 o'clock in the afternoon.

     The aim of the hon. gentleman is to show

     that he is opposed to clerical or sectarian 
     <lb/>
     teaching more than anything else. Well, 
     <lb/>
     Sir, let me tell him that those who are in 
     <lb/>
     favour of separate schools in the proper 
     <lb/>
     sense of the word are in favour of clerical 
     <lb/>
     and sectarian teaching, or otherwise those 
     <lb/>

     have objections to separate schools based upon 
     <lb/>
     the idea of church control, clerical control, or 
     <lb/>
     ecclesiasticism in any form, this system of

     And yet the newspapers which are sup<lb break="no"/>porting the government in the province of

     Quebec are boasting that the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter is preserving for ever the separate 
     <lb/>
     school system which the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories had at first—not the present

     Well, Mr. Speaker, I stated this after<lb break="no"/>noon what I believed to be the real cause 
     <lb/>
     of the changing of the school law in Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, and when the member for Brandon 
     <lb/>
     says that the clerical school system is in<lb break="no"/>efficient, I can refer him to such an excellent 
     <lb/>
     authority as the right hon. the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister who will tell him that he is entirely 
     <lb/>
     mistaken. If the hon. gentleman said that 
     <lb/>
     the elementary schools in our province, or 
     <lb/>
     in other provinces for that matter, if he 
     <lb/>
     said that what we call in French les petites 
     <lb/>
     ecoles are not perfect, there might be some 
     <lb/>
     ground for his statement, because it is 
     <lb/>
     unfortunately true that those who pay for 
     <lb/>
     the maintenance of these schools do not 
     <lb/>
     contribute sufficient to secure the services 
     <lb/>
     of first-class teachers. However, these ele<lb break="no"/>mentary schools are mostly attended by very 
     <lb/>
     young children and up to the present time 
     <lb/>
     they have been found fairly sufficient for 
     <lb/>
     their purpose. But when the member for 
     <lb/>
     Brandon (Mr. Sifton) makes the sweeping 
     <lb/>
    assertion that clerical schools are inefficient. 
     <lb/>he simply does not know what he is talk<lb break="no"/>ing about. Let him look around him in 
     <lb/>this House and see the men on both sides, 
     <lb/>who are the alumni of clerical schools. Let 
     <lb/>him look at the men in this chamber who 
     <lb/>have been taught in colleges and schools 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3491</fw>
     <fw type="num">3492</fw>
         

     conducted by priests ; let him look at the 
     <lb/>
     men who have received what he calls a 
     <lb/>
     clerical education, and perhaps he will re<lb break="no"/>vise his judgment. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Brandon has not to look only on this side 
     <lb/>
     of the House ; let him look at the men sit<lb break="no"/>ting around him and beside him who have 
     <lb/>
     received their education in schools con<lb break="no"/>trolled by the clergy, and I think he will 
     <lb/>
     have to admit that they are men of edu<lb break="no"/>cation, men of high attainments, men of 
     <lb/>
     whom any country might well be proud. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     More than that ; the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Brandon is unjust, because, if I am well 
     <lb/>
     informed—and I have taken my informa<lb break="no"/>tion from some newspapers of repute pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the province of Manitoba—the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic university of St. Boniface today 
     <lb/>
     is above competition. It is understood that 
     <lb/>
     in that university, the young men in the 
     <lb/>
     highest classes have nobody to compete 
     <lb/>
     with, from Toronto to the Pacific coast and 
     <lb/>
     they are obliged to compete amongst them<lb break="no"/>selves. They have carried off prizes, 
     <lb/>
     medals and every distinction. Nobody 
     <lb/>
     knows this better than the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Brandon. These young men are taught 
     <lb/>
     by ecclesiastics ; they are the subjects of 
     <lb/>
     clerical schools. So I say to those who 
     <lb/>
     might be tempted to believe him that when 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman talks of the inefficiency 
     <lb/>
     of clerical education, he is out of the way 
     <lb/>
     altogether. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In answer to my hon. friend the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs (Mr. Paterson), who had de<lb break="no"/>clared that the proceedings of the Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     government in abolishing separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in that province might have been obnoxious 
     <lb/>
     to somebody, the hon. member for Brandon 
     <lb/>
     said : 'Well, Sir, I am here to say that 
     <lb/>
     we cannot abolish abuses of that kind by 
     <lb/>
     handling people with kid gloves.' No, we 
     <lb/>
     all know that he did not use kid gloves. 
     <lb/>
     We all know that not only was the minority 
     <lb/>
     in Manitoba robbed of its system of schools, 
     <lb/>
     not only was the French language abolished, 
     <lb/>
     which is something appreciated by those 
     <lb/>
     who speak that language, but their build<lb break="no"/>ings to the amount of $14,000 were stolen 
     <lb/>
     from them by the Manitoba government and 
     <lb/>
     were never given back to them. So when 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman says that he did not 
     <lb/>
     use kid gloves, he is right. I would rather 
     <lb/>
     say he used a crowbar or a pince-monseig<lb break="no"/>neur to steal the separate schools of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, or what they had and their buildings. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bour<lb break="no"/>assa) speaks very well—I have heard him 
     <lb/>
     before—but he always comes to a conclusion 
     <lb/>
     entirely different from his premises. Every 
     <lb/>
     time I have heard him on these subjects. I 
     <lb/>
     have always seen him starting against the 
     <lb/>
     government and finishing by being entirely 
     <lb/>
     with the government. He thought he would 
     <lb/>
     make a point in his speech by criticising 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. 
     <lb/>
     He even went so far as to say that he had 
     <lb/>
     lost confidence in the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>
          

            <pb n="3493" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3493.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3493</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 30, 1905</fw> 


     tion. Well, that did not pain my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend very much, because he had never sup<lb break="no"/>posed that the hon. member for Labelle had 
     <lb/>
     any confidence in him. The hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Labelle, if I infer rightly from the 
     <lb/>
     words he uttered, is entirely opposed to the 
     <lb/>
     amendment. Still, I believe, though he 
     <lb/>
     did not say so in word, that he will vote 
     <lb/>
     for the amendment. So it is no use for me 
     <lb/>
     to discuss his speech, because, though it 
     <lb/>
     was witty and well delivered, its conclu<lb break="no"/>sion did not follow from its premises ; con<lb break="no"/>sequently there is no result to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     My hon. friend from Peel (Mr. Blain), in 
     <lb/>
     the very eloquent speech he made in the 
     <lb/>
     House in answer to the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle, spoke of the generosity of those 
     <lb/>
     men whom the hon. member for Labelle 
     <lb/>
     was ready to asperse. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     from Peel forgot one thing, however, when 
     <lb/>
     he spoke of the generosity of Ontario, he 
     <lb/>
     should more properly have spoken of the 
     <lb/>
     generosity of the Conservatives of Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend said that only lately there 
     <lb/>
     was an election in the province of Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     and the Prime Minister of the day had said 
     <lb/>
     that if he came into power he would see 
     <lb/>
     that every nationality and creed would be 
     <lb/>
     represented in his government. What did 
     <lb/>
     he do when called on to form an adminis<lb break="no"/>tration? He kept his word; he acted like 
     <lb/>
     an honourable man and according to the 
     <lb/>
     traditions of the Conservative party. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, who was the man who for the 
     <lb/>
     first time, appointed to the upper House 
     <lb/>
     of this parliament a French Canadian from 
     <lb/>
     the province of Ontario—a man coming from 
     <lb/>
     your own city, the Hon. Mr. Casgrain? 
     <lb/>
     Sir John A. Macdonald, whom the Liberals 
     <lb/>
     in our province have always tried to make 
     <lb/>
     a scapegoat of, as a Protestant and a fan<lb break="no"/>atic. Who appointed the first French Can<lb break="no"/>adian senator from the province of Prince 
     <lb/>
     Edward Island, in the person of the Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Arsenault. but a Conservative adminis<lb break="no"/>tration ? And when that gentleman died, 
     <lb/>
     our French Canadian premier replaced him 
     <lb/>
     with an English-speaking Canadian. Who 
     <lb/>
     appointed Senator Poirier. another French 
     <lb/>
     Canadian, from the province of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, but a Conservative administration, 
     <lb/>
     which also appointed Judge Landry ? I am 
     <lb/>
     saying this to show that the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party has traditions of which it may well 
     <lb/>
     be proud, and that it stands by those tra<lb break="no"/>ditions. There may be in our party some 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen who have ideas different from 
     <lb/>
     the others. but the party as a whole has 
     <lb/>
     a history of which it may well be proud. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot say the same of the other party. 
     <lb/>
     We know that if hon. gentlemen opposite 
     <lb/>
     have stood upon any platform in the past, 
     <lb/>
     it has been only to get into power. Their 
     <lb/>
     traditions are all new ; they have never 
     <lb/>
     been in use yet. In 1896, the Liberal party 
     <lb/>
     prevented the Conservative party from do<lb break="no"/>ing an act of justice in the settlement of 
     <lb/>
     the Manitoba school question. We may be

     told that the province of Quebec has sanc<lb break="no"/>tioned that. It is true. There are many 
     <lb/>
     considerations for that ; but it does not de<lb break="no"/>prive the Conservative party of the honour 
     <lb/>
     of having done its duty. I heard my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend from North Toronto (Mr. Foster) yes<lb break="no"/>terday saying in a sarcastic way that hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite may boast that three ap<lb break="no"/>peals have been made to the people since 
     <lb/>
     that time, and that the people have sanc<lb break="no"/>tioned the position taken by my right hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. What does that prove ? It proves 
     <lb/>
     only one thing—and I say it with all mod<lb break="no"/>esty—that they were believed more than 
     <lb/>
     we were believed ; but it does not prove 
     <lb/>
     that they were right. Sir, when I am speak<lb break="no"/>ing about traditions, I want to say this be<lb break="no"/>fore I resume my seat, that upon all those 
     <lb/>
     dangerous questions, national or religious, 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party has always been 
     <lb/>
     found in the path of duty, ready to do what 
     <lb/>
     was best in the interest of the country. 
     <lb/>
     They paid for it dearly sometimes ; but his<lb break="no"/>tory is written, and when that history is 
     <lb/>
     read by those who will come later, the 
     <lb/>
     young men of the day, whether they are 
     <lb/>
     educated in separate schools or in public 
     <lb/>
     schools, it will tell them the truth. The 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party cannot continue to play 
     <lb/>
     double. face with each and every one of 
     <lb/>
     these questions. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Something has been said, unfortunately, 
     <lb/>
     about the hierarchy ; and something has 
     <lb/>
     been written in the papers against the 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy. But it was defended here by 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on both sides, and I was proud 
     <lb/>
     to hear gentlemen who do not belong to 
     <lb/>
     that creed speaking of the hierarchy in most 
     <lb/>
     eulogistic terms. Let me say that, although 
     <lb/>
     we have had this measure before the House 
     <lb/>
     for over a month, I have never received a 
     <lb/>
     letter or word of communication of 
     <lb/>
     any kind regarding it from any bishop 
     <lb/>
     or priest, and I know a great many. 
     <lb/>
     What does that prove ? It shows, 
     <lb/>
     not that the Catholic clergy are not 
     <lb/>
     interested, but that they have too much deli<lb break="no"/>cacy and too much sense of their own dig<lb break="no"/>nity to undertake, without being requested 
     <lb/>
     to do so, to advise a member of parliament 
     <lb/>
     as to what course he should follow. Our 
     <lb/>
     clergy have been deceived in the past, and 
     <lb/>
     if my remarks have been long and tedious. 
     <lb/>
     it is because I wish to put on record in 
     <lb/>
     ' Hansard ' what I consider necessary to 
     <lb/>
     enable them to know who are those by 
     <lb/>
     whom they have been deceived. We have 
     <lb/>
     heard a great deal about petitions, and 
     <lb/>
     we have seen a great many petitions pre<lb break="no"/>sented in this House, but the only petition 
     <lb/>
     that I have received from my constituency 
     <lb/>
     is one that is signed by fourteen Methodists 
     <lb/>
     —whom I know to be most respectable 
     <lb/>
     men—in the city of Valleyfield. We have 
     <lb/>
     been told of certain petitions which have 
     <lb/>
     been sent out in the province of Quebec by 
     <lb/>
     the Club Jacques Cartier at the instigation 
     <lb/>
     of some members of this House. But that 
     <lb/>
     statement was positively denied by my hon.

     friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk). 
     <lb/>
    My hon. friend stated positively that there 
     <lb/>was not a member in this House from the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec who had anything to 
     <lb/>do with these petitions. I am not pretend<lb break="no"/>ing that there would be any harm in these 
     <lb/>petitions, people have the right to petition ; 
     <lb/>but I am merely pointing out that if any 
     <lb/>petitions were circulated, they were circulat<lb break="no"/>ed by some one who took upon himself to 
     <lb/>do that work without having had any 
     <lb/>authorization from any member of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. I have not seen any of these peti<lb break="no"/>tions, but I understand that in all of them 
     <lb/>the right hon. gentleman is asked to stand 
     <lb/>fast by clause No. 16 of the Bill as intro<lb break="no"/>duced. The signers of these petitions were 
     <lb/>afraid that he might drop that clause ; they 
     <lb/>were afraid that he might be influenced by 
     <lb/>the other wing of the government, and 
     <lb/>abandon clause 16 for something else. 
     <lb/>Well, they were not wrong, because my 
     <lb/>right hon. friend has given up that clause 
     <lb/>and accepted an amendment which is satis<lb break="no"/>factory to the hon. member for Brandon 
     <lb/>(Mr. Sifton). One need not go far to show 
     <lb/>what kind of an amendment that must be. 
     <lb/>I call the attention of those who are in 
     <lb/>favour of separate schools to Mr. Sifton's 
     <lb/>approval. If the amendment before the 
     <lb/>House is acceptable to the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Brandon, you may judge for yourselves 
     <lb/>how far it goes in favour of separate schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     In 1896 there was a hierarchy in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec just as there is to-day. 
     <lb/>
     What happened then ? After the elections 
     <lb/>
     were over and my right hon. friend was 
     <lb/>
     returned to power with a large majority 
     <lb/>
     from the province of Quebec, one of the 
     <lb/>
     boasts of the Liberal politicians and the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal press was that they had been able 
     <lb/>
     to carry the province against the hierarchy. 
     <lb/>
     If that were true, what did it mean ? It 
     <lb/>
     could only mean that the hierarchy had no 
     <lb/>
     influence at all. But if it had no influence, 
     <lb/>
     how could we be called a priest-ridden pro<lb break="no"/>vince ? It is not true, however, that the 
     <lb/>
     hierarchy had no influence, and I can tell 
     <lb/>
     my right hon. friend something which he 
     <lb/>
     knows quite well. The hierarchy in 1896 
     <lb/>
     did not do anything. They did not do as 
     <lb/>
     much as I would have liked them to do in 
     <lb/>
     their own interests. So broad and non<lb break="no"/>partisan were the mandements they pub<lb break="no"/>lished that they were accepted by the Lib<lb break="no"/>erals as being in their favour. But if the 
     <lb/>
     day should come when that hierarchy 
     <lb/>
     would feel impelled to take a hand in the 
     <lb/>
     contest, their influence would be soon felt. 
     <lb/>
     My right hon. friend remembers that when 
     <lb/>
     there was trouble in Manitoba, when a re<lb break="no"/>bellion was threatened in that province, it 
     <lb/>
     was not on its troops that the government 
     <lb/>
    relied. No, the government of that day 
     <lb/>did not send out its troops, but telegraphed 
     <lb/>to Rome to his Lordship Bishop Taché, and 
     <lb/>asked him to return home and establish 
     <lb/>peace in the province of Manitoba. Bishop 
     <lb/>Tache did so. The government of that day 
     <lb/>must had confidence in his ability and 


            <cb/>

     influence. Many were the promises which 
     <lb/>
     were made him then, but which have never 
     <lb/>
     been carried out. For this I am not blam<lb break="no"/>ing my right hon. friend. The responsibility 
     <lb/>
     lies with other public men, but unfortun<lb break="no"/>ately the Liberal party had more to do with 
     <lb/>
     it than anybody else. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To come back to the position taken by 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding). 
     <lb/>
     We are now about to create two new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. We are in a sense enlarging Canada. 
     <lb/>
     We are making it stronger and more im<lb break="no"/>portant. I would advise the House not 
     <lb/>
     to stand so much upon the letter of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution, but to do what is best calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to make all creeds and nationalities 
     <lb/>
     in these new provinces live together in har<lb break="no"/>mony. What we require in this country is 
     <lb/>
     tolerance and conciliation, and we cannot 
     <lb/>
     have that when we call for the sacrifice of 
     <lb/>
     any principle or the destruction of any 
     <lb/>
     right. Every nationality and creed in this 
     <lb/>
     Dominion should be made to feel that it 
     <lb/>
     has the respect and the confidence of other 
     <lb/>
     nationalities and creeds, if we want Canada 
     <lb/>
     to be united and ever to achieve anything. 
     <lb/>
     I sincerely hope that the question now being 
     <lb/>
     discussed is the last of the kind that will 
     <lb/>
     ever come before parliament. I sincerely 
     <lb/>
     hope that in the end we shall all join hand 
     <lb/>
     in hand. I trust that every province and 
     <lb/>
     every Canadian worthy of the name, and 
     <lb/>
     who desires the welfare of his country, will 
     <lb/>
     join hand in hand with his fellow-citizens 
     <lb/>
     to work together for what we believe the 
     <lb/>
     best interests of Canada, and not allow 
     <lb/>
     national or religious questions to interfere 
     <lb/>
     with that work.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In speaking of the position taken by my 
     <lb/>
     leader, I wish to say openly that, to my 
     <lb/>
     mind, he made an admirable speech upon 
     <lb/>
     this question, a speech to which nobody 
     <lb/>
     can take exception. We may not all share 
     <lb/>
     the conclusions to which he came. but every 
     <lb/>
     man on this side, and I believe on the other 
     <lb/>
     side as well is convinced that the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition spoke in all sincerity, with<lb break="no"/>out any bias, and influenced solely by a de<lb break="no"/>sire for the welfare of Canada. So much 
     <lb/>
     is that the case, that if in that amendment 
     <lb/>
     of his, ten words were struck off at the 
     <lb/>
     end, I would be disposed to support it. And 
     <lb/>
     in doing so I would be standing on a good 
     <lb/>
     principle, namely, provincial autonomy and 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights ; and in my opinion clause 
     <lb/>
     93 of the British North America Act would 
     <lb/>
     give the new provinces the school system 
     <lb/>
     they have to-day. But as a doubt has been 
     <lb/>
     expressed by the Minister of Justice, I 
     <lb/>
     would have clause 16. But here is where 
     <lb/>
     I think there is a difference between the 
     <lb/>
     position taken by the hon. the leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition and the right hon. the First Min<lb break="no"/>ister. My hon. friend the leader of the op<lb break="no"/>position leaves the door open by his amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the people of the new provinces to 
     <lb/>
     give themselves separate schools. From not 
     <lb/>
     one man on this side of the House have I 
     <lb/>
     heard a word against the system of separate

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I did not hear the

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. I asked my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend if he contended that the system of

     separate schools in that province was a 
     <lb/>
     bad one and he answered yes.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I said that that system, 
     <lb/>
     in my judgment, was not a good one. But 
     <lb/>
     I added, in connection with the schools in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest, that our fight was not against 
     <lb/>
     the people giving separate schools if they 
     <lb/>
     desired to do so, but against interference 
     <lb/>
     with their rights to have any system they 
     <lb/>
     chose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I accept the word of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
     <lb/>
     and I would remind my hon. friend from 
     <lb/>
     Montmagny that it could not be otherwise, 
     <lb/>
     as the separate schools in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     are, for all practical purposes, the very 
     <lb/>
     same as the public schools. Now, the amend<lb break="no"/>ed Bill of my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid 
     <lb/>
     Laurier), in my opinion, will prevent alto<lb break="no"/>gether the establishment in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools such as I would like 
     <lb/>
     to see. He perpetuates the provision of 
     <lb/>
     the ordinance now existing. And the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) has de<lb break="no"/>clared that the schools under these ordin<lb break="no"/>ances are entirely public schools. Put this 
     <lb/>
     upon the statute-book and you prevent for 
     <lb/>
     ever the establishment of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest provinces. On the other 
     <lb/>
     hand, the position taken by the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) leaves it 
     <lb/>
     open to the provinces to establish any sys<lb break="no"/>tem of schools they desire. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, I fear I have kept the House too 
     <lb/>
     long. I had intended to speak much more 
     <lb/>
     briefly. But hon. gentlemen will pardon 
     <lb/>
     me because this is a very important ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and I hope that it will be long before 
     <lb/>
     we shall be called upon to speak on any 
     <lb/>
     such subject so delicate and so dangerous. 
     <lb/>
     When I am called upon to address the House 
     <lb/>
     again, I hope it will be on some question 
     <lb/>
     upon which members of the same party can 
     <lb/>
     agree. Still, though this is an unfortunate 
     <lb/>
     question, a dangerous question, I wish to

     pay this compliment to my colleagues in 
     <lb/>
     this House, on both sides of the House— 
     <lb/>
     that the newspapers of the country might 
     <lb/>
     well take a leaf out of 'Hansard'   for they 
     <lb/>
     will find there that every man who has 
     <lb/>
     spoken has been able to express his opinion 
     <lb/>
     frankly yet in such a way as not to hurt 
     <lb/>
     the feelings of any of his fellow-members. 
     <lb/>
     Hoping, as I have said, that we shall not 
     <lb/>
     have again such questions to deal with, but 
     <lb/>
     that we may all unite for the best interests 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, I am reminded of the words of

     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Hon. N. A. BELCOURT</persName> (Ottawa). Mr. 
     <lb/>
    Speaker, will my hon. friend from Beau<lb break="no"/>harnois (Mr. Bergeron) permit me to extend 
     <lb/> to him my congratulations, and to assure him 
     <lb/>of the pleasure which I share with other 
     <lb/>gentlemen upon this side of the House, 
     <lb/>because of the fact that he will give his 
     <lb/>vote on the measure before you in support 
     <lb/>of the government of to-day. Whatever may 
     <lb/>be thought of the reasons which the hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman gave as justifying that conclus<lb break="no"/>ion, it is a gratification to know that, on 
     <lb/>this occasion, he will vote with us. He 
     <lb/>said that the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. 
     <lb/>Bourassai had devoted most of his speech 
     <lb/>to remarks antagonistic to the course of 
     <lb/>the government, and still concluded by de<lb break="no"/>claring that he would vote with the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I am afraid that the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Labelle has found a very ready 
     <lb/>imitator in that respect, in the person of 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Beauharnois—in fact 
     <lb/>the hon. member (Mr. Bergeron) has gone 
     <lb/>the hon. member for Labelle one better ; 
     <lb/>the whole speech to which we have just 
     <lb/>listened, has been—I say it without of<lb break="no"/>fence—a tirade against the government of 
     <lb/>the day. He did not say at the end how 
     <lb/>he would vote, but I presume he will vote 
     <lb/>against the amendment.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BERG1">Mr. BERGERON</persName>. I may have forgotten 
     <lb/>
     to say that. I will not vote for the amend<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Then, what has been 
     <lb/>
     said has been well said. The Canadian 
     <lb/>
     national family will extend to the two 
     <lb/>
     new provinces in the west their hearty 
     <lb/>
     congratulations when, on the first of July 
     <lb/>
     next, they take their place in the family

     circle and around the family table. I hope 
     <lb/>
     that by that time the note of discord which 
     <lb/>
     has been heard in one part of this country 
     <lb/>
     will have ceased to sound—I believe in fact 
     <lb/>
     that that will be the case, and that even

     if it still sounds, it will not mar the chorus

     intend to take up the time of the House in 
     <lb/>
     referring to those features which are not 
     <lb/>
     the subject of contention. As to irrigation, 
     <lb/>
     as to financial arrangements, as to the divi<lb break="no"/>sion of the territory into one or more prov<lb break="no"/>inces—as to these, there seems to be but 
     <lb/>
     little dispute. With your permission, I will 
     <lb/>
     devote the time during which you may 
     <lb/>
     indulge me, to treating with the main ques<lb break="no"/>tion in dispute, the question of education, 
     <lb/>
     and incidentally, the control of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands. As to the question of education, 
     <lb/>
     section 16 preserves, in my opinion, what we 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics hold as part of our relig<lb break="no"/>ious faith—religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     schools. I need not say that I am a believer 
     <lb/>
     in that doctrine, that I am in that respect, 
     <lb/>
     altogether at one with the church to which 
     <lb/>
     I belong. And it is a gratification to me 
     <lb/>
     to know, and I feel fortified to know, that 
     <lb/>
     there are many great men, not only in this 
     <lb/>
     country, but in the mother country and 
     <lb/>
     elsewhere, not professing the religion to 
     <lb/>
     which I am attached, who also believe in 
     <lb/>
     the necessity of religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     schools. I say that section 16 is altogether 
     <lb/>
     justified under the letter and spirit of our 
     <lb/>
     constitution. I say also, and I shall en<lb break="no"/>deavour to demonstrate it, that, on grounds 
     <lb/>
     of highest public policy, the enactment of 
     <lb/>
     section 16 is altogether expedient and is 
     <lb/>
     rendered absolutely necessary. We know 
     <lb/>
     the rights which are preserved by section 
     <lb/>
     16. If separate schools are allowed, I care 
     <lb/>
     not whether they are called denominational 
     <lb/>
     schools or whatever name may be given to 
     <lb/>
     them. To my mind there is nothing in 
     <lb/>
     the name, or very little—it is altogether in 
     <lb/>
     the principle, a principle which is sanction<lb break="no"/>ed, admitted, and perpetuated by section 16, 
     <lb/>
     insisting on the right or privilege of the 
     <lb/>
     minority to give religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     schools of the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This privilege is recognized and in ex<lb break="no"/>istence to-day by virtue of the statute of 
     <lb/>
     1875 and by virtue of the ordinances of 
     <lb/>
     1901 which have been passed pursuant to 
     <lb/>
     that statute. My hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition devoted a large portion of 
     <lb/>
     his speech to demonstrate as a legal pro<lb break="no"/>position that the statute of 1875 could at 
     <lb/>
     any time have been repealed and that it 
     <lb/>
     could be repealed to-day. He cited the 
     <lb/>
     authority of Sir John Thompson and others 
     <lb/>
     in support of that contention. I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that any lawyer will dispute that. 
     <lb/>
     It is quite clear and must be clear to any 
     <lb/>
     lawyer that the Act of 1875 could have been 
     <lb/>
     repealed and that it could be repealed now 
     <lb/>
     at this very moment. But, Sir, it has not 
     <lb/>
     been repealed. It is in existence to-day. 
     <lb/>
     The ordinances which have been made in 
     <lb/>
     pursuance of that statute are in existence 
     <lb/>
     and they will be in existence on the 1st of 
     <lb/>
     July when these two provinces join the con<lb break="no"/>federation. The effect of section 16 is to 
     <lb/>
     preserve and perpetuate that right upon the 
     <lb/>
     admission of the two new provinces. I 
     <lb/>
     say, that, under the letter of sections 93 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3499</fw>
     <fw type="num">3500</fw>


     and 146 of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     that clause is not only justified, but it is 
     <lb/>
     necessary. The real question with me is 
     <lb/>
     to determine what is the right of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince at the moment it enters the union in 
     <lb/>
     the words of section 93. The whole ques<lb break="no"/>tion with me is determined by the fact 
     <lb/>
     that the right or privilege mentioned in the 
     <lb/>
     section exists concurrently with the crea<lb break="no"/>tion or birth of the province as a province. 
     <lb/>
     The word 'province' in section 93 means 
     <lb/>
     the province, not before. but the province 
     <lb/>
     at the moment that it enters confederation 
     <lb/>
     and for ever thereafter. But before it does 
     <lb/>
     enter as a province it is not a province 
     <lb/>
     of the union and consequently if it has 
     <lb/>
     been admitted as a territory the provis<lb break="no"/>ions of section 93 have no application. The 
     <lb/>
     provisions contained in the British North 
     <lb/>
     America  Act, 1867, are provisith which ap<lb break="no"/>ply to and which regulate the relations of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of the union which determine 
     <lb/>
     the rights, privileges and obligations of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces as provinces. In section 1 to sec<lb break="no"/>tion 146 of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     are contained the provisions, stipulations 
     <lb/>
     and agreements made between the original 
     <lb/>
     partners to the confederation, which are ap<lb break="no"/>plicable to the provinces of the union and 
     <lb/>
     to the provinces of the union only. Surely 
     <lb/>
     it cannot be contended that the original 
     <lb/>
     British North America Act, 1867, section 1 
     <lb/>
     to section 146, was intended to regulate and 
     <lb/>
     determine the relations of any part of Brit<lb break="no"/>ish North America other than the provinces 
     <lb/>
     which agrced at that time to form part of 
     <lb/>
     the confederation or which later on were to 
     <lb/>
     be added thereto. I repeat, Sir, that the 
     <lb/>
     right to be preserved is the right concur<lb break="no"/>rent with and co-existent with the creation 
     <lb/>
     of the province or existing at the time 
     <lb/>
     of its entering into the union. Take section 
     <lb/>
     93 and what is its plain ordinary meaning? 
     <lb/>
     I say, referring to the words of the section, 
     <lb/>
     that the word province in the section— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     —Any right or privilege with respect to de<lb break="no"/>nominational schools which any class of per<lb break="no"/>sons have by law in the province at the union. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     —means nothing else than a province com<lb break="no"/>ing into the confederation as a province and 
     <lb/>
     not as a territory. My hon. friend the lead<lb break="no"/>er of the opposition, in order to make good 
     <lb/>
     his point, says that because the Territories 
     <lb/>
     had been admitted into the confederation in 
     <lb/>
     1870 section 93 has no longer its application ; 
     <lb/>
     in other words, that the provisions of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 must be applied as to the Territories 
     <lb/>
     in 1870, because, according to him, that is 
     <lb/>
     the date at which they came into the union. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I say that in order to come to that 
     <lb/>
     conclusion my learned and hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     had to do what he charged the government 
     <lb/>
     with doing in this case, he has had to inter<lb break="no"/>polate into section 93 a word which is not 
     <lb/>
     to be found in section 93. He has had to 
     <lb/>
     interpolate the word 'territory' into the sec<lb break="no"/>tion which is not to be found in the section. 
     <lb/>
     He has had, in fact, to substitute for the 
 

            <pb n="3501" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3501.jpg"/>
  <fw type="num">3501</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 30, 1905</fw> 

     word 'province,' which is in section 93, the 
     <lb/>
     word 'territory,' which is not in section 93. 
     <lb/>
     I think I am not doing my hon. friend an 
     <lb/>
     injustice in stating that as his argument. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I am not disposed 
     <lb/>
     to admit that my hon. friend (Mr. Belcourt) 
     <lb/>
     is exactly stating my argument. However, 
     <lb/>
     my argument is before the House and when 
     <lb/>
     we come to discuss this question afterwards 
     <lb/>
     in committee we will have an opportunity 
     <lb/>
     of interchanging opinions. But, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to ask my hon. friend one question, if he 
     <lb/>
     will permit me, and it is this: I would in<lb break="no"/>fer from what he has just said that he con<lb break="no"/>siders section 2 of the Bill now under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion as being sufficient to bring into 
     <lb/>
     operation in the new provinces the provis<lb break="no"/>ions of section 93, and that these provisions 
     <lb/>
     would perpetuate in the new provinces the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of section 14 of the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     That is the logical deduction from what my 
     <lb/>
    hon. and learned friend has just said. Am 
     <lb/>I correct in so understanding him? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. If my hon. friend 
     <lb/>will permit me as my argument develops 
     <lb/>I will give him an answer to his ques<lb break="no"/>tion, although I am not quite sure that I 
     <lb/>thoroughly understand his question. It 
     <lb/>may be that it was doubtful, if, under the 
     <lb/>original provision of the British North 
     <lb/>America Act, 1867, we could admit the <choice><sic>Ter<lb break="no"/>ritiories</sic><corr>Territories</corr></choice> otherwise than as provinces. I am 
     <lb/>willing to go that far on the lines of my 
     <lb/>hon. friend's argument. It is doubtful with 
     <lb/>me, if the Act of 1871 had not been passed, 
     <lb/>whether we could have admitted the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories except as full-fledged provinces to 
     <lb/>the union. I have not the slightest doubt 
     <lb/>that the principal reason which prompted 
     <lb/>the Act of 1871 was the very doubt to 
     <lb/>which I have referred. But the passing of 
     <lb/>the Act of 1871 has, to my mind, removed 
     <lb/>any doubt which could have existed to that 
     <lb/>effect. What is the general scheme of the 
     <lb/>Confederation Act ? The general scheme of 
     <lb/>the Confederation Act, as has been pointed 
     <lb/>out by others, was to establish a national 
     <lb/>partnership between then fully independent 
     <lb/>and autonomous provinces or colonies sub<lb break="no"/>ject only to one jurisdiction. and that was 
     <lb/>the imperial jurisdiction, whatever it may 
     <lb/>have been and which I have no doubt varied 
     <lb/>from one case to the other. But the idea 
     <lb/>of the fathers of confederation was to make 
     <lb/>an agreement—a partnership agreement I 
     <lb/>will call it—for the purpose of determining 
     <lb/>the conditions, the powers and the relations 
     <lb/>of these autonomous provinces, as between 
     <lb/>themselves and for the sake of creating a 
     <lb/>central power and enlarging the importance 
     <lb/>of their positions in British North America. 
     <lb/>They came together for the purpose of de<lb break="no"/>termining the conditions of that partner<lb break="no"/>ship. The Act of Confederation determin<lb break="no"/>ed what the relations of these autonomous 
     <lb/>provinces as between themselves and the 
     <lb/>central power and what their powers, rights 
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3501</fw>
     <fw type="num">3502</fw>


     and obligations would be. It also provid<lb break="no"/>ed, by section 146, that later on these 
     <lb/>
     portions of British North America which 
     <lb/>
     at that time did not come into the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion might do so, and I say that it was the in<lb break="no"/>tention then, under the letter of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, and that it was then provided and 
     <lb/>
     stipulated that if other provinces should 
     <lb/>
     later on enter the confederation they should 
     <lb/>
     come in under the same terms and con<lb break="no"/>dition,. and that the conditions which were 
     <lb/>
     made applicable to the original provinces 
     <lb/>
     were uniform conditions applicable not only 
     <lb/>
     to the original provinces but to those which 
     <lb/>
     might be added to the partnership later on. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was not contemplated by the provi<lb break="no"/>sions of the British North America Act, 
     <lb/>
     sections 1 to 146, that there might be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted at that time as full-fledged provinces 
     <lb/>
     any portion of British North America then 
     <lb/>
     in process of formation. It was not thought 
     <lb/>
     that those portions of territory in the west, 
     <lb/>
     which at that time had very little popula<lb break="no"/>tion except the coureurs de bois and a few 
     <lb/>
     stray settlers here and there, should be ad<lb break="no"/>mitted as provinces ; it was not contem<lb break="no"/>plated at that time, for instance, that there 
     <lb/>
     was any possibility of admitting them ex<lb break="no"/>cept as temporary portions of the confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. I say that the provisions contained 
     <lb/>
     in the British North America Act, 1867, so 
     <lb/>
     far as they concerned the original portions 
     <lb/>
     of the confederation, or such provinces 
     <lb/>
     which might be admitted later on, are ab<lb break="no"/>solutely immutable ; they are unchange<lb break="no"/>able, at all events, so far as this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment is concerned, although they might, it 
     <lb/>
     is true, be subject to amendment by the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament. But the Canadian par<lb break="no"/>liament cannot materially alter the specific 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. You are proposing to do 
     <lb/>
     it by this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Not at all. It has been 
     <lb/>
     argued, and it has been stated repeatedly, 
     <lb/>
     that the Northwest Territories, when they 
     <lb/>
     came into confederation in 1870, came in 
     <lb/>
     subject to all the provisions of the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1867. Such argument would have some, 
     <lb/>
     foundation, as I have said, if the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 had not been passed, but the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871, in my opinion, was passed principal<lb break="no"/>ly in order to get over that very diffi<lb break="no"/>culty. It was thought at that time, after 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the Territories had been taken 
     <lb/>
     in, in 1870, that the provisions of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, 1867, were insufficient 
     <lb/>
     to cover the case of the Territories. There 
     <lb/>
     arose a doubt at that time whether all the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the Act of 1867 were ap<lb break="no"/>plicable to the Territories upon their ad<lb break="no"/>mission. There also arose another doubt as 
     <lb/>
     to whether the powers of this parliament in 
     <lb/>
     admitting territories as such under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of section 146 had not been exhaust<lb break="no"/>ed. It was thought by some that we had 
     <lb/>
     exercised the power given to us by section 
  

            <pb n="3503" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3503.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">3503</fw>  
         

     146 in admitting these Territories as ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, and that being so, it was doubted 
     <lb/>
     if it was any longer open to us, if we still   
     <lb/>
     had the power to admit them later on as 
     <lb/>
     provinces. That. I think, was the principal 
     <lb/>
     reason of the amendment of 1871. That 
     <lb/>
     was the principal object of that legislation, 
     <lb/>
     and I think it was also the principal effect, 
     <lb/>
     of it.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. If that contention is cor<lb break="no"/>rect, what would be the effect now?   Would   
     <lb/>
     that statute that was passed then be suffi<lb break="no"/>cient to cover the case with which we are 
     <lb/>
     now dealing ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I cannot understand the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman's question at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. I understood the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman to say that it was thought that 
     <lb/>
     the power of section 146 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act was exhausted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I said a doubt arose.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. That was supposed to be 
     <lb/>
     the reason for getting another Act from the 
     <lb/>
     imperial parliament. If that Act was neces<lb break="no"/>sary at that time, would that Act he suffi 
     <lb/>
     cient for the present case, or would it be 
     <lb/>
     exhausted by the exercise of it at that time? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I said that the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1871 was passed for the purpOse of allowing 
     <lb/>
     us to admit these provinces, on the supposi<lb break="no"/>tion that the power conferred by section 146 
     <lb/>
     had been exhausted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LENN2">Mr. LENNOX</persName>. I have not recently been 
     <lb/>
     looking at the section with this particular 
     <lb/>
     point in view, but my recollection is that 
     <lb/>
     the statute only provides for the case of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and would not be sufiicient to 
     <lb/>
     cover the new province now about to be 
     <lb/>
     admitted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. It covered the case of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba in so many words, but by neces<lb break="no"/>sary inference it covered the case of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories as well. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     must remember that when this Act was 
     <lb/>
     passed the Territories had been admitted 
     <lb/>
     into conederation as territories; Mani<lb break="no"/>toba had been admitted as a province, and 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1871 was passed, as I have said, 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of allowing us a power 
     <lb/>
     which it was thought we had already exer<lb break="no"/>cised under 146 by admitting them as ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, a power to admit them later on as 
     <lb/>
     provinces. I say that by inference the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1871 enables us to do that to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     There was another reason to which the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman also referred, that is, the 
     <lb/>
     provision for the control of lands under the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba Act. It was thought at the time 
     <lb/>
     that that was possibly ultra vircs. and that 
     <lb/>
     was another reason why the Act of 1871 was 
     <lb/>
     passed: but one has only to look at the 
     <lb/>
     preamble of the Act of 1871 to see clearly 
     <lb/>
     and plainly that these were the reasons 
     <lb/>
     that prompted that Act. The preamble 
     <lb/>
     reads :

     of the Act was to remove the doubts to

     As far as the Territories are concerned, it 
     <lb/>
     must be remembered that they came into 
     <lb/>
     the confederation without any special pro<lb break="no"/>visions applicable to them, that it was left 
     <lb/>
     to this parliament to determine, from time 
     <lb/>
     to time, what powers we should confer upon 
     <lb/>
     them. That seems to me to be absolutely 
     <lb/>
     justified. As I have pointed out, as every 
     <lb/>
     one knows, the Territories were then in 
     <lb/>
     their early infancy. They had a very sparse 
     <lb/>
     population, the whole matter was tentative ; 
     <lb/>
     the jurisdiction which the Act conferred on 
     <lb/>
     them must necessarily for manifestly ob<lb break="no"/>vious reasons be a tentative one; and, 
     <lb/>
     therefore, it was provided, under sec<lb break="no"/>tion 2, that we might, from time to time, 
     <lb/>
     apply to them such provisions of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act as we should deem pro<lb break="no"/>per. I say that that discretionary power 
     <lb/>
     vested in this parliament with reference to 
     <lb/>
     the Territories was with reference to terri<lb break="no"/>tories only, and not with reference to 
     <lb/>
     provinces. I say that under the Act of 1871 
     <lb/>
     this parliament has not to-day the right to 
     <lb/>
     apply to any province coming into the union 
     <lb/>
     any but the original provisions, from section 
     <lb/>
     1 to section 146, of the Act of 1867. I say 
     <lb/>
     that the Act of 1871 was made for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose only of the Territories, and cannot 
     <lb/>
     to-day have any application, and should not 
     <lb/>
     have any application whatever, when we are 
     <lb/>
     taking a province into confederation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Act of 1871 was passed for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of completing the Act of 1867; not 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of modifying it, not for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of repealing any of its provisions, 
     <lb/>
     but simply in order to add to the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1867 provisions which it was found had 
     <lb/>
     been omitted from that Act. Its scope 
     <lb/>
     was limited. to the entry, control and gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of new territories. Under the 
     <lb/>
     rules of construction, I submit that my 
     <lb/>
     argument is quite justified, because I 
     <lb/>
     think every lawyer in this House will 
     <lb/>
     agree. with me that the modification of a 
    

            <pb n="3505" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3505.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3505</fw>
            <fw type="dateline">MARCH 30, 1905</fw>
            
     

     specific, clear. definite provision cannot be 
     <lb/>
     modified by another provision made in 
     <lb/>
     general terms to be found in the same Act 
     <lb/>
     or in another Act to be read together with it. 
     <lb/>
     All the provisions of the Act of 1871 are 
     <lb/>
     susceptible of application and are suscep<lb break="no"/>tible of interpretation apart altogether from 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the Act of 1867. What bet<lb break="no"/>ter proof of that do we require than the 
     <lb/>
     course we have pursued for the last thirty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     five years during which we have administer<lb break="no"/>ed these Territories altogether by virtue of 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of the Act of 1871. Since 1870 
     <lb/>
     when these Territories came under our con<lb break="no"/>trol, we have not governed them by virtue 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1867 but by virtue of the Act 
     <lb/>
     of 1871. Therefore, the Act of 1871 has 
     <lb/>
     not in any way modified or altered the speci<lb break="no"/>fic provisions of the Act of 1867, and so 
     <lb/>
     long as these Territories remain Territories. 
     <lb/>
     this parliament of course continues to hold 
     <lb/>
     absolute jurisdiction over them. The legis<lb break="no"/>lation in these Territories shall be just 
     <lb/>
     exactly what this parliament chooses to 
     <lb/>
     make it; from time to time this parliament 
     <lb/>
     may repeal provisions previously enacted 
     <lb/>
     or substitute for them provisions entirely 
     <lb/>
     different. But when the status of the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories is changed and they are made pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ; when they are elevated to the dig<lb break="no"/>nity of provinces, then come in and are 
     <lb/>
     immediately applicable the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1867. The new provinces 
     <lb/>
     are entitled to all the benefits and all the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the Act of 1867; they are en<lb break="no"/>titled to all the provisions which were ap<lb break="no"/>plicable to and which could be claimed by 
     <lb/>
     the original provinces of confederation. 
     <lb/>
     Therefore it is that I say, that when these 
     <lb/>
     Territories are being admitted as full- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     fledged partners in the original partnership 
     <lb/>
     of agreement, when they are admitted as 
     <lb/>
     full—fledged provinces of the union they are 
     <lb/>
     entitled to the full benefits of section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1867 and the rights or privi<lb break="no"/>leges referred to in subsection 1 of said sec<lb break="no"/>tion are preserved to the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Every one admits that we could have re<lb break="no"/>pealed the Act of 1875, that we could have 
     <lb/>
     modified it, and that we could have replaced 
     <lb/>
     it by another Act. If we had simply re 
     <lb/>
     pealed the Act of 1875 the ordinances made 
     <lb/>
     thereunder by the Territories would have 
     <lb/>
    all been wiped out as a necessary con<lb break="no"/>sequence, but not having repealed the 
     <lb/>Act of 1875 the ordinances which have 
     <lb/>been enacted by virtue of that Act 
     <lb/>remain, and they will be in existence 
     <lb/>011 the first of July when these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces come into the union. It has 
     <lb/>been argued, and I am not prepared to dis<lb break="no"/>sent, that section 16 of the present Bill con<lb break="no"/>stitutes a modification of the Act of 1875. 
     <lb/>I shall not discuss whether it does or whe<lb break="no"/>ther it does not, nor shall I say whether 
     <lb/>the modification if any is an important or 
     <lb/>an unimportant one. But the very moment 
     <lb/>it is admitted that this section 16 constitutes 
     <lb/>a modification of the provisions of the Act 
   

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3505</fw>
     <fw type="num">3506</fw>
         

     of 1875, then there immediately arises the 
     <lb/>
     necessity for the enactment of this very 
     <lb/>
     section. It has been said that this section 
     <lb/>
     16 of the Bill we are discussing is the re<lb break="no"/>sult of a compromise, and that may be or 
     <lb/>
     it may not be the case. I admit that it is 
     <lb/>
     in some sense and in some respects a modi<lb break="no"/>fication of the law of 1875, not a modifica<lb break="no"/>tion of the principle of religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     in the schools, which in section 16 is again 
     <lb/>
     upheld, but a modification probably in the 
     <lb/>
     manner in which the principle is to be ap<lb break="no"/>plied. but the leader of the opposition has 
     <lb/>
     told us that because it constitutes a modi<lb break="no"/>fication of the provisions of the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     we are, in enacting section 16, amending 
     <lb/>
     section 93 of the British North America Act. 
     <lb/>
     I do not think that is correct and I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Bor<lb break="no"/>den) if he will contend that we could not 
     <lb/>
     to-day by a separate Bill enact the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of section 16. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. You mean with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Territories ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Yes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Why certainly we 
     <lb/>
     could enact any legislation with regard to 
     <lb/>
     the Territories, and we could repeal it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Quite so; the jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion is in this parliament and it will remain 
     <lb/>
     here until these new provinces come in. 
     <lb/>
     What is the difference then between enact<lb break="no"/>ing section 16 in this Bill or in a separate 
     <lb/>
     Bill ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I would think there 
     <lb/>
     is a very plain difierence. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I do not think there is. 
            </p>
<p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I think not. We have 
     <lb/>
     the jurisdiction, and having the jurisdiction 
     <lb/>
     what is the difference between enacting sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16 by itself or along with other pro<lb break="no"/>visions ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The difference is so 
     <lb/>
     extremely obvious that I would suppose it 
     <lb/>
     could hardly escape the attention of my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend. In one case we are dealing with 
     <lb/>
     territories, which, as my hon. friend has 
     <lb/>
     just explained, are under the absolute legis<lb break="no"/>lative jurisdiction of this parliament until 
     <lb/>
     they are created into provinces. In the 
     <lb/>
     other case we are creating them into pro<lb break="no"/>vinces subject to the provisions of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act as to the distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of legislative power between the Do<lb break="no"/>minion on the one hand and the provinces 
     <lb/>
     on the other. I would think that is a 
     <lb/>
     pretty obvious distinction, but it may not 
     <lb/>
     commend itself to my hon. friend. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I fear the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has not appreciated my argument.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I am afraid I have 
     <lb/>
     not.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. For reasons which I 
     <lb/>
     am not going to discuss, it appears that 
     <lb/>
     the majority of the members of this House 
     <lb/>
     think that the time has arrived when the 
     <lb/>
     provisions of the Act of 1875 shall be chang<lb break="no"/>ed. Some of us think it might be changed 
     <lb/>
     in a broader sense, while others think it 
     <lb/>
     might be changed in a more restrictive sense. 
     <lb/>
     Whatever of that there has been a compro<lb break="no"/>mise ; the majority in this House have 
     <lb/>
     agreed that the legislation of 1875 is not the 
     <lb/>
     legislation which should govern in the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories to-day. I say then, that we have a 
     <lb/>
     perfect right under the constitution and 
     <lb/>
     under the provisions of the Act of 1871 to 
     <lb/>
     enact for these Territories which are still 
     <lb/>
     under our jurisdiction, Territories over 
     <lb/>
     which no other jurisdiction exists, I say we 
     <lb/>
     have the power to crystallize by a separate 
     <lb/>
     enactment or as we are now doing as part 
     <lb/>
     of this measure the provisions of section 16 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill, and these provisions would be 
     <lb/>
     in existence when these two provinces come 
     <lb/>
     into the union on the first of July next. In 
     <lb/>
     other words, we have the right to deter<lb break="no"/>mine to-day what shall be the law in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to education in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. We have now the right and power 
     <lb/>
     to repeal or modify the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     law of 1875 as to education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Certainly. I would 
     <lb/>
     like to ask my hon. friend a question just 
     <lb/>
     here. We have the right to determine that; 
     <lb/>
     therefore we can by an Act of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment withhold any power whatever in res<lb break="no"/>pect of education from these Territories 
     <lb/>
     while they are in a territorial condition. It 
     <lb/>
     would follow therefore, if my hon. friend's 
     <lb/>
     argument is correct, that we can do exactly 
     <lb/>
     the same thing when we create them into 
     <lb/>
     provinces and reserve to this Dominion ab<lb break="no"/>solute control of the educational system. Is 
     <lb/>
     that what my hon. friend means ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Not exactly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I do not think it 
     <lb/>
     is, but it is the logical outcome of his argu<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. What I mean is this— 
     <lb/>
     my argument may not commend itself to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend, but I would like him to 
     <lb/>
     understand what my argument is. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I would like my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend to make that clear. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. My argument is, that 
     <lb/>
     to-day with reference to education, and for 
     <lb/>
     that matter with reference to all other sub<lb break="no"/>jects, the Territories are under the jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion of this parliament. We may repeal those 
     <lb/>
     rights or change them at any time we wish. 
     <lb/>
     I say that to-day a majority of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this House, representatives from all 
     <lb/>
     parts of the country, have agreed that the 
     <lb/>
     time has come when there must be some 
     <lb/>
     modification, important or unimportant, of 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1875, and we have the right to 
     <lb/>
     make that legislation until our jurisdiction

     <fw type="num">3507</fw>
     <fw type="num">3508</fw>
         

     is exhausted. until it ceases, which will he 
     <lb/>
     only on the 1st of July next. Until then we 
     <lb/>
     have a right to make such legislation as 
     <lb/>
     we deem proper for the Territories in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to education. I hope I have made 
     <lb/>
     myself plain. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I am trying to un<lb break="no"/>derstand my hon. friend, but will put an<lb break="no"/>other question and see if I can make my<lb break="no"/>self plain to him. As I understand his 
     <lb/>
     argument, we have full legislative jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion over the Territories. We have seen 
     <lb/>
     fit to give them only a modified power 
     <lb/>
     to legislate with respect to education—that 
     <lb/>
     is to say, we have imposed a limitation on 
     <lb/>
     their power. Because we have done that, 
     <lb/>
     he says we have an absolute right to 
     <lb/>
    continue that limitation when they are 
     <lb/>created into provinces. If that is good 
     <lb/>argument, is not this good argument, 
     <lb/>that because we might absolutely with<lb break="no"/>hold t'rom those Territories, under our 
     <lb/>legislative power, any jurisdiction what<lb break="no"/>ever in respect of education, therefore, for 
     <lb/>exactly the same reason that my learned 
     <lb/>friend has advanced, we can withhold from 
     <lb/>them when we create them into provinces 
     <lb/>any jurisdiction whatever in regard to edu<lb break="no"/>cation ? That is my hon. friend's position. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Not at all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I would like to 
     <lb/>
     know what it is, then. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I will give an answer 
     <lb/>
     which may not be convincing to my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend, but may be to others. It is this. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend did not follow me closely. 
     <lb/>
     I said with reference to the special, clear, 
     <lb/>
     definite, specific provisions of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, that it is not in our 
     <lb/>
     power to modify or change them in any 
     <lb/>
     way either with reference to the provinces 
     <lb/>
     which came in in 1867 or with reference to 
     <lb/>
     those coming later on and one of these is 
     <lb/>
     the provision with reference to education con<lb break="no"/>tained in section 93. But I say that under 
     <lb/>
     the Act of 1871 our power of legislation 
     <lb/>
     with reference to those Territories is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely unlimited and now at this moment 
     <lb/>
     fully existent and unimpaired.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. When we form them 
     <lb/>
     into provinces ?

     <lb/>
     the Territories will be the law and if that 
     <lb/>
     law is in existence on the first of July next, 
     <lb/>
     when the new provinces come in, will be 
     <lb/>
     perpetuated by their charter by virtue of 
     <lb/>
     section 93. My hon. friend the leader of 
     <lb/>
     the opposition has told us that the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the British North American Act 
     <lb/>
     apply automatically or mechanically—I do 
     <lb/>
     not remember which word he used. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I did not go quite 
     <lb/>
     that far. If my hon. friend will pardon me 
     <lb/>
     —I do not want to interrupt him except 
     <lb/>
     when he does not state any argument cor<lb break="no"/>rectly—I said that section 2 of this Bill 
     <lb/>
     would bring into operation section 93 of 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act. so far as 
     <lb/>
     it could have any application to the Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, and therefore I did not see any 
     <lb/>
     necessity or justification for section 16. That 
     <lb/>
     a moment ago—whether or not he thinks 
     <lb/>
     section 2 of the proposed Bill brings into 
     <lb/>
     force in the new provinces the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of section 93. and, if it does, whether or 
     <lb/>
     not the provisions of section 93 have appli<lb break="no"/>cation, considering the conditions existing 
     <lb/>
     at the time when the Territories will be<lb break="no"/>come provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. It is rather immaterial 
     <lb/>
     to me whether the provisions of section 93 
     <lb/>
     of the British North America Act apply 
     <lb/>
     automatically or mechanically, or whether 
     <lb/>
     the enactment of a clause like clause 2 is 
     <lb/>
     necessary to make them applicable. It is 
     <lb/>
     rather unimportant to me whether that is 
     <lb/>
     done by virtue of the Act itself, or whether 
     <lb/>
     the duty is imposed upon this parliament 
     <lb/>
     when creating provinces to say that those 
     <lb/>
     provisions shall apply. But I am not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to say that my hon. friend is not 
     <lb/>
     right. It may be that the provisions of 
     <lb/>
     section 93 apply. as he says. automatically 
     <lb/>
     or mechanically; and I must say that I 
     <lb/>
     am inclined to believe they do. or course, 
     <lb/>
     he and I disagree altogether as to the time 
     <lb/>
     when in this case the application is to be 
     <lb/>
     made. He goes back to the time of the 
     <lb/>
     entrance of these Territories into confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, in 1870, and in order to do that he 
     <lb/>
     has to read into section 93 the word 'Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory,' which I do not find there. I say that 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of section 93 apply at the 
     <lb/>
     time of the entrance of the province as a 
     <lb/>
     province.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. In order to under<lb break="no"/>stand my hon. friend's argument, might I 
     <lb/>
     ask him one more question ? In case my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend is right in the view he has just 
     <lb/>
     taken, what after all is the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     section 16 ? Is it not superfluous, absolutely 
     <lb/>
     superfluous ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
    <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. No. I stated that 
     <lb/>section 16 constitutes, in a measure, un<lb break="no"/>important perhaps, but in a measure, a 
     <lb/>modification of the law of 1875, and for 
     <lb/>that reason there is a necessity for section 

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3509</fw>
     <fw type="num">3510</fw>

     16 to-day. If the law of 1875 were not. 
     <lb/>
     modified in any way, perhaps my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend would be right in stating that there 
     <lb/>
     would be no necessity for section 16, or for 
     <lb/>
     section 2 for that matter; but section 16 
     <lb/>
     is in some respects a modification of the 
     <lb/>
     law as it exists to-day, and that is why I say 
     <lb/>
     it is necessary for this parliament to enact 
     <lb/>
     it to-day, and this parliament has power to 
     <lb/>
     enact it. That is my argument.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The man in the street 
     <lb/>
     would have a hard time in getting that into 
     <lb/>
     his head.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Well, I may say, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that I am hardly addressing my 
     <lb/>
     argument to the member for East Grey. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the leader of the opposition also 
     <lb/>
     argued. and he relied upon the opinion of 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Christopher Robinson. that section 93 
     <lb/>
     applied only to Ontario and Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I will not interrupt 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend, but I would rather have 
     <lb/>
     him take my argument as I stated it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I do not think it can 
     <lb/>
     be seriously argued that section 93 was 
     <lb/>
     framed for the purposes of Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec only, and that its provisions are 
     <lb/>
     to be applied only to Quebec and Ontario. 
     <lb/>
     It is true that subsection 2 of section 93 
     <lb/>
     covers the case of Quebec and Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     that it was framed for that purpose, and 
     <lb/>
     that it protects the rights of the minorities 
     <lb/>
     in Quebec and Ontario only. But then I 
     <lb/>
     would like to ask, if it was intended by the 
     <lb/>
     general provisions of section 93 to protect 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the minority, whether Catholic 
     <lb/>
     or Protestant, only in Ontario and Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     why enact subsection 1. which reads as 
     <lb/>
     follows : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     In and for each province the legislature may

            <p>
     1. Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially

            <p>
     Surely this was not intended for the 
     <lb/>
     province of Ontario and Quebec only mani<lb break="no"/>festly this was intended for provinces other 
     <lb/>
     than Quebec and Ontario. Surely this was

     <lb/>
     and such as <choice><sic>woulld</sic><corr>would</corr></choice> come in later on. 
     <lb/>
     I say that the opinion expressed repeat<lb break="no"/>edly in this House that by section 93 it was 
     <lb/>
     intended to protect only Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec with reference to education has no 
     <lb/>
     foundation whatever, and the merest ex<lb break="no"/>amination of section 93, subsection 1, will 
     <lb/>
     convince any one that it was intended to 
     <lb/>
     protect the rights of the minority in any 
     <lb/>
     part of the country which was then brought 
     <lb/>
     into confederation, or which would be 
     <lb/>
     brought in later on.

     Otherwise subsection 1 has no meaning. 
     <lb/>
     No one in this House has endeavoured to 
     <lb/>
     give to subsection 1 any other meaning. It 
     <lb/>
     is not susceptible of any other interpre<lb break="no"/>tation or application. I say therefore, 
     <lb/>
     that when subsection 1 was framed, 
     <lb/>
     the fathers of confederation evidently 
     <lb/>
     intended by it that whatever other pro<lb break="no"/>vinces might come into confederation, 
     <lb/>
     besides Ontario and Quebec, they should 
     <lb/>
     be similarly protected, so far as education 
     <lb/>
     is concerned, and the same provision applied 
     <lb/>
     to them or to any other portion of the British 
     <lb/>North America Act which might later on<lb/>join the union. I have no hesitation in my<lb/>mind regarding that conclusion. I have <lb/>no doubt that the conclusion to which I<lb/>have come, after considerable investigation<lb/>and thought and research, is the right one.<lb/>But it is quite evident that my opinion is<lb/>not shared by every one. It is quite evi<lb break="no"/>dent that it is not accord with many of<lb/>the legal opinions which down to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent have been expressed in this debate.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Up to a certain 
     <lb/>
     point it is absolutely in accord with my

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I am afraid that my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend and myself differ at the cru<lb break="no"/>cial point. It is not surprising that this 
     <lb/>should be the case because we are dealing 
     <lb/>with a very intricate constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tion. We are dealing with the interpre<lb break="no"/>tation of the spirit and letter of a consti<lb break="no"/>tution, made nearly 40 years ago. and now 
     <lb/>being applied to conditions and circum<lb break="no"/>stances which are very complicated, and 
     <lb/>which at that time could only have been 
     <lb/>pictured in the mind's eye. It is not sur<lb break="no"/>prising therefore that the Confederation Act 
     <lb/>should give rise to these legal divergencies 
     <lb/>and disputes. In fact it is rather surprising 
     <lb/>that during the forty years which have 
     <lb/>elapsed since that Act was enacted, there 
     <lb/>have not arisen more difficulties and diver 
     <lb/>gencies; and it speaks highly for the Wis<lb break="no"/>dom and ability of those who framed that 
     <lb/>Act that greater difficulties have not arisen 
     <lb/>as to its interpretation both in the letter 
     <lb/>and the spirit. In any deliberative body, 
     <lb/>such as a legislature or parliament, it is 
     <lb/>very difficult to have constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tions calmly considered and threshed out as 
     <lb/>they should be and any opinion definitely 
     <lb/>agreed upon. But, however divergent may 
     <lb/>be our views upon the letter of the con. 
     <lb/>stitution, there ought to be no doubt as to 
     <lb/>its spirit. Any one who will read and 
     <lb/>scrutinize the various provisions of the 
     <lb/>British North America Act in the light of 
     <lb/>what happened before and led up to it 
     <lb/>cannot but conclude that it was clearly the 
     <lb/>intention of the framers of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion that the rights of the minority, whe<lb break="no"/>ther Protestant or Catholic, should be pro 
     <lb/>tected. Whether that minority lived in the 
     <lb/>province of Quebec or the province of On<lb break="no"/>tario or was to be found in any other por<lb break="no"/>

tion of British North America, the do<lb break="no"/>minant idea was the same ; and whether<lb/>a man lived on the banks of the St. Law<lb break="no"/>rence or the Saskatchewan or the Red<lb/>river, he was to enjoy the same rights and<lb/>privileges as regards education and the ex<lb break="no"/>ercise of his religion. The spirit which<lb/>prompted the fathers of confederation to<lb/>recognize the rights and privileges of the<lb/>minority in matters of conscience surely had<lb/>equal force whether that minority lived in<lb/>the east, west, south or north. Therefore<lb/>it is manifest that the fathers of confede<lb break="no"/>ration intended whatever may be said as<lb/>to the effectiveness of the language used,<lb/>that the same principle should apply and <lb/>the same rights be respected and preserved<lb/>in every portion of the Dominion. And be<lb break="no"/>cause these differences in constitutional <lb/>views have arisen to such an extent that it<lb/>is difficult to get half a dozen men in this <lb/>House to agree what the letter of the<lb/>constitution means, it has become abso<lb break="no"/>lutely necessary to have section 16 enacted<lb/>and made part of this Act.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
     I referred a moment ago to what had 
     <lb/>
     preceded confederation. I referred to the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority with reference to the 
     <lb/>
     lpreservation and the recognition of liberty 
     <lb/>
     of conscience and liberty of religious be 
     <lb/>
     lief. I say that from the very inception of 
     <lb/>
     British power in British North America 
     <lb/>
     from the very day of the conquest 
     <lb/>
     when the colony of Quebec capitulated to 
     <lb/>
     the British—from that day on, at every 
     <lb/>
     stage, on every occasion when the imperial 
     <lb/>
     parliament and the Canadian authorities 
     <lb/>
     were called upon to deal with the rights 
     <lb/>
     and religious belief of the minority, that 
     <lb/>
     religious belief always received the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion and protection of imperial and Cana<lb break="no"/>dian authority. By articles 2 and 6 of 
     <lb/>
     the capitulation of Quebec, that principle 
     <lb/>
     was sanctioned and recognized. By ar<lb break="no"/>ticles 27, 28, 29, 32 and 38 of the capitula<lb break="no"/>tion of Montreal, it was also recognized. 
     <lb/>
     By the treaty of Paris, clause 4, by the 
     <lb/>
     Quehec Act, clauses 5, 7 and 8, by the 
     <lb/>
     constitution of 1791 section 35, by the Union 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1840, clauses 42 and 46,—by all these 
     <lb/>
     Acts and on all these occasions religious 
     <lb/>
     freedom and liberty of conscience were abso<lb break="no"/>lutely recognized and granted to every sub<lb break="no"/>ject. and more particularly to the Catholic 
     <lb/>
     minority in this country. It is not sur<lb break="no"/>prising therefore that when the fathers of 
     <lb/>
     confederation in 1863 met in the city of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec for the purpose of framing the 
     <lb/>
     conditions upon Which the then provinces 
     <lb/>
     of Canada should come together and live 
     <lb/>
     together as a happy family, and upon which 
     <lb/>
     new provinces should be admitted in the 
     <lb/>
     union—it is not surprising that on that 
     <lb/>
    occasion What had been done on all 
     <lb/>the previous occasions to which I have 
     <lb/>referred should have been repeated, and 
     <lb/>the same rights and privileges and li<lb break="no"/>berty of conscience should have received 
     <lb/>the sanction of those who were framing

     the British North America Act. The Whole 
     <lb/>
     principle which is crystallized in section 16 
     <lb/>
     of this measure is one which is as old as 
     <lb/>
     British Dominion in America and which 
     <lb/>
     has been recognized on every occasion, from 
     <lb/>
     the very day the colony of Quebec capitu<lb break="no"/>lated down to the present. Why then in 
     <lb/>
     1905 should the rights of the Catholic mino<lb break="no"/>rity, which has grown from 60,000 to two 
     <lb/>
     million and over, not receive the respect 
     <lb/>
     and sanction of the parliament of Canada ? 
     <lb/>
     If it was just and proper, as the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     the leader of the House pointed out the 
     <lb/>
     other day, in 1867, that the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     minority in the provinces of Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario should be preserved, is it not 
     <lb/>
     equally just and proper that in 1905 the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic or Protestant minority in these 
     <lb/>
     new provinces should also have its rights 
     <lb/>
     recognized and perpetuated? Where is the 
     <lb/>
     difference ? What was right and proper in 
     <lb/>
     1867 is surely just and right in 1905.

     Mr. Speaker, in opening my remarks, I

     said I would endeavour to show that ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the letter, as well as to the spirit, 
     <lb/>
     of the constitution. section 16 was absolute<lb break="no"/>ly necessary. I also said that, for what I 
     <lb/>
     believed to be reasons of high public policy, 
     <lb/>
     it was expedient and necessary that we 
     <lb/>
     should enact section 16. In the divergence

     of opinion expressed by my hon. friend the

     by my hon. friend from East Hastings (Mr.

     for all of whose opinions I entertain the 
     <lb/>
     greatest respect, I find the strongest possible 
     <lb/>
     reason for saying that considerations of high 
     <lb/>
     public policy make it expedient and neces<lb break="no"/>sary to enact section 16, as we are now 
     <lb/>
     doing. Who in this House or in this coun 
     <lb/>
     try is yearning for a renewal of the agita<lb break="no"/>tion we had some years ago over the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba Schools Act? Who is willing to have 
     <lb/>
     the passions and the prejudices of the people 
     <lb/>
     aroused in the manner in which they were 
     <lb/>
     aroused at that time, bringing this country 
     <lb/>
     almost to the verge of civil war ? Who is 
     <lb/>
     willing to have the energies and activities 
     <lb/>
     of the nation paralyzed in the way they 
     <lb/>
     were paralyzed at that time? I would 
     <lb/>
     ask the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) if he would be willing to-day to 
     <lb/>
     suggest that the Act of 1875, and the ordin<lb break="no"/>nances enacted thereunder by the legislature 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories, should be re<lb break="no"/>pealed ? Would my hon. friend rise in his 
     <lb/>
     place in this House and suggest that we 
     <lb/>
     should repeal the provisions of the Act of 
     <lb/>
     1875 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I never suggested 
     <lb/>
     that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I believe not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. What I have said 
     <lb/>
     is that that is not a matter for me, but a 
     <lb/>
    matter for the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. And I have said further that I do 


<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3513</fw>
     <fw type="num">3514</fw>
        

     not believe that we shall advance the posi' 
     <lb/>
     tion by passing a law which we have no 
     <lb/>
     power to pass. That is all. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I quite believe, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>
     Borden) would not to-day suggest that the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875, and the ordinances enacted 
     <lb/>
     thereunder, should be repealed ; for I know 
     <lb/>
     he would not be willing to take the risk 
     <lb/>
     which that would involve. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     must realize that that is the position in 
     <lb/>
     which the government was placed; and if 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
     <lb/>
     were on the treasury benches, that is the 
     <lb/>
     problem that would face him. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I do not so under<lb break="no"/>stand it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I do, if the hon. gentle 
     <lb/>
     man does not. The government had to do 
     <lb/>
     one of three things—to continue the legis<lb break="no"/>lation of 1875 as it was, to repeal that legis<lb break="no"/>lation altogether, or to modify it. The gov<lb break="no"/>ernment did not choose to repeal this legis<lb break="no"/>lation any more than the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. R. L. Borden) would have dared to 
     <lb/>
     advise the repeal of it had he been in power. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Might I suggest to 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend (Mr. Belcourt) that section 
     <lb/>
     15 of the Bill expressly continues the laws 
     <lb/>
     in force in the Northwest Territories ? The 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman apparently has not read 
     <lb/>
     the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Yes, I have read it, I 
     <lb/>
     still hold the opinion that section 16 consti<lb break="no"/>tutes a modification of the law of 1875. 
     <lb/>
     As I have said, I do not intend to discuss 
     <lb/>
     the extent of that modification ; but, as was 
     <lb/>
     demonstrated by the ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior (Mr. Sifton), it does constitute a 
     <lb/>
     modification. I have no doubt on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, and I do not think there can be any 
     <lb/>doubt. Obliged to do one of the three things 
     <lb/>to which I have referred. the government. 
     <lb/>did not dare, any more than the leader or 
     <lb/>the opposition would have dared, to repeal 
     <lb/>the Act of 1875. It chose to continue that 
     <lb/>Act in a modified form, thus doing one of 
     <lb/>the three things I have mentioned. But, in 
     <lb/>speaking as he has spoken in this House, 
     <lb/>the hon. gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
     <lb/>has virtually taken the position that the 
     <lb/>law of 1875 should be repealed. He 
     <lb/>has told us that this matter should be 
     <lb/>left entirely to the new provinces and 
     <lb/>that we should not interfere, and that 
     <lb/>there is absolutely no danger to the rights 
     <lb/>of the minority being in any way taken 
     <lb/>away or impaired, but that we must trust 
     <lb/>to the spirit of justice and fair-play of those 
     <lb/>who live in these new provinces. For my<lb break="no"/>self, I have confidence in the spirit of jus<lb break="no"/>tice and fair-play among the inhabitants of 
     <lb/>the Northwest Territories. But how long 
     <lb/>would that feeling exist and the spirit of 
     <lb/>justice remain if the agitation that hon. 
     <lb/>gentlemen opposite and their friends and 
     <lb/>their press have caried on in this province

     were carried on in the Northwest ? How 
     <lb/>
     long would the rights of the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     to religious instruction in the schools of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest remain, if the views of the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from East Grey (Mr. Sproule)— 
     <lb/>
     which views, I have no doubt, he enter<lb break="no"/>tains sincerely, were carried out ? How 
     <lb/>
     long would the Catholic minority in the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest have the privilege of having re<lb break="no"/>ligious instruction in their schools ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I can tell the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Belcourt) that the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has never spok<lb break="no"/>en or written one word that would be fairly 
     <lb/>
     susceptible to that interpretation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Perhaps it is time to 
     <lb/>
     learn now where the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule) stands. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I stand exactly where I

     have always stood. I objected to the inter<lb break="no"/>ference with the rights of the provinces to

     deal with the subject.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. We are not dealing

     with the question of provincial rights now,

     but with the question of religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion in the schools.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. But we are dealing with 
     <lb/>
     a subject laid down in the British North

     America Act, a subject with which it is the 
     <lb/>
    birthright of every province to deal—the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of education.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule), no doubt, thinks he has trium<lb break="no"/>phantly aswered my question. I submit 
     <lb/>
     that he has done nothing of the kind. What 
     <lb/>
     I ask is whether he is in favour of religious

     instruction in the schools or not ? Will he

     answer ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is my own busi<lb break="no"/>ness. I wish to say that I was led to re<lb break="no"/>fer to the question in the remarks I made 
     <lb/>
     upon the subject, by what the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter said in introducing the Bill. In reply 
     <lb/>
     to that, I referred to some matters which 
     <lb/>
     otherwise I should not have introduced 
     <lb/>
     into my speech at all.

     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I would like to be permitted 
     <lb/>
     to put a question to my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Sproule). Will he deny that he wrote let<lb break="no"/>ters to residents of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, even before these Bills were intro<lb break="no"/>duced, pointing out to these gentlemen to 
     <lb/>
     whom he wrote that this was the time for 
     <lb/>
     them to get rid of separate schools for all 
     <lb/>
     time ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I deny it. There is not 
     <lb/>
     a word of truth in it.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SCOT2">Mr. SCOTT</persName>. I would like to say that I

     cheerfully accept my hon. friend's words

     and to add further that I have been misin<lb break="no"/>formed by a gentleman who lives in the

            <p>

     beating about the bush and turning sharp 
     <lb/>
     corners. My hon. friend is not candid—I 
     <lb/>
     will not use another expression which I 
     <lb/>
     might—when he refuses to state whether or 
     <lb/>
     not he is in favour of religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     in the schools. But we know what his 
     <lb/>

            </p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. He is entitled to his 
     <lb/>
     views. He has consistently advocated cer<lb break="no"/>tain views in this House and elsewhere, 
     <lb/>
     and they are not favourable to religious 
     <lb/>
     instruction in the schools. He has told 
     <lb/>
     us that in the House. He has told us 
     <lb/>
     that he is not in favour of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. What does he mean by it ? I 
     <lb/>
     do not know, but I would assume that 
     <lb/>
     he was not in favour of religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion in the schools. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     wants to be candid he will tell us that he 
     <lb/>
     is not only not in favour, but he is unalter<lb break="no"/>ably opposed to religious instruction in the

     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     wants to cross question let him try his hand

     on the hon. the ex-Minister of the Interior

     get him to give an answer. I am 
     <lb/>
     sure I am not going to tackle anybody 
     <lb/>
     else until I have got something from 
     <lb/>
     him. I take it according to the French

     maxim, qui ne dit mot consent, that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman is unalterably opposed 
     <lb/>
     to religious instruction. And he is not 
     <lb/>
     alone. I can count them by the dozens 
     <lb/>
     on the other side of the House who are op<lb break="no"/>posed to religious instruction in the schools.

     We have heard them say so one after the

     other—yes, by the dozens on that side of

     of fairplay and justice upon which we are

     told we must absolutely rely ? Why, Sir

     remember Manitoba. We had confidence in 
     <lb/>
     the spirit of justice and fair play of the

     <lb/>
     long did it take to shatter our hopes and

     our confidences in the spirit of fair play

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. Who did it?

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Well, the people of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba did it and the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to-morrow will do it if the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman can have his way. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:INGR1">Mr. INGRAM</persName>. I stood up in 1896 for the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the minority in Manitoba when the

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Well, Sir, we have 
     <lb/>
     been told by other hon. gentlemen of what 
     <lb/>
     they did in 1896 and we were told yester<lb break="no"/>day by the hon. member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster) that what he did in 1896 he 
     <lb/>
     does not propose to do again. He gave us 
     <lb/>
     the reason why he did not propose to do it 
     <lb/>
     again. He told us that it does not pay 
     <lb/>
     politically.? That is the reason. I believe 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for East Elgin (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Ingram) will probably think also that it 
     <lb/>
     does not pay and he does not propose to 
     <lb/>
     do it again.

            </p>
   
            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Well, well.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. The hon. gentleman has

     given an alleged reason as to why I said I

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. No, the hon. gentleman

     gave it himself.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. His reason was that I 
     <lb/>
     would not do it again because it does not 
     <lb/>
     pay. My reason was not that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I beg the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man's pardon ; it is exactly the reason he

     gave. He told us that in 1896 that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple did not appreciate his self-sacrifice. That 
     <lb/>
     in 1900 they did not appreciate his self- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     sacrifice; that in 1904 they did not appreci<lb break="no"/>ate his self-sacrifice and he said that politi<lb break="no"/>cally it did not pay and for that reason he 
     <lb/>
     was not going to do it again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. It is now put so baldly 
     <lb/>
     that I must deny it absolutely and ask the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member either to give his authority 
     <lb/>
     from the 'Hansard' or to immediately with<lb break="no"/>draw it—one or the other, and I appeal to 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker to see that that is carried out.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. If the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     gets very threatening perhaps he will not 
     <lb/>
     have it carried out. If he will appeal to my 
     <lb/>
     instincts and desire me— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

            </p>

            <p>

     <lb/>
     in saying what you have you may keep it. 
     <lb/>
     If you do not wish to be honest and fair and 
     <lb/>
    do what an honest and fair man would do 
     <lb/>you may keep it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Well, if the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman has ended this show of inflamed 
     <lb/>
     temper perhaps he will allow me to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed. I understood the hon. gentleman to 
     <lb/>
     tell the House that in 1869 he had, much 
     <lb/>
     against his own inclination, much against 
     <lb/>
     his own desires, supported the Remedial 
     <lb/>
     Bill. He did it, he told us, when he 
     <lb/>
     had no desire to do it. He did it because 
     <lb/>
     he wanted to protect the rights of the min<lb break="no"/>ority. I understood him to say that his 
     <lb/>
     course was not appreciated by the people 
     <lb/>
     of this country, that in the election which 
     <lb/>
     immediately followed this great act of dis<lb break="no"/>interestedness on his part was not appreci<lb break="no"/>ated by the people and that on the con<lb break="no"/>trary they supported the opposite side. I 
     <lb/>
     understood him to say that the same thing 
     <lb/>
     happened in 1900 and again in 1904, that it 
     <lb/>
     did not pay politically, and that as far as 
     <lb/>
     he was concerned that was the end of his 
     <lb/>
     sacrificing himself. If I am wrong in my 
     <lb/>
     understanding of what the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     said I am wrong honestly. That is the im<lb break="no"/>pression which I gathered from his speech, 
     <lb/>
     but if the hon. gentleman tells me that it 
     <lb/>
     is not the language which he used I am 
     <lb/>
     prepared to accept his statement. Perhaps 
     <lb/>
     he will permit me to read what he did say 
     <lb/>
     on that point.

     But let me state my point first. I rise to 
     <lb/>
     this point that whether knowingly or un<lb break="no"/>knowingly the member for Ottawa (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Belcourt) has misrepresented my position 
     <lb/>
     and he has—

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I read 'Hansard.'

     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I read 'Hansard.'

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. He has declared that my 
     <lb/>
     position was this, that I did support re<lb break="no"/>medial legislation in 1896 but that I would 
     <lb/>
     not support it again, and have so declared 
     <lb/>
     in the House, because it did not pay poli<lb break="no"/>tically.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Now I think that is as 
     <lb/>
     clear a statement as I can make as to what 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman has just said. I stated 
     <lb/>
     that that was not a proper representation 
     <lb/>
     of my position, that I have stated in the 
     <lb/>
     House that I was not an adherent of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools, but that I believed the consti<lb break="no"/>tution of this country gave to a minority 
     <lb/>
     one method of access for redress and that 
     <lb/>
     after the decision of the courts and the 
     <lb/>
     decision of the Privy Council had been 
     <lb/>
     given, that road was open and I said I be<lb break="no"/>lieved that although it was not politically 
     <lb/>
     to my advantage, and it was not as I be<lb break="no"/>lieved politically to the advantage of the 
     <lb/>

     <lb/>Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) cannot state my point 
     <lb/>of order. It must be my right to state 
     <lb/>my point and as he has interrupted me I 
     <lb/>shall have to commence a little further 
     <lb/>back than where I left off. I stated that, 
     <lb/>although I did not believe at the time it 
     <lb/>was my advantage politically, and I did not 
     <lb/>believe it was to the advantage of the party 
     <lb/>to which I belonged politically, I believed 
     <lb/>it was constitutionally right and that I did 
     <lb/>it because I believed it was constitutional 
     <lb/>and that it was my duty to do it. Then I 
     <lb/>said after that had taken place there was 
     <lb/>a power higher than the constitution and 
     <lb/>that power was the sovereign will of the 
     <lb/>people ; that after the position was laid 
     <lb/>before the people in 1896 in 1900 and in 
     <lb/>1904 the people by their votes had endors<lb break="no"/>ed the party that opposed remedial legis<lb break="no"/>lation and consequently, as long as water 
     <lb/>ran and grass grew, I did not think I would 
     <lb/>be found in that same programme. Now 
     <lb/>my position is as I have stated. The state<lb break="no"/>ment made by my hon. friend is exactly to 
     <lb/>the reverse. Mine gives as a reason a re<lb break="no"/>gard for the principle of the constitution 
     <lb/>and a regard for the will of the people. The 
     <lb/>hon. gentleman stated that my reason was 
     <lb/>that I would not do it again because it did 
     <lb/>not pay. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Mr. Speaker, I do not

     <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. May I ask the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman one question ? Does he yet persist

     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER</persName>. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) will admit

     made by a member if he has been wrongly 
     <lb/>
     reported, misconstrued, or wrongly under<lb break="no"/>stood. The moment a member gives a per<lb break="no"/>sonal explanation it is customary to accept 
     <lb/>
     the explanation.

            </p>
   
            <p>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER</persName>. I have given 
     <lb/>
     my ruling. The hon. member for Ottawa 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Belcourt) may have summarized un<lb break="no"/>justly the member for Toronto, but the 
     <lb/>
     member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) has de<lb break="no"/>clared that he accepted the statement of 
     <lb/>
     the member for Toronto (Mr. Foster). I 
     <lb/>
     have given my ruling. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. We are told that in 
     <lb/>
     this matter we should rely upon the spirit 
     <lb/>
     of fair-play and justice of the people in the 
     <lb/>
     new territories. I was proceeding to tell 
     <lb/>
     the House that we must in this matter 
     <lb/>
     remember Manitoba, when I was interrupt<lb break="no"/>ed by the member for North Toronto (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Foster). I wish to say that in my own judg<lb break="no"/>ment in matters of this kind we ought to do 
     <lb/>
     what good business people do in every day 
     <lb/>
     dealings and transactions. Whilst people be<lb break="no"/>lieve and take it for granted that other 
     <lb/>
     people are honest and intend to be honest 
     <lb/>
     until the contrary is proven, yet they make 
     <lb/>
     an agreement, when they decide upon some<lb break="no"/>thing, they reduce it to writing. Until the 
     <lb/>
     day of universal fair-play and justice, until 
     <lb/>
     the day of universal honesty, which I think 
     <lb/>
     most will admit is not going to be in the 
     <lb/>
     very near future, I think people will con<lb break="no"/>tinue to have more confidence in and to 
     <lb/>
     place more reliance upon the written agree<lb break="no"/>ments of other people than they will upon 
     <lb/>
     their spirit of fair-play and justice. That 
     <lb/>
     rule applies to nations as well as to in<lb break="no"/>dividuals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We have made an agreement, we have 
     <lb/>
     decided what is to be done with reference 
     <lb/>
     to those new provinces and it is far better 
     <lb/>
     for the peace of this country, far better 
     <lb/>
     for every consideration, that that agreement 
     <lb/>
     should be committed to writing as it is by 
     <lb/>
     enacting section 16. When we look at 
     <lb/>
     what section 16 merely perpetuates it is 
     <lb/>
     astounding to hear the objections that are 
     <lb/>
     made to it. Section 16 simply consecrates 
     <lb/>
     the principle of religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     school, and I should like to ask: What prin<lb break="no"/>ciple is violated ; what wrong, legal, moral, 
     <lb/>
     natural, or constitutional is done ? Does the 
     <lb/>
     exercise of the privilege claimed by the 
     <lb/>
     minority cause injury to anybody ; does it 
     <lb/>
     entail upon any one in this wide Dominion 
     <lb/>
     the deprivation of any right or any pri<lb break="no"/>vilege ; does it take anything away from 
     <lb/>
     anybody ; does it hurt, hamper or injure 
     <lb/>
     any one in the slightest degree ; does it do

     violence to the conscience of any one that 
     <lb/>
     there should be religious instruction in the 
     <lb/>
     schools. Whose conscience is violated by 
     <lb/>
     the privilege that is given to the minority 
     <lb/>
     to have one of their own religion come to 
     <lb/>
     the school room at stated hours to give the 
     <lb/>
     children religious instruction ? Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, to put the question is to answer it. The 
     <lb/>
     principle recognized by section 16 hurts no<lb break="no"/>body, and yet for weeks and for months 
     <lb/>
     past the Conservative press, the public halls 
     <lb/>
     and some of the pulpits in this great pro<lb break="no"/>vince have been filled with angry and unjust 
     <lb/>
     declamations, with impassioned and violent 
     <lb/>
     denunciations, with appeals to the pas<lb break="no"/>sions and prejudices of the majority against 
     <lb/>
     the minority. This House has been flooded 
     <lb/>
     with petitions protesting against the so- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     called tyranny involved in this legislation, 
     <lb/>
     and we have heard a great deal about the 
     <lb/>
     shackles and the fetters which we are about 
     <lb/>
     imposing upon the poor helpless provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest. The editor of one of the 
     <lb/>
     most prominent newspapers in this province 
     <lb/>
     had the temerity to say on the public hust<lb break="no"/>ings in the city of Toronto, that in this 
     <lb/>
     country you must have absolute unity of 
     <lb/>
     race and creed. Mr. Speaker what does 
     <lb/>
     that mean? It means that the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     of this country are to be absorbed or anni<lb break="no"/>hilated ; it means that the Catholics in gen<lb break="no"/>eral and the French Canadians in particular 
     <lb/>
     are to be wiped out. Why, Sir, we are 
     <lb/>
     told that the province of Quebec must be 
     <lb/>
     wiped out of confederation, all because for<lb break="no"/>sooth the Catholic minority in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces want to have religious instruction in 
     <lb/>
     their schools. Our Catholic clergy have 
     <lb/>
     been daily assailed and insulted ; our priests 
     <lb/>
     have been held up to the electorate of the 
     <lb/>
     country as retrograde, grasping and tyranni<lb break="no"/>cal. Under the pretense of protecting pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights in the new provinces ; the 
     <lb/>
     rights, the religious convictions, the pre<lb break="no"/>judices if you will, of two-thirds of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian people have been made the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of harsh. unjust, unworthy and unfair 
     <lb/>
     criticism and attack. The hierarchy of the 
     <lb/>
     Catholic Church has been once again made 
     <lb/>
     the butt of prejudice and unfounded asser<lb break="no"/>tion. Sir, in the face of the storm which 
     <lb/>
     has raged in Ontario over this question it 
     <lb/>
     is only fair that I should contrast the calm, 
     <lb/>
     the moderation, the spirit of tolerance dis<lb break="no"/>played by that very hierarchy which has 
     <lb/>
     been so ruthlessly assailed. Has any one 
     <lb/>
     heard the Catholic clergy or the minority in 
     <lb/>
     the west or elsewhere say a word in this 
     <lb/>
     crisis ? Has any one seen them stoop to 
     <lb/>
     pick up the gauntlet thus thrown down ; 
     <lb/>
     has any one heard them answer the insults 
     <lb/>
     levelled against them. No, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
    they have pursued a dignified course, con<lb break="no"/>scious that the spirit of fair-play to be found 
     <lb/>in the Canadian Parliament will uphold their 
     <lb/>just rights. I should think that. the con<lb break="no"/>trast would be sufficient to bring the blush 
     <lb/>of shame to the cheek of those who profess

     to practise the true Christian spirit, but who 
     <lb/>
     seem to have forgotten it for the moment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And Mr. Speaker, who are those Catholic 
     <lb/>
     clergy and who are the hierarchy who have 
     <lb/>
     been thus maligned ? They need no defence 
     <lb/>
     from me ; the history of British North 
     <lb/>
     | America is their best vindication. Let me 
     <lb/>
     remind its detractors that the Catholic clergy 
     <lb/>
     has done as much as any other body for 
     <lb/>
     civilization and christianity on this contin<lb break="no"/>ent—there has been in Canada no truer, no 
     <lb/>
     surer, no more constant upholder of British 
     <lb/>
     institutions and British power than this 
     <lb/>
     very clergy—if this country has been pre<lb break="no"/>served to the British Crown, it is due in a 
     <lb/>
     measure to the loyalty and bravery of the 
     <lb/>
     French Canadians and in a greater measure 
     <lb/>
     still to the Catholic clergy. Let me place 
     <lb/>
     on record some of the utterances of Can<lb break="no"/>adian Catholic bishops in defence of British 
     <lb/>
     connection. In the year 1775, the year of 
     <lb/>
     the American invasion, Monsigneur Briand, 
     <lb/>
     the bishop of Quebec, wrote on the 22nd of

     But, Mr. Speaker, we were asked the 
     <lb/>
     other day, who is responsible for this agi<lb break="no"/>tation ? The hon. member for East Grey 
     <lb/>
     answered the question. Some other gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen on the other side of the House also 
     <lb/>
     answered it. Well, Mr. Speaker, I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that the member for East Grey is a 
     <lb/>
     very profound thinker or a great orator ; 
     <lb/>
     I do not think he himself would lay claim 
     <lb/>
     to be either; but there is one thing for 
     <lb/>
     which I am willing to give him the palm, 
     <lb/>
     that is, that he is a consummate actor. For 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman, without a wrinkle on 
     <lb/>
     his face, without a smile, in tones of appar<lb break="no"/>ent earnestness and conviction, told us that 
     <lb/>
     the man responsible for all these appeals to 
     <lb/>
     passion and prejudice, the man responsible 
     <lb/>
     for this storm, is—who ? The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman who leads this House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Yes, and I repeat it 
     <lb/>
     again. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Why, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>there is a pretty general opinion in this 
     <lb/>House that the petitions with which it has 
     <lb/>been flooded during the last few weeks 
     <lb/>have all originated with the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man himself—that he is the father, the 
     <lb/>instigator, the propagator of these petitions 
     <lb/>—that he is the one who has gone into the 
     <lb/>by-ways and the back townships to get 
     <lb/>them signed and sent here. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is entirely incor<lb break="no"/>rect, allow me to say. I think I am within 
     <lb/>
    the mark when I say that half the petitions 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3525</fw>
     <fw type="num">3536</fw>
     

     which have come here never originated 
     <lb/>
     through me or by any suggestion of mine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. The hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has told us on several occasions that peti<lb break="no"/>tions which were being presented by other 
     <lb/>
     members had come to him, and that he 
     <lb/>
     had sent them to those members to be 
     <lb/>
     presented. Why, he was the manipulator, 
     <lb/>
     the whole thing, in connection with those 
     <lb/>
     petitions. They were his special business, 
     <lb/>
     and he gave it all the attention and the zeal 
     <lb/>
     he could. We know that the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     has, through the press, in this House, at 
     <lb/>
     meetings of the great Conservative organ<lb break="no"/>ization of which he is the sovereign grand 
     <lb/>
     master, and which he so consistently, so 
     <lb/>
     constantly and so profitably steers for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of himself and the Conservative 
     <lb/>
     party, appealed to the brethren to keep up 
     <lb/>
     the agitation against this measure. It is 
     <lb/>
     a well known fact, Sir, that this campaign 
     <lb/>
     did not originate in the west, with the 
     <lb/>
     people most concerned, but in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario. I believe that before the Bill 
     <lb/>
     was introduced into the House, there was 
     <lb/>
     absolutely no feeling in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     against the perpetuation of the privileges 
     <lb/>
     granted to the minority. I have it from 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen from the west who sit oppo<lb break="no"/>site that they had to come to Ottawa to 
     <lb/>
     learn that there was such a thing as a 
     <lb/>
     school question, for they had never heard 
     <lb/>
     of it up there. But, forsooth, the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman for East Grey and his friends had 
     <lb/>
     to start an agitation in the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario among people who were more in<lb break="no"/>terested in the matter than the people di<lb break="no"/>rectly concerned. It is true, Mr. Haultain 
     <lb/>
     told us some time ago that so far as he 
     <lb/>
     was concerned, he had no objection to sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools—that if he were a dictator 
     <lb/>
     there, he would not think of abolishing 
     <lb/>
     them. I am told that the draft clause in 
     <lb/>
     the Bill which he submitted two years ago 
     <lb/>
     is very much on the lines of section 16 of 
     <lb/>
     this Bill. It is true, he has changed his 
     <lb/>
     mind about that.

     <lb/>
     by the letter which he has addressed to 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister. Is it not true, Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, that this agitation has been con 
     <lb/>
     fined almost exclusively to the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive press and to gentlemen who belong to 
     <lb/>
     the Conservative party ? With the excep<lb break="no"/>tion of a few misguided or misinformed or

     <lb/>
     carried on—

     <lb/>
     almost exclusively by the Conservatives of 
     <lb/>
     this province. And is it not extraordinary, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Speaker, how much religion people 
     <lb/>
     who, up to a certain moment, are known 
     <lb/>
     to have no religion at all, can develop on 
     <lb/>
     occasion ? It is perfectly extraordinary 
     <lb/>
     how much religion has been developed in 
     <lb/>
     this province within the last few weeks. It 
     <lb/>
     is extraordinary how much religion has 
     <lb/>
     been professed by people who have consti<lb break="no"/>tuted themselves the doughty champions 
     <lb/>
     of a faith which nobody attacks, and which 
     <lb/>
     certainly is in no danger.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I hope the hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman will direct my attention to that 
     <lb/>
     clause He has charged Mr. Haultain, who 
     <lb/>
     is not here, with having changed his mind, 
     <lb/>
     and I would like to see the clause he refers 
     <lb/>
     to. There was a clause like section 2 and 
     <lb/>
     one like section 15, but I do not recollect 
     <lb/>
     any like section 16. I am positive as to 
     <lb/>
     that. I think it would be only fair for the

     Mr. Haultain, in submitting to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment a draft of the Bill providing for auto<lb break="no"/>nomy, submitted a clause which virtually

     they have been by hon. gentlemen opposite

     storm still greater, some very great mater<lb break="no"/>ial, political benefit would be the re<lb break="no"/>sult. They succeeded in getting their

     Was very undecided as to the position he

     remarks to which I was referring. He said 
     <lb/>
     that I was induced by pressure to take a 
     <lb/>
     course which I at first hesitated about. 
     <lb/>
     Naturally I looked into the constitutional 
     <lb/>
     question and made up my mind about that 
     <lb/>
     at the earliest possible moment, because it 
     <lb/>
     was upon that question alone that the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman relied in introducing the 
     <lb/>
     Bill. But when he suggests that pressure 
     <lb/>
     was put upon me by any hon. gentleman on 
     <lb/>
     this side to take one course or the other, 
     <lb/>
     or by any one outside the House,—with the

     exception of letters, sometimes anonymous 
     <lb/>
     sometimes otherwise, which came to me 
     <lb/>
     from both sides and to which I paid no 
     <lb/>
     more attention than such communications 
     <lb/>
     deserve—apart from these no pressure was 
     <lb/>
     put upon me. It has been often stated in 
     <lb/>
     the press which supports the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, and with which he is connected, that 
     <lb/>
     pressure had been put upon me by my con<lb break="no"/>stituents in Carleton. That statement is 
     <lb/>
     absolutely false. Not one of my constitu<lb break="no"/>ents, I am glad to say, ever communicated 
     <lb/>
     with me, verbally or otherwise, with regard 
     <lb/>
     to this matter up to the time I spoke in 
     <lb/>
     this House.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I accept unreservedly 
     <lb/>
     the statement of my hon. friend, but I had 
     <lb/>
     thought-and I think every member in this 
     <lb/>
     House will agree with me that it was a 
     <lb/>
     very legitimate thought—that the leader of 
     <lb/>
     one of the great parties in this House, in a 
     <lb/>
     matter of this kind, would naturally con<lb break="no"/>sult with his supporters and followers and 
     <lb/>
     be, to a very large extent, guided by their 
     <lb/>
     opinions. If he has not consulted the wishes 
     <lb/>
     of the people with whom he is associated 
     <lb/>
     on that subject, if he has not consulted the 
     <lb/>
     wishes of the county of Carleton which he 
     <lb/>
     represents, he is entitled to make the state<lb break="no"/>ment he has. But I thought it was only 
     <lb/>
     natural that he would consult his followers 
     <lb/>
     and the constituency he represents.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. My hon. friend per<lb break="no"/>sists in his personal allusions. I say again 
     <lb/>
     that I did not think it was a question upon 
     <lb/>
     which I should consult my constituents or 
     <lb/>
     upon which I was bound to consult them. 
     <lb/>
     At all events that is a matter for me to 
     <lb/>
     judge and not the hon. gentleman. It is 
     <lb/>
     really a matter with which he has no call 
     <lb/>
     to interfere. I do not know that I ever 
     <lb/>
     constituted him the censor of my mode of

     dealing with my constituents nor have I 
     <lb/>
     heard that they have ever given him any 
     <lb/>
     mandate to represent them. So far as my 
     <lb/>
     own friends are concerned, none of them 
     <lb/>
     knew what course I was going to take on 
     <lb/>
     this Bill, as far as I am aware. I an<lb break="no"/>nounced it in caucus the day before I spoke 
     <lb/>
     in this House, and I did not announce it 
     <lb/>
     as a matter on which they should dictate 
     <lb/>
     to me but as a matter on which I had made 
     <lb/>
     up my mind, and I spoke in the House in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the position I then took.

     rules. I am surprised to find that they

     should have caused so much trouble and

     anxiety to hon. gentlemen opposite. I ac<lb break="no"/>cept the statement of the leader of the oppo<lb break="no"/>sition that he did not consult anybody, 
     <lb/>
     either his followers in the House or his 
     <lb/>
     constituents. But there is a very shrewd 
     <lb/>
     suspicion on this side that in taking the 
     <lb/>
     course he did, he took the lines indicated 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. gentlemen who follow him, whe<lb break="no"/>ther he consulted them or not There is 
     <lb/>
     a very shrewd suspicion that the game he 
     <lb/>
     is playing to-day is that which the gentle<lb break="no"/>men who sit behind him have set for him, 
     <lb/>
     that he is following the pace they set for 
     <lb/>
     him, and that, not with a great deal of 
     <lb/>
     relish, it is evident, but still bravely enough, 
     <lb/>
     he is trying to keep ahead of the procession 
     <lb/>
     which these gentlemen have organized. He 
     <lb/>
     realized at the outset that in doing so he 
     <lb/>
     was going to alienate a great many of his 
     <lb/>
     friends in the province of Quebec. He rea<lb break="no"/>lized that the course he was inspired to 
     <lb/>
     take was going to alienate his friends in 
     <lb/>
     the province, and he tried to make up for 
     <lb/>
     it by paying them compliments. They 
     <lb/>
     asked him for bread and he gave them a 
     <lb/>
     stone. They asked him for bread, and he 
     <lb/>
     gave them petrified bouquets. I wonder 
     <lb/>
     if the hon. gentleman deceived himself to 
     <lb/>
     the extent of believing that any one in the 
     <lb/>
     province of Quebec is to be hoodwinked by 
     <lb/>
     these empty and sonorous compliments. If 
     <lb/>
     he did, he had a very prompt, rude and sad 
     <lb/>
     awakening. Within a few hours from the 
     <lb/>
     time he delivered his speech, the most ac<lb break="no"/>credited and influential of his lieutenants 
     <lb/>
     was on his feet, and in a remarkable speech 
     <lb/>
     destroyed to atoms the speech which his 
     <lb/>
     leader had so laboriously prepared and so 
     <lb/>
     laboriously delivered. The example set by 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier 
     <lb/>(Mr. Monk)—and I hope my hon. friend 
     <lb/>will permit me to pay him the com<lb break="no"/>pliment of saying that he rose to a very 
     <lb/>high ideal and made a most remarkable 
     <lb/>speech—was followed to-day by my hon. 
     <lb/>friend from Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), 
     <lb/>who told us that he also, like his colleague 
     <lb/>from Jacques Cartier, was going to vote 
     <lb/>against the amendment of his leader. He 
     <lb/>must realize to-day that the course he has 
     <lb/>taken with or without consultation with his 
     <lb/>followers has broken the ranks of his own 
     <lb/>party. He must realize to-day that, whe<lb break="no"/>ther he intended it or not, his action on 
     <lb/>this question is a boomerang, and that 
     <lb/>while the ranks of the opposition to-day 
     <lb/>are divided, the ranks of the Liberal party 
     <lb/>present an unbroken front. When the 
     <lb/>vote is taken on this question there will be 
     <lb/>given for the Bill the largest majority that 
     <lb/>was ever given in this parliament on a great 
     <lb/>question.

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, I have spoken much longer 
     <lb/>
     than I intended to. But I think that if the 
     <lb/>
      interruptions with which I have been favour<lb break="no"/>ed were taken out of my speech—

     <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Now, Mr. Speaker,          
     <lb/>
     what is the lesson that stands out most         
     <lb/>
     clearly in this controversy? Is it not the        
     <lb/>
     lesson that in this country appeals to race    
     <lb/>
     and religious prejudice, to passion, to in<lb break="no"/>tolerance, though they may yield some tem<lb break="no"/>porary advantage, yet, in the long run, are     
     <lb/>
     bound to re-act against those who resort to         
     <lb/>
     them ? Is it not the lesson that in this         
     <lb/>
     couintry government is possible only by        
     <lb/>
     tolerance, by conciliation, by fair and hon<lb break="no"/>ourable compromise ? To this policy the         
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier)         
     <lb/>
     who leads this House, early in his public         
     <lb/>
     career, devoted himself; to this policy he        
     <lb/>
     has steadfastly adhered ; and of this policy          
     <lb/>
     he is the most distinguished and successful          
     <lb/>
     exponent in this country. His faithful de<lb break="no"/>votion to this ideal, and his masterly appli<lb break="no"/>cation of the principle have made him the        
     <lb/>
     beloved and idolized leader of his party and         
     <lb/>
     have won for him the respect and admira<lb break="no"/>tion of all Canadians, including, I believe,         
     <lb/>
     his opponents, and have won for him no less           
     <lb/>
     the respect and admiration of the whole Bri<lb break="no"/>tish empire. Before I close, I would like to         
     <lb/>
     quote to the House a passage taken from          
     <lb/>
     one of Burke's immortal speeches, covering,           
     <lb/>
     to my mind, a most significant and pregnant        
     <lb/>
     statement of the present situation in Can<lb break="no"/>ada:         
     <lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. R. S. LAKE</persName> (Qu'Appelle). Mr. 
     <lb/>Speaker, it has been said on several occa<lb break="no"/>sions lately that this House is now dealing<lb/>with the most important question that has <lb/>ever come before it. May I go a little furth<lb break="no"/>er and say that this is a great occasion in<lb/>the history of the British colonial empire?<lb/>Britain's greatest colony is proposing to <lb/>give a constitution to one of her own colo<lb break="no"/>nies. And, while I do not presume that<lb/>there is any analogy between the pow<lb break="no"/>ers which the mother country exer<lb break="no"/>cises in relation to her Crown colonies and<lb/>the powers exercised by the Dominion in re<lb break="no"/>lation to the Northwest, still there is suffi<lb break="no"/>cient resemblance between the two to make<lb/>it a matter of interst to observe the spirit<lb/>in which Canada deals with her colony as <lb/>compared with the spirit which has been<lb/>shown by the mother country in dealing<lb/>with her colonies, and with Canada herself<lb/>especially. I ask that the same spirit which<lb/>has been shown by the mother country in<lb/>dealing with Canada shall be shown by Can<lb break="no"/>ada in dealing with her own colonies. I am<lb/>afraid, Mr. Speaker, the exhibitiion which<lb/>we have seen to-night takes away a good<lb/>deal of the hope which I might have cherish<lb break="no"/>ed. I hope we may calm down a little as<lb/>this discussion proceeds. What we are do<lb break="no"/>ing is being watched outside of Canada,<lb/>and will have an influence far beyond our <lb/>boundaries. I desire to acknowledge in a <lb/>few words the welcome which the hon.<lb/>member for Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) extend<lb break="no"/>ed to the new provinces on joining the Can<lb break="no"/>adian family circle. But I would remind<lb/>him that the Territories are full-grown, and<lb/>as such they feel themselves entitled to the<lb/>full rights of manhood. If they are denied<lb/>these rights, the relations within the family<lb/>circle will be exceedingly unsatisfactory.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I am afraid I must spend some little<lb/>time in going back into the history of this<lb/>question. The matter which we have now<lb/>before us was first brought prominently to<lb/>the front on May 2nd, 1900. The first step<lb/>in the movement was taken in the legisla<lb break="no"/>tive assembly of the Northwest Territories<lb/>on that day, when a memorial was addressed <lb/>to the Governor General in Council asking <lb/>that this matter be dealt with. In Novem<lb break="no"/>ber of that same year a Dominion general <lb/>election was held. In December, 1901, at<lb/>the invitation of the Dominion government, <lb/>a conference took place between a sub-com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the Privy Council and the repre<lb break="no"/>

     sentatives of the Northwest Territories. Af<lb break="no"/>ter the conference a draft Bill, setting forth 
     <lb/>
     in detail the terms and conditions on which 
     <lb/>
     the Territory would be willing to become 
     <lb/>
     one of the provinces of the Dominion, was 
     <lb/>
     submitted to the Prime Minister. In the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing spring at the next session of the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly that Bill was laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the assembly and unanimously endorsed   
     <lb/>
     by them. The only dissenting voice was in 
     <lb/>
     reference to the question whether there   
     <lb/>
     should be one or two provinces. In regard 
     <lb/>
     to every other detail the Bill was endorsed 
     <lb/>
     with unanimity. On the 21st of May, 1902, 
     <lb/>
     a general election was held throughout the 
     <lb/>
     Territories and the question of autonomy 
     <lb/>
     was the main issue in that election. The 
     <lb/>
     Bill was distributed throughout the whole 
     <lb/>
     country and an appeal was made to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple by the premier and by other gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who were supporting him in that election 
     <lb/>
     in these words : 'These are the matters up<lb break="no"/>on which your judgment is invited. The 
     <lb/>
     issue is plain: it is for the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories to decide.'   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The people of the Territories did decide 
     <lb/>
     by returning Mr. Haultain to power by an 
     <lb/>
     overwhelming majority. In spite of this 
     <lb/>
     fact a great many excuses were made by 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion government for delay in deal<lb break="no"/>ing with the question. Two more sessions 
     <lb/>
     of the legislative assembly were held and 
     <lb/>
     in each one of these sessions a resolution 
     <lb/>
     demanding that this question be taken up 
     <lb/>
     was passed unanimously, being voted for 
     <lb/>
     by both Liberals and Conservatives. There 
     <lb/>
     was no dissentient voice on either occasion, 
     <lb/>
     but still the matter was not taken up by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government. During the session 
     <lb/>
     of 1904, when it was again probable that 
     <lb/>
     the demand would be repeated, we suddenly 
     <lb/>
     received the well known letter from the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister in which he made his prom<lb break="no"/>ise that if he was returned to power he 
     <lb/>
     would deal with the matter at the present 
     <lb/>
     session of parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have indulged in this history in order 
     <lb/>
     to show that the government of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories had a definite and full mandate from 
     <lb/>
     the people of that country as to the terms 
     <lb/>
     which they should ask to be granted to the 
     <lb/>
     Territories when they became full-fledged 
     <lb/>
     provinces. The government of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories were invited, as you know, Sir, to a 
     <lb/>
     series of conferences by the right hon. the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister during the first few weeks 
     <lb/>
     of the present year. The premier of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories and a member of his executive 
     <lb/>
     council attended the meeting. I wish to say 
     <lb/>
     here that as far as my information goes, 
     <lb/>
     there was no change in the conditions which 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Haultain demanded from the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister from those which he had been au<lb break="no"/>thorized to demand by the people and the 
     <lb/>
     legislative assembly of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. I believe that he departed from 
     <lb/>
     them in no single particular; and I think 
     <lb/>
     the protest that he addressed to the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. Prime Minister after the introduction 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3533</fw>
     <fw type="num">3534</fw>


     of the Bill is a proof of that fact. But, what 
     <lb/>
     did we find? We found that after this con<lb break="no"/>ference the Bill which was introduced dif<lb break="no"/>fered in most essential points from the re<lb break="no"/>quest of the Northwest Territories, that it 
     <lb/>
     was, in fact. in many respects absolutely 
     <lb/>
     contrary to the wishes of the people. In 
     <lb/>
     consequence of this difference a strong re<lb break="no"/>monstrance was made by the premier of the 
     <lb/>
    Territories which was couched in dignified 
     <lb/>and determined terms. Because it was not 
     <lb/>signed by the other member of the execu<lb break="no"/>tive council, it was stated by the hon. Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) that it was 
     <lb/>only Mr. Haultain's individual opinion. The 
     <lb/>hon. Minister of Finance said that if it was 
     <lb/>the case that we were doing something 
     <lb/>against the wishes of the people of the 
     <lb/>Northwest the government of the Northwest 
     <lb/>had entered no protest. I should like to ask 
     <lb/>what warrant had he for any such state<lb break="no"/>ment?   All we have heard is that Mr. Bul<lb break="no"/>yea expressed a different opinion to that of 
     <lb/>Mr. Haultain in an interview which he 
     <lb/>supposed to have given to the 
     <lb/>'Globe' directly after the introduction 
     <lb/>of the Bill. I am told that Mr. Bul<lb break="no"/>yea denies having given that interview. 
     <lb/>At any rate, whether it was so or not, Mr. 
     <lb/>Bulyea is remaining in the government of 
     <lb/>Mr. Haultain. It is inconceivable that 
     <lb/>if he disagrees with his colleagues on such 
     <lb/>an important matter as this, he should con<lb break="no"/>tinue to remain member of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I say, Mr. Speaker, that his actions 
     <lb/>count for far more in this particular than 
     <lb/>anything that he may have said in any sup<lb break="no"/>posed newspaper interview. It is juggling 
     <lb/>with words to assert that when the premier 
     <lb/>of a government protests it is only the pro<lb break="no"/>test of an individual. As a matter of fact, 
     <lb/>Mr. Bulyea had just the same mandate that 
     <lb/>Mr. Haultain had from the people of the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories. That mandate was 
     <lb/>too clear for it to have been possible for him 
     <lb/>to have taken any position other than one in 
     <lb/>accordance with the views of his leader and 
     <lb/>the fact remains, that he is still a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of Mr. Haultain's government. I have 
     <lb/>also gone into this history to show that two 
     <lb/>Dominion general elections have been held 
     <lb/>since this matter was placed before the 
     <lb/>Dominion government. The government 
     <lb/>refused to act or define their policy in any 
     <lb/>particular during the whole lifetime of one 
     <lb/>parliament. More than that, when another 
     <lb/>appeal to the people became imminent they 
     <lb/>refused to define their policy before the elec<lb break="no"/>tions. Although they had had the draft pro<lb break="no"/>positions before them for three years they 
     <lb/>were not prepared to declare themselves in 
     <lb/>any respect. The hon ex-Minister of the 
     <lb/>Interior (Mr. Sifton) went into the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories and when he was questioned 
     <lb/>in regard to this matter he refused to com<lb break="no"/>mit himself except on one point which I 
     <lb/>shall mention just now, but on all the main 
     <lb/>points in connection with the draft Bill 
     <lb/>he refused to commit himself. We were

     all told in the Northwest Territories—I 
     <lb/>
     heard it myself on many platforms—that the 
     <lb/>
     proper thing for us to do was to trust the 
     <lb/>
     Liberal party, that with their record in the 
     <lb/>
     past they would be sure to give us fair and 
     <lb/>
     liberal terms. We have been told quite re<lb break="no"/>cently and told triumphantly that the seven 
     <lb/>
     Liberal members of parliament who come 
     <lb/>
     from the Northwest Territories would sup<lb break="no"/>port the Bill in its present form. If so, 
     <lb/>
     then I think it must be due to a sudden 
     <lb/>
     change of opinion on the part of at least two 
     <lb/>
     of those members. The two hon. members 
     <lb/>
     who were in the last parliament.  They 
     <lb/>
     have put themselves definitely on record in 
     <lb/>
     regard to this matter. I refer to the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) and to 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member for West Assiniboia (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Scott). The hon. member for Edmonton, on 
     <lb/>
     the 13th of October, 1903, said this: 
     <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     I said in this House last session, and I take 
     <lb/>
     the liberty of repeating it, that if the House 
     <lb/>
     will give the Northwest Territories the terms 
     <lb/>
     asked for in the draft Bill contained in these 
     <lb/>
     papers, I will certainly support it most strong<lb break="no"/>ly. We will support it. These are the terms 
     <lb/>
     we want. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>
     That statement was placed on record. 
     <lb/>
     Then the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     a couple of years previously had placed 
     <lb/>
     himself on record as asking very similar 
     <lb/>
     terms to those which were subsequently 
     <lb/>
     comprised in the draft Bill which was sub<lb break="no"/>mitted by the Northwest Territories. There<lb break="no"/>fore, I hold, Mr. Speaker, that it these two 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentlemen, at any rate, from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, had any mandate from 
     <lb/>
     their constituents in that country, that man<lb break="no"/>date would certainly be in the terms in 
     <lb/>
     which they had placed themselves on record 
     <lb/>
     in their public utterances. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I regret that after having for years 
     <lb/>
     advocated the granting of provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy to the Northwest Territoriees, I am 
     <lb/>
     unable to welcome the measure which has 
     <lb/>
     just been introduced. It does not contain 
     <lb/>
     the 'fair and just terms' for which the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories ask and it does not give 
     <lb/>
     'complete and absolute autonomy' such as we 
     <lb/>
     were promised by the Prime Minister. It 
     <lb/>
     creates two new provinces of an inferior 
     <lb/>
     type and of a lower grade than the other 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion of Canada, and I 
     <lb/>
     contend that the people of the Territories 
     <lb/>
     are justified in their demand to be placed on 
     <lb/>
     the same level as is occupied by the other 
     <lb/>
     province especially as they have a popula<lb break="no"/>tion larger at the present moment than the 
     <lb/>
     populations of four of the seven existing 
     <lb/>
     provinces of the Dominion. Their disap<lb break="no"/>proval of the Bill which has been introduced 
     <lb/>
     has been amply proved by the great number 
     <lb/>
     of protests which they have made and which 
     <lb/>
     have been placed before this House. I am 
     <lb/>
     sorry that there are two provinces instead 
     <lb/>
     of one. The assembly of the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories was strongly in favour of having 
     <lb/>
     only one province for the whole of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. They had voted on that question and 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2525</fw>
     <fw type="num">3536</fw>
         

     had endorsed that position by a large ma<lb break="no"/>jority. The whole country had given their 
     <lb/>
     opinion on it when they voted as they did 
     <lb/>
     at the general elections to which I have 
     <lb/>
     referred. The late Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Sifton) committed himself on only one 
     <lb/>
     particular point and that was with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the matter of one or more provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Although I was not present at the time I 
     <lb/>
     am told on credible authority that both 
     <lb/>
     at Regina and Indian Head he stated that 
     <lb/>
     he was in favour of one province. The 
     <lb/>
     Solicitor General (Mr. Lemieux) has given 
     <lb/>
     the reasons why apparently the government 
     <lb/>
     considered it would be undesirable to make 
     <lb/>
     the whole of the territories into one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. He was afraid that the progress 
     <lb/>
     and the prosperity of one large province 
     <lb/>
     would become such that the influence of that 
     <lb/>
     province upon the rest of Canada would be 
     <lb/>
     too great. I regret also to see the name of 
     <lb/>
     Assiniboia disappear from the map. The 
     <lb/>
     most thickly settled portion of the eastern 
     <lb/>
     province, has borne that name for a long 
     <lb/>
     time past. The magnificent wheat produc<lb break="no"/>ing fields of that district have made the 
     <lb/>
     name famous in the great markets of the 
     <lb/>
     world. Assiniboia contains the largest por<lb break="no"/>tion of the population of the eastern pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and therefore I think when a choice 
     <lb/>
     of names was being made Assiniboia should 
     <lb/>
     have been retained. No matter what the 
     <lb/>
     opinion may be as to whether it was a good 
     <lb/>
     name to choose in the first instance, it was 
     <lb/>
     sanctioned by usage, and should have been 
     <lb/>
    preserved rather than the name Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     However, there are other and greater 
     <lb/>
     questions than these involved in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     and I shall leave these minor points and 
     <lb/>
     proceed to deal with two or three of the 
     <lb/>
     main points at issue, as shortly as I pos<lb break="no"/>sibly can. I shall take up for a few min<lb break="no"/>utes the limitation of the powers of tax<lb break="no"/>ation which are being imposed on the 
     <lb/>
     people of the new provinces in these Bills— 
     <lb/>
     I refer of course to the question of the 
     <lb/>
     exemption of the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     from taxation. One would imagine from 
     <lb/>
     what one constantly hears in this country 
     <lb/>
     that the Canadian Pacific Railway had been 
     <lb/>
     built in order to open up the Northwest and 
     <lb/>
     that therefore the Northwest should pay 
     <lb/>
     for the Canadian Pacific Railway. But was 
     <lb/>
     that the case? Let us turn back for a 
     <lb/>
     few moments to the Quebec resolutions. 
     <lb/>
     Section 69 reads as follows: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     The communications with the Northwestern 
     <lb/>
     Territory, and the improvements required for 
     <lb/>
     the development of the trade of the great west 
     <lb/>
     with the sea-board, are regarded by this confer<lb break="no"/>ence as subjects of the highest importance to 
     <lb/>
     the federated provinces, and shall be prosecuted 
     <lb/>
     at the earliest possible period that the state of 
     <lb/>
     the finances will permit. 
     <lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     That is to say this question of building 
     <lb/>
     a railway into the west was looked upon 
     <lb/>
     as a subject of the highest importance to 


            <pb n="3537" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3537.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3537</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 30, 1905</fw> 
  

     the federated provinces. It was to open up 
     <lb/>
     channels for the trade of the east. That was 
     <lb/>
     the first reason for the building of the 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway. The later and 
     <lb/>
     perhaps the most cogent reason was that 
     <lb/>
     it was absolutely imperative. if faith was 
     <lb/>
     to be kept with British Columbia, that a rail<lb break="no"/>way should be built across the continent. 
     <lb/>
     A confract was made by the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with the Canadian Pacific Railway 
     <lb/>
     and the consideration on the part of Canada 
     <lb/>
     included a grant of money, a grant of land 
     <lb/>
     and exemption from taxation. The North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are today paying their 
     <lb/>
     share of the interest on that money grant 
     <lb/>
     so we will wipe that question away. How<lb break="no"/>ever in addition to that which is imposed on 
     <lb/>
     them in common with the rest of Canada 
     <lb/>
     they are contributing a land grant not only 
     <lb/>
     for that portion of the line which was built 
     <lb/>
     in the Territories, but also for that portion 
     <lb/>
     which was built in British Columbia and 
     <lb/>
     for a part of the line which was built in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and in Manitoba. Now, Sir, that is 
     <lb/>
     a great burden upon the country. The 
     <lb/>
     result of it is that millions of money which 
     <lb/>
     have been made in that country and which 
     <lb/>
     should be kept in the country to develop its 
     <lb/>
     resources are being sent out in payment for 
     <lb/>
     the lands. We have claimed compensation 
     <lb/>
     in the draft Bill for such lands as were 
     <lb/>
     alienated by the Dominion Government for 
     <lb/>
     purely Dominion purposes. Our demand in 
     <lb/>
     that respect has apparently not received 
     <lb/>
     consideration and all I desire at this mo<lb break="no"/>ment is simply to mention the fact and to 
     <lb/>
     enter my protest because it has not been 
     <lb/>
     considered. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To turn to the third consideration for 
     <lb/>
     the building of the Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way. The exemption from taxation is a 
     <lb/>
     very unjust burden and it falls entirely on 
     <lb/>
     the shoulders of the new provinces. It is 
     <lb/>
     an unjust burden which was incurred for 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the whole of Canada, and 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion should relieve us from it. The 
     <lb/>
     Dominion parliament made the contract and 
     <lb/>
     incurred the obligation. There was no pro<lb break="no"/>vincial legislature at the time ; if there had 
     <lb/>
     been one in existence I do not suppose it 
     <lb/>
     would have been possible that such a con<lb break="no"/>tract would have been made. A very 
     <lb/>
     strong point was made in the argu<lb break="no"/>ment which accompanied the draft Bill in 
     <lb/>
     this respect. It was urged in the strongest 
     <lb/>
     terms that this unjust burden should be 
     <lb/>
     removed from the shoulders of the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces. In the teeth of this protest we 
     <lb/>
     find that it is actually proposed in this Bill 
     <lb/>
     to rivet the burden on the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     as part of their constitution. I can see no 
     <lb/>
     possible reason for such action as that, 
     <lb/>
     and I enter against it my strongest protest. 
     <lb/>
     I hope that when this Bill comes to the 
     <lb/>
     committee stage the government will see 
     <lb/>
     fit to withdraw that particular clause. 
     <lb/>
     When this exemption was being discussed 
     <lb/>
     in parliament some two or three years ago, 

<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3537</fw>
     <fw type="num">3538</fw>

     and when the leader of the opposition made 
     <lb/>
     a proposal that certain steps should be 
     <lb/>
     taken which-would remove this burden 
     <lb/>
     from the Territories and place it where it 
     <lb/>
     properly belonged, the Prime Minister, at 
     <lb/>
     all events by implication, gave some sort 
     <lb/>
     of hope to the Territories, when he used 
     <lb/>
     this language: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     All this shows how absolutely essential it is 
     <lb/>
     that the question should be referred to the

     courts; that we should have an authoritative 
     <lb/>
     decision as to the meaning of the law before 
     <lb/>
     We can take any public action in the way of 
     <lb/>

     The right hon. gentleman evidently ad<lb break="no"/>mits here that the settlers of the Northwest

     <lb/>
     that he will give it serious consideration. 
     <lb/>
     We have also a statement made by the mem<lb break="no"/>ber for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) on the

     20th of October, 1903, when he said:

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     Let me say that in face of the position of this 
     <lb/>
     Canadian Pacific Railway tax matter, in view 
     <lb/>
     of the millions of acres of land that are in<lb break="no"/>volved and the millions in value of railway 
     <lb/>
     property of the company that are involved, it 
     <lb/>
     appears to me that the people of the Northwest

     would be simply crazy at present to accept

    autonomy unless driven to it as a last resort.

            <p>
     That was the opinion of the member for 
     <lb/>
     West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) not so very 
     <lb/>
     long ago, and yet we are to-day told in 
     <lb/>
     triumphant tones that the seven Liberal 
     <lb/>
     members from the Northwest are behind 
     <lb/>
     the government in support of this Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Let me deal for a moment with the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the public domain. The Bill pro<lb break="no"/>poses that the lands, mines and minerals 
     <lb/>
     and timbers are to be retained by the 
     <lb/>
     Dominion government and not placed under 
     <lb/>
     the juriSdiction of the new provinces. 
     <lb/>
     If gentlemen on the other side of the 
     <lb/>
     House have their will in respect to this 
     <lb/>
     Bill, that is what will occur. Well. Sir. 
     <lb/>
     we claim that we have just as much 
     <lb/>
     right as any other province in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion of Canada to the full possession 
     <lb/>
     of our lands. I was very glad to see that 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister had dropped the old 
     <lb/>
     stock argument that Canada had purchased 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories. and therefore 
     <lb/>
     that the federal authority could deal with 
     <lb/>
     these Territories just as it liked. There 
     <lb/>
     were very cogent reasons for the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman dropping that argument, but I 
     <lb/>
     was surprised to hear the Solicitor General 
     <lb/>
     revive it and in doing so he must have 
     <lb/>
     been oblivious to some circumstances which 
     <lb/>
     have occurred within the last few years. 
     <lb/>
     In reply to the Solicitor General's statement 
     <lb/>
     that the acquirement of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories had not been profitable to the Dom<lb break="no"/>
        

            <pb n="3539" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3539.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3539</fw>  

inion, I beg to tell him that the profits from 
     <lb/>
     that investment have already been suffi<lb break="no"/>cient, and more than sufficient to pay the 
     <lb/>
     entire claim of the Hudson Bay Company. 
     <lb/>
     Probably the reason which has caused gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen opposite to drop the old argument 
     <lb/>
     as to the purchase of the Territories, is the 
     <lb/>
     grant within recent years of 116,550 square 
     <lb/>
     miles of the same territory to the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec. More than that, the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister now is proposing to make free gifts 
     <lb/>
     of the same territory to Quebec, Ontario, 
     <lb/>
     the new province of Saskatchewan, and 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, although in the case of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, it 
     <lb/>
     would not be a gift but simply a request 
     <lb/>
     that they should administer the territory. 
     <lb/>
     The old argument that this territory be<lb break="no"/>longs to the whole Dominion must have been 
     <lb/>
     abandoned by the present government, or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise they would have no warrant for 
     <lb/>
     making these free gifts to the old provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Prime Minister has appealed to the 
     <lb/>
     precedent of Manitoba as a reason for with<lb break="no"/>holding the public domain from the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. but he deliberately disregarded that 
     <lb/>
     precedent in 1898 when he had a Bill passed 
     <lb/>
     through parliament giving to the province 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec a vast area, nearly one-half the 
     <lb/>
     size of one of the new provinces. If there 
     <lb/>
     is any doubt as to the statement I have 
     <lb/>
     made, I would like to lay before the House 
     <lb/>
     a few extracts from an Order in Council of 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec government dated the 24th of 
     <lb/>
     April, 1898, upon which the legislation 
     <lb/>
     was subsequently framed. Attached to 
     <lb/>
     this Order in Council is a report from Mr. 
     <lb/>
     E. H. Taché, assistant Commissioner of 
     <lb/>
     Crown Lands, who, after discussing the 
     <lb/>
     question as to the province of Quebec mak<lb break="no"/>ing a demand for that portion of the coast 
     <lb/>
     of Labador which is under the jurisdiction 
     <lb/>
     of Newfoundland, goes on to say :

     of Quebec. I think it was a perfectly cor<lb break="no"/>rect policy ; I believe that the province of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec could administer that territory far 
     <lb/>
     more satisfactorily than it could possibly 
     <lb/>
     be administered from Ottawa. Some day 
     <lb/>
     there may be a great rush of people into 
     <lb/>
     that country for all we know, and then I am 
     <lb/>
     quite certain that the provincial manage<lb break="no"/>ment will be more satisfactory to these 
     <lb/>
     people than could possibly be the manage<lb break="no"/>ment of the more distant central govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Ottawa. But, Sir, this incident 
     <lb/>forms a precendent set by the Prime Mini<lb break="no"/>ster himself, which surely he ought to fol<lb break="no"/>low in this case of the new provinces. I am 
     <lb/>afraid, however, that what is sauce for the 
     <lb/>goose in this case is not considered sauce 
     <lb/>for the gander. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Now, I would like to ask whether there 
     <lb/>
     is any similarity whatever between the 
     <lb/>
     conditions which prevailed in Manitoba in 
     <lb/>
     the year 1870, when Manitoba became a 
     <lb/>
     province of this Dominion, and the condi<lb break="no"/>tions of the Territories in this year 1905. If 
     <lb/>
     there is no similarity whatever in condi<lb break="no"/>tions, there can be no precedent. At that 
     <lb/>
     time Manitoba was under the paternal gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Hudson Bay Company. In 
     <lb/>
     the debates of 1870, you will find the opin<lb break="no"/>ion expressed that the people of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     were scarcely fit for a provincial form of 
     <lb/>
     government. A doubt was expressed as 
     <lb/>
     to the 'fitness of a people just emerging 
     <lb/>
     from the conditions of serfdom'—that was 
     <lb/>
     one of the phrases used. They were also 
     <lb/>
     referred to as an ignorant people. They 
     <lb/>
     comprised in all some twelve thousand 
     <lb/>
     souls, and they were at that very time in 
     <lb/>
     the throes of rebellion. Is there any sim<lb break="no"/>ilarity whatever in the condition of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     at that time and the present condition of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, who have a 
     <lb/>
     responsible government, a constitution, 
     <lb/>
     limited certainly as to its powers, but one 
     <lb/>
     which they have enjoyed for a great many 
     <lb/>
     years past ; who have carried on a liberal 
     <lb/>
     and progressive government, a government 
     <lb/>
     which is, I think, second to none in any of 
     <lb/>
     the other provinces of the Dominion, and 
     <lb/>
     also with a population, as I have just 
     <lb/>
     stated, larger than that of the majority of 
     <lb/>
     the provinces of the Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Then, if any hon. gentleman will look 
     <lb/>
     through the debates of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons for many years succeeding the forma<lb break="no"/>tion of the province of Manitoba, he will 
     <lb/>
     find that the opinion on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House was always in favour of the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that the public lands in the province 
     <lb/>
     should belong to the province. I have 
     <lb/>
     culled a number of opinions from the great 
     <lb/>
     men of that time—Mr. Mills, Sir John Mac<lb break="no"/>donald, Sir Leonard Tilley, Mr. G. W. Ross, 
     <lb/>
     by all of whom to a greater or less extent 
     <lb/>
     that principle is recognized. The reason 
     <lb/>
     given in nearly every case for withholding 
     <lb/>
     the lands from the province was that it 
     <lb/>
     would not pay the province to hold them— 
     <lb/>
     that the administration of the lands would

     cost more than the province would ever be 
     <lb/>
     able to make out of them. That is the reason 
     <lb/>
     which was given for a great many years. 
     <lb/>
     But a change came over the scene in 1885, 
     <lb/>
     or a little previous to that, when it was 
     <lb/>
     discovered that the lands had an exception<lb break="no"/>al value. The Prime Minister, in stating his 
     <lb/>
     main reason for withholding the public 
     <lb/>
     lands from the new provinces, quoted from 
     <lb/>
     an Order in Council of the year 1885 ; but 
     <lb/>
     he did not quote the main reasons which 
     <lb/>
     were given in that Order in Council by the 
     <lb/>
     Conservative administration of the day for 
     <lb/>
     withholding the public lands from the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. He only quoted a 
     <lb/>
     consideration which 'had much weight' 
     <lb/>
     with the sub-committee after three or 
     <lb/>
     four of the main reasons had been stated, 
     <lb/>
     that consideration being that it would be 
     <lb/>
     advisable in the interests of immigration 
     <lb/>
     that the Dominion government should con<lb break="no"/>tinue to hold the public lands in its own 
     <lb/>
     hands. Now, to my mind that is a very 
     <lb/>
     unsound argument. The Immigration De<lb break="no"/>partment is for the whole of Canada—for 
     <lb/>
     all the provinces, and for no one more than 
     <lb/>
     another. It may happen, and it does hap<lb break="no"/>pen, that the province of Manitoba and the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories are the most attrac<lb break="no"/>tive field for immigrants to-day ; but to<lb break="no"/>morrow it may be Ontario or Quebec or 
     <lb/>
     British Columbia ; we do not know. As 
     <lb/>
     a matter of fact, we find that the Immi<lb break="no"/>gration Department is working hard in the 
     <lb/>
     interest of the other provinces of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, just as hard, I imagine, as it is for 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories. Here is an ex<lb break="no"/>tract from the report of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior with reference to the immigration 
     <lb/>
     into Ontario : 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     In order to relieve to some extent the situ<lb break="no"/>ation in the province of Ontario, where there 
     <lb/>
     has been such a great dearth of labour, the de<lb break="no"/>partment took steps early in the year to direct 
     <lb/>
     its agents in the old land to divert as much as 
     <lb/>
     possible the farm labouring classes to that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The result of this has been that some 
     <lb/>
     thousands of labourers who perhaps would have 
     <lb/>
     gone to western Canada were induced to remain 
     <lb/>
     over in Ontario, all of whom were immediately 
     <lb/>
     distributed by the Ontario bureau amongst 
     <lb/>
     farmers throughout the country. It has been 
     <lb/>
     found almost impracticable to divert much of 
     <lb/>
     the foreign population, even of the farm labour<lb break="no"/>ing classes, to eastern provinces, many of these 
     <lb/>
     people coming through to meet friends, and, 
     <lb/>
     moreover, nearly all or the farm labourers from 
     <lb/>
     the continent appear to be desirous of securing 
     <lb/>
     lands for themselves first.

     That shows that the Immigration De<lb break="no"/>partment is working for the province of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, and for the other provinces of Can<lb break="no"/>ad just as well as for the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories ; and I do not think it can be said 
     <lb/>
     that any very great inconvenience is caused 
     <lb/>
     to that department by the fact that the 
     <lb/>
     lands of the province of Ontario are in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the government of that province. 
     <lb/>
     Farm labourers and small tenant farmers

     are certainly the very best class of immi<lb break="no"/>grants, and I have no objection to their 
     <lb/>
     being diverted to Ontario to get their first 
     <lb/>
     experience of Canada. But if the lands of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories are to be retained 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the Dominion government, 
     <lb/>
     simply because it wants to apply its immi<lb break="no"/>gration policy to the best advantage, then 
     <lb/>
     it should not divert from those lands any 
     <lb/>
     immigration which is coming out. ButI am 
     <lb/>
     sure that is a position that would be re<lb break="no"/>sented by every other province of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     Every immigrant who comes into this coun<lb break="no"/>try is an asset to the whole Dominion. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I consider that the difficulties which have 
     <lb/>
     been raised are entirely visionary. If the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces were possesed of their own 
     <lb/>
     public lands, they would be the most inter<lb break="no"/>ested of all in encouraging immigration to 
     <lb/>
     come within their bounds. We should have 
     <lb/>
     three local governments all hard at work 
     <lb/>
     trying to bring in immigration, and all com<lb break="no"/>peting with each other for immigration. 
     <lb/>
     More than that, the local government, thor<lb break="no"/>oughly understanding the local conditions, 
     <lb/>
     would be able to make matters so much 
     <lb/>
     more comfortable for the incoming settlers 
     <lb/>
     that they would produce a more contented 
     <lb/>
     class of settlers; and the old saying still 
     <lb/>
     holds good, that the contented settler is the 
     <lb/>
     best immigration agent, and the quotation 
     <lb/>
     which I have just made from the report of 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior goes to prove 
     <lb/>
     it. These people coming in are, a great 
     <lb/>
     many of them, coming to their friends, from 
     <lb/>
     whom they have heard of their great pros<lb break="no"/>perity and who have encouraged them to 
     <lb/>
     come to the country. I contend that the 
     <lb/>
     moral if not the legal right of the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces to the ownership of their public lands 
     <lb/>
     has practically been conceded by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I do not think any doubt has been 
     <lb/>
     seriously raised upon this subject. This 
     <lb/>
     question, as well as the whole question of 
     <lb/>
     provincial powers, was very clearly stated 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for West Assiniboia 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Scott) some four years ago. My hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend sent me a copy of his speech on that 
     <lb/>
     occasion. I concurred then with him in 
     <lb/>
     the position he took, and am very glad to 
     <lb/>
     put on record the second time some of the 
     <lb/>
     opinions which he expressed in that speech, 
     <lb/>
     and which are very similar to those I hold 
     <lb/>
     myself. On the 25th March, 1901, he said :

     and this is really the point to which I wish to

     <lb/>In 1883 Sir Charles Tupper read a statement 
     <lb/>to this House, which showed that the sales 
     <lb/>of land from 1872 to 1880 had been less 
     <lb/>than two million acres, and that the aver<lb break="no"/>age price received was 31 1/2 cents per acre. 
     <lb/>Further on he declared that only 13 cents 
     <lb/>per acre out of this sum had been paid to 
     <lb/>date. Compare the value of the lands in 
     <lb/>these days with their value in the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories to-day. We find that the Canadian 
     <lb/>Pacific Railway lands were selling in Janu<lb break="no"/>ary at an average price of $4.10 per acre 
     <lb/>and the school lands at an average of 
     <lb/>nearly $10 per acre. We also have 
     <lb/>the statement of the First Minister 
     <lb/>that $3 an acre is a very moderate 
     <lb/>rate for land in that country. Therefore, I 
     <lb/>contend there is no comparison whatever be<lb break="no"/>tween the conditions of Manitoba in 1870 
     <lb/>and those of the Territories in 1901. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Coming to the question of the compensa<lb break="no"/>tion offered to the new provinces for the loss 
     <lb/>of their public lands, I would like to ask the 
     <lb/>First Minister what is the basis of that calcu<lb break="no"/>lation? Why have the government selected 
     <lb/>25,000,000 acres out of the 175,000,000 which, 
     <lb/>roughly speaking, will be comprised in each 
     <lb/>of these new provinces, and why have they 
     <lb/>placed a value of only $1.50 per acre on 
     <lb/>these 25,000,000 acres ? Again why do they 
     <lb/>only pay 1 per cent interest at first on those 
     <lb/>lands, and how do they arrive at the grad<lb break="no"/>ual increase in the rate of interest as popula<lb break="no"/>tion increases in that country ? I can only 
     <lb/>suppose that they began to argue the 
     <lb/>question backwards. I would presume that 
     <lb/>their first thought was : How much money 
     <lb/>is the least we can give to the people of 
     <lb/>these provinces ? And having decided upon 
     <lb/>the figure, they began to hunt for 
     <lb/>some method of making it up. The 
     <lb/>whole arrangement seems to me an ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary one. I could not find a word 
     <lb/>to describe it until the Prime Minister sup<lb break="no"/>plied it the other day, when he used the 
     <lb/>word 'ramshackle.' That well characterizes 
     <lb/>the arrangements made in this Bill for com<lb break="no"/>pensation to the provinces for the loss of 
     <lb/>their public lands. It will be noticed that 
     <lb/>compensation is only offered for one- 
     <lb break="yes"/>seventh of the whole area or one-fifth of the 
     <lb/>whole area still undisposed of according to 
     <lb/>a return brought down the other day. Who 
     <lb/>will say that 113,000,000 acres out of these 
     <lb/>138,000,000 still undisposed of in each of 
     <lb/>these provinces are of no value whatever, 
     <lb/>that only 25,000,000 are of any value, and 
     <lb/>that the value of those shall be fixed at 
     <lb/>$1.50 per acre ? Further than that, no con<lb break="no"/>sideration whatever is given for the mines, 
     <lb/>minerals and timber which are being with<lb break="no"/>held from us. As to the fisheries, I do not

know whether they are to be withheld from           
     <lb/>us or not.              
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     With regard to the value of these lands, 
     <lb/>
     in the latest report of the Minister of the 
     <lb/>
     Interior, we have the statement of the sales 
     <lb/>
     of land made by the railway and other com<lb break="no"/>panies from 1893 to 1904. The sales amount<lb break="no"/>ed to 10,512,349 acres, and the amount of 
     <lb/>
     money for which these lands were sold was 
     <lb/>
     $36,992,482, or about $3.50 per acre. That 
     <lb/>
     is to say, we find that as the actual result 
     <lb/>
     of the 10 or 11 years' sales of the great 
     <lb/>
     land companies, they obtain for a little 
     <lb/>
     over 10,000,000 acres a sum nearly 
     <lb/>
     equal to the whole compensation to 
     <lb/>
     be paid to the people of each of the 
     <lb/>
     new provinces for 138,000,000 acres. Then, 
     <lb/>
     again, we have the figures given by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of school lands sales. AsI have 
     <lb/>
     said, they average about $9.90 per acre. 
     <lb/>
     Also, the Prime Minister mentioned as 
     <lb/>
     'a very moderate rate' $3 per acre. 
     <lb/>
     He was afraid that if the land were hand<lb break="no"/>ed over to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories they might begin to sell 
     <lb/>
     them at something more than this very 
     <lb/>
     moderate rate of $3 per acre. When he 
     <lb/>
     was questioned whether the lands were 
     <lb/>
     generally open for sale at these figures, we 
     <lb/>
     discovered that they were only open 
     <lb/>
     to a few favoured individuals and that 
     <lb/>
     the general public were not able to buy 
     <lb/>
     lands even at $3 per acre. I will go a 
     <lb/>
     step further and take the figures given by 
     <lb/>
     the Minister of the Interior a couple of 
     <lb/>
     years ago in discussing the Grand Trunk 
     <lb/>
     Pacific project. He then made the calcula<lb break="no"/>tion that that one line of railway alone was 
     <lb/>
    going to open up 50,000,000 acres of land, and   
     <lb/>that the 20,000,000 or 25,000,000 acres which 
     <lb/>the government would have for sale would 
     <lb/>have an accrued value of $3 per acre within 
     <lb/>ten years after the completion of the line. Or. 
     <lb/>take the ex-Minister of the Interior's (Mr. 
     <lb/>Sifton's) statement made last Friday, when 
     <lb/>he referred to the school lands trust fund 
     <lb/>as being valued at $50,000,000. That state<lb break="no"/>ment he made in the course of his speech 
     <lb/>on the educational clauses of this Bill. 
     <lb/>Now, these school lands consist of two 
     <lb/>sections out of every 36 sections in the 
     <lb/>township. That is, the school lands are 
     <lb/>about one-eighteenth part of the whole ter<lb break="no"/>ritory. About 1 3/4 sections of each township 
     <lb/>have been set aside for the Hudson Bay 
     <lb/>Company, so that the school lands amount 
     <lb/>to one-seventeenth part of the area avail<lb break="no"/>able. And, if the seventeenth part of the 
     <lb/>whole area is estimated by the ex-Minister 
     <lb/>of the Interior at $50,000,000, it is a simple 
     <lb/>calculation to arrive at what he estimates 
     <lb/>as the value of the whole public domain in 
     <lb/>the Northwest—all you have to do is to 
     <lb/>multiply $50,000,000 by 17. But I am not 
     <lb/>suggesting that that is a fair valuation of 
     <lb/>these lands. The ex-Minister of the Inte<lb break="no"/>rior, I presume, thinks it must be. It is 
     <lb/>an exceedingly difficult thing to find at this 
     <lb/>time what the value of these lands will be 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3545</fw>
     <fw type="num">3546</fw>
    

     at some date in the future. But while<lb/>it is a most difficult thing to arrive<lb/>at any final conclusion on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, I submit that the calculations I 
     <lb/>
     have quoted go to prove conclusively that 
     <lb/>
     the compensation that is offered for the loss 
     <lb/>
     of these lands is absolutely and utterly 
     <lb/>
     inadequate. The Prime Minister took the 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba lands as a precedent, as I have 
     <lb/>
     before mentioned. But, in the case of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, the swamp lands were handed back 
     <lb/>
     to that province. The Prime Minister says 
     <lb/>
     there are no swamp lands in the new prov<lb break="no"/>inces. I would not like to make such a con<lb break="no"/>fident assertion as that myself. But, if there 
     <lb/>
     are none, I think the Northwest should have 
     <lb/>
     some lands given them in lieu of the swamp 
     <lb/>
     lands. How much better it would be to 
     <lb/>
     avoid all these difficulties which confront 
     <lb/>
     us in the calculation of their real value by 
     <lb/>
     handing the lands over to the new provinces 
     <lb/>
     just as their public lands have been placed 
     <lb/>
     in the possession of the other provinces of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion. The people of the new prov<lb break="no"/>inces would then feel that, in this respect at 
     <lb/>
     any rate they had been fairly treated ; that 
     <lb/>
     in this respect, they had been granted full 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights. Or, I will make another 
     <lb/>
     proposition. If this parliament considers 
     <lb/>
     only 25,000,000 acres of land of that country 
     <lb/>
     to be of any value, I would invite them to 
     <lb/>
     select 25,000,000 acres in each province and 
     <lb/>
     pay us $1.50 per acre and hand over the 
     <lb/>
     remainder to the provincial authorities. The 
     <lb/>
     people of the Northwest will make some use 
     <lb/>
     of the land if you will give it to them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     As a matter of fact I hold that no mone<lb break="no"/>tary consideration is sufficient to compens<lb break="no"/>ate us for the loss of our land. It is impos<lb break="no"/>sible to have a satisfactory administration 
     <lb/>
     of these lands from a centre upwards of two 
     <lb/>
     thousand miles distant. Nearly everything 
     <lb/>
     has to be referred to Ottawa. It takes 
     <lb/>
     nearly a week to get an answer to a letter 
     <lb/>
     from one of the nearest points, Regina. The 
     <lb/>
     people on the spot understand the conditions 
     <lb/>
     far better than the officials of the depart<lb break="no"/>ment down here in Ottawa. The land will 
     <lb/>
     be much better administered by officers res<lb break="no"/>ponsible to the Legislative Assembly of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories. The whole admi<lb break="no"/>nistration will be under the eyes of the 
     <lb/>
     people who are most deeply interested in 
     <lb/>
     the lands. It is quite a different matter 
     <lb/>
     when the administration is placed in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of one man at Ottawa. He becomes, 
     <lb/>
     in a sense a dictator, and he is responsible to 
     <lb/>
     a body of men very few of whom have any 
     <lb/>
     intimate knowledge of the local conditions 
     <lb/>
     which prevail in the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     The representatives of the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     of the Dominion control and manage their 
     <lb/>
     own lands. And they are the people best 
     <lb/>
     qualified to control and manage those lands. 
     <lb/>
     But I contend that they are not so well 
     <lb/>
     qualified to control and manage the lands of 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest as are the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest themselves. I was very much 
     <lb/>
     amused by one feature of the speech made 
 

            <pb n="3547" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3547.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">3547</fw>  
     

     the other day by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle (Mr. Bourassa). He tried to show 
     <lb/>
     what a kind and statesmanlike thing it 
     <lb/>
     would be to relieve the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west of the burden of managing these lands. 
     <lb/>
     That seemed to be the general trend of his 
     <lb/>
     remarks. He suggested that the members 
     <lb/>
     of the provincial legislatures might be pres<lb break="no"/>sed to use the lands improperly. If he finds 
     <lb/>
     that difficulty in the province of Quebec he 
     <lb/>
     has the remedy of inducing his province to 
     <lb/>
     hand over all their lands to the administra<lb break="no"/>tion of the Dominion. But, we have never 
     <lb/>
     found any difficulty of that kind whatever in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories in the matters 
     <lb/>
     with which we have had to deal up to the 
     <lb/>
     present day, and I believe we shall find no 
     <lb/>
     difficulty in that connection in the future. 
     <lb/>
     At any rate, who is the more likely to have 
     <lb/>
     improper pressure put upon them to ad<lb break="no"/>minister these lands wrongly ? Is it the 
     <lb/>
     members of the legislatures of the new prov<lb break="no"/>inces who are directly under the eye of the 
     <lb/>
     people most intimately concerned, or is it 
     <lb/>
     not likely to be the Minister of the Interior 
     <lb/>
     who is acting by himself down here at 
     <lb/>
     Ottawa ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     After all, these questions, important as 
     <lb/>
     they are to the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, are overshadowed by the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses in this Bill. These clauses have been 
     <lb/>
     introduced, I assert once again in spite of 
     <lb/>
     what the hon. member for Ottawa said, 
     <lb/>
     in such a form as to invite opposition ; and 
     <lb/>
     the disparaging references made constantly 
     <lb/>
     to the people of the Northwest by member 
     <lb/>
     after member on the other side of the House 
     <lb/>
     have not been such as to soothe the feelings 
     <lb/>
     of the people under these difficult circum<lb break="no"/>stances. I would like to say, in reference 
     <lb/>
     to the statement made by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Ottawa that he had been told that no 
     <lb/>
     school question existed in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories up to the present time, that 
     <lb/>
     that is practically the case. The school 
     <lb/>
     question has been raised in this parliament 
     <lb/>
     and raised on the other side of the House. 
     <lb/>
     But, I consider that the same hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man misrepresents the position of this party 
     <lb/>
     when he suggests that our attitude is to 
     <lb/>
     favour the repeal of the present system of 
     <lb/>
     education which obtains in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. The position of this party is 
     <lb/>
     that this is a local and provincial question 
     <lb/>
     which should be dealt with entirely by the 
     <lb/>
     provinces, that this is a matter in reference 
     <lb/>
     to which this parliament has no right or 
     <lb/>
     power to place restrictions or limitations on 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. We contend for provincial 
     <lb/>
     rights in this matter. The hon. member for 
     <lb/>
     Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) accuses us of mis<lb break="no"/>using what he refers to as that sacred term. 
     <lb/>
     With one breath he denounces us for appeal<lb break="no"/>ing for provincial rights and then with the 
     <lb/>
     next breath he approves of the federal 
     <lb/>
     authorities retaining possession of the public 
     <lb/>
     lands of the Northwest Territories which we 
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3547</fw>
     <fw type="num">3548</fw>


     believe it will be an infringement of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights for the Dominion to retain 
     <lb/>
     in their possession. He went on to treat 
     <lb/>
     the people of the Northwest Territories as 
     <lb/>
     if they were children and as if they had no 
     <lb/>
     rights. I do not propose to follow him 
     <lb/>
     into the religious discussion which he raised. 
     <lb/>
     This evening we again had a violent racial 
     <lb/>
     and religious appeal from the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Ottawa. As I said before I have made 
     <lb/>
     up my mind that I at any rate will not 
     <lb/>
     follow the bad example which has been set 
     <lb/>
     us by hon. gentlemen on the other side 
     <lb/>
     of the House. I respect the religious con<lb break="no"/>victions of others and I think they should 
     <lb/>
     show the same respect for my religious 
     <lb/>
     convictions. I feel they have not done it. 
     <lb/>
     Nor, Sir, is it a question of the value of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools as an abstract proposition. 
     <lb/>
     We are not discussing that question at all. 
     <lb/>
     It is a question of equal rights to the new 
     <lb/>
     provinces with those which have been given 
     <lb/>
     to other provinces in the Dominion to deal 
     <lb/>
     with matters of education. It has been sug<lb break="no"/>gested that this question has been raised on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House as a party question, 
     <lb/>
     that this side of the House is responsible for 
     <lb/>
     the agitation that is going on in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories at the present moment. 
     <lb/>
     Now, Sir, it just happened that yesterday 
     <lb/>
     afternoon, after the close of the sitting of 
     <lb/>
     this House, I received a letter from the

     resolution. I presume that these are the

     <lb/>
     or are these the gentlemen of whom the

     he stated his 'firm conviction that most

     people in the country will not bother them<lb break="no"/>selves very much about this constitutional 
     <lb/>
     question' and that there are other ques<lb break="no"/>tions greater than the constitutional ques<lb break="no"/>tion involved in this matter. The rights 
     <lb/>
     and liberties of the British people have 
     <lb/>
     been too closely connected with the consti<lb break="no"/>tution to have it treated thus lightly. I 
     <lb/>
     also wish to offer my protest against the sug<lb break="no"/>gestions which have been constantly made 
     <lb/>
     that the people of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     will be less generous than the people of 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia in dealing with this question. 
     <lb/>
     That suggestion has been made more than 
     <lb/>
     once on the other side of the House. What 
     <lb/>
     my views are in respect to the separate 
     <lb/>
     school question as an abstract proposition, 
     <lb/>
     has in my opinion, really nothing whatever 
     <lb/>
     to do with this discussion. Hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men on the other side of the House have 
     <lb/>
     discussed this question on its merits as 
     <lb/>
     have hon. gentlemen, I must admit, on 
     <lb/>
     this side of the House. Although I do not 
     <lb/>
     intend to follow their example I intend to 
     <lb/>
     claim the privilege of briefly putting on re<lb break="no"/>cord the views which I hold with regard to 
     <lb/>
     this question. After nearly 22 years resi<lb break="no"/>dence in the Northwest Territories, I be<lb break="no"/>lieve firmly that the public school system as 
     <lb/>
     at present administered is the one best 
     <lb/>
     suited to the needs of the country.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. The fact that separate 
     <lb/>
     schools have been so little taken advantage 
     <lb/>
     of shows that except in certain centres and 
     <lb/>
     thickly-populated districts there is no de<lb break="no"/>mand for them. Taking an average settle<lb break="no"/>ment in that country, the separate school 
     <lb/>
     system is nearly impracticable and places a 
     <lb/>
     heavy burden on the people in the increased 
     <lb/>
     taxation incidental to minority schools.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. In certain instances it would 
     <lb/>
     actually prevent the formation of schools at 
     <lb/>
     all. I do not Wish to be understood as favour<lb break="no"/>ing the exclusion of religious teaching from 
     <lb/>
     the education of the young. No education, 
     <lb/>
     in my mind, can be satisfactory which does 
     <lb/>
     not include the ethics of religion, but I say 
     <lb/>
     that doctrine and dogma should be kept to 
     <lb/>
     the church and to the home.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. And I am opposed to a pure<lb break="no"/>ly sectarian education. That is my own 
     <lb/>
     personal opinion, and I believe that I am as 
     <lb/>
     well entitled to hold that opinion and state 
     <lb/>
     it in the House as any other gentleman. 
     <lb/>
     In the public school system of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories provision is made to allow 
     <lb/>
     of religious teaching, as has been frequent<lb break="no"/>ly stated in this House. But the impression 
     <lb/>
     which has been conveyed by many of the 
     <lb/>
     speeches that this religious teaching is 
     <lb/>
     the regular rule, is an erroneous one. 
     <lb/>
     It is not, as a matter of fact, the general 
     <lb/>
     rule. In fact, I do not know personally of 
 

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3549</fw>
     <fw type="num">3550</fw>


     one particular instance in which religious 
     <lb/>
     teaching is given during that last half hour. 
     <lb/>
     But it is open, under the ordinances, to any 
     <lb/>
     and every denomination to teach religious 
     <lb/>
     doctrine in the same school during the last 
     <lb/>
     half hour in the afternoon if they desire to 
     <lb/>
     do so and can obtain the consent of the 
     <lb/>
     parents and the trustees. If they do not do 
     <lb/>
     so it is the fault of the people themselves ; 
     <lb/>
     it means that they do not wish it, and I 
     <lb/>
     take the ground that they should not be 
     <lb/>
     forced to have it. The separate school sys<lb break="no"/>tem in its practical working out means a 
     <lb/>
     hardship in the case of any Roman Catho<lb break="no"/>lic who prefers a public school education 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest Territories, and I would 
     <lb/>
     say again that there are many Roman Cath<lb break="no"/>olics in that country who do prefer a public 
     <lb/>
     school education. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. Is it not a fact that 
     <lb/>
     in the school districts where the Catholics 
     <lb/>
     are in the majority they have not the choice, 
     <lb/>
     but are obliged to go to the public schools, 
     <lb/>
     because they cannot form separate schools ? 
     <lb/>
     Under the ordinance, in every school dis<lb break="no"/>trict where the Catholics are in a majority 
     <lb/>
     they cannot form a separate school, but 
     <lb/>
     have to go to the public school ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. That is quite true. But 
     <lb/>
     they would control the teachers and, of 
     <lb/>
     course, they could have religious instruction 
     <lb/>
     for the last half hour of the afternoon. That 
     <lb/>
     is quite the case, and the hon. gentleman has 
     <lb/>
     stated what is really a very good case 
     <lb/>
     in favour of our national school system 
     <lb/>
     as it exists. I do not think you need go 
     <lb/>
     further than Ottawa to find gentlemen of 
     <lb/>
     that faith who believe in the public school 
     <lb/>
     system of education as contrasted with the 
     <lb/>
     separate school system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I would like to know what the educational 
     <lb/>
     clauses, as at present embodied in the Bill, 
     <lb/>
     really mean. In a House where there are so 
     <lb/>
     many lawyers we laymen might have ex<lb break="no"/>pected to get a clear answer to this ques<lb break="no"/>tion : What do these clauses really embody : 
     <lb/>
     what do they really mean? But we find 
     <lb/>
     that legal opinions differ in regard to this 
     <lb/>
     as widely as the poles, and I am 
     <lb/>
     inclined, after hearing a good many of 
     <lb/>
     the speeches pro and con, to believe that 
     <lb/>
     they mean just about the same thing as the 
     <lb/>
     original clauses. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now, let us trace this question up ; let 
     <lb/>
     us consider the way in which the original 
     <lb/>
     clauses were arrived at, and the way in 
     <lb/>
     which these substituted clauses were arriv<lb break="no"/>ed at. A subc-ommittee of the Privy Council 
     <lb/>
     was appointed to deal with this question ; 
     <lb/>
     it was composed of four gentlemen of the 
     <lb/>
     legal profession, all men of repute—the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, the 
     <lb/>
     Secretary of State and the Postmaster Gen<lb break="no"/>eral ; the three first of these were gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     who belonged to the Roman Catholic faith 
     <lb/>
     and were gentlemen who are avowedly in 
     <lb/>
     favour of separate schools. They took the 
     <lb/>
     unusual course of issuing a pamphlet and 
     <lb/>
     distributing amongst the members of this 
 

            <pb n="3551" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3551.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3551</fw>
            
            
       

     House what purported to be a brief history, 
     <lb/>
     from official sources, of the legislation with 
     <lb/>
     respect to separate schools since 1863. At 
     <lb/>
     the end of that pamphlet they went beyond 
     <lb/>
     the bounds of history, and made a distinct 
     <lb/>
     appeal on the subject. They said that 'it 
     <lb/>
     would be a breach of faith and a 
     <lb/>
     violation of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ica Act to disturb now rights and 
     <lb/>
     privileges granted thirty years ago'—a 
     <lb/>
     violation of the British North Ameri<lb break="no"/>ca Act; and I would like, by the way, to 
     <lb/>
     ask who it is that now proposes to violate 
     <lb/>
     the British North America Act? But the 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet did not rest at this. The rights 
     <lb/>
     and privileges granted thirty years ago 
     <lb/>
     were defined in another pant of this 
     <lb/>
     pamphlet as 'the same system as pre<lb break="no"/>vailed in Ontario and Quebec.' After 
     <lb/>
     issuing this pamphlet, in which this strong 
     <lb/>
     appeal is made for separate schools, they 
     <lb/>
     proceeded to draw up a set of clauses. To 
     <lb/>
     provide for what ? According to the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister in his speech on the introduction 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill, it was to enable the minority to 
     <lb/>
     establish their own schools and to share in 
     <lb/>
     the public moneys as the law is to-day. A 
     <lb/>
     similar statement was made a few days later 
     <lb/>
     by the Minister of Justice, that they drew up 
     <lb/>
     these clauses to give effect to the provisions 
     <lb/>
     of the Act of 1875 and the conditions that 
     <lb/>
     are now in force in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Now, we are told by the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Finance, the Minister of Customs, the 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) and many 
     <lb/>
     others that the ordinances now in force in 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories, for all practical 
     <lb/>
     purposes, simply provide for a national 
     <lb/>
     school system, and not for a separate school 
     <lb/>
     system in its recognized sense—that is, in 
     <lb/>
     the sense in which it prevails in Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     So we have this position, that, after 
     <lb/>
     issuing a pamphlet in favour of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools, they drew up a clause which 
     <lb/>
     did not provide for separate schools as they 
     <lb/>
     understood them, but simply provided for 
     <lb/>
     what was in practice a national school sys<lb break="no"/>tem. These four legal gentlemen drew up 
     <lb/>
     this clause which the Minister of Justice 
     <lb/>
     said was drawn up designedly to be'so 
     <lb/>
     clear and simple that any man might under<lb break="no"/>stand lt;' those were his very words. But a 
     <lb/>
     revelation came a few days later. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) returns 
     <lb/>
     and tells us that those clear and simple 
     <lb/>
     words have a deeper meaning, that they 
     <lb/>
     actually do provide for the same system as 
     <lb/>
     prevails in Ontario and Quebec, and in ad<lb break="no"/>dition give, for the support of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools, a share of a $50,000,000 endowment 
     <lb/>
     which had been specially held in trust for 
     <lb/>
     public schools. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     And these four legal gentlemen apparent<lb break="no"/>ly never saw what they were embodying in 
     <lb/>
     this clause ! They believed all the time 
     <lb/>
     they were simply perpetuating the law as 
     <lb/>
     it exists at present. For the last three 
     <lb/>
     or four weeks there have been anxious ne<lb break="no"/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3551</fw>
     <fw type="num">3552</fw>

     gotiations on the other side of the House, 
     <lb/>
     and they have finally agreed to lay the 
     <lb/>
     blame on the poor draughtsman. These 
     <lb/>
     four gentlemen then took back the clauses 
     <lb/>
     they had drafted originally, and pro<lb break="no"/>vided a substitute which in the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the member for Brandon really 
     <lb/>
     does provide for the schools now in 
     <lb/>
     existence and nothing more. The Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister in introducing the amended clauses 
     <lb/>
     explained that the objections to the original 
     <lb/>
     clauses were that they were 'too broad and 
     <lb/>
     too vague, and if adopted would create con<lb break="no"/>fusion instead of certainty.' Remember 
     <lb/>
     these were the very clauses which we were 
     <lb/>
     told were to be so clear and simple that 
     <lb/>
     any man could understand them. The 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister told us that the amended 
     <lb/>
     clauses simply embody the law of the coun<lb break="no"/>try which has been in force for thirteen or 
     <lb/>
     fourteen years ; but I would remind the 
     <lb/>
     House that the right hon. gentleman said 
     <lb/>
     the same thing in reference to the original 
     <lb/>
     clauses. The Minister of Finance says that 
     <lb/>
     the present clauses continue for ever the 
     <lb/>
     school system which now exists, and the 
     <lb/>
     Minister of Customs explained how simple 
     <lb/>
     it all was, and he told us which of the differ<lb break="no"/>ent clauses of the territorial ordinances 
     <lb/>
     were affected by this Bill. If the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Customs were a lawyer he would have 
     <lb/>
     been a little more careful, but having had 
     <lb/>
     experience of the difliculties of four of the 
     <lb/>
     leading legal gentlemen of the cabinet, some 
     <lb/>
     of us began to think a layman's opinion 
     <lb/>
     might throw some light upon the question. 
     <lb/>
     However that may be, the member for Cal<lb break="no"/>gary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) showed us pretty 
     <lb/>
     conclusively the other day that there is more 
     <lb/>
     behind this matter than we have been led 
     <lb/>
     to believe, and that the separate school 
     <lb/>
     clause of 1875 is re-enacted in its entirety 
     <lb/>
     by the present legislation, and that for all 
     <lb/>
     practical purposes the substituted clauses 
     <lb/>
     are just the same as the original. Is it any 
     <lb/>
     wonder that parliament and the country 
     <lb/>
     are extremely suspicious as to what there 
     <lb/>
     is underlying all this, and that we want to 
     <lb/>
     know distinctly and definitely what this 
     <lb/>
     proposal really does mean ? We find the 
     <lb/>
     very peculiar circumstance that the most 
     <lb/>
     violent advocates of separate schools as 
     <lb/>
     well as the most violent opponents of 
     <lb/>
     separate schools on the other side of 
     <lb/>
     the House, are, one and all of them urging 
     <lb/>
     us to accept these educational clauses. We 
     <lb/>
     are told by one set of these gentlemen that 
     <lb/>
     they strongly approved of these clauses be<lb break="no"/>cause they would tend to disminish the 
     <lb/>
     number of separate schools and I suppose, 
     <lb/>
     finally do away with them altogether. By 
     <lb/>
     another set we are urged in impassioned 
     <lb/>
     language to vote for the clauses and give 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic minority their rights ; 
     <lb/>
     we are told that there is a religious 
     <lb/>
     principle at stake and that no country can 
     <lb/>
     be great and can endure without separate 
     <lb/>
     schoole. Why all this flood of eloqu<lb break="no"/>

     ence if the Bill does not provide for sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools as the people of Quebec 
     <lb/>
     understand them ? Why is it necessary 
     <lb/>
     to change the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act to curtail the liberties of a free people, 
     <lb/>
     if we are only contending for a shadow ? 
     <lb/>
     It seems to me to be an extraordinarily 
     <lb/>
     foolish thing to invade provincial rights and 
     <lb/>
     to create so much ill-feeling if it is only 
     <lb/>
     for a shadow. Mr. <choice><sic>Speaper</sic><corr>Speaker</corr></choice>, it is not yet 
     <lb/>
     too late for the government to retrace its 
     <lb/>
     steps. I trust that the Prime Minister and 
     <lb/>
     his government will withdraw these objec<lb break="no"/>tionable educational clauses and leave this 
     <lb/>
     matter in the hands of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest. I can assure the right hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman that he will make no mistake in 
     <lb/>
     trusting to the generosity of the people of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces. The gentlemen on 
     <lb/>
     the Treasury benches and their supporters 
     <lb/>
     have been mistaken in their estimate 
     <lb/>
     of the character of the people of the 
     <lb/>
     Territories. I can tell them that the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest are a just and broad<lb break="no"/>minded people ; I can tell them that the free 
     <lb/>
     air of the prairies has inspired the people 
     <lb/>
     with as great or a greater love for freedom 
     <lb/>
     than possibly exists down here. The people 
     <lb/>
     of the Territories will not be driven, and 
     <lb/>
     will not be coerced. It is foolish to try to 
     <lb/>
     coerce them ; trust them and they will show 
     <lb/>
     a gentle and a generous spirit in those mat<lb break="no"/>ters. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is a most extraordinary thing that the 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon should have been 
     <lb/>
     ignorant of the proposed action of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment in regard to the educational clauses 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill. No man has occupied a more 
     <lb/>
     prominent position than he on the question 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools. It is incredible that 
     <lb/>
     he did not have this matter under his close 
     <lb/>
     attention and consideration or that he did 
     <lb/>
     not take steps to keep the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     well informed as to his views. However, 
     <lb/>
     he appears not only to have been kept in 
     <lb/>
     ignorance of the whole thing, but to have 
     <lb/>
     kept himself in blissful ignorance too. The 
     <lb/>
     reference of the member for North Toronto 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Foster) to the bolting of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment supporters on this question and his 
     <lb/>
     comparison of it to the bolting of a flock 
     <lb/>
     of sheep reminds me of the experience of an 
     <lb/>
     old friend of mine who was taking his 
     <lb/>
     flock to a new ground where the pasturage 
     <lb/>
     was exceptionally good. The shepherd 
     <lb/>
     found he had to take his sheep through a 
     <lb/>
     narrow and difficult passage right in the 
     <lb/>
     centre of which was a large boulder. The 
     <lb/>
     sheep took alarm at the boulder and began 
     <lb/>
     to bolt in every direction. The shepherd 
     <lb/>
     had however a very sagacious old bell-wether 
     <lb/>
     in his flock and a brilliant idea struck him. 
     <lb/>
     He gave the bell-whether a kick behind and 
     <lb/>
     sent him off with the rest. When the sheep 
     <lb/>
    got well away he rolled the stone over so 
     <lb/>that it did not look the same as before. The 
     <lb/>plan answered to perfection, he soon got 
     <lb/>the flock together again and they safely 


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3553</fw>
     <fw type="num">3554</fw>
   

     negotiated this difficult place led by the old 
     <lb/>
     bell-wether. But, Mr. Speaker, it was just 
     <lb/>
     the same old boulder which he had simply 
     <lb/>
     rolled over and changed in appearance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It was argued th other day by the 
     <lb/>
     member for Brandon that it would be 
     <lb/>
     a breach of faith with the people who 
     <lb/>
     come into this country expecting a 
     <lb/>
     separate school system if this remedial 
     <lb/>
     legislation were not passed in advance, so 
     <lb/>
     to speak ; and if a law were not put on the 
     <lb/>
     statute-book to retain a separate school 
     <lb/>
     system in this country for all time to come. 
     <lb/>
     The Minister of the Interior is responsible 
     <lb/>
     for the immigration pamphlets which are 
     <lb/>
     issued by his department. I have here one 
     <lb/>
     of those pamphlets, and I am told there 
     <lb/>
     are others, in which the system of educa« 
     <lb/>
     tion which exists in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is set forth as entirely different from 
     <lb/>
     what he stated it to be. Further than that, 
     <lb/>
     I believe he has induced to come into this 
     <lb/>
     country a very large number of settlers 
     <lb/>
     from the United States, in the belief that 
     <lb/>
     they were coming into a country where a 
     <lb/>
     public school system existed. These are the 
     <lb/>
     words of one of these pamplets : 'The 
     <lb/>
     schools are non-sectarian and are national 
     <lb/>
     in character.' How about the rights of 
     <lb/>
     those people whom the Minister of the In<lb break="no"/>terior has induced to come into this country 
     <lb/>
     upon such a definite promise as that ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that I have al<lb break="no"/>ready occupied the time of the House at far 
     <lb/>
     too great a length. I appeal to this House 
     <lb/>
     to endorse the amendment which has been 
     <lb/>
     moved by the leader of the opposition, and 
     <lb/>
     to subscribe to the principle stated therein, 
     <lb/>
     which is the very principle upon which con<lb break="no"/>federation was accomplished. That reso<lb break="no"/>lution sets forth that 'subject to and in 
     <lb/>
     accordance with the provisions of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, the legis<lb break="no"/>latures of the new provinces are entitled 
     <lb/>
     to and should enjoy full powers of provin<lb break="no"/>cial self-government, including the power 
     <lb/>
     to exclusively make laws in relation to edu<lb break="no"/>cation.' If this principle is not embodied 
     <lb/>
     in the legislation now before the House, 
     <lb/>
     and if the rights of the new provinces are 
     <lb/>
     restricted and limited, then I wish to say, 
     <lb/>
     so far as I am concerned, and I believe so 
     <lb/>
     far as the Northwest is concerned, that the 
     <lb/>
     question is not settled finally. We shall 
     <lb/>
     take such further action, constitutional ac<lb break="no"/>tion, as we see fit ; and I am mistaken in the 
     <lb/>
     spirit of the men of the Northwest if they 
     <lb/>
     do not finally secure their full rights in this 
     <lb/>
     matter. The Prime Minister in his speech 
     <lb/>
     has appealed to precedent in regard to edu<lb break="no"/>cation and in regard to public lands. In 
     <lb/>
     each case the precedent which he has select<lb break="no"/>ed has been the exception to the general rule. 
     <lb/>
     He proposes to use these precedents to cur<lb break="no"/>tail the rights of the people of the new prov<lb break="no"/>inces. In British history, Mr. Speaker, it 
     <lb/>
     was not for such a purpose that precedent 
     <lb/>
     was ever quoted. Let me remind the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman of some lines of Tennyson, 


            <pb n="3555" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-30_Page_3555.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3555</fw>  
       

     which give the true meaning of precedent, 
     <lb/>
     and let me ask him to apply them to this 
     <lb/>
     great and progressive Canada, with its 
     <lb/>
     future to a great extent what he now 
     <lb/>
     chooses to make it :

     <persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Carleton, Ont.). Be<lb break="no"/>fore the Orders of the Day are called, I 
     <lb/>
     wish once more to call to the attention of 
     <lb/>
     the House the quite unprecedented condi<lb break="no"/>tion of affairs which exists at the present 
     <lb/>
     time. During many months we have not 
     <lb/>
     had in this House the presence of the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Public Works (Mr. Sutherland). 
     <lb/>
     That gentleman is one of my personal 
     <lb/>
     friends, although we are opposed in politics, 
     <lb/>
     and no one regrets more than I do the un<lb break="no"/>fortunate circumstance that illness prevents 
     <lb/>
     him from taking his place among us, and 
     <lb/>
     any remarks which I have to make 
     <lb/>
     with regard to violation of constitutional 
     <lb/>
     usage by the government are, of course, 
     <lb/>
     not connected in any way with that gentle<lb break="no"/>man, because I would be very glad indeed 
     <lb/>
     to have him restored to us, to once more 
     <lb/>
     have his assistance in the House and to 
     <lb/>
     have him back at work in his department 
     <lb/>
     again. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But my right hon. friend seems to take 
     <lb/>
     for granted that he is at liberty, so long as 
     <lb/>
     he may see fit, to deprive parliament and 
     <lb/>
    the country of the services of a Minister 
     <lb/>of Public Works possessing the authority 
     <lb/>and invested with the responsibility which 
     <lb/>that position gives to him. I have 
     <lb/>looked a little into this question, which 
     <lb/>has arisen more than once in Great 
     <lb/>Britain, and I find that the rule there acted 
     <lb/>upon is not at all in accordance with that 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAKE1">Mr. LAKE</persName>. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     suggested by the right hon. gentleman. To 
     <lb/>
     cite just one instance, in 1871, action was 
     <lb/>
     taken in both Houses of parliament in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the absence of Mr. Childers, the 
     <lb/>
     First Lord of the Admiralty, during the 
     <lb/>
     early part of the session, on account of 
     <lb/>
     the state of his health, and within a month 
     <lb/>
     after his resignation took place. It has 
     <lb/>
     been asserted in this House, I do not know 
     <lb/>
     with what truth, that the Minister of Pub<lb break="no"/>lic Works some time ago placed his resigna<lb break="no"/>tion in the hands of the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man, or at all events told him that his port<lb break="no"/>folio was at his service whenever the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country required it. However 
     <lb/>
     that may be, I wish courteously to place 
     <lb/>
     on record a remonstrance against the con<lb break="no"/>tinuance of this condition of affairs. I do 
     <lb/>
     not think there is any warrant for it under 
     <lb/>
     the constitution. Indeed, I do not think 
     <lb/>
     there is any warrant for it under the terms 
     <lb/>
     of the Order in Council which was discussed 
     <lb/>
     somewhat last session, and under which one 
     <lb/>
     minister of the Crown may under certain 
     <lb/>
     circumstances act for another minister of 
     <lb/>
     the Crown. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     On another occasion, which is referred 
     <lb/>
     to by Mr. Todd in his work on consti<lb break="no"/>tutional government, Lord John Russell 
     <lb/>
    had accepted the seals of the Colonial 
     <lb/>Office, at a time when he was absent on 
     <lb/>a diplomatic mission in Vienna. Within two 
     <lb/>weeks after he had accepted the seals of 
     <lb/>office, the matter was brought to the at<lb break="no"/>tention of parliament, and again on two or 
     <lb/>three occasions subsequently, and was made 
     <lb/>the occasion of a grave criticism of the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, which only ceased when he 
     <lb/>took his place in parliament on the 28th 
     <lb/>of April. Now, so far as my hon. friend 
     <lb/>the Minister of Public Works is concerned, 
     <lb/>he has been absent from his duties in parlia<lb break="no"/>ment and from his duties in the depart<lb break="no"/>ment for a very long time ; and if there be 
     <lb/>any foundation for the rumour that he is 
     <lb/>ready to surrender the seals of office at a 
     <lb/>moment's notice, I do not know for what 
     <lb/>reason the right hon. gentleman proposes to 
     <lb/>carry on the business of the country in the 
     <lb/>way in which it is carried on at the present 
     <lb/>time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     We have not only the case of the Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Public Works, but we have what seems 
     <lb/>
     to me a much more serious violation of 
     <lb/>
     constitutional usage in the conduct of the 
     <lb/>
     government with respect to the vacant port<lb break="no"/>folio of the Interior. I do not want to 
     <lb/>
     repeat to-day what has already been said 
     <lb/>
     in this House. I have asked the Prime 
     <lb/>
     Minister more than once for an explanation 
     <lb/>
     of his extraordinary conduct in passing over 
     <lb/>
     that gentleman in introducing a very im<lb break="no"/>portant measure, a most momentous mea<lb break="no"/>sure, into this parliament without even hav<lb break="no"/>ing submitted the terms of perhaps its 
     <lb/>
     most important clause to that gentleman, 
     <lb/>
     although his return was daily expected. 
     <lb/>
     My right hon. friend has treated that very 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
