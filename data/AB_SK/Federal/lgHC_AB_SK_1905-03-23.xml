would like to <lb/>
refer to some remarks made by the Minister <lb/>
of Finance (Mr. Fielding) in closing the <lb/>
debate last evening. His speech sounded to <lb/>
me very much like a threat or a doleful <lb/>
foreboding, and it occurred to me that it <lb/>
was delivered for the purpose of holding his <lb/>
own followers together rather than of fore<lb break="no"/>shadowing what might be the result in the <lb/>
event of this Bill being defeated. He used <lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I say deliberately—and every hon.
gentleman <lb/>

be not passed, if we should be unable to carry <lb/>
a measure on this subject, then my right hon. <lb/>
friend will be obliged to retire and no other <lb/>

the confidence of parliament. <lb/>

            <p> All I can say is that he has a very poor <lb/>
opinion of the people of Canada, that he has <lb/>
not that confidence in the wisdom and sense, <lb/>
good judgment and forbearance, generosi<lb break="no"/>ty and enlightenment of the Canadian peo<lb break="no"/>ple that, as a Canadian, he should have. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Will my hon. friend <lb/>
permit me to insert in the quotation the <lb/>
words 'this parliament'? I was alluding <lb/>
to what might be done with the present <lb/>
parliament. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. ' This parliament. ' Par<lb break="no"/>liaments are usually the result of appealing <lb/>
to the country and the wisdom of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, and I take it that the good sense, and <lb/>
the good judgment, and the wisdom of the <lb/>
people of Canada are quite equal to the <lb/>
task of electing another parliament. I <lb/>
would not so much discredit the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence and the right aims of either the <lb/>
Roman Catholics or the French of this <lb/>
country as to insinuate that they would not <lb/>
be equal to the task of assisting to elect a <lb/>
parliament. Parliaments come and parlia<lb break="no"/>ments go, and we have never yet been con<lb break="no"/>fronted with that situation in Canada, and <lb/>
I am quite sure we are not likely to in the <lb/>
near future. The hon. minister said : <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> This is a religious question. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Well I can tell him that he was the first <lb/>
one in this House who said so. We <lb/>
thought it was a provincial autonomy Bill, <lb/>
that had to do with the establishment of two <lb/>
provinces in the Northwest. out of property <lb/>
that belongs to us, that it was a Bill for the <lb/>
purpose of giving them power to govern <lb/>
themselves, to legislate with regard to their <lb/>
own ends, to do the work which every pro<lb break="no"/>vince in the confederation that has provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy is doing at the present time. <lb/>
But the right hon. gentleman says it has <lb/>
turned into a religious question. Well, Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, if that be the case, who is respon<lb break="no"/>sible ? Is it this side of the House ? Did <lb/>
we introduce the element which would <lb/>
arouse any feeling along religious or sec<lb break="no"/>tarian or national lines ? Not by any means. <lb/>
We were silent spectators at the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of that Bill, which contains the elements <lb/>
that have provoked the acrimonious feeling <lb/>
existing in some parts of the country to-day.
<lb/>
It is, I submit, the right hon. gentleman him<lb break="no"/>self who availed himself of the earliest op<lb break="no"/>portunity—I was going to say the improper <lb/>
opportunity—of making, upon the intro<lb break="no"/>duction of this Bill, a very impassioned <lb/>
speech along those lines. His speech on <lb/>
that occasion was something very unusual, <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3012</fw>
        
 something very improper, something in my <lb/>
judgment quite uncalled for ; for while it is <lb/>
competent and proper for the member who <lb/>
introduces a Bill to explain its provisions, <lb/>
he is expected to confine himself to that <lb/>
object and explain them as briefly as pos<lb break="no"/>sible. But instead of an
explanation, we had <lb/>
an exordium on other lines. We had raked <lb/>
up the condition of things before confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. The right hon. gentleman conjured up <lb/>
again recollections of the various fights on <lb/>
religious issues that formerly prevailed be<lb break="no"/>tween Upper and Lower Canada, when these <lb/>
two provinces were united. All these bitter <lb/>
recollections were pressed into service for <lb/>
the purpose of impressing on this House the <lb/>
wisdom and the necessity of passing this <lb/>
Bill. If there be acrimonious feeling excited <lb/>
in the country to-day, who is responsible ? <lb/>
Certainly not the opposition but the govern<lb break="no"/>ment itself led by the right hon. gentleman, <lb/>
whose appeal in favour of the obnoxious <lb/>
features of the Bill was endorsed by the hon. <lb/>
the Finance Minister. These are the men <lb/>
who are responsible. It is they who have <lb/>
created the feeling of distrust which exists <lb/>
to-day. The right hon. gentleman declared <lb/>
that the press which supports the opposition <lb/>
has spared no effort to inflame the public <lb/>
mind on a very delicate subject. But if <lb/>
there were any such attempt, was it confined <lb/>
to the Conservative press ? If there were <lb/>
any efforts to inflame the public mind, is <lb/>
that to be traced to the Conservative press <lb/>
alone ? No, Sir, the criticisms of the press <lb/>
throughout the country were not confined <lb/>
to the newspapers supporting any political <lb/>
party. We had these criticisms from re<lb break="no"/>ligions papers, independent papers, and <lb/>
political papers on both sides. And they all <lb/>
were agreed in the main that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment is doing an improper thing, something <lb/>
calculated to create a strong feeling of aver<lb break="no"/>sion throughout the country against the <lb/>
measure and the government itself. Is not <lb/>
that a fact, Mr. Speaker ? Need I point to <lb/>
the very logical, moderate and fair criticisms
<lb/>
of the ' Globe '—the organ above all others <lb/>
which ought to voice the sentiments of the <lb/>
present government—and criticisms which,
<lb/>
I humbly submit, would do credit to any <lb/>
newspaper in Canada. What is the press
<lb/>
of the country doing to-day ? The organs of <lb/>
public opinion are, as a mirror, reflecting <lb/>
public sentiment, calling on the government <lb/>
to take warning, calling on parliament to <lb/>
take warning, and not do to-day what after<lb break="no"/>wards they may not be able to undo. Is <lb/>
the press to blame because it contains de<lb break="no"/>nunciations of the offensive features of this <lb/>
measure ? Is not the press in this respect <lb/>
exercising a public duty, and can it be <lb/>
charged with inflaming public passion and <lb/>
arousing sectarian strife because it calls <lb/>
attention to the dangers of this Bill ? Not <lb/>
at all. It is not the press of the country but <lb/>
the right hon. gentleman and his friends who <lb/>
must be held responsible for the present <lb/>
conditions. <lb/>
            </p>

<p> The right hon. gentleman appealed to his <lb/>
record dealing with these troublesome ques<lb break="no"/>tions, and pleaded that he had given suffi<lb break="no"/>cient evidence of his desire to conciliate and <lb/>
treat the various elements and creeds in this <lb/>
country upon lines that are broad, national <lb/>
and humane. He referred to his refusal to <lb/>
interfere in the New Brunswick agitation <lb/>
with regard to separate schools and gave <lb/>
that as an evidence of the spirit of fairness <lb/>
and toleration which actuates him. In the <lb/>
first speech he made on this measure he also <lb/>
referred to that matter, and drew attention <lb/>
to the fact that he had then advocated non<lb break="no"/>interference with the rights of the province. <lb/>
Well, it struck me at the time that if that <lb/>
be the record of the right hon. gentleman, <lb/>
it is a great pity he did not embody the <lb/>
spirit which then actuated him into the <lb/>
measure now before parliament, because, <lb/>
if I understand the English language, this <lb/>
measure is above all things an interference <lb/>
with provincial rights. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman told us that he refused to interfere <lb/>
in the agitation over the Jesuits Estate Bill <lb/>
because it was the undoubted right of the <lb/>
province to pass that Bill. Let me say that <lb/>
the Jesuits Estate Bill was my first ex<lb break="no"/>perience in parliamentary life with one of <lb/>
these vexed questions, and I agreed with <lb/>
the right hon. the First Minister
that as it <lb/>
was dealing with lands belonging to the <lb/>
province, which in my judgment the pro<lb break="no"/>vince had a perfect right to sell and do what <lb/>
it liked with the proceeds, consequently we <lb/>
as a federal parliament had no right to inter<lb break="no"/>fere. I held that it was a Bill dealing with <lb/>
education, which under the British North <lb/>
America Act came within the exclusive right <lb/>
of the province ; and therefore if the pro<lb break="no"/>vince chooses to sell those lands and use the <lb/>
proceeds for educational purposes, or throw <lb/>
them into the sea, we had no right to inter<lb break="no"/>fere. Therefore although the question ex<lb break="no"/>cited a great deal of feeling in my section of <lb/>
the country, I stood by that principle as <lb/>
firmly as I stand by it to-day, and I did it <lb/>
believing that the only guarantee for the <lb/>
successful working out of confederation lay <lb/>
in giving the provinces all the rights con<lb break="no"/>ferred on them by the constitution, and only <lb/>
exercising here those rights which belong to <lb/>
the federal parliament. Then we had the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman boasting that on the <lb/>
question of the Manitoba school education <lb/>
he had stood by provincial rights and en<lb break="no"/>deavoured by conciliatory methods to adjust <lb/>
the diferences between the two classes of <lb/>
people in that province and finally succeed<lb break="no"/>ed. Well, Mr. Speaker, I was with the First <lb/>
Minister on that question as well. I took <lb/>
the same grounds that I did on the Jesuits <lb/>
Estate question, namely, that it was un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly the right of the province to deal <lb/>
with education, and I opposed any proposal <lb/>
to coerce or force Manitoba at that time. <lb/>
Was I right then ? I submit that I was <lb/>
consistent in the stand I took
upon those two  <lb/>
questions, which were at the very antipodes

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3014</fw>
          
 of each other, so far as popularity in my <lb/>
riding was concerned. Am I then
to be <lb/>
blamed if I take the same ground to-day ?<lb/>
Am I to be blamed if I take my stand to<lb break="no"/>day on the question of provincial rights in <lb/>
the matter before the House as firmly as I <lb/>
did on the Jesuits Estate 'Bill
and the Reme<lb break="no"/>dial Bill, which sought to compel the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba to do what I thought she <lb/>
had a perfect right to refuse to do ? Then, <lb/>
I say, I am consistent with my record in
<lb/>
every particular. But the First Minister is <lb/>
not consistent with his record. On other oc<lb break="no"/>casions he stood by provincial rights ; to-day <lb/>
he is abandoning the principle of provincia1 <lb/>
rights and forcing upon these unwilling pro<lb break="no"/>vinces laws which compel them to do what <lb/>
the constitution never intended they should <lb/>
be compelled to do. The right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man defends his conduct by saying : I am
<lb/>
doing this in obedience to the constitution. <lb/>
The Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) said <lb/>
last night that he did not understand the <lb/>
Prime Minister to say that he was compelled <lb/>
by the constitution to take the course he <lb/>
does. But I have here the Prime Minister's <lb/>
very words : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I stand again, as I believe, upon the rock of <lb/>
the constitution of Canada when I say that this <lb/>
parliament should, according to that constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, give to the minority in the new provinces <lb/>
the same rights and privileges
that are given <lb/>
to the minorities in the provinces of Quebec <lb/>
and Ontario. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p>This is a plain a declaration as could<lb/>
            be made that he is obliged by the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion to do what he is doing—that he must <lb/>
take the course he does or otherwise he will <lb/>
not be doing right. I leave the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister and the Minister of Finance to settle <lb/>
this difference between themselves. But I <lb/>
take the declaration of the Prime Minister. <lb/>
I understand his reasoning to be that, as sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 of the British North America Act <lb/>
provides that certain rights enjoyed before <lb/>
confederation must be continued after com<lb break="no"/>ing into the union, he feels compelled to <lb/>
take the course he does. He says, if I under<lb break="no"/>stand him correctly. The Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories have a form of
government, and <lb/>
under that form they have established sepa<lb break="no"/>rate schools ; and, now that We are esta<lb break="no"/>blishing the provinces by these
Autonomy <lb/>
Bills, we must provide for the perpetuation <lb/>
of the separate school privilege. <lb/>

               particular time, which he calls—improperly 
               <lb/>
               I think—the union, he is obliged under the 
               <lb/>
               constitution to provide in the Bills now be<lb break="no"/>fore us for the continuation of the system 
               <lb/>
               of separate schools. Now, my understanding 
               <lb/>
               of the constitution is that subsections 2 and 
               <lb/>
               3 of clause 93 of the British North America 
               <lb/>
               Act was intended to apply to provinces that 
               <lb/>
               had provincial autonomy before entering 
               <lb/>
               the union. Even at the time of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion there were provinces, Prince Edward 
               <lb/>
               Island and British Columbia, which did not 
               <lb/>
               then enter the union, but which have entered 
               <lb/>
               since. Had either of these had a system of 
               <lb/>
               separate schools before entering the union, 
               <lb/>
               these subsections of clause 93 would apply, 
               <lb/>
as it applied also to Ontario and Quebec. 
               <lb/>
But these subsections do not apply in 
               <lb/>
               the case before us at all. Because, these 
               <lb/>
               provinces are being carved out of territory 
               <lb/>
               that is already in the union, and never had 
               <lb/>
               provincial autonomy, but has had only such 
               <lb/>
               legislative authority as was delegated by 
               <lb/>
               this parliament under laws made in 1875 
               <lb/>
               and later. The contention of the First 
               <lb/>
               Minister, as I have said, is that because 
               <lb/>
               they have separate schools we must per<lb break="no"/>petuate that system. But is that the con<lb break="no"/>tention of the Finance Minister (Mr. Field<lb break="no"/>ing) as well ?

               the principles of constitutional government,

               one of which is that a cabinet shall not

               Finance how long he has taken to analyze 
               <lb/>
               this Bill and reach the conclusion he has 
               <lb/>
               reached? We were told he did not see in the

               light in which he now sees it until a short 
               <lb/>
               time ago. He may claim to be excused on

               that ground for not having a very definite

               knowledge of the measure. But the 
               <lb/>
               father of the Bill says, that the constitution 
               <lb/>
               compels him to do what he now proposes. 
               <lb/>
               Now, to satisfy myself I thought I would

               apply to an authority whose opinion would 
               <lb/>
               be respected in this House, one who I have

               <lb/>
               approvingly more than once. I say this be<lb break="no"/>cause the contention was set up that on 
               <lb/>
               account of separate schools being there to<lb break="no"/>day, we were not free, in giving the prov<lb break="no"/>inces provincial autonomy, to ignore those

               schools and allow the provinces to legislate 
               <lb/>
               according to their own judgment. I submit<lb break="no"/>ted the question to Mr. Christopher Robin<lb break="no"/>son, K.C., who is well known I think, as

               high a constitutional lawyer as can be

     The date of the union was antecedent, in

     therefore there was no power in the land

     The right of the Dominion parliament to

     <lb/>

     such restriction, or whether it exists otherwise,

     That was the contention in 1896—that the

     federal parllament was not compelled to 
     <lb/>
     legislate. He was advocating non-interfer<lb break="no"/>ence with provincial rights; he was ques<lb break="no"/>tioning the wisdom of a Remedial Bill on 
     <lb/>
     the ground that it might create a grievance 
     <lb/>
     for the majority that was quite equal to the

     Now, I want to say one word with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the British North America Act as a lay<lb break="no"/>man. I suppose it will have not much 
     <lb/>
     weight with the lawyers of this House, and 
     <lb/>
     it may not have much weight with the lay<lb break="no"/>men ; but I hope it will at least have some 
     <lb/>
     weight with the common sense intelligence 
     <lb/>
     of the people of this country. My under<lb break="no"/>standing of the respective rights and duties 
     <lb/>
     of the federal parliament and the provin<lb break="no"/>cial parliament is something like the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing: At confederation each was assigned 
     <lb/>
     its rights; each was given the class of sub<lb break="no"/>jects upon which it had an exclusive right 
     <lb/>
     to legislate. There were subjects on which 
     <lb/>
     each had an exclusive right; there were 
     <lb/>
     other subjects on which they had a joint 
     <lb/>
     right, and there were other subjects not in<lb break="no"/>cluded in either on which both might pro<lb break="no"/>perly legislate. The British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act puts the rights belonging to the prov<lb break="no"/>inces in one schedule, and the rights belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the federal parliament in another. 
     <lb/>
     Everything concerning local government is 
     <lb/>
     given to the provincial parliament, and 
     <lb/>
     everything concerning trade and commerce 
     <lb/>
     and national undertakings is given to the 
     <lb/>
     federal parliament. But it was never in<lb break="no"/>tended that the federal parliament should 
     <lb/>
     infringe on any of the subjects which were 
     <lb/>
     assigned exclusively to the provincial par<lb break="no"/>liament, and education was one of these 
     <lb/>
     subjects. I have before me a little work

which I have read sometimes with interest.<lb/>It is entitled "The Powers of Canadian Par<lb/>liaments.' by S. J. Watson, of Toronto, who<lb/>has evidently given a good deal of atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the subject He first states the re<lb break="no"/>served rights that were given to the federal<lb/>parliament: regulation of trade and com<lb break="no"/>merce, postal service, military and naval<lb/>service and defence, navigation and ship<lb break="no"/>ping, currently and coinage, banking and the<lb/>issue of paper money, insolvency. Then he <lb/>deals with those rights reserved exclusively<lb/>to the provincial legislatures: amendments <lb/>from time to time in their constitutions,<lb/>municipal institutions in the province, local<lb/>works and undertakings other than such as<lb/>are excepted in subsection 10, the incorpora<lb break="no"/>tion of companies with provincial objects,<lb/>properly and civil rights, education. Educa<lb break="no"/>tion is, therefore, one of the exclusive rights<lb/>of the provinces ; it is only the province<lb/>which has the right to legislate with regard<lb/>to education. I hold that to be the correct<lb/>principle, and whenever this parliament is<lb/>legislating in regard to be the correct<lb/>principle, and whenever this parliament is<lb/>legislating in regard to education it is in<lb break="no"/>fringing on the rights of the provinces.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But I am told there is a provision in sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 of the British North America Act<lb/>that gives us power to legislate. In what <lb/>regard? In one regard and one regard only,<lb/>that is, by remedial legislation. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor in Council, acting as a court, has ap<lb break="no"/>pellate jurisdiction in cases of the infringe<lb break="no"/>ment of the rights that belong to minorities.<lb/>It may be appealed to by the minority for<lb/>the restoration of those rights. Then the <lb/>Privy Counell becomes a court of appeal,<lb/>not a legislative body, and if they think<lb/>those rights have been taken away, and<lb/>they fail to persuade the provincial author<lb break="no"/>ity to restore those rights, then, and not<lb/>till then, their power as a court ceases, and <lb/>they the federal parliament steps in with its<lb/>legislative right. That is the only time <lb/>we can interfere as a federal parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. We can then pass a Remedial<lb/>Bill, but we can only do that, as the first<lb/>minister said, if in our judgment it is good<lb/>public policy to do it, or we can leave it<lb/>alone. That is the only provision in the<lb/>British North America Act, in my judgement,<lb/>giving us any rights to legislate with regard<lb/>to education.<lb/>

     With regard to this measure, I want to 
     <lb/>say that the government have at last under<lb break="no"/>taken to do what they should have done<lb/>long ago, and they are confronted with a<lb/>great many difficulties which they have<lb/>brought upon themselves. These difficulties<lb/>might have been very much minimized had<lb/>they taken the advice of this side of the<lb/>House, and erected the Territories into a<lb/>province or provinces long ago. Had they<lb/>given provincial autonomy to the Northwest<lb/>Territories years ago, before vested rights<lb/>grew up to the extent to which they exist <lb/>to-day, and before the population had in<lb break="no"/>creased to the numbers it has reached to<lb break="no"/>

     day, they would have had much less diffi<lb break="no"/>culty then they have at the present time.<lb/>Their difficulties have multipled in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to the delay that has occurred. The<lb/>disproportion in size between the province<lb/>of Manitoba and the two provinces which<lb/>they contemplate creating now is very great.<lb/>The one is very small and the others are<lb/>very large. What excuse can they give for<lb/>being unable to extend the boundaries of<lb/>Manitoba? The existence of vested rights<lb/>in the Northwest Territories, the growth of<lb/>settlement, and certain other things which<lb/>did not exist years ago. There would have<lb/>been very little difficulty in extending the<lb/>boundaries of Manitoba if the governemnt<lb/>had undertaken this question at an earlier<lb/>date.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Because settlement has gone on there since, 
     <lb/>and owing to that settlement, and owing to<lb/>those vested rights, they find it difficult to<lb/>act to-day. The principle upon which the<lb/>financial arrangements are based is almost<lb/>sure, in my judgment, to create dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction in the other provinces. I feel quite<lb/>satisfied that that will be the case. When <lb/>the other provinces come to know and con<lb break="no"/>tains for financial assistance to these two<lb/>provinces, they will recognize at once that<lb/>it is much more liberal than the terms which<lb/>they enjoy to-day, or which they have had<lb/>in the past, and this will create discontent,<lb/>and will bring them knocking at the doors<lb/>of parliament for a rearrangement of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial subsidies. It is very liberal, I ad<lb break="no"/>mit ; I am not complaining of that, so much<lb/>as of the fact that it will give us trouble in<lb/>the future, perhaps in the very near future.<lb/>In undertaking to do out duty as a federal <lb/>parliament and to create provinces in the<lb/>Territories already in the union, we are<lb/>told that we must treat those Territories as<lb/>though they were provinces which are<lb/>entering the union to-day. I need not refer<lb/>to that again fully, because I have already<lb/>done so. We may properly erect provinces;<lb/>and in giving them provincial autonomy,<lb/>we are bound to give them all the rights<lb/>which the British North America Act says<lb/>they should have, and one of these is the<lb/>right to legislate upon education. Now, I<lb/>say that, as a matter of policy, as a matter<lb/>of duty, according to my understanding of<lb/>the constitution, when we erect these Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories into provinces, we are bound to<lb/>give them all the rights of legislation, all<lb/>the provincial rights, that our constitution<lb/>provides they should have and enjoy ; and<lb/>if we give less, we are likely to cause fric<lb break="no"/>tion and trouble. If we go beyond that, we<lb/>are encroaching upon provincial rights. I <lb/>say we are now going beyond that, and <lb/>therefore I object to that encroachment on<lb/>provincial rights. Have we, as a federal<lb/>parliament, the right to go beyond that ?<lb/>I have given my reasons for thinking that<lb/>

     The British North America Act, in assign<lb break="no"/>ing the rights and power to the parliament 
     <lb/>
     of Canada and the provincial powers, dis<lb break="no"/>tinctly provides how far we may go, but 
     <lb/>
     nowhere does it contain a provision that 
     <lb/>
     we may legislate with regard to what edu<lb break="no"/>cational system a new province must have, 
     <lb/>
     and when we do that we are doing what, in 
     <lb/>
     my judgment, is improper. The right hon. 
     <lb/>
     the premier seems to assume that the federal 
     <lb/>
     parliament is a supreme body which is 
     <lb/>
     over and above the provincial parliaments, 
     <lb/>
     and which can, of its own will, exercise a 
     <lb/>
     patronizing or paternal control to the ex<lb break="no"/>tent of compelling the provincial parlia<lb break="no"/>ments to do what they do not desire to do. 
     <lb/>
     Talk about being a supreme body ! What 
     <lb/>
     does Watson say in regard to it ? The 
     <lb/>
     federal parliament is not a supreme body 
     <lb/>
     at all, it has no over-towering powers, it 
     <lb/>
     has no powers that are so much above or 
     <lb/>
     beyond a provincial parliament that it can

     He argued that we had a federal parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, why ? Because the provincial parlia<lb break="no"/>ments gave up part of their powers to make

     it, but that the provincial powers were 
     <lb/>
     supreme, and must always be so within

     parliament and the provinces gave it cer<lb break="no"/>tain powers, and the federal parliament can

vincial parliament, says it cannot do. The 
     <lb/>
     rights of the provincial parliament within 
     <lb/>
     its sphere are supreme and brook no inter<lb break="no"/>ference. I believe that is as true as the 
     <lb/>
     truism given by the premier with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the rights of majorities. It was not 
     <lb/>
     the federal parliament, as I said, which 
     <lb/>
     condescended to give rights to provincla1 
     <lb/>
     parliaments ; the condescension was on the 
     <lb/>
     part of the provincial parliaments, and 
     <lb/>
     they established the federal parliament. 
     <lb/>
     The rights of the provincial parliaments 
     <lb/>
     were an inheritance belonging to them ; 
     <lb/>
     they had inherited their rights and enjoyed 
     <lb/>
     their rights, and any rights or powers which 
     <lb/>
     the federal parliament has to-day are mere 
     <lb/>
     hereditary rights given to it by the provin<lb break="no"/>cial parliaments ; therefore, the provincial 
     <lb/>
     parliaments ought to be supreme and are 
     <lb/>
     supreme within their own jurisdiction. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The educational clauses in this Bill are 
     <lb/>
     purely an interference, in my judgment, 
     <lb/>
     with provincial rights, and on this ground I 
     <lb/>
     am opposed to them. I do not mean that I 
     <lb/>
     am opposed to the whole Bill, but I am op<lb break="no"/>posed to the educational clauses. The 
     <lb/>
     struggles which have taken place in the past 
     <lb/>
    with regard to provincial rights, and the 
     <lb/>contention of the Reform party that pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights must be maintained at all 
     <lb/>hazards, ought to be as strongly impressed 
     <lb/> upon the minds of the Liberals as it was in 
     <lb/>the past, and they ought to endeavour to 
     <lb/>carry out that principle. They should 
     <lb/>not neglect that principle. We have had 
     <lb/>many fights of this nature. We had the 
     <lb/>struggle over the Streams Bill, and very 
     <lb/>strong feelings were created ; we had it 
     <lb/>over the Boundary Award ; we had it over 
     <lb/>the Hotel Licenses Bill, which was known 
     <lb/>as the McCarthy Act ; we had it over the 
     <lb/>timber and mineral rights of the provinces ; 
     <lb/>we had it over the Manitoba Remedial Bill, 
     <lb/>the New Brunswick School Bill ; and in 
     <lb/>every one of these cases the Reform party 
     <lb/>stood on the same ground, that is, in de<lb break="no"/>fence of provincial rights. Where are they

ing his wigwam and met a traveller in 
     <lb/>
     the forest. He asked the traveller if he 
     <lb/>
     could tell him where he was. 'Why,' the 
     <lb/>
     traveller said, "you are an Indian. Are you 
     <lb/>
     lost?' 'No,' said he, 'but the Wigwam is 
     <lb/>
     lost.' In like manner, while the principle 
     <lb/>
     remains, these hon. gentlemen opposite have 
     <lb/>
     drifted away from their wigwam. They 
     <lb/>
     have taken another track, and are advocat<lb break="no"/>ing principles the very opposite of those 
     <lb/>
     they formerly contended for. I would ask 
     <lb/>
     the Reformers of Ontario how they will 
     <lb/>
     justify their conduct of to-day before the 
     <lb/>
     people of that province ? I remember when 
     <lb/>
     a motion was made in this House calling on 
     <lb/>
     the British authorities to grant home rule 
     <lb/>
     to Ireland. Every Reformer. without a 
     <lb/>
     single exception, voted for it. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Sir WILLIAM MULOCK</persName>. How did the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman vote ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I can tell him very well 
     <lb/>
     if he would like to know.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MULO1">Sir WILLIAM MULOCK</persName>. I certainly 
     <lb/>
     would. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. They contended that 
     <lb/>
     home rule for Ireland was the proper prin<lb break="no"/>ciple. They were advocating giving home 
     <lb/>
     rule to a territory over which they had no 
     <lb/>
     control, but when they have in their own 
     <lb/>
     country a territory to which they are giving 
     <lb/>
     provincial autonomy, they refuse to give 
     <lb/>
     it home rule. Where they have the power 
     <lb/>
     to give home rule they will not do it ; but 
     <lb/>
     where they have no power they insist on its 
     <lb/>
     being given. They are something like Mark 
     <lb/>
     Twain who was willing to sacrifice all his 
     <lb/>
     wife's relations on the alter of his country. 
     <lb/>
     In like manner these hon. gentlemen are 
     <lb/>
     willing to sacrifice every one of their prin<lb break="no"/>ciples in order to keep office. They are evi<lb break="no"/>dently not in accord on the principle of 
     <lb/>
     home rule because if they were they would 
     <lb/>
     give the Territories the fullest measure of 
     <lb/>
     self government and political autonomy but 
     <lb/>
     in reality we are not. Can it be said that 
     <lb/>
     we are granting them full provincial auton<lb break="no"/>omy, when we interfere with their rights 
     <lb/>
     to deal with education, although it is ex<lb break="no"/>pressly laid down in the British North 
     <lb/>
     America Act that the provinces shall exclu<lb break="no"/>sively make laws on that subject. If we 
     <lb/>
     compel them to adopt an educational system 
     <lb/>
     which we prescribe, though it may be quite 
     <lb/>
     unsuited to their needs and conditions, are 
     <lb/>
     we giving them home rule? But we are 
     <lb/>
     told that the fathers of confederation ac<lb break="no"/>cepted the principle of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     rather than jeopardize confederation. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     the great principle was not that of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools. The great difficulty the fathers of 
     <lb/>
     confederation had to confront was the dead<lb break="no"/>lock between the different sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House. It was not the question of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools which was the disturbing element 
     <lb/>
     between upper and lower Canada. Not at 
     <lb/>
     all. But when the fathers of confederation 
     <lb/>
     were enacting the British North America 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3028</fw>
          

     Act, they had to provide for the conditions 
     <lb/>
     that existed in these two provinces and con<lb break="no"/>sequently had to provide for separate schools. 
     <lb/>
     They acceptedthe conditions existing in 
     <lb/>
     Ontario and Quebec and provided that 
     <lb/>
     should other provinces come in with similar 
     <lb/>
     rights in existence, these rights should con<lb break="no"/>tinue. But there were four provinces enter<lb break="no"/>ing confederation which had not these 
     <lb/>
     rights. If however the principle of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools was established at confederation, 
     <lb/>
     why do we not have it in these four pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This clause which is objected to, said the 
     <lb/>
     right hon. gentleman, is the law to-day, it 
     <lb/>
     is in accordance with the constitution, and 
     <lb/>
     I commend it even to the biased judgment of 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend from East Grey. He referr<lb break="no"/>ed to the hon. member from East Grey in 
     <lb/>
     different lights that day. and I think in a 
     <lb/>
     manner quite uncalled for and which did 
     <lb/>
     not come with the best grace from one 
     <lb/>
     occupying the dignified position of Premier 
     <lb/>
     of this Dominion. It was a gratuitous as<lb break="no"/>sumption on his part that the member for 
     <lb/>
     East Grey has a biased mind and is not 
     <lb/>
     fair. No one, he said, is so blind as the one 
     <lb/>
     who will not see, and of course the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member for East Grey was in that category. 
     <lb/>
     Well, I think that the hon. member for East 
     <lb/>
     Grey ought to be credited with possessing 
     <lb/>
     the ordinary intelligence which the aver<lb break="no"/>age member of parliament is usually credit<lb break="no"/>ed with. If we were in 1867 instead of 1905 
     <lb/>
     and if we had to introduce into the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion the provinces of Alberta and Saskatche<lb break="no"/>wan, would we not. asks the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, have to give these provinces the 
     <lb/>
     same rights and privileges with regard to 
     <lb/>
     separate schools as we gave Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ? I say emphatically no, and I am 
     <lb/>
     confirmed in that conclusion by the advice 
     <lb/>
     of that high authority, Mr. Christopher 
     <lb/>
     Robinson, whose opinion I have cited. In 
     <lb/>
     my judgment the question we have to settle 
     <lb/>
     is this. Is it proper to interfere with the 
     <lb/>
     rights of these provinces in the matter of 
     <lb/>
     education ? The Minister of Finance says 
     <lb/>
     there is a moral obligation resting on us to 
     <lb/>
     do it. But is that moral obligation suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently strong to justify our interfering with 
     <lb/>
     provincial rights and compelling the major<lb break="no"/>ity of the country to do what they say it is 
     <lb/>
     impossible to carry out successfully under 
     <lb/>
     their present conditions. Would that be sound 
     <lb/>
     policy? These are the questions that ap<lb break="no"/>peal to our judgment to-day. In the first 
     <lb/>
     place is it right, as a question of principle ? 
     <lb/>
     In the second place is it sound as a question 
     <lb/>
     of policy? It might possibly be right in 
     <lb/>
     principle and still not be sound as a matter 
     <lb/>
     of policy. As a matter of policy is it wise 
     <lb/>
     to compel the people to provide for separate 
     <lb/>
     schools for all time whether suited to the 
     <lb/>
     conditions out there or not ? I do not think 
     <lb/>
     it is and am therefore opposed to any inter<lb break="no"/>ference with provincial rights. If we grant 
     <lb/>
     educational rights to one church. we must 
     <lb/>
     logically grant them to every church. These 
     <lb/>

     are practically church schools though called 
     <lb/>
     separate schools. What kind of system 
     <lb/>
     have they in France ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. A very bad system. I 
     <lb/>
     stand for the British system.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. They have a system of 
     <lb/>
     national schools. France is a great country 
     <lb/>
     and I admire it. How long is it since they 
     <lb/>
     have taken the schools out of the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the church? Only a short time. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. Do you approve of that? 
     <lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Why did they do it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. The church got bad. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is your statement 
     <lb/>
     not mine, and the hon. gentleman knows 
     <lb/>
     more about it than I do. But here is the 
     <lb/>
     question that appeals to my mind. If for 
     <lb/>
     centuries past the education of the French 
     <lb/>
     people has been under the wing of the 
     <lb/>
     church and the church has directed it and 
     <lb/>
     worked into it its religious tenets and dog<lb break="no"/>ma, and it has resulted in giving them an 
     <lb/>
     uneducated people. I was told by a 
     <lb/>
     Frenchman a short time ago that France 
     <lb/>
     is a nation of atheists today. I was 
     <lb/>
     told that by a Frenchman who ought 
     <lb/>
     to know. And, if that is what has been 
     <lb/>
     accomplished with full control of edu<lb break="no"/>cation in the hands of the church—if it 
     <lb/>
     means the turning out of a nation of illiter<lb break="no"/>ates and atheists, then surely, it is not amiss 
     <lb/>
     to place education wholly beyond the con<lb break="no"/>trol of the church. Is not that one of the 
     <lb/>
     strongest arguments that could be found in 
     <lb/>
     favour of that course ? And that is the 
     <lb/>
     very reason that France is following that 
     <lb/>
     course to-day. President Loubet declares 
     <lb/>
     that it is proper and right, and that France 
     <lb/>
     must do it. And if we try to keep education 
     <lb/>
     flee from the control of the same church, 
     <lb/>
     is it to be said that we are fanatics? I can<lb break="no"/>not recall all the names that are applied to 
     <lb/>
     us— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. Narrow-minded. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is one. And we are 
     <lb/>
     told that we are bigoted. But there is an<lb break="no"/>other word— 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. Fanatical. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Yes, we are told that 
     <lb/>
     we are fanatics and prejudiced against the 
     <lb/>
     church. But if we endeavour to do what 
     <lb/>
     France declares is imperative for the main<lb break="no"/>tenance of her national life, are we to be 
     <lb/>
     accused of being fanatics ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. Will the hon. gentleman

            </p>

     with a case nearer home. Would the hon.

     I ask are we to be blamed for doing what

     France has done ? Are we to be blamed for 
     <lb/>
     doing what Belgium has done ? Are we to 
     <lb/>
     be blamed for doing what Italy has done,— 
     <lb/>
     the very home of the Pope ? In that country 
     <lb/>
     the schools have been taken out of the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the church. Are we to be blamed 
     <lb/>
     for advancing a similar course here to 
     <lb/>
     that which has been taken in Ireland, esta<lb break="no"/>blishing and carrying on national schools ? 
     <lb/>
     Are we to be blamed for doing what has 
     <lb/>
     been done in the Australian colonies and in 
     <lb/>
     the United States? Above all are we to 
     <lb/>
     be blamed for doing what five out of the 
     <lb/>
     seven provinces of the confederation are do<lb break="no"/>ing to-day, carrying out a national school 
     <lb/>
     system ? When we take such a course, can 
     <lb/>
     this be said to be proof of fanaticism on our 
     <lb/>
     part ? I do not think it is fanaticism. I 
     <lb/>
     do not wish to say a word that would be 
     <lb/>
     offensive to our Roman Catholic fellow- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     subjects. I admire their zeal, their piety 
     <lb/>
     and their attachment to their church. No 
     <lb/>
     one admires these things more than I do. 
     <lb/>
     No one is less disposed to deprive them of 
     <lb/>
     their rights than I am. But, because I 
     <lb/>
     believe that, forty years ago we discarded 
     <lb/>
     a bad system of education and adopted a 
     <lb/>
     better one; and because I believe that we 
     <lb/>
     ought to carry out in the interests of the 
     <lb/>
     rising generation, keeping the system free 
     <lb/>
     from the control of any church, am I to be 
     <lb/>
     accused of fanaticism ? I have just said 
     <lb/>
     if you grant church schools at all, to be 
     <lb/>
     logical you cannot confine that privilege to 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholic church; you must 
     <lb/>
     grant them to every other denomination as 
     <lb/>
     well.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is the question I 
     <lb/>
     asked. This Bill proposes to hand it over 
     <lb/>
     to one church. My contention is that no 
     <lb/>
     church should be allowed to control it. In 
     <lb/>
     my opinion it is as improper to give the 
     <lb/>
     control of education to the Methodist church 
     <lb/>
     or the Presbyterian or the Baptist or the 
     <lb/>
     Luthern or the Mormon as it would be to 
     <lb/>
     give it to the Catholic Church—they are all 
     <lb/>
     in the same category according to my judg<lb break="no"/>ment. The state should provide the means 
     <lb/>
     of education and should control education. 
     <lb/>
     We should have a state system of educa<lb break="no"/>tion as we have in some parts of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion to-day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAMP3">Mr. CAMPBELL</persName>. Will the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule) tell us what is the dif<lb break="no"/>ference between the schools that are pro<lb break="no"/>posed to be established in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories and that he calls separate schools 
     <lb/>
     on the one hand, and the public schools on 
     <lb/>
     the other hand ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That is not relevant to 
     <lb/>
     the purposes of my argument. I am not say<lb break="no"/>ing anything about the quality of the schools 
     <lb/>
     as they are to-day, but I am talking about 
     <lb/>
     the interference with the powers of the 
     <lb/>
     provincial legislature, to give whatever sys<lb break="no"/>tem of schools they think best. Now we can 
     <lb/>
     find some countries where this particular 
     <lb/>
     school system does prevail. Where does it 
     <lb/>
     prevail ?

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Not at all. You have 
     <lb/>
     there what the hon. gentleman (Mr. Armand 
     <lb/>
     Lavergne) would call a national system. 
     <lb/>
     But the peculiar system to which I have 
     <lb/>
     referred is used in Newfoundland. Every 
     <lb/>
     denomination has its own schools and the 
     <lb/>
     public money devoted to education is divided 
     <lb/>
     amongst them. And I have a letter from 
     <lb/>
     a very intelligent gentleman there, who 
     <lb/>
     says : God forbid that you should drift into 
     <lb/>
     the educational methods that we have here.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. He is a Scotchman like 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman (Mr. A. Johnston), but 
     <lb/>
     he does not come from South Cape Breton, 
     <lb/>
     and his name is not Johnston. He tells me 
     <lb/>
     that the public money devoted to education 
     <lb/>
     is divided amongst these denominations, 
     <lb/>
     and he adds : Our educational system is a 
     <lb/>
     disgrace to the civilization of the twentieth 
     <lb/>
     century. Are we desirous of going back to 
     <lb/>
     that condition in the Northwest Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     Yet, it is the only logical thing we can do 
     <lb/>

     if we follow out the principles of this Bill. 
     <lb/>
     The separation of church and state is one of 
     <lb/>
     the principles that we fought for long ago. 
     <lb/>
     Are we desirous of throwing away to-day 
     <lb/>
     all that we have gained in this respect ? I 
     <lb/>
     say that this Bill which is a violation of that 
     <lb/>
     principle, it is a re-union of the church and 
     <lb/>
     the state by which education will be handed 
     <lb/>
     over to church control.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. Will the hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Sproule) tell me how these separate 
     <lb/>
     schools of the Northwest will be under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the church and not under the 
     <lb/>
     control of the state ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The minister refers to a 
     <lb/>
     condition of things different from the or<lb break="no"/>dinary separate schools. He has always 
     <lb/>
     been defending the system in Quebec and 
     <lb/>
     Ontario. I am speaking of the system in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec and Ontario where schools are un<lb break="no"/>der the control of the church. Does the 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman deny that in his own pro<lb break="no"/>vince ?

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. I am speaking of the

     system existing in the Northwest Territores. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I am speaking of the 
     <lb/>
     desire to perpetuate a system which will 
     <lb/>
     practically put the control of the schools 
     <lb/>
     under the church, where the money for the 
     <lb/>
     support of those schools must go to the 
     <lb/>
     church indirectly. Then this is a union of 
     <lb/>
     church and state. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. My hon. friend will ad<lb break="no"/>mit that so far as the Northwest is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, there is no provision in the Bill now 
     <lb/>
     before the House by which the schools shall 
     <lb/>
     be under the control of the church. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I do not say that the 
     <lb/>
     church has any improper control over them 
     <lb/>
     in the Northwest. I am talking about the 
     <lb/>
     principle involved in taking away from the 
     <lb/>
     provinces the right of control, and compell<lb break="no"/>ing them to establish a system they do not 
     <lb/>
     want. Remember I am not condemning the 
     <lb/>
     educational system there to-day, nor am I 
     <lb/>
     fighting to do away with that system; I am 
     <lb/>
     fighting for the right of the provinces to 
     <lb/>
     establish whatever system they choose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. Did not my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend say a moment ago that the system 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools was bad ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Yes, the system that we 
     <lb/>
     have in Ontario and Quebec is bad. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MACL4">Mr. W. F. MACLEAN</persName>. The national sys<lb break="no"/>tem is better—that is the way to put it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Now if the legislatures 
     <lb/>
     of those provinces, in the exercise of their 
     <lb/>
     undoubted right, see fit to establish sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools to-morrow, I have not a word 
     <lb/>
     of objection to it. It is their own business, 
     <lb/>
     their own right. We are not fighting 
     <lb/>

          <fw type="num">3033</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 23, 1905</fw> 
      


     against that, we are not proposing to give 
     <lb/>
     them advice with regard to what they shall 
     <lb/>
     do ; we are only fighting for their right to 
     <lb/>
     establish such a system as suits their con<lb break="no"/>ditions. We are not condemning them for 
     <lb/>
     what they may or may not do in the future, 
     <lb/>
     we are not even advising them. Let them 
     <lb/>
     do as they like. If they wish to re-enact 
     <lb/>
     the present educational system, and re<lb break="no"/>enact the ordinances relating to the separate 
     <lb/>
     school system that they have there to-day, 
     <lb/>
     we have not a word of complaint against 
     <lb/>
     their doing so. But we say, Do not bind 
     <lb/>
     them with a chain that prevents them from 
     <lb/>
     doing what the constitution says they have 
     <lb/>
     a right to do and ought to be allowed to 
     <lb/>
     do. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Now the next question I shall consider 
     <lb/>
     is, Who are asking for educational rights 
     <lb/>
     for minorities in those provinces ? Are the 
     <lb/>
     people in those provinces complaining, even 
     <lb/>
     the Roman Catholics, who, according to the 
     <lb/>
     census, number 30,000 ? So far as I know 
     <lb/>
     we have not had a single petition presented 
     <lb/>
     to this House from any of them asking that 
     <lb/>
     the provisions of this Bill be put through. 
     <lb/>
     Then why are we to be blamed if we say 
     <lb/>
     that these provisions are not needed there ? 
     <lb/>
     The people there do not think they are 
     <lb/>
     needed, as otherwise I presume they would 
     <lb/>
     ask for them. So far as I know we have 
     <lb/>
     not yet received a single petition from that 
     <lb/>
     country asking that the new provinces be 
     <lb/>
     compelled to adopt that system ; so far as I 
     <lb/>
     know not a single memorial of any des<lb break="no"/>criptlon has come from that vast country 
     <lb/>
     asking us to adopt that system, though there 
     <lb/>
     are supposed to be 500,000 people in that 
     <lb/>
     country. Who is asking for it ? Not the 
     <lb/>
     legislature of those Territories, because the 
     <lb/>
     Prime Minister of the Northwest legislature 
     <lb/>
     has declared that these school provisions are 
     <lb/>
     an improper interference with their rights, 
     <lb/>
     and he is opposed to them. He is speaking 
     <lb/>
     on behalf of that country , on behalf of all 
     <lb/>
     the people. Neither the majority nor the 
     <lb/>
     minority seems to be desirous of having this 
     <lb/>
     provision in the Bill. They have not 
     <lb/>
     asked their legislature for any change. 
     <lb/>
     Then I say, why should we force it upon 
     <lb/>
     them ? Are we not coercing them ? Then 
     <lb/>
     who are asking for it ? It is not the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces of the confederation who 
     <lb/>
     have no separate schools. Five out of 
     <lb/>
     the seven provinces of the confederation 
     <lb/>
     have no separate schools ; British Columbia 
     <lb/>
     has none, Manitoba has none, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick and Nova Scotia have none, nor 
     <lb/>
     has Prince Edward Island. They are 
     <lb/>
     not asking for this measure, because they 
     <lb/>
     won't have it at home. Then we may as<lb break="no"/>sume they do not want it. Is Ontario ask<lb break="no"/>ing for it ? Up to the present time I think 
     <lb/>
     but one petition has come from Ontario re<lb break="no"/>commending that the provisions in the Bill 
     <lb/>
     be put through. Then who is asking for it ? 
     <lb/>
     Not the provinces who do not enjoy that 
     <lb/>
     system to-day. The only parties who are 
     <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3034</fw>
  

     clamouring for it are the clergy and the 
     <lb/>
     people of the province of Quebec. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TALB1">Mr. O. E. TALBOT</persName>. It was the Jacques 
     <lb/>
     Cartier Club who started the movement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That may be, that club 
     <lb/>
     is composed of a portion of the people of 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. But I am not denying them the 
     <lb/>
     right to do so, it is perfectly proper for 
     <lb/>
     them to do so. But I say this demand 
     <lb/>
     comes only from the clergy and the people 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec, who are asking us to force this 
     <lb/>
     system on an unwilling people. What is 
     <lb/>
     the situation to-day ? Quebec is thousands  
     <lb/>
     of miles removed from that country. The  
     <lb/>
     great bulk of the people of Quebec know  
     <lb/>
     little about the conditions out there, and 
     <lb/>
     know little about the school system. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. The people of Que<lb break="no"/>bec have many relatives in the Northwest. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. They have, and those 
     <lb/>
     relatives have not even asked for it, they 
     <lb/>
     are satisfied. Then why should Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     that is thousands of miles away from that 
     <lb/>
     country, force this Bill on an unwilling peo<lb break="no"/>ple ? Do they know anything about the 
     <lb/>
     conditions out there ? Do they know any<lb break="no"/>thing about the possibility of keeping up 
     <lb/>
     such a system there ? The people out 
     <lb/>
     there know better than any others the con<lb break="no"/>ditions prevailing in that country. It does 
     <lb/>
     not necessarily follow that because separate 
     <lb/>
     schools can be carried out successfully in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec they can be carried 
     <lb/>
     out with equal success in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories. Why do I say so ? Because 
     <lb/>
     the conditons are altogether different. How 
     <lb/>
     wide is the average farm in Quebec? Fifteen 
     <lb/>
     rods, I think. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANON1">An hon. MEMBER</persName>. More than that. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Well, it cannot be more 
     <lb/>
     than twenty rods, because I notice there 
     <lb/>
     are four of them in a width of eighty rods 
     <lb/>
     on the river with one settler on each in 
     <lb/>
     Quebec. The houses are principally on the 
     <lb/>
     river front, where there is a river, and there 
     <lb/>
     is a family every twenty rods. The houses 
     <lb/>
     are so thickly located along these rivers that 
     <lb/>
     for miles and miles they look almost like 
     <lb/>
     villages. There is therefore great commun<lb break="no"/>ity of interest among them, the population is 
     <lb/>
     numerous, and they can keep up schools 
     <lb/>
     without any difficulty, it is not a heavy bur<lb break="no"/>den for them to do so. Now I have made a 
     <lb/>
     little calculation on this point. In the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec how many families have 
     <lb/>
     you to the square mile ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LAVE1">Mr. A. LAVERGNE</persName>. Two families and a 
     <lb/>
     lot of children. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. According to the way 
     <lb/>
     their farms are laid out on the river front, 
     <lb/>
     you have at least twenty-one and a third 
     <lb/>
     families to the square mile, and every one 
     <lb/>
     of them has about a quarter of a hundred 
     <lb/>

     children. They can fill the schools. I am 
     <lb/>
     glad of it and they are entitled to great credit 
     <lb/>
     for it ? How many families are there to the 
     <lb/>
     mile square in the Northwest Territories ? 
     <lb/>
     Taking the ordinary farm that is owned up 
     <lb/>
     there you would have but four families. 
     <lb/>
     How many miles square of that territory 
     <lb/>
     will it require to provide children enough to 
     <lb/>
     fill a school ? Do you not see if you divide 
     <lb/>
     the people up according to religious belief 
     <lb/>
     in one locality, part Protestant and part 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholic, you reduce the number 
     <lb/>
     of available people to support a school 
     <lb/>
     there, and therefore it may be quite 
     <lb/>
     impossible to carry on such an educat<lb break="no"/>ional system as would be quite suit<lb break="no"/>able and easily carried on in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. What do we find in regard 
     <lb/>
     to the same inquiry in Manitoba and some<lb break="no"/>what similar conditions exist up there ? 
     <lb/>
     How many children have they in their 
     <lb/>
     schools in the province of Manitoba ? I 
     <lb/>
     have the list for 1894 : Woodlands nine, 
     <lb/>
     Ossowo five, Oakland eight, White Haven 
     <lb/>
     six, Silver Creek nine, West Oakland seven, 
     <lb/>
     and I find that the average attendance is 
     <lb/>
     about four. There is not one school in fifty 
     <lb/>
     that has an average attendance of ten. 
     <lb/>
     What is that caused by ? By the sparseness 
     <lb/>
     of the population. The people have their 
     <lb/>
     farms in the west larger than they have their 
     <lb/>
     farms in Quebec and larger than they have 
     <lb/>
     their farms in Ontario, and therefore there 
     <lb/>
     are fewer settlers in the different school 
     <lb/>
     sections. Why is it that separate schools 
     <lb/>
     can never be worked out successfully in 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba and the Northwest Territories un<lb break="no"/>less it be in the villages and towns ? It is 
     <lb/>
     due to the fact that you have only four 
     <lb/>
     families to the mile and when you divide 
     <lb/>
     them, there are only two Catholic and two 
     <lb/>
     Protestant families. They are thus separ<lb break="no"/>ated and there is no support for the schools. 
     <lb/>
     The burden becomes too great. It is too 
     <lb/>
     onerous. If they get up schools at all they 
     <lb/>
     must hire inferior teachers because the 
     <lb/>
     salaries they pay must be very low and the 
     <lb/>
     result of this is a poor school and injustice 
     <lb/>
     to the children who get the only education 
     <lb/>
     they will ever get in such schools. I draw 
     <lb/>
     attention to this to show the conditions that 
     <lb/>
     exist in the Northwest Territories and I ask 
     <lb/>
     what justification there is for the people and 
     <lb/>
     the clergy of the province of Quebec, where 
     <lb/>
     the conditions are entirely different, where 
     <lb/>
     the conditions are such as would enable them 
     <lb/>
     to keep up separate schools, to insist that 
     <lb/>
     separate schools shall be enforced upon these 
     <lb/>
     people in the Northwest Territories ? In 
     <lb/>
     my judgment there is none. Are the people 
     <lb/>
     of Quebec capable of being the best judges ? 
     <lb/>
     They are far removed from the country, 
     <lb/>
     they know little about the conditions or 
     <lb/>
     otherwise I am sure very many of them 
     <lb/>
     would take a different view of the matter.

     us how it is that some years ago he voted 
     <lb/>
     in favour of forcing the government of the

     schools in those territories ?

     <persName ref="pers:BROD2">Mr. BRODEUR</persName>. A Bill was introduced 
     <lb/>
     some years ago when my hon. friend was in 
     <lb/>
     the House providing that separate schools 
     <lb/>
     should be provided in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories and he did not say anything against 
     <lb/>
     such a provision in the Bill.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That was in 1875 before 
     <lb/>
     I was a member of this parliament. If it 
     <lb/>
     had been proposed when I was here I cer<lb break="no"/>tainly would have opposed it. It is true 
     <lb/>
     that the Act has been amended once or 
     <lb/>
     twice since but the question of schools has 
     <lb/>
     never been raised.

     <lb/>
     mistaken. When he was in the House in 
     <lb/>
     1880 the same provision was introduced in 
     <lb/>
     a Bill which was then placed before the

     House. But it was introduced by a Tory 
     <lb/>
     and he never said one word against it.

     section 9 that I did not say that it was a 
     <lb/>
     re-enactment of any section contained in the 
     <lb/>
     Act of 1875. As to the principle embodied 
     <lb/>
     in section 10 it was a re-enactment of the 
     <lb/>
     clause which appeared in the Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     but as to the embodiment in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act of section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act, I think it was the first 
     <lb/>
     time it was incorporated in the Bill.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. That might be and I 
     <lb/>
     would pay no attention to it. I was not 
     <lb/>
     familiar until later years with the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. You might mention any 
     <lb/>
     clause of the British North America Act and 
     <lb/>
     I would not know what it did or did not 
     <lb/>
     apply to. But, as I understand it that was 
     <lb/>
     a simple re-enactment of the Act of 1875 and 
     <lb/>
     if I had known of it then I would have stood 
     <lb/>
     just where I stand to-day. It did not matter

            <p>
     It is contended that immigrants coming 
     <lb/>
     to settle in the Northwest Territories have 
     <lb/>
     been influenced in favour of this country 
     <lb/>
     by the knowledge that there were separate 
     <lb/>
     schools here, in connection with the church 
     <lb/>
     to which they belonged, and that if we do 
     <lb/>
     not perpetuate these schools, we shall do a  
     <lb/>
     great injustice to them and be likely to re<lb break="no"/>tard immigration. Now , I took the trouble 
     <lb/>
     to look up the immigration literature issued 
     <lb/>
     by the present government to ascertain if 
     <lb/>
     there was anything to justify that state<lb break="no"/>ment, and I could not find anything at all. 
     <lb/>
     Here is one of the important pamphlets dis<lb break="no"/>tributed by the government, and what does 
     <lb/>
     it say with regard to schools ? It says :

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. This is a government 
     <lb/>
     issue, by authority of the Hon. Clifford 
     <lb/>
     Sifton, Minister of the Interior. It is en<lb break="no"/>titled 'Farms and Farmers in Western Can<lb break="no"/>ada,' to be distributed in the United States, 
     <lb/>the old country or anywhere else. It also 
     <lb/>sets out that a certain proportion of land 
     <lb/>is set apart for the support of national 
     <lb/>schools, and that the state provides for their 
     <lb/>support and maintenance. This is not an 
     <lb/>evidence that immigrants come to that coun<lb break="no"/>try because of the advantages offered to 
     <lb/>them in the shape of separate schools. I 
     <lb/>may draw attention to another fact, which 
     <lb/>may not be known to many. There have 
     <lb/>been presented to this House from all 
     <lb/>parts of Canada a large number of petit<lb break="no"/>ions against the educational clause of this 
     <lb/>Bill. Petitions have come from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories, with tens of thousands of 
     <lb/>

     signatures, and among them are the names 
     <lb/>
     of many Roman Catholics, who are petition<lb break="no"/>ing parliament to-day not to pass this clause 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill. I have letters in my posses<lb break="no"/>sion drawing attention to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     the names of many Roman Catholics are on 
     <lb/>
     those petitions. I have letters stating that 
     <lb/>
     if petitions had been sent to the Doukho<lb break="no"/>bors, translated into their language, seventy- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     five per cent of them would sign those 
     <lb/>
     petitions ; so would the Galicians, and so 
     <lb/>
     would the Roman Catholics of this country. 
     <lb/>
     The Galicians say : We left one country 
     <lb/>
     because of the tyranny of the church, and we 
     <lb/>
     were told that we were coming to a free 
     <lb/>
     country, and we do not want it in Canada. 
     <lb/>
     They do not want separate schools ; they 
     <lb/>
     want national schools ; and the result is 
     <lb/>
     that none of them are asking for this pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the Bill, while hundreds of them 
     <lb/>
     have deliberately petitioned against it. Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholics in the province of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     have also petitioned against it, very many 
     <lb/>
     of them. I have had petitions sent to me 
     <lb/>
     in large numbers, and my attention has 
     <lb/>
     been drawn to the fact that Roman Catholic 
     <lb/>
     names were on those petitions. In some 
     <lb/>
     instances 1 have know them very well ; 
     <lb/>
     I have known them for years ; and I as<lb break="no"/>sume that they knew what they were seek<lb break="no"/>ing. So I say the Roman Catholics are 
     <lb/>
      not a unit on this question. Many of them 
     <lb/>
     are in favour of national schools, and we are 
     <lb/>
     not to blame because we desire to give them 
     <lb/>
     national schools. I have always under<lb break="no"/>stood that the sentiment of this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     was in favour of national schools and 
     <lb/>
     against interference with the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. I presented one petition from 
     <lb/>
     New Westminister, British Columbia with 
     <lb/>

     to the same effect, declaring that it is 
     <lb/>
     improper for this parliament to interfere 
     <lb/>
     with the rights of the province, and asking 
     <lb/>
     that there be no interference with the rights 
     <lb/>
     of provinces in regard to education. The 
     <lb/>
     church unions all over the country are pas<lb break="no"/>sing resolutions against it. The Orange

     the Protestant minority of Quebec ever had

     everybody is satisfied wth the separate 
     <lb/>
     schools of Ontario. I know that is not a

     fact ; I have heard it over and over again. 
     <lb/>
     I know where a separate school has been 
     <lb/>
     converted into a public school, within a few 
     <lb/>
     miles of where I live, and the reason the 
     <lb/>
     people gave for doing that was that with 
     <lb/>
     their strength divided, the task of keeping 
     <lb/>
     up separate schools was too onerous and 
     <lb/>
     heavy either for the Protestants or for the 
     <lb/>
     Roman Catholics. The Prime Minister says: 
     <lb/>
     I have never heard of any dissatisfaction in 
     <lb/>
     the province of Quebec. Now, I have here 
     <lb/>
     a quotation from the Huntingdon ' Gleaner,'

     The alternative was before them to see their 
     <lb/>
     children grow up in ignorance or go to a coun<lb break="no"/>try where there are no separate schools. They 
     <lb/>
     were doing well in the province of Quebec,

     they did not expect to get farms of better

     break old associations and part with old

     they felt they must make the sacrifice. It is 
     <lb/>
     a sad truth, and one I am ashamed to set 
     <lb/>
     down, that in localities in the townships where 
     <lb/>
     Protestant parents have not left under this 
     <lb/>
     motive, they have become so few that they 
     <lb/>
     have either no schools or are able to keep

     one open for so short a term each year that 
     <lb/>
     it is of nominal service. Their children can 
     <lb/>
     neither read nor write, and a race of illiterates 
     <lb/>
     are growing up who are a reproach to Protes<lb break="no"/>tantism. Analyze the reports of the inspec<lb break="no"/>tors of schools and there are revelations of 
     <lb/>
     ignorance among the scattered English-speak<lb break="no"/>ing communities in the eastern townships and 
     <lb/>
     adjoining counties which, if their wealthy,

     There is no more saddening aspect in the

     condition of our province than the groups of 
     <lb/>
     Protestant children to be found here and 
     <lb/>
     there all over it destitute of the means of

     threatening us with a coming generation of        
     <lb/>
     Protestant farmers as ignorant as Russian

     <lb/>
     be without opportunity to learn to read and

     <lb/>
     that is, where Protestant farmers are too few to 
     <lb/>
     have a school, they are taxed to support Cath<lb break="no"/>olic schools, which, sometimes, have as their 
     <lb/>
     teachers nuns or Christian Brothers. There 
     <lb/>

     and what was the reason? That where

     ago, there was then only an odd one, and 
     <lb/>
     they had become so few and scattered that 
     <lb/>
     they were neither able to support separate

     That is the answer I give to the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the First Minister, and that is why 
     <lb/>
     I say we ought not to do the same thing in 
     <lb/>
     a country which is, new and being rapidly 
     <lb/>
     settled. In such a country we shoud avoid 
     <lb/>
     the mistakes committed in the past. For 
     <lb/>
     that reason I am supporting what I believe 
     <lb/>
     to be a national school system. Forty years 
     <lb/>
     ago we had church schools and pay schools 
     <lb/>
     and we had no public or free schools. Our 
     <lb/>
     educational system then was very poor, 
     <lb/>
     and we adopted the national school system 
     <lb/>
     because we believed it to be better than the 
     <lb/>
     other, and upon trial we found it a great 
     <lb/>
     improvement and extended it by degrees 
     <lb/>
     until we have it practically enforced 
     <lb/>
     throughout the province to-day. Shall we 
     <lb/>
     ever go back to these church and parochial 
     <lb/>
     schools ? Protestants never will because 
     <lb/>
     they prefer the national system and because 
     <lb/>
     they think it is the duty of the state to see 
     <lb/>
     that every child is educated. They have no 
     <lb/>
     desire to have religion taught in the schools 
     <lb/>
     but are content to leave that to the churches. 
     <lb/>
     The sentiment of the 19th and 20th century 
     <lb/>
     is in favour of that system. The enlighten<lb break="no"/>ed, intelligent civilization of to-day recog<lb break="no"/>nizes that fact, and that policy is being car<lb break="no"/>ried out the world over. Are we going back 
     <lb/>
     to what has been discarded in the past? 
     <lb/>
     We are told to-day that public sentiment is 
     <lb/>
     not against these clauses. Well, one of 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet ministers, representing that 
     <lb/>
     great western country, has resigned from 
     <lb/>
     the cabinet because he could not support the 
     <lb/>
     policy of the government, and the right 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman will not consult the Premier 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest Territories. Dare he test 
     <lb/>
     public opinion in the Territories by calling 
     <lb/>
     on an election ? I challenge him to do it. Let 
     <lb/>
     him do it and he will soon find out what the 
     <lb/>
     deep seated sentiment of the people out 
     <lb/>
     there is. But he dare not make the attempt. 
     <lb/>
     If he were certain he could elect a member 
     <lb/>
     to support his government in that country 
     <lb/>
     and take the place in the cabinet rendered 
     <lb/>
     vacant by the resignation of the late Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), he would not 
     <lb/>
     loose a moment in having that place filled. 
     <lb/>
     Can he be said to be carrying out constitu<lb break="no"/>tional government on popular lines when the<lb/>
       

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3044</fw>
          

     people of the illimitable west have no one 
     <lb/>
     to speak for them in the cabinet, especially 
     <lb/>
     at a time when a Bill is being forced through 
     <lb/>
     this House which will affect them for all 
     <lb/>
     time in the future. He is certainly not, as 
     <lb/>
     I understand constitutional government or 
     <lb/>
     as the people of the west understand it. The 
     <lb/>
     government dare not test public opinion to<lb break="no"/>day. There is a vacancy in the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of the city of Toronto. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     the Postmaster General thinks he is in ac<lb break="no"/>cord with public opinion. Well, I challenge 
     <lb/>
     him to open up Centre Toronto to-morrow 
     <lb/>
     with the best candidate he can get. Why 
     <lb/>
     in that very constituency the reform party 
     <lb/>
     had a meeting the other day and passed 
     <lb/>
     resolutions declaring against these clauses 
     <lb/>
     and protesting against their being forced 
     <lb/>
     on the people. Surely that ought to be a 
     <lb/>
     warning to the Postmaster General—a warn<lb break="no"/>ing which he should take now, for later on it 
     <lb/>
     may be too late. The government dare not 
     <lb/>
     test public opinion anywhere west of Lake 
     <lb/>
     Superior or even in Ontario. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     We are told that separate schools work 
     <lb/>
     satisfactorily. I need hardly refer to that 
     <lb/>
     question. The trend of the age is in favour 
     <lb/>
     of national schools. The educational system 
     <lb/>
     of Canada to-day is entirely different from 
     <lb/>
     what it was when the schools were sectar<lb break="no"/>ian and pay schools. They are now national 
     <lb/>
     and non-sectarian and we want to keep 
     <lb/>
     them so. But a comparison is made with 
     <lb/>
     regard to the prevalence of crime in coun<lb break="no"/>tries where there are separate schools com<lb break="no"/>pared with those where the national public 
     <lb/>
     school flourishes. It seemed to me that was 
     <lb/>
     a most unfortunate comparison. Can the 
     <lb/>
     comparison be said to be a fair one between 
     <lb/>
     Canada and the United States ? No. But 
     <lb/>
     take the provinces that have no separate 
     <lb/>
     schools and compare them with those that 
     <lb/>
     have. Did the right hon. gentleman do that? 
     <lb/>
     Not at all. I however have taken the troube 
     <lb/>
     to look up the statistics and I find that there 
     <lb/>
     is practically no difference. Take Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land, British Columbia and Manitoba, and 
     <lb/>
     I find practically there is no difference as 
     <lb/>
     regards the prevalence of crime between 
     <lb/>
     these provinces and the provinces of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec. But the right hon. gentleman 
     <lb/>
     pointed to the United States and asked how 
     <lb/>
     we were to account for the prevalence in 
     <lb/>
     that country of divorces. Surely that is not 
     <lb/>
     due to the absence of separate schools. Why 
     <lb/>
     did he not show that the application for 
     <lb/>
     divorces from these provinces which have 
     <lb/>
     not separate schools are larger than those 
     <lb/>
     which have. The reason is evident. I 
     <lb/>
     looked into that question and I found no 
     <lb/>
     evidence of any difference so that the com<lb break="no"/>parison between Canada and the United 
     <lb/>
     States is not a fair one. I have said that 
     <lb/>
     the trend of the age is in favour of national 
     <lb/>
     schools. They are to be found in Mexico, 
     <lb/>
     Bolivia, in most of the South American 
     <lb/>
     republics, Venezuela, Equador, France, Italy, 
     <lb/>
     Germany and Ireland. Then are you going

     to establish in these new provinces some<lb break="no"/>thing else ? The enlightened advanced in<lb break="no"/>telligence of the twentieth century declares 
     <lb/>
     in favour of national schools, are you going 
     <lb/>
     back to something else ? Are you going 
     <lb/>
     to clothe these new provinces with the 
     <lb/>
     cast-off and tattered garments of those 
     <lb/>
     nations which discarded church and <choice><sic>sectar<lb break="no"/>ain</sic><corr>sectarian</corr></choice> schools years ago ? We shall be com<lb break="no"/>mitting the greatest of follies if we do. 
     <lb/>
     Our people out in the west are inured to a 
     <lb/>
     freedom far in advance of any enjoyed in 
     <lb/>
     almost any part of the world, and it is but 
     <lb/>
     natural that they should feel sore at being 
     <lb/>
     deprived of any of their undoubted rights. 
     <lb/>
     Why should we interfere with those rights, 
     <lb/>
     as we shall assuredly do if we establish 
     <lb/>
     separate schools in that country and compel 
     <lb/>
     these people to maintain such schools for 
     <lb/>
     ever after. These people are inured to 
     <lb/>
     western freedom and should continue to 
     <lb/>
     enjoy it. These young giants have in them<lb break="no"/>selves and their surroundings all the capa<lb break="no"/>bilities of great development, if we will 
     <lb/>
     only avoid binding them with chains and 
     <lb/>
     shackles which will retard that development. 
     <lb/>
     They have in themselves the elements of 
     <lb/>
     great development. Surely we do not wish 
     <lb/>
     to retard or prevent them developing the 
     <lb/>
     highest capabilities of citizens in that great 
     <lb/>
     western country. Let them breathe the 
     <lb/>
     fresh air of heaven in their western freedom 
     <lb/>
     which is their birthright, let them enjoy the 
     <lb/>
     sunshine and the other exhilarating environ<lb break="no"/>ments of western freedom which they enjoy 
     <lb/>
     to-day and grow up under these favourable 
     <lb/>
     conditions. Let their mental pabulum be the 
     <lb/>
     unadulterated food supplied from the nation<lb break="no"/>al storehouse of the little red schools, and 
     <lb/>
     we need have no fear for the future citizen<lb break="no"/>ship of these people. They will grow up 
     <lb/>
     mental and colossal giants and be a source 
     <lb/>
     of strength not only to this country in the 
     <lb/>
     future but to the British empire. Our motto 
     <lb/>
     to-day is ' hands off the twins ; do not inter<lb break="no"/>fere with their rights.' Provincial rights are 
     <lb/>
     sacred and inalienable. They must not be 
     <lb/>
     interfered with, and therefore I shall vote 
     <lb/>
     for the amendment to strike those clauses 
     <lb/>
     from the Bill.

     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Hon. WILLIAM PATERSON</persName> (Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Customs). It has been rightly said, Mr. Speak<lb break="no"/>er, by gentlemen who preceded me, that we 
     <lb/>
     have come to the consideration of two very 
     <lb/>
     important Bills. From what has transpired 
     <lb/>
     in this House and the country, there is evid<lb break="no"/>ently a good deal of diversity of opinion 
     <lb/>
     on at least some of the points in those mea<lb break="no"/>sures. My hon. friend (Mr. Sproule) who 
     <lb/>
     has just taken his seat has emphasized his 
     <lb/>
     objections strongly, those objections being 
     <lb/>
     mainly to one portion of the Bill. If I 
     <lb/>
     understood him aright, he objects also to 
     <lb/>
     another section which deals with the pub<lb break="no"/>lic lands. I did not quite catch whether he 
     <lb/>
     objected to those sections referring to the 
     <lb/>
     boundaries. 
     <lb/>

     <fw type="num">3046</fw>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I have always been of 
     <lb/>
     the opinion that the lands should go to the 
     <lb/>
     provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I understood that to be 
     <lb/>
     the hon. gentleman's position. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, like others who preceded him, 
     <lb/>
     seems to have been influenced by the in<lb break="no"/>terest aroused in the country by what are 
     <lb/>
     known as the educational clauses. The 
     <lb/>
     House has been petitioned in reference to 
     <lb/>
     those clauses ; there have been petitions 
     <lb/>
     for and petitions against. It is for parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to come to the consideration of this 
     <lb/>
     question, as I believe parliament has done 
     <lb/>
     and will do, in a calm and dispassionate 
     <lb/>
     spirit, and to endeavour to give due weight 
     <lb/>
     to any argument that may be advanced 
     <lb/>
     from any point of view. That is what this 
     <lb/>
     discussion is for ; that is how we may be 
     <lb/>
    benefited. In committee, of course, the 
     <lb/>educational clauses will be discussed at 
     <lb/>length. Still I may follow the example of 
     <lb/>the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule), 
     <lb/>and deal largely with that subject. The 
     <lb/>government have proposed in this Bill cer<lb break="no"/>tain provisions with reference to the mat<lb break="no"/>ter. The leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
     <lb/>Borden), in his able speech, offered a legal 
     <lb/>argument against that portion of the Bill 
     <lb/>and submitted an amendment. Not only 
     <lb/>was a legal argument presented by the 
     <lb/>leader of the opposition, but the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) also directed part 
     <lb/>of his argument in the same line. And I 
     <lb/>have no doubt that other gentlemen in the 
     <lb/>House who are competent to do so will fol<lb break="no"/>low that line. But upon that portion of the 
     <lb/>case I shall not trespass. Like the hon. 
     <lb/>member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule), I do 
     <lb/>not feel that I should be regarded as an 
     <lb/>authority upon the subject, and I know it 
     <lb/>would be hazardous for me—and even pre<lb break="no"/>sumptious—for me to express an opinion ; 
     <lb/>not that I abandon my judgment in this 
     <lb/>matter, but simply that I do not argue the 
     <lb/>matter before the House. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>(Mr. Sproule) read an opinion from a very 
     <lb/>able legal gentleman. Mr. Christopher Rob<lb break="no"/>inson, K.C. I believe that gentleman stands 
     <lb/>almost, if not quite, at the head of his pro<lb break="no"/>fession. The leader of the opposition is 
     <lb/>also admitted, I think, to be a gentleman of 
     <lb/>legal attainments of no ordinary character. 
     <lb/>And I think I am not saying more than I 
     <lb/>am perfectly justified in saying when I 
     <lb/>state that the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz<lb break="no"/>patrick) is also one of the brightest legal 
     <lb/>minds we have in the country. But these 
     <lb/>gentlemen do not agree. If I followed 
     <lb/>aright the argument of the leader of the 
     <lb/>opposition, he takes the ground that this 
     <lb/>parliament has no power to pass the legis<lb break="no"/>lation now proposed. If I followed him 
     <lb/>aright and was able to apprehend his argu<lb break="no"/>ment, that is his position. But if I appre<lb break="no"/>hend aright the opinion expressed in the 
     <lb/>telegram of Mr. Christopher Robinson, that 
     <lb/>gentleman does not at all take the view 
     <lb/>expressed by the leader of the opposition.

<p>
     If I understand him, Mr. Christopher Robin<lb break="no"/>son argues that it is doubtful whether the 
     <lb/>
     Premier's position in relation to section 93 
     <lb/>
     would be borne out. If it is not, and if the 
     <lb/>
     Territories do not come under that provis<lb break="no"/>ion, Mr. Robinson says, it would be necessary 
     <lb/>
     for parliament to supplement their action. 
     <lb/>
     Then, if parliament can supplement that 
     <lb/>
     action, it must be because parliament has 
     <lb/>
     the power—

     The legislation before parliament not only

     I had not seen or heard of this opinion

     when I spoke yesterday. So far as I am. 
     <lb/>
     able to understand it, as very briefly em<lb break="no"/>bodied in the telegram, it seems to me alto<lb break="no"/>gether in accordance with the view which 
     <lb/>
     I expressed, except that I expressed a

     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Well, it is plain from 
     <lb/>
     what we have heard that lawyers differ. 
     <lb/>
     However, I still maintain my opinion, but 
     <lb/>
     I do so with deference, because neither am

     I able to make a legal argument myself,

     nor have I a sufficiently sharp mind to un<lb break="no"/>derstand the contradictory legal arguments

     of others. Now I want to know what Sir 
     <lb/>
     Christopher Robinson means. If section 93 
     <lb/>
     does give certain powers, should parliament 
     <lb/>
     exercise the power it possesses ? Now then 
     <lb/>
     what power does parliament possess ? The 
     <lb/>
     leader of the opposition says we have no

     these new provinces is vested in this par<lb break="no"/>liament, and if it be necessary to give effect 
     <lb/>
     to that right. we must do so. But he is 
     <lb/>
     not clear that section 93 does give that 
     <lb/>
     right.

     <lb/>
     legal point with the hon. gentleman, I am 
     <lb/>
     simply pointing out that the best legal 
     <lb/>
     minds we have in the country do not agree. 
     <lb/>
     Now there was a very large meeting held 
     <lb/>
     in the city of Toronto last Monday, in Mas<lb break="no"/>sey Hall. The multitude assembled were 
     <lb/>
     evidently deeply moved by the subject of 
     <lb/>
     discussion, namely, the educational clauses 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill. There was present a legal 
     <lb/>
     gentleman whose standing in the profession 
     <lb/>
     I do not know ; I see he is a King's Counsel, 
     <lb/>
     and I have no doubt he is a gentleman pos<lb break="no"/>sessed of legal knowledge. Evidently he 
     <lb/>
     felt warmly on this subject, for he moved 
     <lb/>
     a resolution protesting against the passage 
     <lb/>
     of the Bill. In the resolution which was 
     <lb/>
     to be forwarded to the Prime Minister he 
     <lb/>
     proposes one of three different courses in 
     <lb/>
     dealing with this question. I am taking 
     <lb/>
     now the report of the meeting published in 
     <lb/>
     the Toronto 'World,' which I presume will 
     <lb/>
     be accepted by hon. gentlemen opposite. 
     <lb/>
     In speaking to his resolution he replied to 
     <lb/>
     the arguments of the Prime Minister as to 
     <lb/>
     the bearing of section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act. He said that if what 
     <lb/>
     the Prime Minister had contended was true, 
     <lb/>
     then there was no necessity to do anything 
     <lb/>
     further. Then he considered what Mr. Haul<lb break="no"/>tain had contended for, and could not agree 
     <lb/>
     with that. The third view, and the one that 
     <lb/>
     was likely, from his own opinion, to prevail 
     <lb/>
     was that under the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Amendment Act of 1871, power was vested in 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion parliament to deal with this 
     <lb/>
     educational question in the constitution of 
     <lb/>
     the new provinces, as it saw fit; and, said 
     <lb/>
     he, that is the supreme reason why we want 
     <lb/>
     to speak out now. because that power is 
     <lb/>
     in the hands of the Dominion parliament, 
     <lb/>
     and if they exercise it now it is irrevocable 
     <lb/>
     for all time to come. The legal gentleman 
     <lb/>
     to whom I refer was Mr. Thomson, K.C., of 
     <lb/>
     Toronto. Hon. gentlemen may read his 
     <lb/>
     opinion for themselves. Now amidst all 
     <lb/>
     these conflicting opinions as to whether we 
     <lb/>
     have this power, the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion proposes to leave this question un<lb break="no"/>settled, no one knowing where they are, 
     <lb/>
     nothing definite. the country to be left in 
     <lb/>
     a turmoil in reference to this matter for a 
     <lb/>
     long time to come. If there is such a divi<lb break="no"/>sion among the legal gentlemen, may not the 
     <lb/>
     same doubt exist in the Supreme Court, the 
     <lb/>
     same doubt in the Privy Council ? And all 
     <lb/>
     this time you have the delay. What shall 
     <lb/>
     we do? What shall I as a layman do ? 
     <lb/>
     Judging from the arguments I have heard, 
     <lb/>
     and bringing to hear what common sense I 
     <lb/>
     have on the subject. and what legal knowl<lb break="no"/>

     me we have power to deal with this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. In dealing with this matter, I have 
     <lb/>
     regard to the fact that in those Territories, 
     <lb/>
     of "thirty years, by Act of this Dominion 
     <lb/>
     parliament under which people have en<lb break="no"/>tered that country, knowing that the exist<lb break="no"/>ing school system had been established by

     there and settled there under that system

     of education, I say it is only just, and right, 
     <lb/>
     and sensible, and the proper thing to do in 
     <lb/>
     dealing with this matter on the basis of jus<lb break="no"/>tice of law, to say that the advantages.

     whatever they may be, that these people

     <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Mr. Speaker, when you 
     <lb/>
     left the chair at six o'clock I had alluded 
     <lb/>
     to the fact that there were differences of 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the constitutionality of the 
     <lb/>
     Act which has been submitted for the ap<lb break="no"/>proval of the members of this House. I 
     <lb/>
     gave, as far as I understood them, the dif<lb break="no"/>fering views. Whether I interpreted them 
     <lb/>
     aright or not it must be evident to every 
     <lb/>
     hon. gentleman present that there is a diver<lb break="no"/>sity of opinion when a very able and emi<lb break="no"/>nent lawyer whose words were read to us 
     <lb/>
     from a telegram this afternoon, speaks of 
     <lb/>
     doubts, speaks of the necessity for further 
     <lb/>
     consideration and hints that it is possible 
     <lb/>
     it may be necessary, in order to supple<lb break="no"/>ment section 93 of the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act, that we should have recourse to the 
     <lb/>
     powers which parliament may possess to 
     <lb/>
     make it plain. If I apprehended him aright 
     <lb/>
     that shows that in his opinion it was con<lb break="no"/>templated that parliament had powers in 
     <lb/>
     this matter and that view, in my humble 
     <lb/>
     opinion, coincides with what I think to be 
     <lb/>
     the facts in the case. But, as I said be<lb break="no"/>fore I do not intend in any way to argue 
     <lb/>
     the constitutional question. I point out this, 
     <lb/>
     however, that there being such a conflict 
     <lb/>
     of opinion and the authority to whom I have 
     <lb/>
     alluded saying that it might be necessary to 
     <lb/>
     get a judicial opinion that would require 
     <lb/>
     time during which you would have excite<lb break="no"/>ment, during which you would have unrest 
     <lb/>
     and during which you would not have that 
     <lb/>
     peace that is conducive to the prosperity of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion and which would affect, I 
     <lb/>
     think, injuriously, the provinces that we 
     <lb/>
     are about to bring into the confederation. I 
     <lb/>
     think it will be admitted by all who have 
     <lb/>
     listened to the arguments that the view 
     <lb/>
     which is taken by many is not the correct 
     <lb/>
     view to take of the constitution of this Dom<lb break="no"/>inion in reference to educational matters.

            <p> And
that it is contrary to the whole spirit <lb/>
of confederation to take another view. When <lb/>
the constitution was framed under which we <lb/>
exist there were certain subjects
which <lb/>
were allotted to the local legislatures in <lb/>
which they have absolute and independent <lb/>
power, Others were reserved to the
Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament in which they have absolute <lb/>
and unrestricted power. The question of <lb/>
education, as rightly stated by these gentle<lb break="no"/>men, is remitted to the local legislatures, <lb/>
but under the British North America Act,
<lb/>
that is not given to them. as many other sub<lb break="no"/>jects are given to them to be dealt by them <lb/>
exclusively without any reservation what<lb break="no"/>ever. There is a reservation, but the reser<lb break="no"/>vation is in the spirit of preserving to the <lb/>
minorities in the various provinces in the <lb/>
confederation the rights they
enjoy at the <lb/>
time they enter confederation. Therefore, <lb/>
I repeat again, while having the highest re<lb break="no"/>gard for the honesty, yes, and the intelli<lb break="no"/>gence of that body of gentlemen who ad— <lb/>
dressed that resolution to me, I am unable <lb/>
honestly to agree with them. My view is <lb/>
different. The whole spirit of confederation, <lb/>
as I understand it in reference to the edu<lb break="no"/>
 
<cb/>
     <fw type="num">3052</fw>

cational question, is that the local
govern<lb break="no"/>ments may dea1—shall deal—with the edu<lb break="no"/>cation question, but they shall do that sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the restriction that secures the rights <lb/>
of minorities as it is embodied in the consti<lb break="no"/>tution that was given to us. The whole <lb/>
spirit of that, I say, is in the direction of se<lb break="no"/>curing the rights of the minorities. It was <lb/>
a confederacy of independent provinces that <lb/>
was being formed. It was necessary to <lb/>
secure unity in order that we might have <lb/>
progress and harmony and in order that we <lb/>
might become a nation. Therefore it was, <lb/>
that, finding that there were deep feelings <lb/>
on the subject in some of the provinces <lb/>
which entered confederation at that time, <lb/>

concessions in reference to the matter of <lb/>
education were given and secured to two <lb/>
of the provinces. More than that it was <lb/>
enacted that as respects other provinces en<lb break="no"/>tering the union, minorities having had edu<lb break="no"/>cational privileges or rights prior to their <lb/>
union should have these conserved to them. <lb/>What has been the result of
that? Why, <lb/>
Sir, the fathers of confederation, or some <lb/>

of them, said it would be impossible to <lb/>
form a confederation under any other con<lb break="no"/>ditions or stipulations. The Hon. George <lb/>
Brown, who had always been a consistent <lb/>
opponent of separate schools, waived his <lb/>
objections in order to accomplish what he <lb/>
considered the great good of uniting the <lb/>
various provinces of British North America <lb/>
into a grand confederacy which would be<lb break="no"/>come, as it has become, the brightest gem <lb/>
in the British Crown; and it is proper to <lb/>
consider the question before us now in the <lb/>
light of promoting the unity, concord, har<lb break="no"/>mony, peace, prosperity and progress of <lb/>
these united provinces which form the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion of Canada. <lb/>It has been said that the position taken <lb/>by the government in this matter is wholly <lb/>contrary to the position which they took in <lb/>the year 1894 on the Manitoba school ques<lb break="no"/>tion—that then the Liberal party stood for <lb/>provincial rights. I think it was the hon. <lb/>member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) <lb/>who, the other night, in that aggressive <lb/>speech of his. pointed out that the Prime <lb/>Minister, the Postmaster General, the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance, had all gone through the <lb/>country proclaiming that—strong upon it; <lb/>yes, and that the Minister of Customs had <lb/>thundered in that direction. Well. Mr. <lb/>Speaker. just by way of passing, I call to <lb/>your attention how a noted orator like even <lb/>my hon. friend from North Toronto is apt <lb/>to make an inapt illustration.

               things, would have been correct. With the

               other gentlemen to whom my hon. friend 
               <lb/>
               has alluded, I was against the coercion of 
               <lb/>
               Manitoba; I said it would be an infringe<lb break="no"/>ment of provincial rights why? Because 
               <lb/>
               I did not sympathize with the minority ? 
               <lb/>

               No. Why. then ? For the same reason that

               actuated the other gentlemen and actuated 
               <lb/>
               the Liberal party. It had been declared 
               <lb/>
               by the court of last resort, the Judicial Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the Privy Council, that, as it 
               <lb/>
               seemed to the minority in that province, 
               <lb/>

               their rights had been abrogated by the Bill 
               <lb/>
               that had been passed by the Manitoba le<lb break="no"/>gislature, but that nevertheless the Manito<lb break="no"/>ba legislature had acted within its powers,

               that, acting within its powers, it must be

               its competence. That, Sir, was the reason 
               <lb/>
               we opposed interference. Now, I have not 
               <lb/>
               read what I said on that occasion, if it is 
               <lb/>
               recorded anywhere; I have not had time. 
               <lb/>
               I have not even read the utterances of other 
               <lb/>
               gentlemen, as some of the hon. gentlemen 
               <lb/>

               opposite have done; but if there are any 
               <lb/>
               recorded utterances of mine, I have no 
               <lb/>
               doubt that they will be found to be in the 
               <lb/>
               direction in which I have spoken. That 
               <lb/>
               position I took, and for that position I con<lb break="no"/>tended; and in supporting this Bill, am I 
               <lb/>

               taking back anything I said at that time? 
               <lb/>
               Am I in a position different from what I 
               <lb/>
               was in at that time ? Am I now an oppon<lb break="no"/>ent of provincial rights? Am I now sup<lb break="no"/>porting the Bill to override an enactment 
               <lb/>
               passed by a legislature having full compe<lb break="no"/>tence to pass that enactment? Nothing of 
               <lb/>
               the kind. There is no such proposition; 
               <lb/>
               the cases are not parallel. Find the strong<lb break="no"/>est utterance you can, made by any mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Liberal party in defence of the 
               <lb/>
               provincial rights of Manitoba and the deci<lb break="no"/>sion of the Privy Council, and you will find 
               <lb/>
               it none too strong, unless it was couched in 
               <lb/>
               offensive language, as I trust none was. 
               <lb/>
               But to claim, as we heard it claimed this 
               <lb/>
               afternoon, that the present measure is an 
               <lb/>
               invasion of provincial rights, is something 
               <lb/>

               that I cannot understand. What law of the 
               <lb/>
               Territories that are about to become pro<lb break="no"/>vinces are we seeking to override ? It is 
               <lb/>
               said : you are passing a law—which is true. 
               <lb/>
               But what law of the Territories are we 
               <lb/>
               passing a law to do away with? 
               <lb/>

               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. The answer of the

               hon. gentleman is not a correct answer, and 
               <lb/>
               therefore I must ask again. Suppose I try

               the hon. member for South York (Mr. W. F.

               Maclean) ; he would give me a different an<lb break="no"/>swer to that, I think. What are we doing ? 
               <lb/>
               We have submitted a Bill for the considera<lb break="no"/>
     

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3054</fw>
            
      

               tion of this House-what for? To override 
               <lb/>
               legislation enacted by the Territories?  To 
               <lb/>

               wipe out and do away with laws which 
               <lb/>
               they have passed? Will any hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man say that we are ? Most undoubtedly 
               <lb/>
               not. Do you say to me : but you are pass<lb break="no"/>ing a law to continue an Act that is on the 
               <lb/>
               statute-book of the Territories. I say, Yes, 
               <lb/>

               but who passed that Act? This Dominion 
               <lb/>
               parliament ? No; Premier Haultain, his 
               <lb/>
               government, and the members of the North<lb break="no"/>west assembly. It is their Act. There is 
               <lb/>
               chapter 29, chapter 30, chapter 31, passed 
               <lb/>
               of their own free motion by the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the' people in the Territories. And 
               <lb/>
               what are we proposing to do ? What hon.
               <lb/>
               gentlemen opposite wanted us to do in the 
               <lb/>
               Manitoba case—to repeal that, to abrogate 
               <lb/>
               it ? No; simply to continue it. Talk about 
               <lb/>
               Mr. Haultain not having been consulted. 
               <lb/>

               He says he was consulted twice: but 
               <lb/>
               if he had never been consulted, if no North<lb break="no"/>west member had ever been consulted. I 
               <lb/>
               ask, what better indication can you have 
               <lb/>

               of the desires of. the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories than their own legislation ? 
               <lb/>
               It may be said that Mr. Haultain has stated 
               <lb/>
               that he thinks this question should be left 
               <lb/>
               to the provincial legislature. But, if cor<lb break="no"/>rectly reported, when asked : if it were left 
               <lb/>
               to the legislatures of the provinces when 
               <lb/>
               constituted, would they change the law ? 
               <lb/>
               His answer was, if I remember rightly  
               <lb/>
               'If I were a dictator to-morrow, I would 
               <lb/>
               not change it.' Yet these gentlemen talk 
               <lb/>

               about provincial rights being invaded by 
               <lb/>
               this Bill. Amid all the doubts and uncer<lb break="no"/>tainties that our constitutional lawyers in

               this House and outside of this House pres<lb break="no"/>ent, in reference to ascertaining what are 
               <lb/>
               the facts of the case, if, as I believe, from 
               <lb/>

               advice which I have received from men in 
               <lb/>
               whose legal knowledge I have confidence 
               <lb/>
               we have the power under the amendment 
               <lb/>
               to the British North. America Act of 1871 to 
               <lb/>
               pass this law which we have submitted for 
               <lb/>
               the approval of this House and if this Bill 
               <lb/>

               simply provides for the continuance of the 
               <lb/>
               law which was passed by the men who re<lb break="no"/>presented the Northwest Territories three 
               <lb/>
               years ago, and which has been in existence 
               <lb/>
               for three years without, so far as I am 
               <lb/>
               aware, any man having lifted up his voice 
               <lb/>

               against it, is it not better to deal with this 
               <lb/>
               question now, to settle this question in this 
               <lb/>
               way, rather than to leave it open to be â 
               <lb/>
               very possible cause of discord, and a means 
               <lb/>
               of holding back the prosperity and the pro<lb break="no"/>gress of this Dominion ? 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Objection is taken to this law by friends 
               <lb/>
               in other provinces. Why ? Because they 
               <lb/>
               say that the law passed by the Territories 
               <lb/>
               provides for separate schools—and so it does. 
               <lb/>
               And this Dominion parliament in 1875 said 
               <lb/>

               that there should be privileges given to 
               <lb/>
               minorities, whether Protestant or Catholic, 
               <lb/>
               in the country to form separate schools if 
               <lb/>
               they so desired. That Act, passed under

               the Mackenzie administration, a Liberal ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, was consolidated and re-en<lb break="no"/>acted, as the Minister of Inland Revenue 
               <lb/>
               (Hon. Mr. Brodeur) read this afternoon, in 
               <lb/>
               1880 under Sir John Macdonald's govern<lb break="no"/>ment. For thirty years, this legislation has 
               <lb/>
               been enjoyed by these people. It was con<lb break="no"/>solidated again and went into effect in 
               <lb/>
               1902, three years ago. This is the law which 
               <lb/>
               was embodied in the Bill which is now be<lb break="no"/>fore the House and which if this Bill passes 
               <lb/>
               will secure to the minorities in those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the rights that are given to them in 
               <lb/>
               the legislation contained in the laws which 
               <lb/>
               the assembly of those Territories enacted. 
               <lb/>
               Let us stop for a moment or two, to con<lb break="no"/>sider this question of separate schools. In 
               <lb/>
               the School Act, which is the first Act in that 
               <lb/>
               book, there are 180 sections and five sec<lb break="no"/>tions out of that 180 deal with this question 
               <lb/>
               of separate schools—five and five only. The 
               <lb/>
               hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
               <lb/>
               in his argument this afternoon based his 
               <lb/>
               objection wholly on the fact that he objects 
               <lb/>
               to church schools, or as he calls them, den<lb break="no"/>ominational schools under the direction and 
               <lb/>
               control of the church and he pictured to us 
               <lb/>
               a condition of things- 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I did not base my argu<lb break="no"/>ment on any such contention. I based my 
               <lb/>
               argument upon the rights of the provinces 
               <lb/>
               to deal with education and said that I had 
               <lb/>
               no concern with what they did, that I would <lb/> 
               give them whatever types of schools they <lb/> liked.<lb/>

               
            </p>

            
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Quite so. And I do 
               <lb/>
               not wish to misrepresent the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man (Mr. Sproule), but when he was drawn 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               the House he had to admit that the schools 
               <lb/>
               provided for in these Acts are not church 
               <lb/>
               schools. But why did he picture to us all 
               <lb/>
               the evils that had resulted from church 
               <lb/>
               schools in other countries and in other 
               <lb/>
               provinces ? Why was it that he complained 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               of what he was pleased to call separate 
               <lb/>
               schools that were church schools in other 
               <lb/>
               provinces when we were not discussing the 
               <lb/>
               system of separate schools in other provin<lb break="no"/>ces, but were debating the condition of the 
               <lb/>
               schools in the Territories which are about<lb/>
    
               to become provinces ? That is the ques<lb break="no"/>tion. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               I think it would be perhaps worth while 
               <lb/>
               that I should hurriedly give to the House a 
               <lb/>
               portion of the law, particularly the sections 
               <lb/>to the Bill which the Bill now before us

               will continue as the law of the Territories.

               First as to the constitution of the Depart<lb break="no"/>ment of Education. Let there be no cloud<lb break="no"/>ing of this question. The Territories did

               not enact church schools; they enacted

               state schools, national schools in every

               My right hon. colleague, the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter, in introducing the Bill said its object 
               <lb/>
               was to secure to the minority what they 
               <lb/>
               now enjoy, namely, the right to have their 
               <lb/>
               own schools, to assess themselves for the 
               <lb/>
               cost of these schools, and to receive their 
               <lb/>

               equitable and proportionate share of the 
               <lb/>
               public grants for school purposes. My hon. 
               <lb/>
               colleague, the Minister of Justice, also de<lb break="no"/>clared that to be the object and intent of 
               <lb/>
               the Bill. It was contended, however, by 
               <lb/>
               some that there might be a broader con<lb break="no"/>struction placed upon the general Bill than 
               <lb/>
               was intended, as explained by the Prime 
               <lb/>
               Minister and the Minister of Justice, and to 
               <lb/>
               meet that objection, the clauses were 
               <lb/>
               amended so as to re-enact the existing pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the law and thus prevent any dis<lb break="no"/>pute in the future. It must be borne in 
               <lb/>
               mind that those separate schools are formed 
               <lb/>
               precisely as every school district is formed. 
               <lb/>
               Although the name separate school appears 
               <lb/>
               to convey to the minds of some people the 
               <lb/>

               impression that they are separate in the 
               <lb/>
               sense in which they are established in some 
               <lb/>
               other province, there is no distinction be<lb break="no"/>tween these schools and the other public 
               <lb/>
               schools as regards organization, or the quali<lb break="no"/>fication of teachers, or the text books, or 
               <lb/>

               the right of state to inspection, or in the re<lb break="no"/>ports they have to make. In every respect 
               <lb/>
               they are under the commissioner of educa<lb break="no"/>tion in absolutely the same manner as is 
               <lb/>
               every other public school in the Territories. 
               <lb/>
               All they get is what? If they desire it, pro<lb break="no"/>vided they have the requisite number of 
               <lb/>
               children of school age, they may upon peti<lb break="no"/>tioning the commissioners be permitted by 
               <lb/>
               them to erect a school district, pay for it 
               <lb/>
               out of their own pockets, and get only their 
               <lb/>

               share of the money they contribute. Is not

               from 1.30 until 3.30 pm. no religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion is to be given to the children. Pre<lb break="no"/>cisely the same course of study that is fol<lb break="no"/>lowed in the public schools is to be followed 
               <lb/>
               in these schools ; but when the hour of 3.30 
               <lb/>
               p.m. arrives, if the trustees of the separate 
               <lb/>
               school desire, religious instruction may 
               <lb/>
               then be given to the youth therein. Is that 
               <lb/>a concession made particularly to our Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic brethren ? Why, the same 
               <lb/>
               clauses apply to every school, Protestant, 
               <lb/>
               public and every other. No special right, 
               <lb/>
               no special permission is given the separate 
               <lb/>
               schools which is Withheld from the other. 
               <lb/>
               Shall it be made a reproach to our Roman 
               <lb/>
               Catholic brethren that it be a matter of con<lb break="no"/>science With them, that they instill into 
               <lb/>
               the minds of their youth the principles 
               <lb/>
               of the Christian religion? Is that something 
               <lb/>
               to be deplored? The trustees of any school 
               <lb/>
               may avail themselves of those clauses and 
               <lb/>
               have religious instruction given to the pu<lb break="no"/>pils. I do not wish to intrude my personal 
               <lb/>
               views upon this House, but speaking for 
               <lb/>
               myself alone, I would desire if it could be 
               <lb/>
               accomplished—and it seems to me that it 
               <lb/>
               ought not to be impossible in these days of 
               <lb/>
               broad-minded charity among the various 
               <lb/>
               denominations—that some agreement might 
               <lb/>
               be come to under which certain portions of 
               <lb/>
               the Bible might be read and studied in the 
               <lb/>
               public schools of these Territories, if the 
               <lb/>
               trustees so desire. I am very sure that no 
               <lb/>
               child would be injured thereby. I am quite 
               <lb/>
               sure that no harm would thereby be caused 
               <lb/>
               any of the thousands of people now going 
               <lb/>

ferent with regard to these
matters—indif<lb break="no"/>ferent. not hostile—and who possibly do not <lb/>
read to their children from that Book which <lb/>
I think we all agree will make any man <lb/>
that studies it and follows its precepts a <lb/>
good citizen. I am sure we all agree that <lb/>
any one who studies that Book cannot be <lb/>
an ignorant man, and that if he follows its <lb/>
precepts he cannot be a bad citizen. If we <lb/>
believe, as I think we do, that it is right<lb break="no"/>ousness which exalts a nation,
who will say <lb/>
that it is wrong to have during the half hour <lb/>
at the closing of the school portions of that <lb/>
Book taught and read to the children? <lb/>
Will it be worse for them if they know <lb/>
the Ten Commandments ? Will it be worse <lb/>
for them if they know the sermon on the <lb/>
mount in which is contained the golden rule? <lb/>
Or the fifteenth psalm that describes what <lb/>
a citizen ought to be. If it be desirable—as <lb/>
it is—that during the Sabbath afternoon, <lb/>
the children should be brought together in <lb/>
order to teach them these things, can it be <lb/>
wrong—if it can be agreed upon—that dur<lb break="no"/>ing half an hour in the afternoon of five <lb/>
other days of the week they should have <lb/>
the same instruction? I do not seek to <lb/>
obtrude my own personal views, I speak for <lb/>
myself alone. But I trust that that spirit <lb/>
will take possession of the men in the west<lb break="no"/>ern country, and that, instead of repining <lb/>
or complaining if our Roman Catholic fel<lb break="no"/>low-citizens, in obedience to their conscience, <lb/>
give religious instruction to their youth, <lb/>
they also will devise means whereby relig<lb break="no"/>ious instruction may be given in the schools. <lb/>
As I have said, I am aware of the diffi<lb break="no"/>culties that in the past, have prevented this <lb/>
being accomplished. But I do think that, <lb/>
with the spirit of charity that is abroad, <lb/>
and with many Protestants seeking means <lb/>
for a concerted movement in this direction, <lb/>
it would be well worth their while at any <lb/>
rate to give the matter some consideration. <lb/>
There have been noble men, Canadians of <lb/>
French extraction, who have laboured in <lb/>
the Northwest as missionaries in days gone <lb/>
by ; and there have been grand Protestant <lb/>
clergymen who have engaged in the same <lb/>
work, believing that it is the duty of Can<lb break="no"/>adians to establish the Christian religion in <lb/>
that country as the foundation of its insti<lb break="no"/>tutions. Many a time have I heard such <lb/>
a view expressed publicly and at least once <lb/>
in my own home by one who has passed <lb/>
away, but whose memory is revered, one <lb/>
who was a noble patriot it ever there was <lb/>
one—that the great object to be sought in <lb/>
the Northwest Territories was to follow <lb/>
with religious ordinances the population <lb/>
pouring in there, so that they might become <lb/>
a great people and enduring power in the <lb/>
state. I say that I for one have no <lb/>
objections; nay more, I am glad to find, <lb/>
that it is proposed to continue such a <lb/>
law in the Northwest to give permis<lb break="no"/>sion to the trustees of each school, pub<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3060</fw>

lic or separate, to have such religious
in— <lb/>
struction as may be desired given during. <lb/>
that half hour. Yet, it is
provided that <lb/>
the children of parents—if such there be— <lb/>
who cannot approve of the teaching given <lb/>
have the privilege of withdrawing their <lb/>
children while that instruction is in pro<lb break="no"/>gress. No man's conscience can be offend<lb break="no"/>ed in the least. And the further provision <lb/>
is made, lest, perchance the possible case <lb/>
might arise of an inspector, or school trus<lb break="no"/>tee or teacher seeking to place the child <lb/>
so withdrawn by his parents during that <lb/>
half hour at a disadvantage because of that <lb/>
withdrawal, that such an Act would be an <lb/>
offense subjecting the one guilty of it to
<lb/>
summary loss of his office. So, there. is <lb/>
eminently safe provision made. In these <lb/>
provisions I find that which not only I do
<lb/>
not disapprove but that which meets my <lb/>
cordial approval. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I was pleased to receive the resolution <lb/>
forwarded to me by the gentleman who <lb/>
acted as secretary on the occasion when it <lb/>
was adopted. He accompanied it
with a <lb/>
personal letter to myself. The writer is a
<lb/>
reverend gentleman whose personal friend
<lb/>
I should deem it an honour to be considered. <lb/>
I believe he is also a political friend of the <lb/>
party in power. I cannot give the exact <lb/>
words, but he said in effect that he was not <lb/>
disposed to blame the Prime Minister (Sir <lb/>
Wilfrid Laurier)—though he did not approve <lb/>
of this measure, of course—as some were <lb/>
disposed to do; but he was disposed to
<lb/>
blame the members of the cabinet from On<lb break="no"/>tario. What are they doing? he
said. I <lb/>
find Mr. Stapleton Caldecott, who presided <lb/>
at the meeting at Toronto in his opening <lb/>
remarks wanted to know where the On<lb break="no"/>tario members of the cabinet were on this <lb/>
question; were they favourable, or were <lb/>
they unfavourable ? Well, I had supposed <lb/>
that Mr. Stapleton Caldecott knew enough <lb/>
of constitutional procedure to know that <lb/>
when the Ontario members of the cabinet <lb/>
remained in the cabinet after the measure<lb/>
had been proposed, he could pretty well: <lb/>
know, or at least guess, Where they were <lb/>
on that question. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Not now—a—days. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATTERSON</persName>.
Mr. Caldecott stated <lb/>
that, while he had been a great admirer <lb/>
of the Prime Minister and his supporter, <lb/>
he must confess that he had lost respect <lb/>
for his judgment. When a gentleman like <lb/>
that did not know that the presence in the <lb/>
cabinet of the ministers of Ontario was <lb/>
an indication that they approved the <lb/>
measure, perhaps the loss of his respect <lb/>
for the Prime Minister's judgment on a <lb/>
constitutional question was not so serious a <lb/>
matter that it ought to break my right hon. <lb/>
friend's heart ? Mr. Caldecott is a friend <lb/>
of ours, no doubt. But that leads me to <lb/>
remark upon something that has been more <lb/>

 than once hinted at rather forcibly by my
<lb/>
hon. friend from North Toronto (Mr. Foster). <lb/>
There is and has been an attempt in this <lb/>
House to weaken the influence and dis<lb break="no"/>parage the judgment of the leader of the <lb/>
government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). In days <lb/>
gone by we were accustomed to hear from <lb/>
the other side of the House at times, and <lb/>
in the press, descriptions of the right hon. <lb/>
leader of this government being little more <lb/>
than clay that was moulded in the hands <lb/>
of some stronger man or men in his cabinet. <lb/>
Now the tune is entirely changed. My hon. <lb/>
friend from North Toronto, describing him <lb/>
the other day, and he was very indignant <lb/>
about it, said that that his conduct was like <lb/>
that of a Czar, who introduced-a measure <lb/>
without consulting his colleagues, and who <lb/>
does whatever he pleases. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. The strong men have de<lb break="no"/>parted. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. Very well. I am deal<lb break="no"/>ing with the hon. gentlemen's estimate of <lb/>
the Prime Minister. The hon. gentleman <lb/>
complains that the Prime Minister alone is <lb/>
responsible for that Bill, and that his coll<lb break="no"/>eagues had, you might infer that from his <lb/>
statement, to accept it. Is it a fault in <lb/>
the eyes of the hon. member for North <lb/>
Toronto that we have a strong man at the <lb/>
head of the government ? Does the hon. <lb/>
gentleman remember that a few years ago <lb/>
there was a government with which he was <lb/>
in perfect accord on all questions of policy, <lb/>
and on all intended measures that were to <lb/>
be introduced—thoroughly in accord, a <lb/>
united and happy party ? But unfortun<lb break="no"/>ately the strong leader was not at their <lb/>
head. and the hon. gentleman and six others <lb/>
withdrew. Well, now. if we have got a <lb/>
strong man at the head of the government, <lb/>
and we have— <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. Some of you have found <lb/>
it so. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>—he ought to be very <lb/>
glad that such is the case. It is true that <lb/>
we have a strong man at the head of the <lb/>
government. but he never forgets to avail <lb/>
himself of the counsel of his colleagues. and <lb/>
to treat them with the utmost courtesy. <lb/>
We have a strong man, he has his views, <lb/>
and the very fact that he is known to be a <lb/>
strong man is the reason why his political <lb/>
opponents desire his overthrow and the
over<lb break="no"/>throw of his government. If they can <lb/>
weaken the man that is a tower of strength <lb/>
to the party, then they weaken the party, <lb/>
and they hope to be able by that means to <lb/>
attain power. They say that he has lost <lb/>
the confidence of the Liberal party, that <lb/>
the Liberal party have lost the confidence <lb/>
of thousands and tens of thousands of their <lb/>
supporters on account of the introduction of <lb/>
this measure. It is true that many staunch <lb/>
and sterling men of character, integrity and <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3062</fw>

 honour in the Liberal party, who, I
believe, <lb/>
desire well for the Liberal party, have not <lb/>
been able to see eye to eye With us on this <lb/>
question. That has been a source of sorrow <lb/>
      and of grief to us, as it must be to any
one,  <lb/>
 for we value the esteem and friendship of
<lb/>
our fellow citizens, especially of those who <lb/>
have given us their confidence in times gone <lb/>
by. If the prediction made by a
gentleman <lb/>
at the Toronto meeting comes true that if <lb/>
this Bill is put through it should consign to <lb/>
political extinction the Prime Minister and <lb/>
his government and of every member of par<lb break="no"/>liament that votes for it—if that be true—— <lb/>
and the gentleman who made the prediction <lb/>
at this meeting no doubt thought he was <lb/>
speaking the truth, then are we not entitled <lb/>
to credit in voting for this Bill, believing <lb/>
in our conscience that it is our duty to do so, <lb/>
even in face of this threatened extinction ? <lb/>
It seems to me there is nothing for us to be <lb/>
ashamed of in that. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:KEMP1">Mr. KEMP</persName>. May I ask the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who said that at the Toronto meeting

But surely <lb/>
it must be admitted that if we proceed in <lb/>

that we are doing what is right. Another <lb/>
gentleman spoke at that meeting, and he <lb/>
uttered a sentiment that I think was hardly <lb/>
proper and which I regretted to see coming <lb/>
from him. He said that the introduction of <lb/>
this Bill tended to promote racial and re<lb break="no"/>ligious strife. According to this gentleman, <lb/>
that could only be averted by withdrawing <lb/>
this Bill and then this vexed question of <lb/>
race and religion would be eliminated alto<lb break="no"/>gether. He said : <lb/>

<lb/>
to them what their course meant and what, <lb/>

we shall be guilty of treason to the common<lb break="no"/>wealth, and yet who proposes, as a means <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:PATE1">Mr. PATERSON</persName>. I will speak loud <lb/>
enough. I am not like the hon. gentleman ; <lb/>
when I have anything to say I am not afraid <lb/>
to speak it out. There are men in the Lib<lb break="no"/>eral party, grand men, excellent men, who <lb/>
have my esteem, and who will have my <lb/>
esteem even if they leave the party and <lb/>
feel that they cannot continue longer with <lb/>
us, because they think that we are wrong <lb/>
in this matter. I think when they thoroughly <lb/>
understand this Bill, when the past is past, <lb/>
when we enjoy that peace and unity that <lb/>
will prevail, and that progress and pros<lb break="no"/>perity which will result, as we be<lb break="no"/>lieve they will revise their opinions. <lb/>
But, whether they are able to do so <lb/>
or not, their views will be respected <lb/>
by me. I will give them credit for con<lb break="no"/>scientiousness ; but I do think this, that if <lb/>
they had calmly considered the question, <lb/>
some of them, limited in their number, <lb/>
grand men, who, in the heat of their feel<lb break="no"/>ings on this question and viewing it from <lb/>
their standpoint, have uttered certain <lb/>
things against the right hon. Prime Minister <lb/>
of this Dominion, will regret themselves <lb/>
having said, for instance, that he has de<lb break="no"/>parted from the principles that he advocat<lb break="no"/>ed in days gone by, that he has sacrificed <lb/>
the principles that he declared to be good <lb/>
and that he would ever stand by. While <lb/>
I regret that it is the case that such state<lb break="no"/>ments have been made, I only wish, in con<lb break="no"/>clusion, to say this, if my words will carry <lb/>
any weight and my judgment is worth any<lb break="no"/>thing in this country, where for two and <lb/>
thirty years I have had the honour, which <lb/>
I value, of a constituency returning me as <lb/>

may for the time being, perhaps in the heat <lb/>
of their feelings, have uttered the ungener<lb break="no"/>ous words, that, speaking out of the know<lb break="no"/>ledge of the man that I have, Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier is, in my opinion, as he long has <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. F. D. MONK</persName> (Jacques Cartier). Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, it is hardly necessary for one who <lb/>
speaks in this House after my good friend <lb/>
the Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) to <lb/>
assure the House that he will be moderate. <lb/>
because there is something in the tone of <lb/>
my hon. friend, even when he gives utter<lb break="no"/>ance to the mildest thoughts, which leads <lb/>
one to believe that he is a man of such vio<lb break="no"/>lent type that it is impossible to reach the <lb/>
the high vocal pitch he has done himself <lb/>
in propounding his opinions. But I <lb/>
notice that my good friend the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Customs, although he
spoke <lb/>
in a very deep voice, spoke somewhat <lb/>
low when he assured the House that this <lb/>
measure, which is being introduced to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the minority in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, was absolutely harmless, contained <lb/>
nothing which would in any way trench <lb/>
upon the rights of the majority, and that <lb/>
the importance of that enactment had been <lb/>
very much exaggerated, because it contain<lb break="no"/>ed very little. My hon. friend's voice was <lb/>
very deep, but it was hardly lower <lb/>
than that of the hon. Minister of Finance <lb/>
(Mr. Fielding) last night when he made the <lb/>
startling announcement that so trifling were <lb/>
the concessions we gave that the schools <lb/>
which this Bill was intended to create would <lb/>
almost infallibly disappear before long. My <lb/>
attention has been drawn, Mr. Speaker, to <lb/>
a caricature in to-day's Montreal 'Herald.' <lb/>
at which I feel very much offended. My <lb/>
hon. friend the leader of the opposition (Mr. <lb/>
R. L. Borden) is represented as sitting on a <lb/>
wharf with a fish basket. At one side of <lb/>
him is the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. <lb/>
Sproule) with a fish on the end of his line, <lb/>
and on the other side myself with another <lb/>
fish. We are both supposed to be fishing <lb/>
on each side of the wharf different kinds <lb/>
of fish that are called petitions, in order to <lb/>
put them into the basket held by my hon. <lb/>
friend the leader of the opposition. The <lb/>
only difference between myself and my hon. <lb/>
friend from East Grey is that I have a tall <lb/>
hat on and he has a Christy stiff. It will be <lb/>
for the hon. member for East Grey to clear <lb/>
himself of this imputation, but for my part <lb/>
I can say positively that during the course <lb/>
of the present discussion I have fished for <lb/>
no petitions in the province of Quebec, and <lb/>
indeed I may say that I think this caricature <lb/>
would perhaps be more properly applied to <lb/>
my hon. friend the Minister of Finance and <lb/>
my hon. friend the Minister of Customs, <lb/>

 before the House. <lb/>
for me to explain, as briefly as possible, the <lb/>
reasons which have led me to oppose the <lb/>
amendment which has been offered
to the <lb/>
main motion for the second reading of this <lb/>
Bill. I Will do so as briefly as I possibly <lb/>
can. I feel very little guilt in connection <lb/>
with what, to my mind, has been a very <lb/>
needless agitation over this question. After <lb/>
the general election of 1896 the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tive party held a meeting in the city of <lb/>
Montreal, of which some notice
was taken <lb/>
in the Montreal 'Gazette' on the following <lb/>
morning. At that meeting, held subsequent <lb/>
to the general election, I declared for my <lb/>
part I would not in the future discuss the <lb/>
school question. I have adhered to that <lb/>
resolution, and on no occasion, at any meet<lb break="no"/>ing which I have attended, and I have at<lb break="no"/>tended a great many in the province of <lb/>
Quebec and elsewhere, have I
ventured to <lb/>
mention that much vexed question. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> It has been discussed in my presence by <lb/>
representatives of both parties, but I have <lb/>
stood firm to my resolution. I have not <lb/>
discussed it on any occasion; and if, in<lb break="no"/>deed, it were not necessary that I should <lb/>
state What are the reasons which have sep<lb break="no"/>arated me on some points from the major<lb break="no"/>ity of those who sit on this side of the <lb/>
House, I would be perfectly satisfied to <lb/>
give a silent vote on this question ; because, <lb/>
Sir, I consider that it is an unfortunate <lb/>
thing that, this question has been discussed <lb/>
with so much passion in public. I believe <lb/>
that many of the mischievous—I cannot <lb/>
call them by any other term—mischievous <lb/>
utterances which have been made on the <lb/>
subject of these Bills, have been the result <lb/>
of ignorance as to the real state of affairs <lb/>
in connection with the proposed
legislation; <lb/>
and I sincerely believe that when the ques<lb break="no"/>tion has been fully looked into—I agree to <lb/>
that extent with my hon. friend the Min<lb break="no"/>ister of Finance—and all sides of it proper<lb break="no"/>ly weighed, at any rate as regards the edu<lb break="no"/>cational aspect of the question, the people <lb/>
of Canada will come to the conclusion that <lb/>
in the concessions granted, and
the efiort <lb/>
made by this parliament to
create condi— <lb/>
tions of justice and equity in the North<lb break="no"/>west, the practical result is not one of very <lb/>
great importance. That, at any rate, is my <lb/>
view of the subject. It is, I admit, an im<lb break="no"/>portant subject in the principles which are <lb/>
to govern us in our decision of the question. <lb/>
It is important, no doubt, that one,
should <lb/>
state for what reason one gives a vote <lb/>
which may appear strange ; but at the same <lb/>
time I think a great deal too much has been <lb/>
made of the extent to which parliament has <lb/>
been asked to go in connection with this <lb/>
legislation. Let me at once call the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the House to the seriousness of a <lb/>
statement made last night by the Minister <lb/>
of Finance. To my mind this is a question <lb/>
upon which every man can have a free and <lb/>
independent opinion without in any way <lb/>
alienating his co-religionists of different <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3066</fw>
   
 creed. I am pleased to say, and I desire <lb/>
to acknowledge, that in the words that fell <lb/>
from the hon. leader of the opposition last <lb/>
night—and I followed him very attentively <lb/>
—there was not one word which it seems <lb/>
to me could shock any man of any creed in <lb/>
the province of Quebec or elsewhere. He <lb/>
was led by logical deductions to the conclu<lb break="no"/>sions at which he arrived; and, Sir, I am <lb/>
proud to say, so far as I may represent <lb/>
public opinion in my own province, that <lb/>
there is one thing which we learn early in <lb/>
our schools, and that is, to respect abso<lb break="no"/>lutely the convictions of all of our fellow <lb/>
citizens. I am sorry to say that I do not <lb/>
think that part of our curriculum is to be <lb/>
found in all the other schools of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. But when the Minister of Finance <lb/>
went so far as to say that in the event of <lb/>
the Prime Minister not being able to carry <lb/>
this measure through the House, and of my <lb/>
hon. friend the leader of the opposition <lb/>
being called upon to form a cabinet, the <lb/>
cabinet which he would form would neces<lb break="no"/>sarily have a purely religious colour, and <lb/>
would be a Protestant administration, I do <lb/>
think my hon. friend the Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance went quite beyond the bounds which <lb/>
anything which my hon. friend the leader <lb/>
of the opposition said could in any sense <lb/>
justify. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Hon. W. S. FIELDING</persName>. Will my hon. <lb/>
friend permit me to say that I did not at<lb break="no"/>tribute any remark of any kind to the hon. <lb/>
leader of the opposition in that relation. I <lb/>
expressed my own opinion as to the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances surrounding the whole case. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. My hon. friend spoke of <lb/>
that conclusion to which he himself had <lb/>
arrived as being the legitimate conclusion <lb/>
of the observations made by the hon. lead<lb break="no"/>er of the opposition. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. If my hon. friend will <lb/>
allow me, I will at once say that I
certain<lb break="no"/>ly did not mean to do so, and I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied that I did not do so. I had no such <lb/>
thought, for I was not referring to anything <lb/>
the leader of the opposition said in any <lb/>
way. I am sorry to interrupt my hon. <lb/>
friend. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. I am glad to hear my hon. <lb/>
friend say so. My hon. friend no doubt <lb/>
sympathizes with those who, perhaps not <lb/>
very readily, have arrived at the conclu<lb break="no"/>sion to which he arrived yesterday, to sup<lb break="no"/>port this educational measure; because, if <lb/>
rumours are well founded, my hon. friend <lb/>
him-self experienced very great
difficulty in <lb/>
arriving at that conclusion before he spoke. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Not the least. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. There was nothing in what <lb/>
my hon. friend said which indicated that <lb/>
state of mind; but my hon. friend knows <lb/>
what has been the public rumour. One <lb/>
of my hon. friend's friends stated to me <lb/>

 yesterday that the Minister of Finance
was <lb/>
a wonderful swimmer, but that he had to <lb/>
be thrown into the water. I realize, with <lb/>
some degree of fear, that this debate may <lb/>
be protracted to a considerable length. and <lb/>
I wish to indicate as briefly as possible to <lb/>
the House through what mental process I <lb/>
have passed, it I may use that expression, <lb/>
in order to arrive at the conclusion at which <lb/>
I have arrived in respect to this measure. <lb/>
The question has been treated from a con<lb break="no"/>stitutional standpoint, and certainly it ought <lb/>
to be treated from that standpoint. since <lb/>
the very grounds on which we are legisla<lb break="no"/>ting
in this affair are constitutional <lb/>
 grounds. I submit. in addition. that it
must <lb/>
be looked at from a political standpoint— <lb/>
I say political in altogether the highest <lb/>
sense of the word. But, taking the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional standpoint, the House will per<lb break="no"/>mit me to say in what sense I understand <lb/>
that we are called upon to act. and how I <lb/>
interpret the three constitutional Acts <lb/>
which serve as the foundation for our le<lb break="no"/>gislation, and which must be
read together. <lb/>
We have the Confederation Act of 1867. <lb/>
the Act of 1871 and the Act of 1886— all
<lb/>
imperial Acts without which we have no <lb/>
jurisdiction whatever. Under section 3 of <lb/>
the last imperial Act, the amendment of <lb/>
1886, these three Acts must be read toge<lb break="no"/>ther. I will not quote the sections; it <lb/>
would be imposing upon the attention of <lb/>
the H&lt;,)rlse. But according
to the Con<lb break="no"/>stitutional Act of 1867, from the very <lb/>
first section. it is evident that the scheme <lb/>
of the framers of our constitution was that <lb/>
the provinces should be associated together <lb/>
with an absolutely equal division of powers. <lb/>
It never entered into the minds of the fram<lb break="no"/>ers of those Acts, particularly the Act of <lb/>
1867, nor even into the minds of those who <lb/>
laid the foundations of that Act in the Que<lb break="no"/>bec conference, that there should be the <lb/>
slightest inequality between the provinces. <lb/>
You will see that if you look at the Act of <lb/>
1867, from section 58 to section 91. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Read section 91 and section 92 (which are
<lb/>
the two most important sections in regard <lb/>
to the definition of the field of legislation), <lb/>
read section 93, section 109, section 146, and <lb/>
section 147 and you will come to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that the main object of
the im<lb break="no"/>perial legislature was to unite the varied <lb/>
provinces together and to distribute among <lb/>
those provinces, with the most absolute <lb/>
measure of equality, the different powers <lb/>
which were assigned to each. It is im<lb break="no"/>possible to read these Acts and not arrive <lb/>
at the conclusion that this is the proposition <lb/>
which is the outcome of the efforts made by <lb/>
the imperial legislature in the direction of <lb/>
confederation. The plan of confederation <lb/>
itself rests upon the absolute equality, the <lb/>
equal division of powers between all the <lb/>
provinces, parties to
confederation. Any <lb/>
variation, however small, from this rule is <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3068</fw>

 destructive
of the fundamental principle <lb/>
of our constitution. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Section 146
which provides for the ad<lb break="no"/>mission of other provinces into the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion upon the Order in Council
of the home <lb/>
government, especially declares that the <lb/>
admission of those other provinces of Prince <lb/>
Edward Island and British Columbia and <lb/>
Newfoundland is to be done by the mere <lb/>
operation of an imperial Order in Council <lb/>
which shall bring those
provinces into <lb/>
confederation, subject to all the dispositions <lb/>
of the Confederation Act. This was so very <lb/>
well understood at the very inception that <lb/>
we find British Columbia first of all enter<lb break="no"/>ing into confederation by the operation of <lb/>
section 1-16 by the mere passage
of an <lb/>
Order in Council bringing the province into <lb/>
confederation and touching in no respect <lb/>
whatever upon any of the powers which are <lb/>
to be attributed to the new provinces or <lb/>
upon any of those powers then lying in the <lb/>
lap of the new province and which were by <lb/>
necessary implication to be transferred to <lb/>
the Dominion. It is undeniable that when <lb/>
British Columbia and Prince Edward Island <lb/>
were brought into confederation. no other <lb/>
mention was made of the Order in Council <lb/>
which brought these provinces into con<lb break="no"/>federation but this that they came in with <lb/>
a certain representation in parliament, sti<lb break="no"/>pulated and agreed upon between the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion government and the
provincial powers, <lb/>
but as to a distribution of powers nothing <lb/>
whatever is said ; reference is simply made <lb/>
to section 146 of the Confederation Act. <lb/>
It is there declared that these
provinces <lb/>
come into the Dominion subject to that dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of powers which, according to my <lb/>
interpretation of our constitution, acts au<lb break="no"/>tomatically the moment the province enters <lb/>
the Dominion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> In the case of Manitoba there were
special <lb/>
circumstances. Manitoba did not enter con<lb break="no"/>federation under the ordinary rule. It was <lb/>
an exceptional case, and the terms upon <lb/>
which that province entered the Dominion <lb/>
were the subject of a special agreement <lb/>
between the representatives of that then <lb/>
part of the Northwest Territories and the <lb/>
Dominion government. An Act was passed <lb/>
beforehand by this parliament in order to <lb/>
create that province with certain rights, <lb/>
certain broad possibilities, and the charter <lb/>
of Manitoba is so little founded upon that <lb/>
Act of our own parliament and that Act <lb/>
was so clearly, in the judgment of competent <lb/>
lawyers, ultra vires, that it became neces<lb break="no"/>sary to pass in England the Imperial Act <lb/>
of 1871 which is really the charter of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba, so that Manitoba did not enter the <lb/>
confederation under the same machinery <lb/>
as that provided for other parts of British <lb/>
North America. Its charter is a special <lb/>
one, and it is taken altogether out of the <lb/>
ordinary rule with regard to its entering <lb/>

 into confederation. These provinces, Sir,
<lb/>
are to be created under a section-of that <lb/>
Act of 1871, passed mainly in order to vali<lb break="no"/>date our own Manitoba legislation, and to <lb/>
the second section of which Act I wish to <lb/>
call your attention particularly. The sec<lb break="no"/>ond section of the Imperial Statutes of 1871 <lb/>
amending the Confederation Act says: <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> The parliament of Canada may from time to
<lb/>
time establish new provinces in any territories <lb/>
forming for the time being part
of the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion of Canada, but not included in any province <lb/>
thereof, and may, at time of establishment, <lb/>
make provision for the constitution and ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of any such province, and for the <lb/>
passing of laws for the peace, order and good <lb/>
government of such province, and for its repre<lb break="no"/>sentation in the said parliament. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Now,
that section is of some length. It <lb/>
is the only section under which we are em<lb break="no"/>powered to act. It is in virtue of the powers <lb/>
conferred upon us by the imperial parlia<lb break="no"/>ment by this section that we are creating <lb/>
this province. It is known, Mr. Speaker, to <lb/>
many members of this House that a popular <lb/>
impression exists to the effect that this <lb/>
parliament has the power of creating pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and that at the time of the creation <lb/>
of provinces it can give those provinces such <lb/>
a constitution as it thinks fit. That is <lb/>
the popular impression and that impression <lb/>
is created no doubt in the minds of many <lb/>
by the reading of this section. But is that <lb/>
proposition well founded ? I think not; I <lb/>
do not think there is anything in this sec<lb break="no"/>tion which authorizes us, in creating a pro<lb break="no"/>vince, to give any constitutional aspect to <lb/>
that province. We are not called
upon to <lb/>
give it a constitution, we simply perform, if <lb/>
I may use that expression. a creative Act; <lb/>
we create the province, the constitutional <lb/>
Act of 1867 provides the rest.
That is how <lb/>
 I read this section. It is true that in this <lb/>
section the words 'establish' and then 'con<lb break="no"/>stitute.' and then 'administer' are used. <lb/>
But what do these words mean? There is <lb/>
one thing it seems to me that they do not <lb/>
mean. It is this, that in creating a province <lb/>
we can in any way vary the terms relating <lb/>
to the powers of that province that have been <lb/>
laid down in a uniform and definite man<lb break="no"/>ner by our Constitutional Act of 1867, and <lb/>
that is the reason which no doubt has led <lb/>
many and has induced probably the leader <lb/>
of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) to ar<lb break="no"/>rive at the conclusion that we have no power <lb/>
in creating a province to make any dispos<lb break="no"/>ition in regard to that province as far as edu<lb break="no"/>cational matters are concerned, because if <lb/>
when creating a province we can give to that <lb/>
province a particular educational system we <lb/>
can equally confer upon this province other <lb/>
powers, for instance. those
which are men<lb break="no"/>tioned in section 92 of the Constitutional <lb/>
Act. We could deprive the province of a <lb/>
part of these powers. We can
confer upon <lb/>
the province powers which it has not under <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3070</fw>
          
 the Confederation Act, which are en<lb break="no"/>umerated under section 91 as belong<lb break="no"/>ing to the Dominion parliament alone, <lb/>
and that is, no doubt, the reason <lb/>
which has led many to conclude
that <lb/>
we have no power under section 2 which I <lb/>
have just read to the House but that of <lb/>
creating a province, automatically come in<lb break="no"/>to force and are applied the dispositions of <lb/>
the Confederation Act limiting strictly the <lb/>
powers of the province and on the other <lb/>
side defining the extent of the powers of <lb/>
the Dominion parliament. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> What is the sense which one must attri<lb break="no"/>bute to the words ' establish, constitute and <lb/>
administer.' To my mind it is clear that <lb/>
these words were used by the draughtsman <lb/>
for the purpose of giving to the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion parliament, when carving provinces <lb/>
out of the Northwest Territories. the powers <lb/>
necessary to perform fully all the functions <lb/>
of the creative act. We decree for instance <lb/>
that a province will be established. The <lb/>
word 'constitute ' means that we define the <lb/>
limits of the province, that we declare what <lb/>
it will comprise. when it will come into ex<lb break="no"/>istence and other details which are all com<lb break="no"/>prised in the word ' constitute,' and we fur<lb break="no"/>ther have the power to administer that pro<lb break="no"/>vince until these automatic provisions of <lb/>
the Confederation Act come into operation, <lb/>
by which a power superior to our own has <lb/>
provided what will be the political constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of the province. Otherwise if you once <lb/>
pretend that the words of the statute con<lb break="no"/>fer upon this parliament the power <lb/>
to modify in any way, what will be <lb/>
the political constitution and
the att<lb break="no"/>tribution of the new provinces, where <lb/>
will you end ? Suppose to-morrow we <lb/>
should carve a province out of the Yu<lb break="no"/>kon. could we, in creating that province, <lb/>
declare that the minerals shall remain the <lb/>
property of the Dominion power? Could <lb/>
we declare that the lands would remain in <lb/>
our possession ? I hold we could not, and <lb/>
that the only power we have is to create the <lb/>
province ? That however is my own indi<lb break="no"/>vidual opinion. It is the opinion of a law<lb break="no"/>yer, and we all know that lawyers differ <lb/>
very considerably, particularly on consitu<lb break="no"/>tional points. For instance my hon. friend <lb/>
the leader of the opposition, in defining the <lb/>
constitutional position he takes with regard <lb/>
to this Bill, gave it as his opinion. if I mis<lb break="no"/>take not. that section 3 of the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion Act does not apply to the new provinces <lb/>
coming into the Dominion without any pre<lb break="no"/>vious provincial organization, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently did not apply to provinces created <lb/>
by ourselves under the Imperial Act of 1871 <lb/>
and carved out of the Northwest Territories. <lb/>
I cannot, after a careful examination of <lb/>
section 93, agree in that conclusion, although <lb/>
I believe it is shared by gentlemen eminent <lb/>
in the legal profession. I believe that at <lb/>
the moment a province is created, even if <lb/>
it did not possess beforehand full legis<lb break="no"/>
      

            <pb n="3071" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-23_Page_3071.jpg"/>

lative autonomy, even if it did not enter
<lb/>
confederation as an independent province, <lb/>
it falls ipso facto under the provision
of <lb/>
section 93, and whatever rights in school <lb/>
matters the minority in that province may <lb/>
possess at the moment of its creation are <lb/>
preserved by virtue of that section. That <lb/>
is the way I read section 93 and I think <lb/>
the terms are extremely general. Subsec<lb break="no"/>tion 1 of section 93—Which is a section of <lb/>
very great importance in the determination <lb/>
of this question says: <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> Nothing in any such law shall
prejudicially <lb/>
affect any right or privilege with respect to <lb/>
denominational schools which any class of per<lb break="no"/>sons have by law in the province at the time of <lb/>
the union. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Doubt might exist if instead of those
very <lb/>
general words, the words used were ' which <lb/>
any class of persons possess by virtue of a <lb/>
provincial law or a law passed by the legis<lb break="no"/>lature of the province' or other such words <lb/>
clearly indicating that the legislators had in <lb/>
view exclusively the case of the entry into <lb/>
confederation of a province having full pos<lb break="no"/>session, previous to such entry, of its entire <lb/>
autonomy. But the words are extremely <lb/>
general. They speak of the rights with res<lb break="no"/>pect to denominational schools which any <lb/>
persons have by law within the limits of <lb/>
the province at the union. I therefore ar<lb break="no"/>rive at the conclusion that the moment a <lb/>
province is erected in the Northwest and <lb/>
that within the territorial limits of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince there exists a law passed by compe<lb break="no"/>tent authority securing certain rights to any <lb/>
class of persons with regard to denomina<lb break="no"/>tional schools, those rights are preserved <lb/>
by the mere fact of that territory coming <lb/>
as a province within the limits of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion. That is the opinion I have, and much <lb/>
of the conclusions at which I have arrived <lb/>
in respect of this question is the result of <lb/>
that opinion. My hon. friend from East <lb/>
Grey (Mr. Sproule) asks me if I consider <lb/>
the words 'establish, constitute. coming in,' <lb/>
to be all synonymous. My interpretation of <lb/>
section 2 of the Imperial Act of 1871 is that <lb/>
that Act clearly gives us the creative power. <lb/>
it enables us to decree the establishment of <lb/>
a province, to constitute it by defining its <lb/>
limits and entering into other details which <lb/>
are absolutely necessary for the purpose of <lb/>
such creation, but the moment that act has <lb/>
been performed our power is exhausted and <lb/>
the new province comes under the control <lb/>
of the different clauses of the Act of 1867, <lb/>
and these clauses apply in their entirety to <lb/>
it. Will the House permit me to give an <lb/>
example in another field. Take the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the lands. It seems to me that in <lb/>
the new Bill now submitted for second read<lb break="no"/>ing, we have gone entirely beyond our power <lb/>
as regards the lands. Why? Because <lb/>
under section 109 of the Confederation Act <lb/>

 inion. And
in legislating as we, have done <lb/>
with regard to these lands, in withholding <lb/>
from these new provinces the whole <lb/>
of their lands, for a consideration it is true, <lb/>
but keeping the lands entirely in our pos<lb break="no"/>session we are legislating ultra vires, we are <lb/>
decreeing what we have no right to do ; and <lb/>
not only as an act of policy, as a political <lb/>
act, but as a constitutional act, those Bills <lb/>
are absolutely in violation of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Are we to assume then <lb/>
that the Manitoba Act, which was in terms <lb/>
practically the same as this Act, which de<lb break="no"/>clared the ungranted lands of that province <lb/>
to remain subject to the control of the <lb/>
Dominion government, was ultra vires ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. As I stated a moment ago, <lb/>
the Manitoba Act itself was ultra vires— <lb/>
was so considered by the legal advisers <lb/>
of the Crown in England—and in order <lb/>
to make it valid it was necessary to pass <lb/>
the Imperial Act of 1871. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. To remove doubts. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. That is the preamble that <lb/>
my hon. friend (Mr. Lemieux) is citing. <lb/>
But, if he will go to the sources. he will <lb/>
find that there was a very strong opinion <lb/>
in England and also here—I believe it was <lb/>
shared by Mr. Blake—that we had no right. <lb/>
It validated the section to which my hon. <lb/>
friend from Ottawa (Mr.
Belcourt) has re<lb break="no"/>ferred. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. My hon. friend (Mr. <lb/>
Monk) will not contend that any one ques<lb break="no"/>tioned at that time or since that the Act <lb/>
was ultra vires in respect of the lands. <lb/>
The necessity of the Imperial Act, as I un<lb break="no"/>derstand, was in reference to other matters, <lb/>
to remove doubts in reference to other mat<lb break="no"/>ters than the lands. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. It did not arise in that case. <lb/>
There was, as I stated, an
agreement be<lb break="no"/>tween Manitoba that was to be and the <lb/>
Dominion, and the lands clause to Which <lb/>
my hon. friend has just referred was the <lb/>
outcome of that agreement. At any rate, <lb/>
it was never questioned before the courts. <lb/>
As my hon. friend, no doubt, is aware, this <lb/>
question has come before the courts in many <lb/>
instances and the interpretation given by <lb/>
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council <lb/>
upon section 199, to which I have referred, <lb/>
has always been favourable to the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, and has gone very far in the direc<lb break="no"/>tion of maintaining that all public lands, <lb/>
whatever may be the source of the owner<lb break="no"/>ship of the public lands, once the province <lb/>
is created. fall under provincial control. <lb/>
A case arose in the province of
Quebec, the <lb/>
case of Fraser who died without leaving <lb/>
a will. and without heirs. My hon. friend <lb/>
(Mr. Belcourt) is familiar with
that case. <lb/>

            <p> It was the case of the Attorney General
of <lb/>
Quebec against the Attorney General of the <lb/>
Dominion. It was held in the province of <lb/>
Quebec, that, under section 109, the lands <lb/>
in dispute reverted to the Crown in right <lb/>
of the province. In the courts of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec they held that upon the <lb/>
ground that, as the province had the ex<lb break="no"/>clusive right to legislate in regard to pro<lb break="no"/>perty and civil rights, it followed as a con<lb break="no"/>sequence that it might have legislated <lb/>
equally in regard to these lands, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently that these lands were the pro<lb break="no"/>perty of the province. And that judgment <lb/>
went through the courts and was main<lb break="no"/>tained in the Privy Council. Then there <lb/>
was the Mercer case in Ontario. I speak <lb/>
of that frmi memory only and under cor<lb break="no"/>rection. The last court of appeal in On<lb break="no"/>tario held that escheated lands
fell to the <lb/>
Dominion, if I mistake not—the contrary <lb/>
of what our own Court of Appeals held. <lb/>
But the matter went to the Privy Council, <lb/>
and the Privy Council held that in the case <lb/>
of an escheat, the province had the right to <lb/>
the land under section 109. And, in the case <lb/>
of the St. Catharines Milling Company vs. <lb/>
the Queen, a case that lawyers will remem<lb break="no"/>ber, the question involved was as to an In<lb break="no"/>dian reservation which had been abandoned <lb/>
by the Indians. The Privy Council held <lb/>
that, under section 109 of the Confederation <lb/>
Act, these lands, abandoned by the Indians <lb/>
who were under control of the Dominion <lb/>
government and under the legislative con<lb break="no"/>trol of the Dominion parliament, fell into <lb/>
the provincial domain under section 109. <lb/>
The latest case I have is the case of the <lb/>
Attorney General of British Columbia vs. <lb/>
the Attorney General of Canada, in which <lb/>
the question arose in a still more pointed <lb/>
manner and in which, I think, the Privy <lb/>
Council went even further. In that case, <lb/>
as hon. members will remember, British <lb/>
Columbia had conceded to the Dominion <lb/>
government a forty-mile strip upon the line <lb/>
of the Canadian Pacific Railway for a con<lb break="no"/>sideration, I believe, of $100,000 a year. <lb/>
That was an absolute cession of the lands. <lb/>
Gold was found in that forty-mile strip, <lb/>
and the question arose as to whether the <lb/>
Dominion power or the provincial power <lb/>
had a right to that gold and the royalties <lb/>
upon it—which of the Powers owned the <lb/>
mineral wealth. In that case, if I remember <lb/>
aright, the Lords of the Privy Council held <lb/>
that the words ' British Columbia ' must be <lb/>
read into section 109 of the Confederation <lb/>
Act—that not only the four provinces then <lb/>
parties to the confederation compact, but, <lb/>
said the Lords of the Privy Council you <lb/>
must read into section 109 the names of <lb/>
British Columbia and all the provinces that <lb/>
have since been added to the Domin<lb break="no"/>ion, and the right to this gold and <lb/>
the royalties upon it is in the Crown <lb/>
in right of the province. So I am <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3074</fw>
       
 correct, I think, in saying that
jurispru<lb break="no"/>dence seems to favour the view that section <lb/>
109 is of a most general character, and <lb/>
that all lands belonging to the Crown, fall <lb/>
to the Crown in right of the province the <lb/>
moment that province is created. It was <lb/>
so understood in regard to the provinces <lb/>
that entered the Dominion since confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. It was so understood in regard to <lb/>
British Columbia. There was no special <lb/>
mention of the lands in the Order in Coun<lb break="no"/>cil by which the gates were opened to that <lb/>
province for its entry into confederation. <lb/>
There was no mention of lands in the Order <lb/>
in Council under which Prince Edward Is<lb break="no"/>land came into confederation. But, in the <lb/>
case of British Columbia these lands, by <lb/>
the very vigour of the Confederation Act <lb/>
were supposed to remain the property of <lb/>
the province, and, in the case of Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island, where there were no public <lb/>
lands, the Dominion had to agree to a cer<lb break="no"/>tain sum to be given to the province in
<lb/>
lieu of public lands. So. I say, by com<lb break="no"/>mon understanding of section 109 and the <lb/>
interpretation put upon that section since <lb/>
our constitutional questions have arisen, it <lb/>
would seem to be evident that public lands, <lb/>
by the very terms of the constitution be<lb break="no"/>longed to the province the moment they <lb/>
enter confederation. And I see no reason <lb/>
for departing from that rule in regard to <lb/>
the province created out of a portion of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. Are we not proprietors<lb/>
of the land in Manitoba, and proprietors
of<lb/>
the lands in these provinces? <lb/>
            </p>






            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. I do not know that that <lb/>
makes any difference. And as regards the <lb/>
observation of the Solicitor General (Mr. <lb/>
Lemieux) that we purchased the lands, I <lb/>
do not think that that proposition is well <lb/>
founded. Even had we purchased the <lb/>
lands, they are not vested in the Dominion <lb/>
government, they are the property of the <lb/>
Crown, the property of the King. And un<lb break="no"/>der our confederation scheme, all public <lb/>
lands situated within the province continue <lb/>
to belong to the King in right of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince. As a matter of fact, We did not <lb/>
purchase the landed rights. There was an <lb/>
amount given to the Hudson Bay Com<lb break="no"/>pany in consideration of the abandonment <lb/>
of its rights in that territory. But those <lb/>
rights were not rights in the lands, but <lb/>
hunting rights and commercial rights under <lb/>
charters obtained long ago under Charles <lb/>
II. But I do not think that those charters <lb/>
conferred any special title in the lands. So <lb/>
I do not think the hon. gentleman is right <lb/>
in saying what he does as to the purchase <lb/>
of the lands. The same remarks apply to <lb/>
that section of the Act in which we enjoin <lb/>
upon the province that it shall not interfere <lb/>
with the Canadian Pacific Railway. I ven<lb break="no"/>ture the opinion that that is not intra vires. <lb/>
We can create a province, but we have no <lb/>

right to formulate an enactment in the <lb/>
creating statue to say that the province or <lb/>
its municipalities that may in future exist <lb/>
shall not tax the Canadian Pacific Railway <lb/>
Company. That is an interference with <lb/>
that provision of the Confederation Act con<lb break="no"/>tained in section 92 which gives the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces absolute and exclusive control over <lb/>
municipalities. It is an interference with <lb/>
section 92 which says that the province shall <lb/>
have the right to raise money by direct tax<lb break="no"/>ation within its limits. I do not say for in<lb break="no"/>stance that the Canadian Paciflc Railway <lb/>
has not any valid defence to offer to any ex<lb break="no"/>actions that may be made by the province <lb/>
or by municipalities within that province. <lb/>
There may be a defence, although the ques<lb break="no"/>tion is certainly one that admits of much <lb/>
doubt. But in my understanding of the <lb/>
constitution, we have no power by positive <lb/>
enactment to say to the new province: <lb/>
Here are two powers which you have under <lb/>
section 92, the power of taxing directly, and <lb/>
the absolute control over municipalities, <lb/>
but you shall not exercise these powers in <lb/>
either case with respect to this particular <lb/>
company. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>.
It seems to me the <lb/>
point to decide is the jurisdiction of this <lb/>
parliament concerning lands contained in <lb/>
the Bills now under consideration. I would <lb/>
like to know from my hon. friend exactly <lb/>
what his legal view is. I understood him <lb/>
to say, in reply to my question, that the <lb/>
provision in the Manitoba Act with reference <lb/>
to lands, by which the control of these lands <lb/>
was retained in the Dominion government, <lb/>
was ultra vires, but that that defect was <lb/>
cured by the Confederation Act. of 1871, <lb/>
section 1 which he read to the House. I <lb/>
would like to know whether, in the opinion <lb/>
of my hon. friend, the amendment of 1871 <lb/>
has had the effect of amending the British <lb/>
North America Act of 1867 generally or <lb/>
only with reference to Manitoba, particular<lb break="no"/>ly as regards lands? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>.  Well,
it has amended the <lb/>
Confederation Act, no doubt; it has added <lb/>
powers in order to define more clearly our <lb/>
power to create provinces. But
the ques<lb break="no"/>tion has never arisen before the courts as <lb/>
to the validity of our enactment with regard <lb/>
to lands in Manitoba. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. I want to know <lb/>
whether, in the opinion of the hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man. our powers given in the
British North <lb/>
America Act of 1867 have been extended by <lb/>
the provisions of 1871. not only with re<lb break="no"/>ference to Manitoba. but with reference to <lb/>
any new province coming into the
Domin<lb break="no"/>ion ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. I think section 2, which is <lb/>
the basis of our powers under which we <lb/>
are acting now, is an addition. a further ex<lb break="no"/>tension of what is contained in section 148 <lb/>
of the Confederation Act. There is an in<lb break="no"/>crease of powers—if that is what my hon. <lb/>


            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3076</fw>
         
 friend means. Now, Mr. Speaker, I wish to
<lb/>
be brief, and I find it is very difficult. I <lb/>
am arriving at the point I wish to make <lb/>
with reference to the Educational Act. I <lb/>
have wandered away from it in order to <lb/>
give the House a better understanding of <lb/>
my opinion of these Acts, since we are on <lb/>
the second reading. and it will save me the <lb/>
trouble of explaining my views at a later <lb/>
stage. I hope that is the view which will <lb/>
prevail. I would like to point out, as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber from the province of Quebec, that it <lb/>
would be a great calamity indeed if the <lb/>
Minister of Justice and the government did <lb/>
not arrive at a conclusion that it is neces<lb break="no"/>sary to modify that section which has re<lb break="no"/>gard. for instance, to the lands. I do not <lb/>
see, looking upon it as a question of policy. <lb/>
what we have gained in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec, and in the older provinces generally, <lb/>
by this enormous indemnity we are under<lb break="no"/>taking to pay the new provinces
of the <lb/>
Northwest for their lands. As I understand <lb/>
it they have a legal claim to these lands. <lb/>
They are better able to administer them <lb/>
than we are here in Ottawa. They are on <lb/>
the spot, they know the necessities of their <lb/>
province, they have every interest in ad<lb break="no"/>ministering them with care, because these <lb/>
lands are their principal asset.
and they are <lb/>
the best judges of the requirements of their <lb/>
province in respect to the lands. As to us <lb/>
in the province of Quebec, why, Sir. we have <lb/>
over 25.000000 acres of good land for settle<lb break="no"/>ment, which we are trying to settle, which <lb/>
we are doing our best to settle. Instead <lb/>
of devoting all our energies and all our <lb/>
moneys and public resources to settle the <lb/>
lands in our own province, under the terms <lb/>
of the constitution. we are going to pay <lb/>
millions of dollars to keep a hold on the <lb/>
lands of the Northwest, which properly be<lb break="no"/>long to our sister provinces. That is the <lb/>
way I understand this clause, and I hope it <lb/>
will be reconsidered. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Now, Sir, taking the views which I have <lb/>
offered to the House, being my own humble <lb/>
interpretation of the constitutional Act, I <lb/>
have entertained no doubt at any time that <lb/>
section 93 of the Act applies to this territory <lb/>
which we are to-day erecting into provinces. <lb/>
In section 93. as we all know, there was a <lb/>
protection for the rights of the minority in <lb/>
those new provinces. I assume that. but <lb/>
is it the case? Eminent lawyers, men <lb/>
whose authority on constitutional matters <lb/>
is far greater than my own, do not assent <lb/>
to this view. They do not think that sec<lb break="no"/>tion 03 applies to these new provinces. which <lb/>
is a proof, if proof was required at all, that <lb/>
lawyers, like doctors, will disagree on con<lb break="no"/>stitutional points particularly. There is no <lb/>
set of cases coming before our courts where <lb/>
we have had a more uniform spectacle of <lb/>
disagreement among our judges than con<lb break="no"/>stitutional cases. Therefore, I say there is <lb/>
a grave doubt in my own mind as to whether <lb/>
section 93 applies. If it does not apply, then <lb/>
what guarantee. what security
has the <lb/>
minority of these two provinces on enter<lb break="no"/>ing confederation ? If it applies. if that <lb/>
          

            <pb n="3077" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-23_Page_3077.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">3077</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 23, 1905</fw> 
      

 was certain and was admitted by
everybody. <lb/>
you could-not say more of this amendment <lb/>
which is before the House at the present <lb/>
time than that it duplicates what the con<lb break="no"/>stitution provides, and duplicates it useless<lb break="no"/>ly. But if, as is pretended by
some. section <lb/>
98, the protecting section of the Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion Act. does not apply. then they have no <lb/>
protection. Then I say, if that claim is well <lb/>
founded in equity, there is a moral obliga<lb break="no"/>tion on the part of this parliament; if the <lb/>
claim of the minority is well founded, and <lb/>
if they do not find that protection which it <lb/>
would seem they have in section 93, then <lb/>
should we not provide it ourselves? Is <lb/>
there a man in this House, be he from the <lb/>
west or from the east, who will deny that <lb/>
at this very moment when we are creating <lb/>
two new provinces, we particularly of this <lb/>
parliament, who have for more than thirty <lb/>
years maintained, rightly or wrongly, the <lb/>
minority in that immense territory in the <lb/>
possession of their educational rights, we <lb/>
who have been the guardians of those rights. <lb/>
and on two occasions have solemnly affirm<lb break="no"/>ed that those rights exist—is there any man <lb/>
who will deny that we should at the present <lb/>
moment, when we are creating these pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, when doubts are expressed as to <lb/>
our right to legislate in regard to this im<lb break="no"/>portant point, is there a man who will pre<lb break="no"/>tend that we ought not, in the preservation <lb/>
of our own honour, to maintain those rights <lb/>
as far as we can ? If the enactment is un<lb break="no"/>constitutional, it will be so declared by the <lb/>
courts. If the minority, under section 93 <lb/>
of the British North America Act, have full <lb/>
protection, this Act is surplusage. The same <lb/>
question would arise if we went beyond <lb/>
what section 93 assures, if we gave more <lb/>
than they have at the present time, or if we <lb/>
took from them something which has always <lb/>
been secured. But we are merely assuring <lb/>
to them the rights which they possess at <lb/>
the present time. In this connection, let me <lb/>
say that we have before us three drafts of <lb/>
proposed legislation. In the very able com<lb break="no"/>munication made by Mr. Haultain to the <lb/>
government, which has been brought down <lb/>
in this House is one of these
drafts. That <lb/>
is a draft which, at first sight,
seemed to <lb/>
me to go even farther than did
the first <lb/>
educational clause of my right hon. friend, <lb/>
[and farther than this last one,
and that <lb/>
clause is to be found in Mr. Haultain's <lb/>
draft, at page 14 of the papers
produced be<lb break="no"/>fore the Northwest Territories
assembly. <lb/>
Section 2 of the draft is as follows : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> On, from and after the said first day of
Janu<lb break="no"/>ary, 1903, the provisions of the British North <lb/>

in<lb break="no"/>tendment may be held to be specially applic<lb break="no"/>able to or to affect only one or more but not the <lb/>

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3078</fw>
            <p> As I at first felt under my interpretation
<lb/>
of our Constitutional Act, I assumed that in <lb/>
regard to all school legislation the Act of <lb/>
union drafted by Mr. Haultain brought us <lb/>
back to the 1st of July, 1867, and I say that <lb/>
that disposition of law went even farther <lb/>
than the two other enactments that are be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, because, if we went back <lb/>
to the date of the Union in 1867, the min<lb break="no"/>ority in these new provinces might proper<lb break="no"/>ly urge the claim that Since legislative auto<lb break="no"/>nomy has been conferred on the Northwest <lb/>
Territories they have had their educational <lb/>
committee. They have had their own ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of their own schools confer<lb break="no"/>red to a greater extent than they have at <lb/>
the present time and therefore under that <lb/>
enactment and under section 93 of the Con<lb break="no"/>stitutional Act they may claim to be fully <lb/>
restored to all their privileges. I think <lb/>
they might urge that at any rate. As to <lb/>
the first educational clause that was brought <lb/>
down 'I must say that it did not seem to me <lb/>
to have any other effect than to create in <lb/>
the public mind an extremely erroneous <lb/>
impression as to what we were doing for <lb/>
the new provinces. Any man who takes <lb/>
the trouble to inquire will be able to as<lb break="no"/>certain that by the clause relating to
edu<lb break="no"/>cation which was first submitted to the <lb/>
attention of the House we were not break<lb break="no"/>ing in upon the educational system of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories, not introducing a <lb/>
separate school system exactly as it existed <lb/>
in the province of Quebec, but that we <lb/>
were following the established order of <lb/>
things in the Northwest Territories, and it <lb/>
is probably due to the haste with which <lb/>
that clause was drawn that all the agita<lb break="no"/>tion that subsequently arose is to be attri<lb break="no"/>buted, because, in reality, what did that <lb/>
clause give to the Northwest Territories? <lb/>
It gave separate schools. They have them. <lb/>
They have had them since 1875, but it
gave <lb/>
nothing more. It is true it made a provi<lb break="no"/>sion as regards the distribution of moneys <lb/>
resulting from the Northwest Territories <lb/>
Trust School Fund, but, as I understand <lb/>
that part of the question, I think there is <lb/>
no doubt whatever that under section 93 of <lb/>
our Confederation Act the words 'public <lb/>
schools' in the Northwest Lands Act is un<lb break="no"/>derstood as applying to the schools of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories as they exist today.
<lb/>
They are called separate schools but they <lb/>
      are in reality public schools and will be
so <lb/>
       interpreted by any tribunal. We have this <lb/>
amendment in which it has been suggested <lb/>
that concessions have been made - <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. I did not know that, but it <lb/>
goes to prove that interpretation and there <lb/>
is no other interpretation possible because <lb/>
anybody who takes the trouble to read <lb/>
from end to end the ordinances of the <lb/>
Northwest Territories in respect to schools <lb/>
must arrive necessarily at that- conviction. <lb/>
I do not know what distinction there <lb/>
would be between what are called separate <lb/>
schools and public schools. They are not <lb/>
separate schools in the sense that we or<lb break="no"/>dinarily understand the term. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LEMI1">Mr. LEMIEUX</persName>. They are separate <lb/>
schools but not denominational schools. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. They are not denomination<lb break="no"/>al schools; certainly not. So, I do not see <lb/>
in the last enactment that there is any con<lb break="no"/>cession—very far from it. I think the last <lb/>
amendment goes perhaps a little farther <lb/>
than the original enactment which caused <lb/>
so much excitement because it defines more <lb/>
clearly what the privileges of the separate <lb/>
schools are. They were not defined at all <lb/>
in the original enactment. It defines them <lb/>
by reference to the chapters of the North<lb break="no"/>west Ordinances where they are fully ex<lb break="no"/>plained so that it defines more clearly these <lb/>
privileges and it may be argued that it se<lb break="no"/>cures to the separate schools the right of
<lb/>
religious instruction. I am not just sure <lb/>
under the first enactment it would not have <lb/>
been possible to say in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories: You have the right to separate <lb/>
schools, that is granted, you will have them <lb/>
but you have no right even to the half hour <lb/>
of religious instruction because it is not <lb/>
laid down in the bond. It is not in the <lb/>
Dominion enactment and we will withdraw <lb/>
that right from you. This enactment goes <lb/>
a little farther because it refers to the or<lb break="no"/>dinance which secures the right of religious <lb/>
instruction. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Will you just allow me to say one word <lb/>
in regard to What has been referred to by <lb/>
my hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bouras<lb break="no"/>sa) ? Is it a fact that we are by this
Bill <lb/>
establishing denominational schools in the <lb/>
Northwest Territories ? Before I
touch <lb/>
upon that let me say this to the House. <lb/>
The fact that a very great difference of <lb/>
opinion has existed among lawyers led me <lb/>
   
 to the conclusion that there is
certainly no <lb/>
   harm, holding as I do that the minority
is <lb/>
entitled to the preservation of its rights, in <lb/>
repeating in the form of an enactment, as <lb/>
we do by this Bill, what is already assured <lb/>
constitutionally to the minority by section <lb/>
93 of the British North America Act. And, <lb/>
I may go a step farther. That section forms <lb/>
part of the constitution, it is true, but I <lb/>
think one, who has at heart, as I have, I <lb/>
must admit, the maintenance of the very <lb/>
limited privileges that the minority are <lb/>
going to enjoy under this enactment might <lb/>
say in addition that we have had the ex<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3080</fw>
         
perience of Manitoba. Surely no case of <lb/>
any province could be presented in which <lb/>
greater precautions had been taken than <lb/>
were taken at the time of the creation or <lb/>
Manitoba for the maintenance of the <lb/>
rights of the minority. Everybody <lb/>
knows what happened. I will not re<lb break="no"/>peat the story of that unfortunate affair, <lb/>
but, as a matter of fact, by legislation of <lb/>
the province, the rights of the minority were <lb/>
taken away. They were taken away after <lb/>
every assurance had been given to that <lb/>
minority that their rights would be preserv<lb break="no"/>ed. There never was anything to my mind <lb/>
more unworthy than the action of the Mani<lb break="no"/>toba legislature in abolishing its legislative <lb/>
council, and at the time of that abolition <lb/>
giving the minority who helped to put <lb/>
through that abolition, every possible assur<lb break="no"/>ance that honourable men could give that <lb/>
at no time would their privileges be inter<lb break="no"/>fered with. They were taken away. The <lb/>
minority carried their claims before the <lb/>
courts. Ultimately, after an endless liti<lb break="no"/>gation, the highest court in the realm de<lb break="no"/>clared that they had a right to redress. <lb/>
That judgment of the Privy Council render<lb break="no"/>ed years ago remains, as the members of <lb/>
this House know, unsatisfied to this day. <lb/>
Does that not give to those whose mission <lb/>
perhaps more particularly it is
to secure <lb/>
the rights of the minority in these new <lb/>
provinces, the right to take every imagin<lb break="no"/>able precaution in order that those rights <lb/>
should be maintained even in the North<lb break="no"/>west? And I say this with due regard <lb/>
ts the people of the Northwest, because I <lb/>
have implicit confidence in that population. <lb/>
I hope on this occasion at any rate that <lb/>
confidence will not be misplaced. I know <lb/>
the disposition of the people who inhabit <lb/>
that large territory. They are generous, <lb/>
they are broad-minded, and I have every <lb/>
confidence—because, as any educationist <lb/>
knows, everything depends on the way in <lb/>
which an education law is administered— <lb/>
that they will treat that minority with <lb/>
justice. But we must admit that after the <lb/>
Act of 1875 had been passed, and after the <lb/>
Act of 1880 had been passed, the North<lb break="no"/>west legislature did confer rights upon
<lb/>
the minority—gave them a council of public <lb/>
instruction, gave them certain rights with<lb break="no"/>out which up to the present it has been <lb/>
considered impossible, by the minority, to <lb/>
carry on Catholic education, and they had <lb/>
the use of the French language. These <lb/>
things have been taken away, and, in reality <lb/>
as was said yesterday, what we are endea<lb break="no"/>vouring to preserve for them is merely the <lb/>
right to the material separation of schools, <lb/>
the right to be exempt from double taxa<lb break="no"/>tion in educational matters, to which Catho<lb break="no"/>lics are subject all over the United States, <lb/>
and the right to that half-hour of religious <lb/>
instruction at the end of the day which <lb/>
exists in the Northwest for all denomina<lb break="no"/>tions alike, I am happy to say, because I am <lb/>

 not a believer in any sense in those
schools <lb/>
where the name of God is never mention<lb break="no"/>ed. But is this education, Mr. Speaker— <lb/>
denominational education? So much has <lb/>
been said that is displeasing, that is hurtful, <lb/>
we have heard so much about the hierarchy, <lb/>
about priestly control, about endowing the <lb/>
Catholic Church in the Northwest. I have <lb/>
met men who have told me this: We are <lb/>
ready to give every facility to our Catholic <lb/>
fellow-countrymen in the Northwest, but <lb/>
we are not prepared to endow a church. <lb/>
This is the way they understood this en<lb break="no"/>actment. Well, it is reasonable, it seems <lb/>
to me, to ask ourselves what is in reality <lb/>
the effect of this enactment? Is it the <lb/>
endowment of a church ? Is it even denom<lb break="no"/>inational education, as they have it freely <lb/>
all over England? It is not denominational <lb/>
education at all, because that supposes <lb/>
that the education in denominational schools <lb/>
is entirely under the control of men of a <lb/>
particular denomination. It supposes that <lb/>
the particular creed of that denomination <lb/>
is taught with the same care as other <lb/>
branches of knowledge. It supposes that the <lb/>
education in the schools, the text books, <lb/>
the qualifications of teachers, all that goes <lb/>
to make up denominational education, is <lb/>
under the control, not of clerics, not of <lb/>
priests or bishops, but of men who belong <lb/>
to that denomination. This is not at all <lb/>
the character of the education that is being <lb/>
provided for in these new provinces. Let <lb/>
me just indicate to you what has already <lb/>
been indicated, but what cannot be re<lb break="no"/>peated too often in view of what has been <lb/>
said, that under the new regime in the <lb/>
Northwest Territories there is no Council of <lb/>
Public Instruction. There is a commissioner <lb/>
of education who with his department con<lb break="no"/>trols everything that is important in edu<lb break="no"/>cation—controls absolutely the formation <lb/>
of school districts, controls everything con<lb break="no"/>nected with normal schools for forming <lb/>
teachers; regulates the qualifications of <lb/>
those teachers, and can revoke them at <lb/>
any moment ; controls the books, the courses <lb/>
of study, the hours, the holidays, compulsory <lb/>
attendance of pupils, the requirements of <lb/>
the schools in regard to sites and buildings. <lb/>
All these matters remain absolutely under <lb/>
the control of the government, at present a <lb/>
government entirely Protestant. It is true, <lb/>
there is an educational advisory board com<lb break="no"/>posed of five members, two of whom are <lb/>
Catholics, to whom these matters are refer<lb break="no"/>red. But that board can only advise; it <lb/>
has no power of deciding; and, as a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of fact, the control of education in <lb/>
what are called separate schools, though <lb/>
they are really not so, is absolutely in the <lb/>
hands of the government. What, then, is <lb/>
the power of the Catholics under this legis<lb break="no"/>lation which we are called upon to sanct<lb break="no"/>ion ? Well, they engage teachers, but these <lb/>
teachers must have the qualifications which <lb/>
     

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3082</fw>
         
 have been settled beforehand by the
govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and those teachers may be re<lb break="no"/>voked; they provide for the half-hour of <lb/>
religious instruction, and they levy the rate <lb/>
of taxation; and even in regard to these <lb/>
matters they are absolutely accountable to <lb/>
the government, are inspected by an in<lb break="no"/>spector named by the government and hav<lb break="no"/>ing instructions from the government, and <lb/>
who may be and in most cases is not of <lb/>
their own creed. Under these circumstances <lb/>
I do not think we are imposing a great deal <lb/>
on the Northwest Territories, nor introduc<lb break="no"/>ing a very revolutionary measure. The <lb/>
best proof of that may be found in the <lb/>
appreciation given by Archbishop Taché of <lb/>
the legislation which at present exists, and <lb/>
we are anxious to preserve, because it keeps <lb/>
for the minority some shred of what they <lb/>
had before. Archbishop Taché, speaking of <lb/>
the schools in the Northwest, said : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> The Catholic schools are under the
control <lb/>
and direction of a council of public instruction <lb/>
(now it is a commissioner) in which there is <lb/>
not a Catholic who has a right to vote. The <lb/>
choice of all the books, both for teachers and <lb/>
for pupils, is entirely in the hands of Protest<lb break="no"/>ants, as well as the final formation of teachers <lb/>
and the right to give them permission to teach. <lb/>
The inspectors may all be Protestants, and <lb/>
in any case the inspection is made apart from <lb/>
any consideration for Catholic ideas. The ordi<lb break="no"/>nance destroys the Catholic character of
the <lb/>
schools which formerly distinguished those <lb/>
schools, and leaves them no point whatever <lb/>
upon which the faith of parents
can rest with <lb/>
any degree of confidence. <lb/>
            </p></quote>

            <p> Further on, Archbishop Taché appreciat<lb break="no"/>ing the system of education condemns the <lb/>
system and as a matter of fact those who <lb/>
have seen that system of schools in opera<lb break="no"/>tion in the Northwest Territories, who have <lb/>
been called upon as Catholics to take part <lb/>
in it, have time and again been obliged to <lb/>
apply to the authorities for the redress of <lb/>
grievances which must necessarily take <lb/>
place under such a system of law. I shall <lb/>
give as an example the case of religious <lb/>
orders going up there to teach, nuns and <lb/>
Christian brothers. They are obliged to <lb/>
qualify under the ordinance of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories and Without this qualifica<lb break="no"/>tion on certain occasions they have not been <lb/>
allowed to teach. This has given rise to a <lb/>
great deal of difficulty. As I
said before <lb/>
everything depends in an educational law on <lb/>
the manner in which it is administered and <lb/>
what we are claiming by this enactment is <lb/>
little enough. The Catholics in the North<lb break="no"/>west will have to a very large extent to <lb/>
depend on the generosity and broadminded<lb break="no"/>ness of the majority there in order to be <lb/>
able to carry into effect the legal privileges <lb/>
which they have kept up to this day. These <lb/>
are the reasons which have led me to the <lb/>
conclusion that the very least we can do, <lb/>
taking my interpretation of the constitution, <lb/>
is to support that part of the Bill which <lb/>
relatcs to the maintenance of separate <lb/>

 schools. Of course it would be useless at
<lb/>
this stage to point to the great differences <lb/>

 which
exist between our own country and <lb/>
       
 England in respect to broadness of
conces<lb break="no"/>sion in regard to education, but in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with this very important subject I <lb/>
have had occasion to look over the English <lb/>
educational law and the debates which have <lb/>
taken place on the Bill of 1902, and it is <lb/>
amazing, it is edifying to see to what extent <lb/>
they have gone in England in order to main<lb break="no"/>tain the principle of religious liberty in con<lb break="no"/>nection with schools. of course
as every <lb/>
one knows, denominational education exists <lb/>
in England ; there are there denominational <lb/>
schools such as exist here, but denomina<lb break="no"/>tional schools helped by the state, supported <lb/>
by the state, and in the educational Bill of <lb/>
1902 they have gone to a great length, they <lb/>
have improved the system in every way but.<lb/>
they have stuck with admirable tenacity to <lb/>
the principle that there shall be no schools <lb/>
without some kind of religion. There are <lb/>
board schools in England. where secular <lb/>
matters are taught. subject to what <lb/>
is known as the Cowper-Temple clause <lb/>
which provides that there will be re<lb break="no"/>ligious education but not of any par<lb break="no"/>ticular denominational
character. They <lb/>
have not wished even in the board <lb/>
schools to exclude the religious principle. <lb/>
In the voluntary schools denominational <lb/>
education is provided and encouraged by the <lb/>
state, and, always faithful to the principle <lb/>
of liberty of conscience, there is in the vol<lb break="no"/>untary schools a conscience. clause which <lb/>
exists since the educational law of 1870 and <lb/>
which provides that any pupil attending a <lb/>
school, may, if his conscience or the con<lb break="no"/>science of his parents require it, absent <lb/>
himself during religious instruction. In <lb/>
England they have stood firm throughout <lb/>
all educational changes to the principles of <lb/>
absolute religious equality in the schools <lb/>
and true to the principle of religious teach<lb break="no"/>ing. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> There is in this country, for some reason
<lb/>
which I am unable to understand, a servile <lb/>
desire to imitate the United States. <lb/>

we come to schools, amongst a certain set of <lb/>
people we have a desire to do exactly as <lb/>

Speaker. that system is on trial, it is on <lb/>
trial. It has only existed for some fifty <lb/>
years. Up to 1812. the primary
education <lb/>
provided in the United States was exactly <lb/>
the same as that provided in England and <lb/>
out of those schools which existed in the <lb/>
United States and which were similar to <lb/>
           

            <cb/>

 the schools that we have in Quebec, and <lb/>
that exist in Ontario, have come the most <lb/>
famous men whom we have had in the world <lb/>
during the last century. These schools have <lb/>
produced men like Washington, Jefferson, <lb/>
Colquhoun and Webster, and many others <lb/>
who have not been followed by men of equal <lb/>
value in the public life of the United States. <lb/>
And even those state schools which origin<lb break="no"/>ated in New York in 1842 and
have since <lb/>
spread over the whole republic, are in a ten<lb break="no"/>tative state; they are on trial. Have they <lb/>
given absolute satisfaction? Far from it, <lb/>
they are only on trial and many people have <lb/>
condemned that system of schools, have <lb/>
found it insufficient, inadequate to meet the <lb/>
wants of the nation. I have taken the <lb/>
trouble to find out What the judgment in the <lb/>
United States upon that system of schools <lb/>
has been, the judgment of men whose opin<lb break="no"/>ion is worth considering. not men of my <lb/>
own creed, but men of other creeds, and I <lb/>
find that opinion is very much divided as <lb/>
to the value of these schools. If anybody <lb/>
has any doubt as to the matter, he should <lb/>
read the ' New York Herald' of October 20, <lb/>
1871, in which are given the results of an <lb/>
inquiry made by no less a person than Pro<lb break="no"/>fessor Agassiz of the value in 1871 of the <lb/>
new educational system established in the <lb/>
United States. Speaking of the New York <lb/>

unanimous as to its merits. Under those <lb/>
circumstances, it seems strange that we <lb/>
should wander away from British traditions <lb/>
and be seduced into favouring a system <lb/>
which, to my mind at any rate, presents <lb/>
some very serious objections. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I did not wish to take up more time than <lb/>
I should, but I wished to give fully
my <lb/>
views to the House. I regret to have to <lb/>
say it, but there has been in the public dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of this question an endeavour to <lb/>
convey to the public that outside of all other <lb/>
considerations, outside of the constitutional <lb/>
question, which is a very grave one, it <lb/>
would be, from the point of view of exped<lb break="no"/>iency and policy, a great misfortune to see <lb/>
established in these provinces the schools <lb/>
of the Catholic minority. Are they then <lb/>
so inferior ? Are these schools productive <lb/>
of nothing but ignorance ? One is entitled <lb/>
to ask that question in view of what one <lb/>
reads and hears every day. Is that the <lb/>
fact? Well, in the United States where <lb/>
the natural rights of the parent to educate <lb/>
his child, the natural right of the citizen <lb/>
not to pay taxes for the support of schools <lb/>
to which he cannot send his children, is <lb/>
disregarded, what do we find? The cal<lb break="no"/>culation has been made and the statistics <lb/>
are there to prove it. We find that the <lb/>
Catholics, who cannot conscientiously send <lb/>
their children to these public schools, are <lb/>
obliged to expend, and do expend annually <lb/>
—what amount do you think ? Over $50,<lb break="no"/>000,000 a year in order to provide that ade<lb break="no"/>quate education for their children which <lb/>
their consciences oblige them to provide. I <lb/>
forget how many millions they expend in <lb/>
the city of New York alone. And they <lb/>
expend those millions to provide schools of <lb/>
their own with Catholic teachers. These <lb/>
schools are sometimes visited by impartial <lb/>
judges, and the education given in them is <lb/>
found just as good, and often better, than <lb/>
that given in the public schools. So that <lb/>
we have this spectacle in the United States, <lb/>
of a large portion of the people being obliged <lb/>
to pay taxes for schools to which they can<lb break="no"/>not send their children, and having to tax <lb/>
themselves further in order to provide <lb/>
schools which will satisfy the dictates of <lb/>
their conscience and enable them to exer<lb break="no"/>cise that right which is the natural un<lb break="no"/>deniable right of every parent, the right to <lb/>
educate his own children in the manner <lb/>
he thinks best. But under this tyranny <lb/>
exercised under the American constitution, <lb/>
they are obliged, in order to exercise that <lb/>
right, to pay double taxation. Is that what <lb/>
we want to see under the British flag in <lb/>
Canada? I say it is not desirable that <lb/>
anything of the kind should exist in this <lb/>
country. And outside, of constitutional con<lb break="no"/>siderations—the value of which I acknowl<lb break="no"/>edge and to the opinions of those who hold <lb/>
them I pay every deference—I will always <lb/>
uphold the principle in discussion under the present Bill,namely, the
right of a parent <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3088</fw>
          
to educate his child as he thinks best.
And <lb/>
at the risk of being a little lengthy, will <lb/>
you allow me just to quote what the First <lb/>
Minister of England had to say with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to that phase of the question in dis<lb break="no"/>cussing the Educational Bill. Speaking of <lb/>
the religious question, Mr. Balfour said :— <lb/>
            </p>


<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> I cannot leave this topic of the
necessity of <lb/>
the voluntary schools without saying that in <lb/>
my opinion they are necessary
also for another <lb/>
and a very different reason. What is the theory <lb/>
which, on both sides of the House as I think— <lb/>
I do not recognize any difference of principles <lb/>
between us—we ought to adopt with regard to <lb/>
denominational education in public schools. We <lb/>
do not insist, as everybody knows, upon teach<lb break="no"/>ing the children of this country any particular <lb/>
religion. We do insist upon teaching them a <lb/>
recognized arithmetic, a recognized geography, <lb/>
history, &amp;c. In the one case we decline the <lb/>
responsibility, leaving the responsibility to the <lb/>
parents, and in the other we are agreed that <lb/>
the state may properly take the responsibility <lb/>
of saying to every parent, so far as secular <lb/>
education is concerned, your child shall learn <lb/>
what we think fit to teach it. Of course the <lb/>
reason of this difference is known to all. We <lb/>
are agreed about secular education. We are not <lb/>
agreed about religious education. Whatever be <lb/>
the historic origin or the present state of <lb/>
things, we have, as a community, repudiated re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility for teaching the particular form <lb/>
of religion. We maintain the responsibility, we <lb/>
gladly assume the responsibility for teaching <lb/>
secular learning. As we have thus left to the <lb/>
parents the responsibility for choosing what <lb/>
religion their children are to learn surely we <lb/>
ought, as far as we can consistently with the <lb/>
inevitable limitations which the practical neces<lb break="no"/>sity of the case put upon us, make our system <lb/>
as elastic as we can in order to meet their <lb/>
wishes. <lb/>

            <p> And he goes on to explain exactly the <lb/>
position they take in England in regard to <lb/>
this difficult matter and how they have <lb/>
solved it. I have read many of the speeches <lb/>
of English statesmen upon this Education <lb/>
Bill, a Bill which has afforded ground for <lb/>
so much discussion in England. I venture <lb/>
to say that there is not a word in those <lb/>
speeches that could not be uttered from the <lb/>
pulpit of any Catholic Church in my prov<lb break="no"/>ince and to every sentence of which every <lb/>
member of the congregation would not be <lb/>
prepared to say, 'Amen.' Which
shows <lb/>
how far they go in regard to religious liberty <lb/>
in educational matters on the other side <lb/>
oi the water. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> And now, Mr. Speaker, I feel that I have <lb/>
sufficiently made known my opinions in <lb/>
regard to this matter. I wish before resum<lb break="no"/>ing
my seat, to make a very brief allusion <lb/>
     to the character of the discussion of
this <lb/>
matter in the public press. We have heard <lb/>
a great deal about freedom of the North<lb break="no"/>west and about common schools ; we have <lb/>
seen in some papers a clear indication that, <lb/>
were opportunity offered, there
exists a <lb/>
great desire to deprive this minority, once <lb/>
for all
of even a shred of the rights which <lb/>
they
preserve at the present moment in the <lb/>

 Northwest Territories. The discussion has
<lb/>
gone even farther, and it has been time and <lb/>
again written and said that those in this <lb/>
House who defend the rights of the min<lb break="no"/>ority are under clerical influence, are acting <lb/>
under the dictation of the hierarchy, what<lb break="no"/>ever that may mean. What is the meaning <lb/>
of these insinuations ? If they were utter<lb break="no"/>ed once or twice. if they appeared, so to <lb/>
speak, by accident, one would be prepared to <lb/>
treat them with the tolerance
which must <lb/>
necessarily be the quality of a public man <lb/>
if he wishes to live. But it has been so <lb/>
often stated that those who in this House <lb/>
adopt the view which I adopt are under <lb/>
the domination of the clergy, that I wish at <lb/>
any rate for my part, to enter my protest <lb/>
against that insinuation. There is no foun<lb break="no"/>dation for that accusation, and those who <lb/>
make it know not of what they speak. I <lb/>
say, I come to this House to fulfil my <lb/>
duty to my country without any control over <lb/>
me of priest or bishop or anybody else. That <lb/>
control I have never admitted, and that <lb/>
control never existed. As a matter of fact, <lb/>
I venture to say, the clergy in my province <lb/>
"do not exercise any control upon
the de<lb break="no"/>cision of public questions and the votes <lb/>
which we give in this House. That control <lb/>
does not exist ; it is a figment of the mind. <lb/>
And, when men take the trouble to write <lb/>
in newspapers—not to speak in the irrita<lb break="no"/>tion of the moment, but to write deliberately <lb/>
—that those who are in my position in <lb/>
this House are under outside control, are, <lb/>
so to speak, led by extraneous influences, <lb/>
they are casting upon us a libel which we <lb/>
do not deserve. I venture to say there is <lb/>
not a voter in the Dominion of Canada who <lb/>
would be more free from clerical influence <lb/>
than the average voter of the province of <lb/>
Quebec. Priests exercise no influence in <lb/>
these matters. They refrain from action in <lb/>
them. And they could not interfere with the <lb/>
exercise of the franchise. Take the case <lb/>
of my own county; I verily believe that <lb/>
if the parish priests of my county—and <lb/>
they are respectable men—were to unite to <lb/>
secure my election, I would lose my deposit. <lb/>
They do not interfere in elections; they <lb/>
scarcely vote. I am prepared to admit <lb/>
that there are isolated cases where a clergy<lb break="no"/>man, not of my own denomination only, but <lb/>
of other denominations as well, has inter<lb break="no"/>fered. What has been the consequence in <lb/>
Quebec Where these isolated cases have oc<lb break="no"/>curred ? They have led to lawsuits and to <lb/>
the final departure of the parish priest from <lb/>
the charge of the parish—that has been the <lb/>
history of such cases. As a matter of <lb/>
fact I repeat there is no man who would <lb/>
resent more promptly (and I could give <lb/>
numberless examples of it) any interfer<lb break="no"/>ence by the priest with the exercise of the <lb/>
franchise than would the average voter of <lb/>
the province of Quebec. And, as a public <lb/>
man, I believe that everybody is in the same <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3090</fw>
         
 position of independence that I am in my<lb break="no"/>self. I would like to see anybody be he <lb/>
priest or bishop, interfere with me in the <lb/>
exercise of my functions in this House. I <lb/>
thought it necessary to make this declara<lb break="no"/>tion, because, these things being so often <lb/>
repeated it becomes essential that they <lb/>
should be denied. As to the boring under<lb break="no"/>ground of the black-robed men who are all <lb/>
the time acting by hidden, obscure, mys<lb break="no"/>terious conspiracies upon members of parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, upon the electors in general—all this <lb/>
is nothing but a chimera. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. Speaker, I have finished. I do not <lb/>
wish to go one step farther, but you will <lb/>
allow me in closing to quote the last sen<lb break="no"/>tence of Mr. Balfour's speech upon the Edu<lb break="no"/>cation Bill : <lb/>
