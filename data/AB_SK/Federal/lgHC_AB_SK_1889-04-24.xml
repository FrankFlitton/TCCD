            <p>
     On the order for second reading of Bill (No 136) to con<lb break="no"/>solidate and amend the Act respecting the North-West 
     <lb/>
     Territories, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DEWD1">Mr. DEWDNEY</persName>. When I introduced this Bill for the 
     <lb/>
     special purpose of consolidating the three Acts now in ex<lb break="no"/>istence, my principal reason was that last Session the 
     <lb/>
     Legislative Assembly consolidated the North-West Ordin<lb break="no"/>ances, and I thought it would be very convenient to have 
     <lb/>
     the North-West Territories Act also consolidated. How<lb break="no"/>ever, some hon. gentlemen opposite thought it was too late 
     <lb/>
     in the Session to put through this Bill; but I thought, sub<lb break="no"/>sequently, that if they would agree to raise no question on 
     <lb/>
     the clauses not amended, we might possibly be able to put 
     <lb/>
     through the amendment. Since that, several hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men have informed me, that probably there would be con<lb break="no"/>siderable discussion on some of the old clauses of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     which I do not propose to amend, and, as the amendments 
     <lb/>
     I did propose are not of a serious character, and several hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen on both sides have expressed a wish that, if pos<lb break="no"/>sible, I might allow the measure to remain over for another 
     <lb/>
     Session, I beg to move that the order be discharged. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Motion agreed to, order discharged, and Bill withdrawn. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
