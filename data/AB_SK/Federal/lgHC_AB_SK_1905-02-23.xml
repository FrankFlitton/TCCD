     last form is seldom adopted. Most of these 
     <lb/>
     questions in fact can only be answered by 
     <lb/>
     information sought in the different depart<lb break="no"/>ments, sometimes far from Ottawa. That 
     <lb/>
     information is obtained from officials of the 
     <lb/>
     government at some remote places. It 
     <lb/>
     seems to me that a question put in this 
     <lb/>
     form is pertinent and should have been an<lb break="no"/>swered on the principle that this commis<lb break="no"/>sion is really a servant of the government. 
     <lb/>
     The practical object of my question is to 
     <lb/>
     know in what form, according to the rules, 
     <lb/>
     questions must be put. If they are put in 
     <lb/>
     the form suggested to me by the govern<lb break="no"/>ment, will questions be answered or is the 
     <lb/>
     Transcontinental Railway Commission a 
     <lb/>
     body independent of this House ?

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. The answer to <lb/> my hon. friend (Mr.
                  Monk) is to be found <lb/> in a motion of which my hon. friend has <lb/> himself
                  given notice, asking all information <lb/> with regard to these surveys. When the
                  <lb/> motion is reached, I have no doubt it will be <lb/> carried, but it will
                  have to be amended, be<lb break="no"/>cause the information has to be obtained
                  <lb/> from the Transcontinental Railway Com<lb break="no"/>mission, and not from
                  the government. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:MONK1">Mr. MONK</persName>. Perhaps my right hon. friend <lb/> will allow me to
                  say that that is not the <lb/> information which I sought by my question. <lb/>
                  The information sought by the question I <lb/> put was simply in relation to the
                  fact. In <lb/> the motion I asked for a copy of the report, <lb/> detailed
                  accounts of expenses and the names <lb/> of the parties employed. The question I
                  put <lb/> had reference to a department of the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and I
                  think should have been <lb/> answered in the form in which it was put. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. If my hon. <lb/> friend wants the
                  information, he will have to <lb/> make a motion. We have not the informa<lb break="no"/>tion in our hands, but shall have to obtain <lb/> it from the
                  commission itself. <lb/>
