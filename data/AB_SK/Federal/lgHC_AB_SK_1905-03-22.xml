            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Rt. Hon. Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName> (Prime <lb/> Minister) moved
                  second reading of Bill (No. <lb/> 69) to establish the government of the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Alberta. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>(Mr. Speaker having
put the motion, both <lb/>
Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mr. R. L. Borden <lb/>
rose at the same time.) <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. If my hon <lb/> friend wanted simply to
                  put a question, I <lb/> would certainly give way to him, but if it is <lb/> his
                  intention to address the chair on this <lb/> measure, perhaps he will allow me the
                     privi<lb break="no"/>ledge of a few remarks before he does so. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I took it for granted <lb/> from the right
                  hon. gentleman inclining his <lb/> head, that he meant he was not going to <lb/>
                  speak and that I was to go on. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I am glad that <lb/> this debate is
                  starting in such an auspicious <lb/> manner and that both sides are apparently
                  <lb/> in very good humor and in a very good <lb/> frame of mind for the
                  discussion. When <lb/> some time ago I presented this Bill to the <lb/> House, I
                  stated that there were certain ques<lb break="no"/>tions connected with it which
                  were of para<lb break="no"/>mount importance and which in fact were <lb/> the
                  essence of the whole measure. The first <lb/> was the number of provinces to be
                  created ; <lb/> the second was the ownership of the land; <lb/> the third was the
                  financial terms to be <lb/> granted; and the last was the education <lb/> system.
                  My hon. friend the leader of the <lb/> opposition (Mr. Borden) rose immediately
                  <lb/> after me, but confined his remarks for the <lb/> moment to two of those
                  questions only-<lb/> the ownership of the lands and the school <lb/> question.
                  With regard to the ownership <lb/> of the land, my hon. friend re-asserted the
                  <lb/> position he had often maintained on the floor <lb/> of this House as
                  elsewhere, namely, that <lb/> the land should go to the provinces to be <lb/>
                  owned and managed by them. On the school <lb/> question my hon. friend was
                  reserved. He <lb/> did not announce any policy, but very wisely <lb/> said that,
                  in his judgment, the subject was <lb/> one which ought to be approached with calm
                  <lb/> and moderation. The press which follows <lb/> and supports my hon. friend
                  took, notwith<lb break="no"/>standing this advice of his, a very different <lb/>
                  attitude. On the land question it said very <lb/> little, if it said anything at
                  all, but upon <lb/> the school question it offered a very violent <lb/>
                  opposition. Perhaps I may not be out of <lb/>
                  <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2916</fw> the way in saying that the press which sup<lb break="no"/>ports my hon.
                  friend has spared no effort <lb/> to inflame the public mind upon an ever <lb/>
                  delicate subject. <lb/>
               </p>



            <p>In the course of the
years I have been in <lb/>
this House, many have been the occasions in <lb/>
which parliament has had to face and to solve <lb/>
questions, simple enough in themselves, but <lb/>
complicated and rendered difficult by sudden <lb/>
outbursts of passion. And here again I may <lb/>
repeat what I had the opportunity of saying <lb/>
some few days ago, that in using this word <lb/>
'passion.' I do not want to convey any offen<lb break="no"/>sive sense. I recognize, we all recognize, <lb/>
that passions are very often the outgrowth <lb/>
of noble sentiment; but let this sentiment <lb/>
be ever so meritorious, if it goes beyond a <lb/>
certain line, it may become blind, unthink<lb break="no"/>ing, unreasoning passion. In 1875 on the <lb/>
New Brunswick school question, in 1889 on <lb/>
the Jesuit Estates questions, in 1896 on the <lb/>
Manitoba school question, several parts of <lb/>
the country—now one part, now another-<lb/>
were roused to a high pitch of excitement.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Since my conduct on
the present occasion <lb/>
has been assailed, perhaps I may be pardon<lb break="no"/>ed if I refer for one moment to myself, and <lb/>
say that upon every one of these questions, <lb/>
I have endeavoured, so far as I know—and
<lb/>
successfully I think—to act on the very prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of the constitution under which we <lb/>
live. In 1875, being then a young man, <lb/>
I supported the government of Mr. Mac<lb break="no"/>kenzie which refused to interfere with <lb/>
certain legislation passed by the legislature <lb/>
of the provinces of Quebec of which the <lb/>
Roman Catholic minority complained. That <lb/>
minority complained that this legislation <lb/>
was an invasion of their rights and forced <lb/>
an intolerable burden upon them. But, as <lb/>
it was established that at the time of con<lb break="no"/>federation New Brunswick had no system <lb/>
of separate schools, it followed as a con<lb break="no"/>sequence that this parliament had no juris<lb break="no"/>diction in the matter, and the government <lb/>
of Mr. Mackenzie, very properly, I think, <lb/>
refused to interfere and disallow that Act <lb/>
it was asked to disallow. In 1889, having <lb/>
become leader of the party to which I be<lb break="no"/>long, I supported the government of Sir <lb/>
John Macdonald when they refused to accede <lb/>
to the request of a section of our fellow <lb/>
countrymen to disallow the Act of the <lb/>
legislature of the province of Quebec to <lb/>
settle what was known as the Jesuit Estates <lb/>
question. In 1896, I opposed the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of Sir Mackenzie Bowell when they <lb/>
endeavoured to force upon the province of <lb/>
Manitoba a
system of schools which, accord<lb break="no"/>ing to high judicial authority, the province <lb/>
of Manitoba had a right to reject and which <lb/>
it had rejected by action within the scope <lb/>
of its legitimate authority. And in this year, <lb/>
1905, when two
provinces are to be brought <lb/>
into the Dominion, in which provinces there <lb/>
is a system of separate schools such as <lb/>
we have in the province of Quebec and<lb/>Ontario, I stand
again, as I believe, upon<lb/>the rock of the
constitution of Canada when <lb/>
       

            <pb n="2917" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-22_Page_2917.jpg"/>

 I say that this
parliament should, according <lb/>
to that constitution, give to the minority <lb/>
in the new provinces the same rights and <lb/>
privileges that are given to the minorities <lb/>
in the new provinces of Quebec and Ontario. <lb/>
Sir, what seems to me this very proper <lb/>
legislation is opposed throughout the length <lb/>
and breadth of our country—no, I will not <lb/>
say that,—but in certain portions of our <lb/>
country—and in the name, I might almost <lb/>
say the sacred name, of provincial rights. <lb/>
But it is remarkable that the men who at <lb/>
this day, are insisting the most upon what <lb/>
they call provincial rights have taken no <lb/>
heed of the fact that, in the very letter of <lb/>
the constitution on which they rely there is <lb/>
an abbreviation of provincial rights wher<lb break="no"/>ever there exists in any province a system <lb/>
of separate schools. Provincial rights are <lb/>
the basis of our constitution. All parties now <lb/>
admit these rights and recognize them, what<lb break="no"/>ever may have been their position in the <lb/>
past. But, Sir, it is an old saying that <lb/>
there is no rule without its exception ; <lb/>
and, in the very letter of the constitution, <lb/>
an exception has been made concerning pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights wherever there is a system <lb/>
of separate schools in any province. Now <lb/>
here is the law upon this point. The words <lb/>
which I use now may grate upon the feel<lb break="no"/>ings of some, may seem harsh to the ears <lb/>
of others, may seem harsh to my own ears, <lb/>
but, Sir, here is the law. Section 93 of the <lb/>
constitution says: <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> In and for each
province the legislature <lb/>

            <p>If the law stopped
there, if there were <lb/>
no other words to qualify this general pro<lb break="no"/>vision, such legislation as is now before the <lb/>
House would never have been introduced. <lb/>
But the law does not stop there; there <lb/>
are words which qualify the general pro<lb break="no"/>position : <lb/>

            <p>Here you have the
fact proclaimed, the <lb/>
principle laid down, that wherever there is, <lb/>
in any province, a system of separate schools, <lb/>
the provincial rights are abbreviated and <lb/>
the legislature can do nothing to preju<lb break="no"/>dicially affect the rights of the minority <lb/>
who have the benefit of this clause. But, <lb/>
though these facts are plain, still, at <lb/>
the present moment, they seem to be <lb/>
ignored ; and, even on the floor of this <lb/>
House the attempt is sometimes made to <lb/>
cast upon myself, who have always held <lb/>
these views, the imputation that at one <lb/>
time or other, I held different
views. The <lb/>

stopped there. Had he <lb/>
read a little further, he would have found <lb/>
that I qualified the statement I made by <lb/>
saying that, in the matter of education, <lb/>
provincial rights were not supreme, but <lb/>
they are abbreviated by the very letter of <lb/>
the constitution. I continued as follows: <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> I agree with the
Prime Minister in this <lb/>
view, that it would have been wiser for the <lb/>
fathers of confederation to have adopted the <lb/>
American principle of local independence. But <lb/>
such, after all, is not the principle which has <lb/>
been adopted. On the contrary, the principle <lb/>
of our constitution is this : that while in all <lb/>
other matters the powers of the local legis<lb break="no"/>lature are almost independent, in the matter <lb/>
of education, a supervisory power has been <lb/>
given to this government, in so far as sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools are concerned. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>So that, in 1893 I
held the views I now <lb/>
hold, and I am acting exactly in accordance <lb/>
with the opinions I proclaimed twelve years <lb/>
ago and which so far as I remember, I have <lb/>
always held. This being well established, <lb/>
this being I believe, impossible of denial-<lb/>
that the rights of a province are abbreviated <lb/>
whenever there is a system of separate <lb/>
schools—yet we are told that this cannot be <lb/>
adopted because the provinces referred to in <lb/>
this legislation are not now provinces, but <lb/>
are simply territories. If I understand that <lb/>
argument correctly it means that if the <lb/>
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan al<lb break="no"/>ready existed and were to come to—day <lb/>
and ask to enter confederation, they would <lb/>
come with their system of schools, and that <lb/>
system would apply mechanically and par<lb break="no"/>liament would be forced to give it to them; <lb/>
but as they come as territories, they are <lb/>
not to have the same privileges as they <lb/>
would have had. coming as provinces. Now, <lb/>
in the name of common sense, what does <lb/>
it matter, so far as law and order is con<lb break="no"/>cerned, whether these territories are now ter<lb break="no"/>ritories or are now provinces? If under the <lb/>

law we gave them in 1875 they established
<lb/>
a system of schools, is not that system of <lb/>
schools as dear to them as if they had been <lb/>
erected into provinces ?  If they have ac<lb break="no"/>quired rights thereby, are not those rights <lb/>
as sacred as if they had been erected into <lb/>
provinces ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir, it seems to me that this argu<lb break="no"/>ment cannot bear examination. But if we <lb/>
are to take some of the newspaper articles <lb/>
and some of the speeches I have read, what <lb/>
is the supreme reason and argument that <lb/>
is advanced why this principle of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution should not apply to the Territories? <lb/>
It is because parliament is omnipotent, it <lb/>
is because parliament is not bound to res<lb break="no"/>pect the acts of a former parliament, it is <lb/>
because the parliament that was elected in <lb/>
November, 1904, is not to be
bound by the <lb/>
parliament which sat in this House in 1875. <lb/>
Well, Sir, if that view is to be taken, if we <lb/>
are to say that parliament is supreme, I <lb/>
have nothing more to say. Parliament is <lb/>
supreme indeed, parliament is supreme, and <lb/>
may even go to the length of disobeying <lb/>
the moral laws which bind all governments <lb/>
and all men. It is open to any man to <lb/>
break his word, it is open to any man to <lb/>
violate his engagement, it is open to any <lb/>
man to trample under foot his plighted <lb/>
troth. Now if it is open to any man to <lb/>
do that, it is also open to an assembly of men; <lb/>
and if it be the view that parliament is not <lb/>
bound by the acts of any preceding parlia<lb break="no"/>ment, that parliament may violate its <lb/>
plighted troth, then we have a double op<lb break="no"/>portunity on this occasion to signalize our<lb break="no"/>selves, because not only can we remove <lb/>
from the minority the system of separate <lb/>
schools which they have had for many <lb/>
years, but we can correct another invasion <lb/>
of provincial rights which is far more reach<lb break="no"/>ing than the violation of provincial rights <lb/>
in the matter of education.  If it be true <lb/>
that in 1875, parliament introduced separate <lb/>
schools into the Northwest Territories and <lb/>
gave to the minority the privilege of those <lb/>
schools, it is equally true that in the
year <lb/>
1881 this parliament for ever abbreviated the <lb/>
powers of those new provinces in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter of taxation ; it is equally true that in <lb/>
1891 this parliament decreed by an Act
<lb/>
passed here, passed against the protest of <lb/>
the minority in that parliament, decreeing <lb/>
for all time to come, not for one year only, <lb/>
or ten years, or one generation, but for all <lb/>
time to come, that the Canadian Pacific <lb/>
Railway and all stations, station grounds, <lb/>
workshops, buildings, yards and other
pro<lb break="no"/>perty, rolling stock and appurtenances re<lb break="no"/>quired and used for the construction and <lb/>
working thereof, and the capital stock of <lb/>
the company, should for ever be free from <lb/>
the power of taxation by those provinces. <lb/>
It was decreed also that no municipal body <lb/>
created by the provinces could
levy tax<lb break="no"/>ation upon the Canadian Pacific Railway, <lb/>
its stock, its buildings, its workshops and its  <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2920</fw> 
           
 capital stock. Sir, is not that an
invasion <lb/>
of provincial rights far more reaching in <lb/>
its consequences than the invasion of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights which is complained of in the <lb/>
matter of education ? But does anybody in <lb/>
this House think of removing from the <lb/>
Canadian Pacific Railway the powers and <lb/>
immunities which have been granted to <lb/>
that company? Does anybody in this House <lb/>
think for a moment of giving to those new <lb/>
provinces the power to levy taxation upon <lb/>
the Canadian Pacific Railway? No,
we <lb/>
respect our engagements. Then I ask if <lb/>
we respect our engagements in the one case, <lb/>
why should we not respect our engagements <lb/>
in the other case? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, that is not all. I find no better
<lb/>
testimony in favour of the principle which <lb/>
is embodied in this Bill than the letter <lb/>
which was written to me some days ago <lb/>
by Mr. Haultain, Premier of the Northwest <lb/>
Territories ; I want no better testimony of <lb/>
the soundness of the position which we <lb/>
have taken than the ipsissima verba con<lb break="no"/>tained in Mr. Haultain's letter, and which I <lb/>
will read to the House. <lb/>

            <p>That is to say, as a matter of 'indefea<lb break="no"/>sible right' the provision of section 93 of <lb/>
the British North America Act becomes part <lb/>
of the constitution of the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories. Now, let me repeat, what is the <lb/>
disposition of section 93 of the British North <lb/>
America Act : <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>In and for each province the legislature

            <p>Therefore, if I understand the English <lb/>

Haultain's own admission, that in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter of education the rights and privileges <lb/>
of the minority are secured against any <lb/>
prejudicial legislation which might be pass<lb break="no"/>ed. Now, Sir, there is this difference
be<lb break="no"/>tween Mr. Haultain and myself with regard <lb/>
to this point. Mr. Haultain argues that <lb/>
this section 93 applies automatically, that <lb/>
this House has nothing to do but simply to <lb/>
admit the province and immediately it be<lb break="no"/>comes subject to section 93 ; whereas the <lb/>

            <p>Upon this point I might go further. On <lb/>
a previous occasion I spoke at some length <lb/>
on this point, and I will not go over the <lb/>
same ground again. However, it may not <lb/>
be inopportune on this occasion to inquire <lb/>
what is the history of clause 93 in the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish North America Act, how did it become <lb/>
a part of the British North America Act ? <lb/>
Sir, we live in an age of such intense ex<lb break="no"/>citement, we are moving with such rapidity, <lb/>
our lives are so much engaged in business <lb/>
occupations, that history is very soon for<lb break="no"/>gotten, and what is the event of to-day
is <lb/>
forgotten history to-morrow. It may not <lb/>
therefore be inopportune to look into the <lb/>
causes which led to the introduction of this <lb/>
section of 93 into the British North America <lb/>
Act. It was introduced at the suggestion <lb/>
of Mr. Galt, in the interest of the Protestant <lb/>
minority of the province of Quebec, at a <lb/>
time when he was champion and representa<lb break="no"/>tive of that minority in the old parliament <lb/>
of Canada. I have quoted on a former <lb/>
occasion, and I may be permitted to quote <lb/>
again, the language of the Quebec resolu<lb break="no"/>tions which formed the embryo of section <lb/>
93 of the British North America Act. We <lb/>
find that section 43 of the Quebec resolu<lb break="no"/>tions, concludes as follows : <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Education, saving the rights and
privileges <lb/>
which the Protestant or Catholic minorities in <lb/>
both Canadas may possess as to their deno<lb break="no"/>minational schools at the time when the <lb/>
union goes into operation. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>That was section 43 which guaranteed <lb/>
separate schools both in Ontario and Que<lb break="no"/>bec, but did not go further. Now, Sir, it is <lb/>
a matter of history that the Protestant min<lb break="no"/>ority in Quebec at that time was not alto<lb break="no"/>gether satisfied with their condition under <lb/>
the system of separate schools such as it <lb/>
was. They wanted the system extended <lb/>
and improved, and they wanted this to be <lb/>
done before confederation, so that under the <lb/>
new constitution the rights and privileges <lb/>
secured to the Protestant minority could <lb/>
not be interfered with by the new legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Quebec. Mr. Galt, who at that time <lb/>
as I said was the champion of the Protes<lb break="no"/>tant minority in the province of Quebec, <lb/>
and was also a member of the government <lb/>
of that day, spoke upon that subject at a <lb/>
meeting held in the town of Sherbrooke <lb/>
which he represented in parliament.
In <lb/>
the month of October, 1864, just a few <lb/>
months after the Quebec resolutions had <lb/>
been adopted by the conference, Mr. Galt <lb/>
used the following language:<lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
<p>He would now endeavour to speak somewhat <lb/>
fully as to one of the most important questions, <lb/>
perhaps the most important that could be con<lb break="no"/>fined to the legislature, the question of edu<lb break="no"/>cation. This was a question in which, in <lb/>
Lower Canada, they must all feel the greatest <lb/>
interest, and in respect to which more mis<lb break="no"/>apprehension might be supposed to exist in <lb/>
the minds, at any rate of the Protestant popu<lb break="no"/>lation, than in regard to anything else con<lb break="no"/>nected with the whole scheme of confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. </p>
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2922</fw>
        
            <p>It must be clear that a measure would not
be <lb/>
favourably entertained by the majority of Lower <lb/>
Canada which would place the education of their <lb/>
children and the provision for their schools, <lb/>
wholly in the hands of a majority of a different <lb/>
faith. It was clear that in confiding the general <lb/>
subject to the local legislatures it was abso<lb break="no"/>lutely necessary it should be accompanied with <lb/>
such restrictions as would prevent injustice in <lb/>
any respect from being done to the minority. </p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Now, this applied to Lower Canada, but it
<lb/>
also applied, and with equal force, to Upper <lb/>
Canada and the other provinces ; for in Lower <lb/>
Canada there was a Protestant minority, and <lb/>
in the other provinces a Roman Catholic min<lb break="no"/>ority. The same privileges belong to the one <lb/>
of right here, as belonged to the other of right <lb/>
elsewhere. There could be no greater injustice <lb/>

to a population than to compel them to have <lb/>
their children educated in a manner contrary <lb/>
to their own religious belief. </p>
            <p><lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It had been stipulated that the question
was <lb/>
to be made subject to the rights and privileges <lb/>
which the minorities might have as to their <lb/>
separate and denominational schools. There <lb/>
had been grave difficulties surrounding the <lb/>
separate school question in Upper Canada, but <lb/>
they were all settled now, and with regard to <lb/>
the separate school system of Lower Canada, it <lb/>
was the determination of the government to <lb/>
bring down a measure for the amendment of the <lb/>
school laws before the confederation was al<lb break="no"/>lowed to go into force. He made this state<lb break="no"/>ment, because as the clause was worded in the <lb/>
printed resolution, it would appear that the <lb/>
school law, as it at present existed, was
to be <lb/>
continued. <lb/>
            </p>
</quote>





            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Galt undertook <lb/>
that the school law would be amended in <lb/>
the following session. In the following ses<lb break="no"/>sion, that was the session of 1865, the <lb/>
resolutions of the Quebec conference <lb/>
were discussed in the legislature of <lb/>
Canada but no school Bill was introduced <lb/>
to amend the law of Lower Canada. Com<lb break="no"/>plaint was made to the House by Mr. Hol<lb break="no"/>ton and others and a measure was promised <lb/>
the following year. In the following year, <lb/>
that was the year beforeconfederation, a <lb/>
school Bill was introduced giving to the <lb/>
Protestant minority much more power than <lb/>
they had then and giving to them the powers <lb/>
which they have now and which have been <lb/>
given them since by the legislature of the <lb/>
province of Quebec. Amongst the dispo<lb break="no"/>sitions of that measure were the following
: <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> The superior education will comprise the
uni<lb break="no"/>versities and the classical and industrial col<lb break="no"/>leges or seminaries, and the provincial aid <lb/>
thereto, as well as that for academies, shall be <lb/>
annually divided between the Roman Catholic <lb/>
and Protestant institutions in proportion to the <lb/>
respective Roman Catholic and Protestant popu<lb break="no"/>lation according to the then last census. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>Another section reads : <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> Whenever four of the Protestant members

            <p>But a strange thing happened in the
legis<lb break="no"/>lature of Canada. It was at the time when <lb/>
we had a representation from Lower Canada <lb/>
and a representation from Upper Canada. <lb/>
A similar Bill was introduced immediately <lb/>
for the province of Upper Canada. This was <lb/>
strongly resisted and so strongly was it re<lb break="no"/>sisted that the two Bills were withdrawn. <lb/>
Thereupon Mr. Galt resigned his position <lb/>
as a member of the government of the day <lb/>
because he had not been able to improve <lb/>
the situation of the minority to which he <lb/>
belonged by legislation before the Act of <lb/>
confederation came into operation. Then <lb/>
what took place ? Of course, there was a <lb/>
great deal of commotion at that time and <lb/>
the Protestant minority of Quebec felt <lb/>
disinclined to enter confederation unless <lb/>
their rights were secured as they thought <lb/>
they ought to be secured. Mr. Galt was <lb/>
appointed to go to England with Sir John <lb/>
Macdonald, Sir Geo. Cartier and others in <lb/>
order to frame the Act which was to be the <lb/>
Act of Confederation. At that
time the <lb/>
  'Montreal Gazette' was the principal as to<lb break="no"/>day it is the most important organ of the <lb/>
Conservative party. It spoke for Mr. Galt <lb/>
and on the 24th October, 1866,
the 'Mon<lb break="no"/>treal Gazette' contained the following <lb/>
article : <lb/>

            <p>We have much pleasure in announcing that <lb/>

very fully considered. The ministry were, we <lb/>

appointed as a delegate to represent the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the British population, but that gen<lb break="no"/>tleman felt that he could not accept unless he <lb/>
was assured as to the views of the government <lb/>
on the points that so seriously concern his <lb/>
countrymen and co-religionists, and which so <lb/>
deeply roused their feelings. We are informed <lb/>

their determination to give practical effect to the <lb/>
pledges given in parliament, and the gentleman <lb/>

           even in his own handwriting. Therefore it
<lb/>
is to him that we have section 93 in its <lb/>
present form. As to that let me call the <lb/>
attention of the House to another extract <lb/>
from the 'Montreal Gazette' of March 2nd, <lb/>
1867. Either that day or the day before <lb/>
the 'Montreal Gazette' had published the <lb/>
whole text of the Bill which afterwards <lb/>
bcame the Confederation Act and it accom<lb break="no"/>panied this with the following comment: <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>Few questions have excited a more lively
in<lb break="no"/>terest in this country than the education of <lb/>
children in public schools, or, perhaps, it would <lb/>
be more accurate to say, the appropriation of <lb/>
taxation for that purpose. We need not repeat <lb/>
the particulars of the agitation on the subject, <lb/>
which commenced with the promulgation of the <lb/>
resolutions of the conference of Quebec, and re<lb break="no"/>sulted in Mr. Galt resigning his seat in the <lb/>
cabinet. The short of the story is, all this led <lb/>
to an agreement on the part of the Canadian <lb/>
government to advise Her Majesty's ministers <lb/>
to insert in the Union Bill the provisions with <lb/>
which the public are, undoubtedly, already <lb/>
aware. That was the agreement to which we <lb/>
referred, in October last, as having been satis<lb break="no"/>factory to Mr. Galt, and on the strength of <lb/>
which he consented to become a delegate to <lb/>
London. The public may find in these provi<lb break="no"/>sions in the Bill the proof of the statement <lb/>
made by us, which some of our contemporaries, <lb/>
without any evidence, undertook to call in ques<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Before the question of confederation was <lb/>
mooted, the constant cry on the part of a por<lb break="no"/>tion of Lower Canada Protestant minority, was: <lb/>
give us the same privileges as those enjoyed <lb/>
by the Upper Canada minority. Well, the Bill <lb/>
as it stands, in terms, provides that the min<lb break="no"/>ority in Lower Canada shall have precisely the <lb/>
same privileges as the minority in Upper Can<lb break="no"/>ada. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And further, that the minorities in all
the <lb/>
provinces shall have the right of appeal to the <lb/>
general parliament. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill, in this form, undoubtedly, in
our <lb/>
opinion, will become the fundamental law of the <lb/>
country, forming a part of its political consti<lb break="no"/>tution ; and that, as such, it must be accepted. <lb/>
It affords essential guarantees as well in im<lb break="no"/>mediate practice as in ultimate resort. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Well Sir, Mr. Galt was too great a man <lb/>
not to stipulate for other minorities that <lb/>
which he was stipulating for the minority <lb/>
to which he belonged. Mr. Galt was not <lb/>
satisfied to have these guarantees under the <lb/>
constitution simply for the minority of <lb/>
Quebec, but he put them in the terms which <lb/>
I read a monment ago so that they could <lb/>
apply to any minority in any province under <lb/>
any condition under which a system of <lb/>
separate schools exist. It is in obedience to <lb/>
that order of the constitution that we have <lb/>
inserted the clause which I read a moment  <lb/>
ago. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, a word as to the changes we
have <lb/>
made in that clause. I stated the other day <lb/>
that we proposed to make a change and we <lb/>
have given notice of an amendment which <lb/>
we intend to move to clause 16. What is <lb/>
the reason of this change ? It is a fair ques<lb break="no"/>tion to ask and a question to be answered. <lb/>

            <p>Sir, we have taken the ground on more <lb/>
than one occasion, we again take this <lb/>
ground and it is the ground upon which <lb/>
we stand in dealing with the present case, <lb/>
that wherever a system of separate schools <lb/>
exists that system comes into force and <lb/>
is constitutionally entitled to the guaran<lb break="no"/>tees which are embodied in section 93 of <lb/>
the British North America Act. Be that <lb/>
system much, be it little, whatever
it is, <lb/>
it is entitled to those guarantees. That is the <lb/>
position we take, and when we introduced <lb/>
section 16, as it is in the Bill, we had no <lb/>
other intention than to give to the minority <lb/>
the rights and privileges to which they are <lb/>
entitled under the law which they have to<lb break="no"/>day. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, it has been objected to us that
<lb/>
the language used in section 16 was too <lb/>
broad, too vague, and that if it were adopt<lb break="no"/>ed, it would create trouble and confusion <lb/>
instead of certainty as to the rights of the <lb/>
minority. By the first paragraph of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16 as it stands in the Bill, the Act <lb/>
of 1875 is reproduced in toto. But Sir, an <lb/>
event occurred some 14 or 15 years ago <lb/>
which has to some extent limited that Act. <lb/>
Some 14 years ago the legislature of the <lb/>
Territories passed a law which in the opin<lb break="no"/>ion of the minority abridged the rights con<lb break="no"/>ferred on them by the Act of 1875. They <lb/>
complained to the federal government <lb/>
at Ottawa. They made representa<lb break="no"/>tions to the government of that day <lb/>
and asked the disallowance of that <lb/>
law as an infringement upon their <lb/>
privileges as secured to them by the law <lb/>
of 1875. Sir John Thompson, who was then <lb/>
Minister of Justice, examined the question <lb/>
and refused to disallow the Act. He ad<lb break="no"/>mitted rather, that the Act was an infringe<lb break="no"/>ment on the privileges conveyed to the min<lb break="no"/>ority, but he stated that as this was a con<lb break="no"/>sequence, only following a similar Act, or <lb/>
rather continuing a similar Act passed some <lb/>
three or four years before, as to which no <lb/>
complaint had been made, and which was <lb/>
therefore in force, he would not advise <lb/>
disallowance and he allowed the Act to go <lb/>
into force. Under such circumstances the <lb/>
law of the Territories has been in force now <lb/>
for 13 or 14 years. Section 16 thus re<lb break="no"/>stricted is now the law of the country <lb/>
which has been in force for 13 or 14 years <lb/>
and which has given general satisfaction. <lb/>
Under such circumstances it we were to re<lb break="no"/>enact section 93 of the Act, it was possible <lb/>
that we would create confusion and that <lb/>
there would be lawsuits to determine the <lb/>
exact condition of the law. We there<lb break="no"/>fore thought it was preferable to have <lb/>
the law made absolutely certain and <lb/>
in order to do that we have incor<lb break="no"/>porated the ordinances under which <lb/>
the law as it is to-day has been established. <lb/>
It may be disappointing to some, but we be<lb break="no"/>lieve that on the whole it is preferable to <lb/>
have a clear understanding on this subject <lb/>
so that the minority shall have the pri<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw type="num">2926</fw>vilege of exercising control over their <lb/>
schools as they have to-day, and so that <lb/>
the law shall be absolutely clear and pro<lb break="no"/>nounced as to what is intended by the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada if it passes this legisla<lb break="no"/>tion. That is the reason why we have <lb/>
done this. The law of the Territories on <lb/>
this question is established in three ordin<lb break="no"/>ances, chapter 29 of 1901, chapter 30 of 1901, <lb/>
and chapter 31 of 1901. Chapter 29 organ<lb break="no"/>ized a system of schools and this organiza<lb break="no"/>tion retained to the minority
the privileges <lb/>
which they have of separate schools. Chap<lb break="no"/>ter 30 regulates the power of assessments <lb/>
over the municipalities for contributions <lb/>
to education and chapter 31 regulates the <lb/>
aid and contributions to be made to the <lb/>
different schools conforming to the law.
<lb/>
We have introduced into the amendment <lb/>
chapter 29 and chapter 30 ; we have not in<lb break="no"/>troduced chapter 31 which regulates the <lb/>
aid and grants to be given to schools be<lb break="no"/>cause we have thought it preferable simply <lb/>
to lay down the principle, putting no burd<lb break="no"/>en upon the Territories, not saying how <lb/>
they are to dispose of their money, not tel<lb break="no"/>ling them what they shall do but simply <lb/>
stating that when schools conform to the <lb/>
law, whether they are separate schools or <lb/>
public schools, all shall be treated equally <lb/>
and there shall be no discrimination be<lb break="no"/>tween them. That is the reason of the le<lb break="no"/>gislation I have introduced. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this occasion I have nothing more <lb/>
to say but in moving this Bill, as I now <lb/>
do, for the second reading, I want to im<lb break="no"/>press on the House once more that we are <lb/>
acting strictly in accordance with the prin<lb break="no"/>ciples involved in the constitution of Can<lb break="no"/>ada. I want to impress once more the fact <lb/>
that the constitution of Canada has been <lb/>
and is a compromise between different <lb/>
elements in order to produce a great result. <lb/>
It is a compromise in order to unite differ<lb break="no"/>ent heterogeneous elements. There are dif<lb break="no"/>ferences of powers, there are
exceptions, <lb/>
but all this diversity is intended to promote- <lb break="yes"/>
unity.  <lb/>
            </p>





            <p>Let me say one last word. We have done <lb/>
pretty well so far in the development of <lb/>
our national institutions, but we have not <lb/>
yet reached the maximum ; we have not <lb/>
yet reached the end. We may have a great <lb/>
deal still to do and I hold that we ought <lb/>
always to be ready for the task, and I am <lb/>
sure that it will not be too much to say that <lb/>
it will not injure any one, that it will not do <lb/>
any harm but on the contrary will do much <lb/>
good if, whenever we are called upon to <lb/>
apply the principles of the constitution, we <lb/>
apply them, not in any carping sense, but <lb/>
in a broad and generous spirit. <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> (Carleton, Ont). Mr. <lb/> Speaker, the

                  <lb/> usual eloquence upon the second reading of <lb/> this Bill. If I were

                   past, I might term him a scrapbook orator <lb/> to-day.
                  Whenever I have endeavoured to <lb/> gather up certain pearls of thought which
                  <lb/> he has distributed in days gone by and to <lb/> contrast them with the
                  utterances made in <lb/> the immediate present, the right hon gentle<lb break="no"/>man has been good enough to apply that <lb/> appellation to myself and I trust
                  that he <lb/> will not resent my returning it to him on <lb/> this occasion. The
                  right hon. gentleman <lb/> has told us that the measure which the <lb/> government
                  has introduced, and especially <lb/> the educational clauses contained in sec<lb break="no"/>tion 16 of the Bill, as well as the provisions <lb/> which have
                  been now substituted for that <lb/> section, make for unity. Well, Mr. Speaker,
                  <lb/> they may make for unity in the country if <lb/> the right hon. gentleman's
                  own words are <lb/> to be taken at their face value to-day, but <lb/> certainly
                  they have not made for unity in <lb/> the cabinet nor among the right hon.
                     gentle<lb break="no"/>man's followers. The Prime Minister has <lb/> been good
                  enough a few days ago to charge <lb/> me with having treated this question in
                  <lb/> this House lightly. I desire, in terms as <lb/> strong as the usage of this
                  parliament <lb/> will permit, to repudiate to the utmost <lb/> that assertion, and
                  to say that if any <lb/> man in this House has treated that <lb/> question lightly
                  it has been the right hon. <lb/> gentleman himself. When I brought this <lb/>
                  question up two years ago, not he, nor any <lb/> one of his colleagues in the
                  cabinet dared <lb/> to rise in his place and say one word about <lb/> it. They put
                  up the hon. member for Ed<lb break="no"/>monton (Mr. Oliver) who was then the
                     mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Alberta, to say on behalf of the <lb/> government
                  that they were not going into <lb/> any 'blind pool,' and when the right hon.
                  <lb/> gentleman tendered to this country and to <lb/> the members of the Northwest
                  the blindest <lb/> kind of pool in the letter which he wrote <lb/> in the heat of
                  a general election, then hon. <lb/> gentlemen on the other side were all too <lb/>
                  eager to accept it without one moment's <lb/> question. That was the first
                  occasion when <lb/> he treated this question lightly. The next <lb/> was when in
                  this House he asserted, cry<lb break="no"/>ing 'hear, hear' to the words of my
                  hon. <lb/> friend from Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) <lb/> who interpreted the
                  remarks of the Prime <lb/> Minister as meaning that provincial auto<lb break="no"/>nomy could not be granted to the Territo<lb break="no"/>ries of the Northwest
                  for many years to <lb/> come. And, in the next place, Mr. Speaker, <lb/> he
                  treated this question lightly when he <lb/> brought this Bill down to parliament,
                  telling <lb/> parliament as plainly as if he had said so in <lb/> express terms
                  that this measure embodied <lb/> the collective wisdom of the cabinet, when <lb/>
                  afterwards it transpired although the Bill <lb/> had not even been submitted to
                  the ex-<lb break="yes"/> Minister of the Interior or to the Minister of <lb/>
                  Finance, the most important members of the <lb/> government. And, in the next
                  place, Sir, <lb/> my right hon. friend treated this question <lb/> lightly when
                  more than once I asked him <lb/> across the floor of this House why it 'was <lb/>
                  that he, the leader of the House ventured <lb/>
                  <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2928</fw> to mislead it with regard to the attitude <lb/> of two of his ministers. I
                  asked him that <lb/> question not once or twice, but three <lb/> times, and the
                  only answer I ever <lb/> received from the right hon. gentleman <lb/> was evasion
                  and badinage. It does not <lb/> lie in his mouth to charge me with having <lb/>
                  treated this question lightly in view of the <lb/> fact that he has dealt with it
                  after the fash<lb break="no"/>ion I have described. Further than that, the <lb/>
                  right hon. gentleman approaches the consid<lb break="no"/>eration of this question
                  now without a min<lb break="no"/>ister in the Department of the Interior, al<lb break="no"/>though in the right hon. gentleman's cor<lb break="no"/>respondence
                  the absence of the Minister of <lb/> the Interior on former occasions has been
                  <lb/> put forward as a ground for delay. So much <lb/> for that. I will leave the
                  right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man himself to judge whether under these <lb/>
                  circumstances he or I can most justly be <lb/> charged with having treated this
                  question <lb/> lightly and not in the serious way in which <lb/> it should be
                  treated. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>I do not agree, Sir, with some remarks <lb/>
which the right hon. gentleman made in his <lb/>
speech on the 21st of February. He then <lb/>
said : <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> A great deal has been done; in fact more <lb/>
has been done than we have to do to-day. We <lb/>
have to take the last step, but it is easy <lb/>
and comparatively unimportant in view of and <lb/>
in comparison with what has already been <lb/>
accomplished. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>I do not know whether my right hon. <lb/>
friend is quite of the same opinion to-day <lb/>
with regard to the easy nature of the step, <lb/>
but I venture to say in all seriousness that <lb/>
the step which we are taking is the most im<lb break="no"/>portant and momentous step that has ever <lb/>
been taken by this parliament in regard to <lb/>
our northwestern country. We are doing <lb/>
to-day what this parliament cannot undo in <lb/>
the future, because the constitution which <lb/>
we now propose to give to the territories of <lb/>
the Northwest can only be altered by the <lb/>
imperial parliament. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I agree absolutely with the principle of <lb/>
this Bill so far as it is designed to give a <lb/>
provincial status to these territories. As <lb/>
leader of the Conservative party, I laid <lb/>
down that principle when in the northwest <lb/>
more than two years ago. I have stood <lb/>
for that principle in this House in the ses<lb break="no"/>sions of 1903 and 1904, and that
principle  I <lb/>
stand for today. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The mode in which the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has brought down this measure has led <lb/>
to the expression of strong differences of <lb/>
opinion throughout this country. The educa<lb break="no"/>tional clauses have been discussed almost <lb/>
exclusively in all parts of Canada. For the <lb/>
moment they overshadow other questions: <lb/>
they involve differences of race. When I <lb/>
addressed the House on the first read<lb break="no"/>ing of the Bill I said I did not de<lb break="no"/>sire to make this a political question. Per<lb break="no"/>haps the expression was not very happily <lb/>
chosen, because from whatever aspect con<lb break="no"/>sidered, it must in the highest sense of<lb break="no"/>

I have been referred to as a coward and en<lb break="no"/>treated to speak out. The proper time for <lb/>
me to speak is to-day upon the
second read<lb break="no"/>ing, and before I conclude I shall, I think, <lb/>
make my position absolutely clear. And I <lb/>
say, that in taking the position which I shall <lb/>
now take, I do not for one moment suggest <lb/>
that any hon. gentleman on this side of the <lb/>
House, following the dictates of his con<lb break="no"/>science and of his good judgment should <lb/>

<p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:FOST1">Mr. FOSTER</persName>. They do not seem to under<lb break="no"/>stand
                  that principle over there. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in
                  his opening remarks adverted to <lb/> five principal matters contained in the
                  Bill: <lb/> to the number of provinces, to the bound<lb break="no"/>aries of the
                  provinces, to the financial terms, <lb/> to the control of public lands and to the
                  <lb/> provisions respecting education. It seems <lb/> to me that so far as I
                  desire to make any <lb/> observations on the first three of these, I <lb/> can
                  better do that in committee. I will, <lb/> therefore, in the remarks which I
                  address <lb/> to the House to-day deal solely with the <lb/> questions which
                  concern the control of <lb/> public lands and the educational provisions <lb/> of
                  the Bill. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>So far as the control of the lands is
con<lb break="no"/>cerned, I adhere to the opinion I before ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in this House: that the people of the <lb/>
northwest when they are granted provincial <lb/>
rights are fully capable of dealing with these <lb/>
lands; that they are entitled to the control <lb/>
of these lands just as much as the people <lb/>
of the eastern provinces of Canada are en<lb break="no"/>titled to the control of their provincial do<lb break="no"/>main. I see no distinction. One organ of <lb/>
the government published in the city of Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, an organ in which my hon. friend <lb/>
the Minister of Agriculture is supposed to <lb/>
have a controlling interest, has given utter<lb break="no"/>ance to a delightful piece of information <lb/>
with regard to this matter. It declares that <lb/>
these lands should not be handed over to the <lb/>
control of the people of the northwest for <lb/>
fear of the danger which might be encoun<lb break="no"/>tered from greedy land grabbers. Well, I <lb/>
am inclined to think—looking at the history <lb/>
of the past and looking forward a little to <lb/>
what may be expected in the future—that <lb/>
we are not likely to suffer any greater dan<lb break="no"/>ger from land grabbers under the adminis<lb break="no"/>tration of the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories, than we have suffered in the past <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2930</fw>
          
and are likely to suffer under the
present <lb/>
administration. The right hon. gentleman <lb/>
argued that the control of these lands by <lb/>
the people of Alberta and Saskatchewan <lb/>
would probably interfere with the immigra<lb break="no"/>tion policy of the government; he thought <lb/>
there might be interference with free home<lb break="no"/>steads and with the present low price of <lb/>
government lands. But, Mr. Speaker, may <lb/>
I not suggest with a great deal of force to <lb/>
hon. gentlemen on both sides of the House, <lb/>
that the people of the Northwest are more <lb/>
interested in attracting immigration to these <lb/>
splendid territories, which are their glorious <lb/>
heritage, than are the people of any other <lb/>
part of Canada. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Are they not the people chiefly
interested? <lb/>
May we not rightly conclude that if these <lb/>
lands are handed over to them, they will so <lb/>
deal with them as to best conserve their own <lb/>
interests by forwarding and assisting a <lb/>
vigorous policy of immigration ? May I not <lb/>
further suggest that even if there were any <lb/>
danger—and I do not think there is—it <lb/>
would be the task of good statesmanship <lb/>
to have inserted, if necessary, a provision <lb/>
in this Bill with regard to free homesteads <lb/>
and the prices of those lands, and obtain to <lb/>
it the consent of the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories. I see no possible constitu<lb break="no"/>tional difficulty because after all the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the lands is not a question of <lb/>
legislative power until the lands are <lb/>
handed over to the people and become the <lb/>
public property of the provinces. There are <lb/>
hundreds of millions of acres of public lands <lb/>
in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Are <lb/>
we not endeavouring now to promote im<lb break="no"/>migration to those provinces ? And has the <lb/>
government of my right hon. friend found <lb/>
any difficulties interposed by
any provincial <lb/>
administration which impede the carrying <lb/>
out of his immigration policy? Those lands <lb/>
are under the control of the provinces. The <lb/>
people of Ontario and Quebec go to their <lb/>
own provincial capitals and transact there <lb/>
all business relating to public lands. Why <lb/>
should not the people of the Northwest in the <lb/>
same way be entitled, when their own pro<lb break="no"/>vincial capitals are established in the new <lb/>
provinces, to deal with their own public <lb/>
lands and exercise control over them in their <lb/>
own legislature? My right hon. friend has <lb/>
referred to the example of the United States. <lb/>
He found the example of that country very <lb/>
cogent in this instance; but when, a little <lb/>
later on, he came to deal with the question <lb/>
of education, he departed altogether from <lb/>
that example and presented it as one to <lb/>
be entirely avoided. But if
the institu<lb break="no"/>tions of the two countries are so much alike <lb/>
that we may safely follow their example <lb/>
with regard to the lands, are not the charac<lb break="no"/>teristics and the religions of the two people <lb/>
so much of the same character that we <lb/>
might also grant to the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories exactly the same rights as <lb/>
are enjoyed by the states of the Union and <lb/>
by the provinces of Nova Scotia and New <lb/>
Brunswick? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>My right hon. friend referred to his re<lb break="no"/><pb n="2931" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-22_Page_2931.jpg"/> <fw type="num">2931</fw> <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw>cord in the past. He referred to his
record <lb/>
with regard to the Manitoba school con<lb break="no"/>troversy. I do not desire to discuss this <lb/>
question from too controversial a stand<lb break="no"/>point, but does my right hon. friend really <lb/>
feel satisfied to-day with his record on that <lb/>
question, which so much disturbed public <lb/>
opinion ten years ago? If ever there was <lb/>
a question in this country calculated to <lb/>
arouse passion and prejudice, and if ever <lb/>
such a question was deliberately thrown <lb/>
into the political arena for the purpose of <lb/>
political gain, it was the Manitoba school <lb/>
question. That question was precipitated <lb/>
into the political arena by the right hon. <lb/>
gentleman and his friends then in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, and by his Liberal friends in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Manitoba. There can be no doubt <lb/>
about that. Let us look at the record for <lb/>
a moment or two as the hon. gentleman <lb/>
himself has called attention to it. There <lb/>
were difficulties surrounding the Con<lb break="no"/>servative administration of that day. <lb/>
What was the attitude of my right <lb/>
hon. friend with regard to those difficul<lb break="no"/>ties ? When the Conservatives desired to <lb/>
investigate, he was impatient of de<lb break="no"/>lay. When they desired to conciliate, he <lb/>
accused them of weakness and cowardice. <lb/>
When they sought an interpretation of the <lb/>
constitution in the courts, he declared that <lb/>
they were exciting passion and discord. <lb/>
When they proposed the remedial order, he <lb/>
declared it was ineffective and insufficient. <lb/>
When they sought to enforce it by an Act <lb/>
of this parliament, he declared it was too <lb/>
strong and drastic in its terms. He de<lb break="no"/>nounced in violent language the late Mr. <lb/>
Dalton McCarthy in 1890, not only as an <lb/>
enemy of his creed, but of his race, and <lb/>
three years later he was content to accept <lb/>
Mr. McCarthy's aid on that question. On <lb/>
one side of him, he established a very able <lb/>
gentleman, who does not now occupy a seat <lb/>
in this House, but who then represented the <lb/>
constituency of L'Islet, in the province of <lb/>
Quebec—he used that gentleman to declare <lb/>
that the rights of the minority were <lb/>
being betrayed in Manitoba. And on <lb/>
the other side he accepted the aid of Mr. <lb/>
McCarthy, who denounced the action of the <lb/>
Conservative government as coercive and <lb/>
oppressive. He himself posed in the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish speaking provinces as the champion of <lb/>
provincial rights, and in the province of <lb/>
Quebec as the heaven-constituted protector <lb/>
of the minority. The hon. gentleman thus <lb/>
addressed himself with great skill to both <lb/>
opposing elements, and eventually succeeded <lb/>
in utilizing that question as the means of <lb/>
putting himself and his party into power. <lb/>
And after they did attain office, I ask <lb/>
my right hon. friend, in all seriousness and <lb/>
earnestness, whether or not he carried out <lb/>
to the full, and according to the spirit, the <lb/>
promise he made his compatriots in the pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Quebec. Well, the election came <lb/>
on, and my right hon. friend secured sup<lb break="no"/>port in the English speaking provinces as <lb/>
the upholder of provincial rights. He se<lb break="no"/>cured also even a greater measure of sup<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw type="num">2932</fw>port in the province of Quebec, and now
he <lb/>
is face to face with the very same question <lb/>
to-day. Years ago Brougham, in the <lb/>
English House of parliament, addressed a <lb/>
cogent indictment against the gentleman <lb/>
who was then leading the English adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. There, he said, he sits to-day doing <lb/>
penance for the disingenuousness of years. <lb/>
Does my right hon. friend regard those <lb/>
words as having to-day some application <lb/>
to himself. <lb/>
            </p>



            <p>The prime minister first declared that
this <lb/>
question is not one of separate schools, and <lb/>
then he proceeded to give us a long argu<lb break="no"/>ment with regard to the value and necessi<lb break="no"/>ty of such schools. I shall not follow him <lb/>
along that path. It is not, in my opinion, a <lb/>
question of separate schools, but a question <lb/>
of provincial rights. It is not a question of <lb/>
separate schools, but of provincial self-<lb break="yes"/>
government. It is not a question of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools but of constitutionl home rule. <lb/>
It is a question of those privileges and lib<lb break="no"/>erties of which the right hon. gentleman, <lb/>
up to the present at least, has claimed to be <lb/>
the champion and exponent. No one appre<lb break="no"/>ciates or respects more highly than I do <lb/>
the moral and ethical training which the <lb/>
Roman Catholic Church bestows upon the <lb/>
youth of Canada who were born within the <lb/>
pale of that church. I esteem at the highest <lb/>
the value of the moral training of the child<lb break="no"/>ren of this country ; and I am free further <lb/>
to confess that I appreciate more highly per<lb break="no"/>haps than some others the consistency and <lb/>
devotion of Roman Catholics, in this and <lb/>
other matters of their faith, wherein they <lb/>
give to the Protestants of this country an <lb/>
example from which the latter might well <lb/>
learn valuable lessons. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps in dealing with this question to<lb break="no"/>day I shall not make myself understood, as <lb/>
I would like to be understood, by many of <lb/>
my friends in the province of Quebec, whose <lb/>
esteem and friendship I value second to none <lb/>
of any of my fellow-citizens in Canada. I <lb/>
have met these gentlemen in friendly <lb/>
intercourse, both Conservatives and Lib<lb break="no"/>erals ; I have found among them men of <lb/>
broad, generous spirit, men of culture, <lb/>
men of wide reading, men able to look <lb/>
beyond the confines of their province and of <lb/>
Canada, men inspired not only with pat<lb break="no"/>riotism and devotion to this country. but <lb/>
with a broad and generous spirit in their re<lb break="no"/>gard for those who happened to differ from <lb/>
them in political opinions or in matters of <lb/>
religion. And I would desire to make my<lb break="no"/>self understood not only by those who are <lb/>
within the sound of my voice, but by all my <lb/>
friends in the province of Quebec, all of <lb/>
those whom I have known long and inti<lb break="no"/>mately and whose opinion I highly regard ; <lb/>
I desire them to appreciate the fact that I, <lb/>
to-day, am standing on the rock of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, as I understand that constitution : <lb/>
that I simply desire that the domination of <lb/>
this parliament shall not in any way destroy <lb/>
or undermine that foundation upon which <lb/>
the provincial rights of this country <lb/>
rest. And if there are any men in Canada <lb/>

 who should have a sacred regard for pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, they are my friends from
the <lb/>
province of Quebec, who of all men, have <lb/>
been in the past most jealous of the liberties <lb/>
of their province. It was in that school <lb/>
that my right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier) learned long ago the lesson which <lb/>
he seems to have somewhat forgotten to-day. <lb/>
In the province of Quebec, there is and there <lb/>
is rightly, a strong spirit in favour of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights. And it is because I inter<lb break="no"/>pret the constitution in the light of that <lb/>
spirit that I take the stand upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion which I take to-day. Let me illustrate <lb/>
my meaning by one further statement. If <lb/>
any hon. member of this House or any man <lb/>
in this country should seek to
insert in this <lb/>
Bill a provision forbidding the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of separate schools in the Northwest, <lb/>
I would combat that proposal to the end, <lb/>
because I would consider it as absolutely <lb/>
in the conflict with the provincial rights <lb/>
which I desire to see maintained. I take <lb/>
this stand because I believe that not only <lb/>
in the light of the constitution, but in the <lb/>
light of the highest wisdom and statesman<lb break="no"/>ship, education should be left absolutely to <lb/>
the control of the people of the new prov<lb break="no"/>inces. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, in 1896—to refer again for one
moment <lb/>
to the Manitoba school question—the consti<lb break="no"/>tution had been interpreted by the highest <lb/>
courts of the land. One decision had de<lb break="no"/>clared that Manitoba had absolute jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion over education, except as controlled by <lb/>
section 22 of the Manitoba Act. (And,
in <lb/>
referring to the Manitoba Act, let us remem<lb break="no"/>ber that it has all the force of imperial legis<lb break="no"/>lation because it was found necessary, al<lb break="no"/>most immediately to have it validated by <lb/>
imperial statute and it was validated by the <lb/>
British North America Act of 1871.) Another <lb/>
decision declared that parliament had power <lb/>
to enact remedial legislation. A remedial <lb/>
order was made by the Conservative govern<lb break="no"/>ment; and a remedial measure was intro<lb break="no"/>duced into this parliament by that govern<lb break="no"/>ment. My right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier) fought against it. At his right <lb/>
hand he had Mr. Tarte, who then represent<lb break="no"/>ed in this House the constituency of L'Islet, <lb/>
who I believe, expressed sincerely the strong <lb/>
views he entertained on this question. At <lb/>
his left, was Mr. Dalton McCarthy, to <lb/>
whom at least the same tribute is due. And <lb/>
between these was the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
(Sir Wilfrid Laurier), willing to accept the <lb/>
support of both. Like the three Romans <lb/>
who went forth to hold the bridge, these <lb/>
gentlemen went forth to hold the breach. <lb/>
Mr. McCarthy had upon his shield the de<lb break="no"/>vice, 'No coercion; provincial rights.' Mr. <lb/>
Tarte had upon his shield the device 'The <lb/>
rights of minorities; equal justice to all.' <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman had on one side of <lb/>
his shield the device of Mr. McCarthy, and on <lb/>
the other the device of Mr. Tarte,—I do not <lb/>
know which side he called the silvern and <lb/>
which side he called the golden; at all <lb/>
events the shield was thus exhibited. The <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2934</fw>
          
general election came on, and, as I have <lb/>
said, the Conservative administration was
<lb/>
defeated. In the maritime provinces a <lb/>
strong campaign was made, especially in the <lb/>
province of Nova Scotia, by my hon. friend <lb/>
the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding), with <lb/>
the war-cry 'provincial rights; no coercion <lb/>
of Manitoba.' In the west the same cam<lb break="no"/>paign was carried on by my hon. friend the <lb/>
ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton).
In <lb/>
Haldimand, in Winnipeg and in many other <lb/>
places throughout the west, ' No coercion of <lb/>
Manitoba' was the battle cry of that hon. <lb/>
gentleman, the ally and friend of the right <lb/>
hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). <lb/>
And, Sir, what was all the storm about at <lb/>
that time? Had there been any attempt <lb/>
to violate the constitution? No; it was <lb/>
simply a question of policy. The highest <lb/>
court of the realm had declared the right <lb/>
of this government to make a remedial order <lb/>
and of this parliament to enact remedial <lb/>
legislation. Undoubtedly, remedial legisla<lb break="no"/>tion was within the terms of
the constitution. <lb/>
Well, by an overwhelming majority, the <lb/>
people of Canada rendered this verdict,
a <lb/>
verdict which has been twice confirmed, if <lb/>
confirmation were needed—in 1900 and in <lb/>
1904. That verdict declared that even with<lb break="no"/>in the terms of the constitution there should <lb/>
be no coercion of a province in respect of its <lb/>
control over educational matters. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, the Conservative party was not un<lb break="no"/>animous on the question at that time. It was <lb/>
in the very nature of things that it would <lb/>
not be unanimous. Nor was there absolute <lb/>
unanimity among the Liberals of that day. <lb/>
The great majority of the Conservatives <lb/>
believed in the constitutional rights of the <lb/>
minority, and they stood by those rights at <lb/>
great risk and great cost to themselves. <lb/>
Men supported that Remedial Bill who knew <lb/>
that their action in so doing would debar <lb/>
them from future participation in the public <lb/>
life of Canada. The sacrifice was great, but <lb/>
it was not too great for many members <lb/>
who sincerely believed in the wisdom of <lb/>
enacting that legislation, who even went <lb/>
further and believed it to be the absolute <lb/>
duty of parliament to enact that legislation <lb/>
as proposed by the Conservative adminis<lb break="no"/>tration. And there were equally sincere <lb/>
men in the ranks of the Conservative party <lb/>
who combated that proposal, and, in the <lb/>
end, their position was sustained by the <lb/>
verdict of the country, brought about, in <lb/>
very great measure I believe, by the elo<lb break="no"/>quent addresses of my right hon. friend <lb/>
(Sir Wilfrid Laurier) in favour of provincial <lb/>
rights—addresses which were re-echoed in <lb/>
Ontario, in the maritime provinces and in <lb/>
the west by the Minister of Finance (Mr. <lb/>
Fielding) by the Postmaster General (Sir <lb/>
William Mulock), by the ex-Minister of the <lb/>
Interior (Mr. Sifton), by the Minister of <lb/>
Customs (Mr. Paterson) and many other <lb/>
gentlemen on that side of the House. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Well, after the elections my right hon. <lb/>
friend stood forth as the champion of the <lb/>
       
            <pb n="2935" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-22_Page_2935.jpg"/>

 liberties of the people, as the defender
par <lb/>
excellence of provincial rights,
as the con<lb break="no"/>ciliator who had dispersed by
sunny smiles <lb/>
the mists of passion and prejudice. If he <lb/>
was rightly estimated by the people of <lb/>
Canada at that time, there is grave ques<lb break="no"/>tion in the minds of many whether he <lb/>
has not now abandoned the principles which <lb/>
he then professed. Under what conditions <lb/>
did be present this measure ? Without <lb/>
consulting his two ministers best quali<lb break="no"/>fied by their knowledge and experience, <lb/>
without really consulting the representatives <lb/>
of the people, the executive government <lb/>
of the Northwest, with regard to this par<lb break="no"/>ticular clause, and moreover, if we may <lb/>
believe all that we now hear, without con<lb break="no"/>sulting the representatives in this House of <lb/>
the people of the Northwest. I have chal<lb break="no"/>lenged him before to state to this House <lb/>
and to the people of this country the rea<lb break="no"/>sons which induced him to bring down <lb/>
that measure without exposing it
to the <lb/>
ex-Minister of the Interior, then a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of his cabinet, or to my hon. friend the <lb/>
Minister of Finance. I have thought this <lb/>
involved to some extent the self respect and <lb/>
even the honour of my right hon. friend. <lb/>
He has not so regarded it. He must be the <lb/>
guardian of his own honour, I admit that, <lb/>
and I do not press him further. But I <lb/>
venture to think that it was only due to <lb/>
parliament and to the country to declare <lb/>
to us why he saw fit to adopt that most <lb/>
extraordinary course. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to the arguments of my right <lb/>
hon. friend when introducing this measure. <lb/>
He put forward constitutional grounds, and <lb/>
he gave two reasons, which I must examine <lb/>
a little in detail, even if in doing so I tres<lb break="no"/>pass upon the indulgence of the
House. The <lb/>
first reason he gave, so far as I was able <lb/>
to comprehend his argument, was this : That <lb/>
when parliament in 1875 enacted section 11 <lb/>
of the Northwest Territoires Act of that <lb/>
year, it imposed permanently upon those ter<lb break="no"/>ritories the provisions therein contained, so <lb/>
that they must necessarily become embodied <lb/>
in the constitution of such territories when <lb/>
created into provinces. To state that pro<lb break="no"/>position seems to me to refute it. Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment could at any time within the last <lb/>
thirty years have repealed section 11, or <lb/>
any other section of that Act ;
parliament <lb/>
could repeal that section to-day. Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment on many occasions during the
past <lb/>
thirty years has amended and modified the <lb/>
provisions contained in that Act. In 1890 <lb/>
Sir John Thompson introduced and this <lb/>
House carried an amendment, to a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion moved by Mr. McCarthy. That resolu<lb break="no"/>tion so amended conferred upon the people <lb/>
of the Northwest Territories power to deal <lb/>
with the question of dual languages after <lb/>
the next general election. A similar provi<lb break="no"/>sion could then have been made with regard <lb/>
to education. So that provision
contained <lb/>
in section 11 of the Act of 1875 must be <lb/>
       
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2936</fw>
         
regarded not as a permanent measure, but,
<lb/>
as a temporary provision which could at <lb/>
any moment be repealed by parliament so <lb/>
soon as it saw that the legislature of the <lb/>
Northwest might safely be entrusted with <lb/>
larger powers. It was absolutely within the <lb/>
power of parliament at any time during the <lb/>
past thirty years to have given to the people <lb/>
of the Northwest the same authority over <lb/>
education as was given by the measure to <lb/>
which I referred with respect to the use of <lb/>
the dual language. It was absolutely within <lb/>
the power of parliament at any time within <lb/>
the last thirty years to have given to the <lb/>
people of the Northwest Territories exactly <lb/>
the same power over education as that <lb/>
which is enjoyed to-day by the people of <lb/>
Nova Scotia, of New Brunswick and of <lb/>
Prince Edward Island. Now I challenge <lb/>
my right hon. friend the Prime Minister, <lb/>
my hon. friend the Minister of Justice, or <lb/>
any other gentleman on that side of the <lb/>
House to refute that statement, and to do so <lb/>
by any convincing or satisfactory argument. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>My right hon. friend has referred to the
op<lb break="no"/>inion of the late George Brown. So far as <lb/>
matters of policy in this country are con<lb break="no"/>cerned, Mr. Brown's opinion would undoubt<lb break="no"/>edly be of great weight, and should com<lb break="no"/>mend itself especially to hon. gentlemen on <lb/>
that side of the House who were brought <lb/>
up in that school of which Mr. Brown was <lb/>
the leader. Therefore when my right hon. <lb/>
friend, upon the first reading of this Bill, <lb/>
was obliged to quote the words of Mr. Brown <lb/>
condemning any attempt to create separate <lb/>
schools in the Northwest of Canada, he <lb/>
was giving to his followers a lessen read <lb/>
to them by the leader of that school in <lb/>
which they were brought up. But he was <lb/>
not content to deal with the opinion of Mr. <lb/>
George Brown upon a question of policy, <lb/>
he rather sought to use Mr. Brown as <lb/>
a constitutional authority. Well, we <lb/>
know that Mr. Brown was not dealing <lb/>
with the question from the standpoint <lb/>
of constitutional obligation; we know <lb/>
he was not well qualified to do so, be<lb break="no"/>cause he had not the legal training and <lb/>
the constitutional knowledge which would <lb/>
cause him to be recognized as a great au<lb break="no"/>thority on a question of that
kind. Now if <lb/>
my right hon. friend desired to quote Mr. <lb/>
Brown's views upon the constitution, he <lb/>
might well have read to the House these <lb/>
words from Mr. Brown as a
constitutional <lb/>
authority : <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> The constitution was framed with a view
to <lb/>
leaving this question to the settlement of the <lb/>
various provinces, and it would be folly in <lb/>
parliament to violate that arrangement. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>But if my right hon. friend really
desired <lb/>
constitutional authorities, he might have <lb/>
come down a little later. I will give to the <lb/>
House the authority upon that question of <lb/>
men versed in the law, men whose every <lb/>
word upon the meaning of the constitution <lb/>
must carry weight. In the first place, let <lb/>

         me cite the views of the late Sir John <lb/>
Thompson, a great lawyer, a great consti<lb break="no"/>tutional lawyer, which were uttered in this <lb/>
House in the year 1894 : <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> What the constitution of the future pro<lb break="no"/>vinces shall be, in view of the pledges which <lb/>
have been referred to, or in view of any <lb/>

those provinces. <lb/>
            </quote>

            <p>There was another gentleman, a lawyer <lb/>
who devoted himself, almost all his
great <lb/>
ability, to the consideration of the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion of Canada, a gentleman who, after <lb/>
being a colleague of my right hon. friend <lb/>
in his cabinet, was elevated to the Supreme <lb/>
Court of Canada, and whose loss by death <lb/>
a few years ago we all deplore. I refer to <lb/>
the Hon. David Mills, who, speaking also <lb/>
in this House, in 1894, used
this language: <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> When the people of the Territories or any
<lb/>
portion of the Territories are sufficiently nu<lb break="no"/>merous to constitute a province, when, in fact, <lb/>
they attain their majority in regard to local <lb/>

            <p>Another gentleman, at one time a prom<lb break="no"/>inent member of this House, now elevated <lb/>

to impose taxation on Canadian Pacific Rail<lb break="no"/>way lands, Mr. Justice Girouard said this: <lb/>

            <p>Mr. Clement, an eminent constitutional <lb/>

I desire to make this question plain inas<lb break="no"/>much as my right hon. friend has based <lb/>
his constitutional argument upon the per<lb break="no"/>manence of those institutions upon the <lb/>
theory that, forsooth, because a certain <lb/>
enactment was passed in 1875 when there <lb/>
were only 500 people west of Manitoba, <lb/>
that provision must be, by the decree of <lb/>
this parliament, permanently impressed <lb/>
upon those territories although they
now <lb/>
contain a population of 500,000. Here are
<lb/>
the words of Mr. Clement : <lb/>

with his views, but nevertheless, one <lb/>
which, if it does not command his respect, <lb/>
will at least, I am sure,
attract his atten<lb break="no"/>tion. My right hon. friend himself said in <lb/>

            <p>Mr. Speaker, you do not observe in this <lb/>

reference to the permanence of this pro<lb break="no"/>vision which he now seeks to impress for <lb/>
ever upon the people of the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. But, let me not forget one other <lb/>
authority which I should refer to, that is <lb/>
the authority of Sir John Thompson, whom <lb/>
I have already mentioned. These words <lb/>
were uttered in the year 1894. Mr. McCar<lb break="no"/>thy, in the course of his speech on that oc<lb break="no"/>casion, used this language and Sir John <lb/>
Thompson gave the following answer :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>As I understood the First Minister in his
<lb/>
answer to the hon. member for West Assini<lb break="no"/>boia—perhaps I was wrong, but Iwould like <lb/>
to be corrected if I was wrong—rather in<lb break="no"/>sisted upon the view I am putting which is <lb/>
that if separate schools are continued until <lb/>
the Northwest Territories are given provin<lb break="no"/>cial autonomy they will have the right of <lb/>
insisting upon that being continued when pro<lb break="no"/>vincial autonomy is conferred upon them. <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

                     which the First Minister holds. He <lb/> seems to be on both sides of the
                     question. <lb/>

            <p>Sir JOHN THOMPSON. Not at all. If I <lb/> spoke
                     amblguously before, I was not at all <lb/> conscious of it; but I cannot be
                     said to be <lb/> ambiguous after the explanation I made to <lb/> the hon.
                     member for Assiniboia. I appealed <lb/> to the House to continue the present
                     system <lb/> while the territorial system continued, and I <lb/> declared that
                     in my opinion the whole sub<lb break="no"/>ject would be open and free to
                     parliament as <lb/> to what constitution we would give to the <lb/> provinces
                     when provinces were created. <lb/>

            <p>Now, my right hon. friend took one other <lb/>
ground. He says that within the four <lb/>
corners of the British North America Act, <lb/>
1867 to 1886, he has found justification for <lb/>
imposing upon the people of the Northwest <lb/>
this restriction. I take issue with him upon <lb/>
this ground as strongly as upon the other. <lb/>
Neither in the negotiations and resolutions <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2940</fw>
           
 which led up to the British North America
<lb/>
Act, 1867, nor within the four corners of
<lb/>
that Act, and of the Acts in amendment <lb/>
thereto, can any provision be found which
<lb/>
obliges, or in my humble opinion even
justifies <lb/>
parliament in imposing separate schools
<lb/>
upon the new provinces. No doubt in this
I <lb/>
may be in conflict with some hon.
gentleman <lb/>
in this House, apparently with the
Minister <lb/>
of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for
otherwise <lb/>
this provision would not be brought down.
<lb/>
If anything would cause me to hesitate in
<lb/>
 my own opinion it would be that I differ <lb/>
 from the Minister of Justice (Mr.
Fitzpatrick) <lb/>
 whose legal ability I very highly esteem.
<lb/>
I do not claim to be infallible, but I have <lb/>
given to this question a good deal of con<lb break="no"/>sideration and it is my duty to state the
<lb/>
 conclusion I have arrived at, and which I
<lb/>
 have just stated, that there is not any
pro<lb break="no"/>vision within the four corners of the Act
<lb/>
 which obliges or in my humble opinion
even <lb/>
justifies parliament in imposing this
restric<lb break="no"/>tion upon the legislative power of the pro<lb break="no"/>posed provinces. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Let us examine in the first place the ne<lb break="no"/>gotiations upon which the British North <lb/>
America Act was passed. Do not forget <lb/>
that in the very outset the intention was to <lb/>
include in the confederation the very terri<lb break="no"/>tories that are now being constituted into
<lb/>
provinces. My right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid
<lb/>
Laurier) has referred to the Quebec resolu<lb break="no"/>tions. Let me also refer to them. He has
<lb/>
referred to the 43rd article and to the 6th <lb/>
sub-article. I shall read that because it is <lb/>
important to consider it in order to judge <lb/>
whether, outside the strict letter of the law <lb/>
and within the spirit of the constitution, <lb/>
within the lines of the negotiations which <lb/>
resulted in its formation, anything is to be <lb/>
found which justifies the present action of <lb/>
the government. The 43rd article enumer<lb break="no"/>ates subjects within the exclusive power of <lb/>
the provincial legislatures and the 6th sub-
<lb break="yes"/>
article is as follows :-<lb/>

            <p>But in construing that article do not
for<lb break="no"/>get to read in connection with it article 10 <lb/>
of the same resolution, which is this : <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> The Northwest Territories, British
Columbia <lb/>

 <p>What do I argue from that ? There were <lb/>
resolutions passed with regard to the union <lb/>
of certain provinces, the 10th article of those <lb/>
resolutions contemplated the bringing into <lb/>
the confederation of the very territories <lb/>
with which we are dealing to-day, and when <lb/>
the question of education was dealt with <lb/>
under article 43, sub-article 6 of the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions no restriction was placed upon the <lb/>
powers of provinces which might be <lb/>
created in the future in the Northwest. Cer<lb break="no"/>tainly, this is very significant. My right <lb/>
hon. friend in his speech upon
the first read<lb break="no"/>ing of this Bill very frankly admitted this. <lb/>
He said :  <lb/>
            </p>
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> I shall be told that that exception

Ontario and Quebec alone, and not to the other <lb/>

            <p>Let us trace the history of this a little
<lb/>
further. The British North America Act <lb/>
was passed and went into force on the first <lb/>
of July, 1867. Section 146 provided for the <lb/>
admission of other provinces upon a joint <lb/>
address of their legislatures and of the par<lb break="no"/>liament of Canada. I shall read it. <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and
with <lb/>
the advice of Her Majesty's most honourable <lb/>
Privy Council, on addresses from the Houses <lb/>

colonies or provinces of Newfoundland, Prince <lb/>
Edward Island and British Columbia to admit <lb/>
those colonies or provinces, or any of them into <lb/>
the union, and on address from the Houses of <lb/>

them into the union on such terms and condi<lb break="no"/>tions in each case as are in the addresses ex<lb break="no"/>pressed, and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, <lb/>

            <p>I lay special stress upon the words 'sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the provisions of this Act.' Under <lb/>
this provision the Territories became part <lb/>
of Canada on July 15, 1870, under an order <lb/>
of Her Majesty in council passed upon <lb/>
two addresses from the parliament of <lb/>
Canada. These addresses, did not, nor did <lb/>
the Order in Council founded upon them, <lb/>
nor did the Rupert's Land Act,1868, contain <lb/>
any provision which authorized, it seems to <lb/>
me, or justified, in my humble opinion, the <lb/>
imposition upon the people of the Northwest <lb/>
of the educational provisions contained in <lb/>
the present measure. Manitoba was includ<lb break="no"/>ed in the territory which became part of <lb/>
Canada under that Order in Council. The <lb/>
position of Manitoba was a little peculiar. <lb/>
An Act was passed by this parliament in <lb/>
anticipation of the Order in Council to which <lb/>
we have just referred. That Act was pass<lb break="no"/>ed on May 12, 1870, a little more than two <lb/>
months before these territories became part <lb/>
of Canada, and therefore Manitoba was <lb/>
            
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2942</fw>
           created into a province at the very
moment <lb/>
that it became part of the Dominion of <lb/>
Canada. That is a circumstance which <lb/>
should never be lost sight of in dealing with <lb/>
any question relating to Manitoba, and I <lb/>
have already pointed out that so doubtful <lb/>
was parliament, so doubtful was the ad<lb break="no"/>ministration of the day of the validity of <lb/>
the Act creating Manitoba into a province. <lb/>
that recourse was almost immediately had <lb/>
to the parliament of Great Britain and the <lb/>
provisions of the Manitoba Act were vali<lb break="no"/>dated by the parliament of Great Britain in <lb/>
1871. Therefore, any question which might <lb/>
otherwise have arisen whether or not this <lb/>
parliament was justified in inserting certain <lb/>
provisions in the Manitoba Act became im<lb break="no"/>material and never could arise after the <lb/>
passing of the British North America Act, <lb/>
1871. Under these circumstances it seems <lb/>
to me that no constitutional obligation, and, <lb/>
in my humble opinion, with all deference to <lb/>
the views of those who think differently, <lb/>
no constitutional authority is found for the <lb/>
educational clauses. I am of that opinion <lb/>
because these educational clauses
depart in <lb/>
terms from the provisions of the British <lb/>
North America Act which they purport to <lb/>
embody. If my right hon. friend (Sir Wil<lb break="no"/>frid Laurier) is correct in his contention that <lb/>
he is observing not only the letter but the <lb/>
spirit of the constitution, why is it that he <lb/>
has inserted in section 16 both as originally <lb/>
drafted and as amended provisions which <lb/>
purport to incorporate but which do more <lb/>
than that, which amend and change the <lb/>
terms of the British North America Act? <lb/>
The Prime Minister in his argument to<lb break="no"/>day declared that these Territories became <lb/>
entitled to the provisions of the British <lb/>
North America Act when they became part <lb/>
of this confederation. So they did, but 1875 <lb/>
is subsequent in date to 1870, and he is <lb/>
not seeking to-day to preserve any rights <lb/>
which existed at the time of the union in <lb/>
1870. He attempts by this measure to per<lb break="no"/>petuate privileges which did not then exist, <lb/>
but which were created by this par<lb break="no"/>liament in 1775. Is my right hon. <lb/>
friend willing to base his case upon <lb/>
the rights which existed in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories at the time of the union? <lb/>
What does my right hon. friend regard as the <lb/>
time of the union? I gathered from him <lb/>
to-day that the time of the union, is the <lb/>
time when these provinces became part of <lb/>
the Canadian confederation. If that is the <lb/>
meaning of the constitution let the consti<lb break="no"/>tution be so construed and acted upon with<lb break="no"/>out any attempt by this parliament to over<lb break="no"/>ride or change its provisions. My right <lb/>
hon. friend says that under subsection one <lb/>
of section 93 of the British North America <lb/>
Act, laws imposed by this parliament upon <lb/>
the Territories in 1875, when those Terri<lb break="no"/>tories had only 500 people must continue <lb/>
for ever to be the laws of these Territories, <lb/>
although they contain 500,000 people now <lb/>
and inside of twenty years they may con<lb break="no"/>

            </p>
            <p>Subsection 2 of section 93 is not very <lb/>

            <p>Analyze the British North America Act so <lb/>
far as analysis is necessary for the purpose <lb/>
of considering this question and what do <lb/>
you find ? In the first place you find the <lb/>
establishment of a federal parliament and a <lb/>

find the establishment of provincial legis<lb break="no"/>latures and provincial executives; in the <lb/>

lastly you find the distribution of leg<lb break="no"/>islative power between the Dominion <lb/>
parliament and the provincial
legis<lb break="no"/>latures. This analysis is not exhaus<lb break="no"/>tive, but it covers all that is neces<lb break="no"/>sary for the present purpose. I submit, <lb/>
Sir, that the basis established by this dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of legislative and executive power <lb/>
cannot be altered either under section 146
<lb/>
of the British North America Act or under <lb/>
section 2 of the British North America
<lb/>
Act, 1871. In establishing a new province <lb/>
can this parliament wholly or partially <lb/>
alter the basis of confederation; can it <lb/>
change the distribution of legislative power? <lb/>
That, I submit can only be done by the <lb/>
imperial parliament. Surely it cannot be <lb/>
contended that in giving to a new province <lb/>
the constitutional rights conferred by the <lb/>
British North America Act we can reverse <lb/>
the scheme framed by the fathers of con<lb break="no"/>federation and embodied in an imperial sta<lb break="no"/>tute. Yet, that is what the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman seeks to do to-day by the provisions <lb/>
contained both in the original and amended <lb/>
section 16 of the Bill. In creating a new <lb/>
province under the British North America <lb/>

amend section <lb/>
92 as to transfer to federal jurisdiction nine- <lb break="yes"/>

            <p>But it may be said that the second sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the British North America Act, 1871, <lb/>
has the efect of enabling this

to alter the terms of the constitution crea<lb break="no"/>ted in 1867. I do not so read it. I have al<lb break="no"/>ready quoted section 146 of the

            <p>Let us examine then the basis of union <lb/>
with regard to education, because that still <lb/>
remains to be considered, and it is upon <lb/>
that point my hon. friend has rested a con<lb break="no"/>siderable portion of his argument. Would <lb/>
it not be well before doing so to observe <lb/>
how this question has been regarded by <lb/>
great constitutional lawyers in days gone <lb/>
by? There was no man in parliament for <lb/>
whose opinion in constitutional matters my <lb/>
right hon. friend had greater regard than <lb/>
the late Hon. David Mills. Speaking in <lb/>
this parliament in 1894, Mr. Mills said: <lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>When you look at the subject of education
<lb/>
prior to the union you will find not that any <lb/>
system was expressly imposed upon the pro<lb break="no"/>vince, not that the principle of separate schools <lb/>
was virtually established, but the rule was es<lb break="no"/>tablished that where separate schools were es<lb break="no"/>tablished and had been established before the <lb/>
union, they should remain, and where they were <lb/>
not established, the province should retain con<lb break="no"/>trol over the subject to
introduce them or pre<lb break="no"/>vent their introduction as seemed proper to the <lb/>
people. We have a practical illustration of <lb/>
this fact in the position of things in the mari<lb break="no"/>time provinces and the provinces of Ontario <lb/>
and Quebec. So far as the Territories were <lb/>
concerned—I do not at all admit that the in<lb break="no"/>troduction of separate schools there stands upon <lb/>
the same footing as the introduction of separate <lb/>
schools in the province of Ontario, or of dis<lb break="no"/>sentient schools in the province of Quebec. In <lb/>
these provinces they are protected under the <lb/>
constitution; they cannot be interfered with <lb/>
by the local legislature. But in the Northwest
<lb/>
Territories, as the hon. minister has said, it <lb/>
has been a matter not of right, not of guarantee <lb/>
to any particular class of the population, but a <lb/>
matter of policy. They were introduced with <lb/>
the view of preventing conflict in this House <lb/>
upon the subject of separate schools and for the <lb/>
reason that they were introduced there they <lb/>
should be maintained as long as these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories are under the control of this parliament. <lb/>
When this parliament has discharged its duties <lb/>
and the people of the Territories have received <lb/>
the population to entitle them to enter the <lb/>
union they must assume the responsibility for <lb/>
deciding for themselves under the British North <lb/>
America Act how far they should maintain the <lb/>
principle of separate schools or maintain the <lb/>
non-denominational system. Any attempt on <lb/>
our part, whatever our inclinations or feelings <lb/>
may be, to anticipate what ought to be done in <lb/>
that particular, by the province after its <lb/>
autonomy is established, instead of being a <lb/>
source of security to its institutions would be <lb/>
a source of great danger. <lb/>

            <p>My opinion is now and has been for years <lb/>
that when that time comes you cannot with<lb break="no"/>hold from the provinces so erected the right to <lb/>

last to favour this parliament imposing upon <lb/>
the people there any system of
education, <lb/>
either free or separate. I only claim that when <lb/>
a Bill is introduced to erect those Territories <lb/>
into provinces that Bill should contain a pro<lb break="no"/>vision enabling the people of the different pro<lb break="no"/>vinces so created to decide what system of edu<lb break="no"/>cation they shall have. I do not discuss that <lb/>
question now. I only express this view lest I <lb/>
might be supposed by my silence to give assent <lb/>
to some extreme doctrines which hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men have propounded. In view of the remarks <lb/>
which have been made, I thought it necessary <lb/>
to disclaim that, in assenting to the passing of <lb/>
this Bill, I bound myself for all time on this <lb/>
question of education. I do not. Although we <lb/>
are giving powers almost equal to those con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon local legislatures, we are not erect<lb break="no"/>ing the Territories into separate provinces. <lb/>
When that is done I suppose it will be done by <lb/>
the Queen in Council under the 146th section of <lb/>
the British North America Act, and I simply <lb/>
claim the right when that time comes to de<lb break="no"/>termine for myself. In accordance with the <lb/>
view I have always held and hold now, I have <lb/>

            <p>Is there anything in the terms of section

93, read in connection with section 2 of the <lb/>
Act of 1871, which authorizes or indeed <lb/>
justifies the imposing of restrictions on the <lb/>
legislative rights of the new provinces ? <lb/>
Let me once more read it, omitting
what is <lb/>
immaterial in this regard : <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> The parliament of Canada may establish

            </quote>

            <p>It is urged that when you read that in
con<lb break="no"/>nection with section 93, you are to conclude <lb/>
for some reason that the schools which <lb/>
were established in 1875, or the law which <lb/>
was passed in 1875 and the ordinances <lb/>
which were enacted in pursuance of that <lb/>
law, are to be imposed and must indeed <lb/>
constitutionally be imposed upon the new <lb/>
provinces. What is the basis with regard <lb/>
to education ? The basis is that in and for <lb/>
each province the legislature may exclusive<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw type="num">2948</fw>ly make laws in relation to education,
sub<lb break="no"/>ject and according to certain provisions. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>These provisions I have already adverted <lb/>
to ; and the question arises whether or not <lb/>
they have any relation to the creation of <lb/>
provinces from territories which became <lb/>
part of Canada in 1870—whether or not <lb/>
laws which were not in force in those ter<lb break="no"/>ritories at the time when they became part <lb/>
of Canada are or can be imposed upon the <lb/>
territories under the constitution by virtue <lb/>
of the provisions of section 93 coupled with <lb/>
the Act of 1871. With all deference to the <lb/>
opinion of those who differ from me in this <lb/>
regard, I submit that such is not the result. <lb/>
And it is perfectly clear that in their hearts <lb/>
the government believe that these provisions <lb/>
have no such effect. Otherwise they would <lb/>
not have attempted to change those provis<lb break="no"/>ions by the Bill now before the House. It the <lb/>
constitution is the rock upon which the <lb/>
right hon. Prime Minister stands,
why does <lb/>
he not let that rock stand and why does he <lb/>
not build the superstructure of his legisla<lb break="no"/>tion upon it ? Why does he seek first to un<lb break="no"/>dermine it as he is attempting to do ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I submit that the first subsection of sec<lb break="no"/>tion 93 which affords the key to all the <lb/>
subsections, is only applicable to provinces <lb/>
already formed, already existing as separate <lb/>
sovereignties. The words of the section <lb/>
are: ' In the province at the union ' —con<lb break="no"/>templating, it seems to me, laws which had <lb/>
come into existence by the sovereign will <lb/>
of the people before they entered this con<lb break="no"/>federation, and not laws imposed upon 500 <lb/>
people in the Northwest of Canada in 1875, <lb/>
at a time when their voice could not indeed <lb/>
be heard in this parliament because they had <lb/>
then no representative here. These ter<lb break="no"/>ritories do not come into the union as a <lb/>
province. The words of the
section I have <lb/>
just read are not apt, nor were they in<lb break="no"/>tended to convey any such meaning as the <lb/>
right hon. Prime Minister has attempted to <lb/>
read into them. In making his argument in <lb/>
favour of withholding the lands from the <lb/>
province, the Prime Minister
inadvertently <lb/>
made a very strong argument against these <lb/>
educational provisions; and I will tell <lb/>
him what it was. He said : <lb/>

<lb/>
created by the people themselves in their <lb/>
independent legislatures before the union. <lb/>
It was a matter of compact. Legislative sov<lb break="no"/>ereignty had already established certain <lb/>
rights. These were not to be prejudiced <lb/>
after union had taken place. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In the case of the Northwest, however, <lb/>
the people had never acted. A system im<lb break="no"/>posed upon them in 1875, which
has con<lb break="no"/>tinued from that time to the present, is now <lb/>
sought to be made perpetual. The people <lb/>
did not freely establish separate schools in <lb/>
the Northwest, but these were established <lb/>
under the terms of a statute in framing <lb/>
which the people had no voice, but to which <lb/>
as good loyal subjects they have been ab<lb break="no"/>solutely obedient so long as they were in <lb/>
a territorial position. The territories have <lb/>
never had any complete legislative powers <lb/>
such as were originally enjoyed by the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, <lb/>
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island, and <lb/>
British Columbia. Parliament, as I have <lb/>
pointed out over and over again could have <lb/>
revoked the power conferred first upon the <lb/>
territorial council and afterwards upon the <lb/>
territorial legislature. The right hon. Prime <lb/>
Minister sought to overcome this by a mis<lb break="no"/>use of words—I say that in no

sense. He said: <lb/>

not done anything of the kind. They estab<lb break="no"/>lished separate schools in the Northwest <lb/>

            <p>House in Committee on Bill (No. 12) re<lb break="no"/>specting the Ottawa Electric Company. <lb/>
On the preamble, <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:STEW1">Mr. ROBERT STEWART</persName> (Ottawa). Up <lb/> to the present moment
                  we have heard <lb/> nothing from the promoter of the Bill as to <lb/> the reasons
                  why he asks this House to pass <lb/> it. As one of the representatives of the city
                  <lb/> of Ottawa I would like to hear from him <lb/> why he asks for this
                  legislation, which, to my <lb/> mind, is an invasion of the rights of the <lb/>
                  municipality. In such an important matter <lb/> as this I really think that the
                  promoter of <lb/> the Bill ought to give us some reasons why <lb/> he thinks we
                  should pass it. I may say that <lb/> since this Bill was in committee before a
                  <lb/> very numerously signed petition has been <lb/> sent in protesting against
                  the passing of the <lb/> Bill, a petition signed by over 2,000 rate<lb break="no"/>payers of the city of Ottawa. I mention this <lb/> as showing the very strong
                  feeling that ex<lb break="no"/>ists in the city against this Bill; and yet in
                  <lb/> face of this fact. and in face of the fact that <lb/> this Bill seems to
                  call for the abolition of the <lb/> competition which exists to-day, we are <lb/>
                  still without any reasons given by the pro<lb break="no"/>moter of the Bill why it
                  should pass. <lb/>
               </p>

            <fw type="running">COMMONS</fw> 
            <p>Regarding the amendment proposed by Mr. <lb/>
Birkett, then member for Ottawa, let me <lb/>
draw attention to the fact that the Bill went <lb/>
through committee in Mr. Birkett's absence. <lb/>
I am not making any charge or finding fault <lb/>
with him, but merely stating that he was not <lb/>
present when the Bill went through com<lb break="no"/>mittee. When it came before the House and <lb/>
he saw that the Bill was likely to carry, <lb/>
the amendment he proposed was conceded <lb/>
by the city only because they thought they <lb/>
could not get better. But the
point of the <lb/>
present Bill and the subject now really be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, is whether this House shall <lb/>
pass a Bill to enable the Ottawa Electric <lb/>
Company to abolish competition.
So far as <lb/>
the mayor's statement in the committee is <lb/>
concerned, it is well known that immediate<lb break="no"/>ly after the meeting of that committee, the <lb/>
city council was called togther, and, by a <lb/>
vote of nineteen to five, decided to oppose <lb/>
the adoption of the maximum rate of the <lb/>
Consumers' Electric Company. So, we have <lb/>
to-day before us not the question whether <lb/>
this was acceptable to the mayor, or whe<lb break="no"/>ther it was acceptable to the corporation <lb/>
of a previous year, but we have the state<lb break="no"/>ment of the corporation of Ottawa that <lb/>
they are opposed to the abolishing of com<lb break="no"/>petition, which is the principle underlying <lb/>
this Bill. And I think that the promoter <lb/>
or the Bill, if he would tell us all he knows <lb/>
about it, would say that the idea of in<lb break="no"/>creasing the capital is that the company may <lb/>
be able to absorb the Consumers' Electric <lb/>
Company and thereby destroy
competition. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:KEMP1">Mr. KEMP</persName>. Might I inquire from the hon. <lb/> member for
                  Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) why <lb/> it is necessary for this company to come <lb/>
                  here for legislation ? If they wish to over<lb break="no"/>ride the city of Ottawa
                  why do they not go <lb/> to the provincial legislature of Ontario? <lb/>
               </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BELC1">Mr. BELCOURT</persName>. The charter which it is <lb/> proposed to amend
                  is a Dominion charter. <lb/> So, they must come here. <lb/>

            <p>Preamble agreed to, yeas 82, nays 59. <lb/>

            <p>Well, I ask him why he conveniently <lb/>
leaves out of sight in that illustration, the <lb/>
cases of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and <lb/>
Prince Edward Island? He himself, has <lb/>
pointed out in an earlier passage of his <lb/>
speech—indeed to-day he has gone into the <lb/>
historical aspect of that matter—that
these <lb/>
clauses, so far as Ontario and Quebec are <lb/>
concerned, were introduced into the British <lb/>
North American Act by virtue of a compact, <lb/>
and that no such compact existed in respect <lb/>
to the three maritime provinces. Well, if my <lb/>
right hon. friend will show me that the case <lb/>
of these proposed provinces—because they <lb/>
are not yet provinces—comes
nearer to the <lb/>
case of Ontario and Quebec than it does to <lb/>
the case of the maritime provinces, if he is <lb/>
able to show me that there is in respect to <lb/>
these proposed provinces any such compact <lb/>
as that which was made before confederation <lb/>
between Ontario and Quebec, I will then <lb/>
readily and gladly accept his illustration; <lb/>
but until he does so I contend that his illus<lb break="no"/>tration is of not the slightest value. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to section <lb/>
16, because it is opposed to the spirit <lb/>
and the letter of the constitution. I am <lb/>
opposed to the substituted section because <lb/>
it is not different in principle from that <lb/>
for which it is substituted; and indeed it is <lb/>
difficult to understand why there
have been <lb/>
three weeks of delay, why there have been <lb/>
three weeks of negotiation, why there have <lb/>
been three weeks of turmoil, why this mea<lb break="no"/>sure has been postponed from the 21st of <lb/>
February up to the present time, simply <lb/>
for the purpose of bringing down to parlia<lb break="no"/>ment as a substitute that which is to all in<lb break="no"/>tents and purposes, in principle and for the <lb/>
most part in detail, exactly the same as <lb/>
the original section. Is this the result of <lb/>
the efforts of the ex-Minister of the Interior? <lb/>
Is it for this that he resigned office
? Is it <lb/>
to accomplish this that he laid down the <lb/>
seals of office and placed himself before the <lb/>
people of this country as the champion of <lb/>
provincial liberties ? Is this the result of <lb/>
the unceasing and untiring efforts of the <lb/>
seven hon. gentlemen from the Northwest <lb/>
Territories who sit on the other side of the <lb/>
House ? Sir, the mountains have been in <lb/>
labour, and a ridiculous mouse has been <lb/>
brought forth. What does section 16 as <lb/>
proposed to be amended accomplish? It <lb/>
sterotypes for ever the ordinances and laws <lb/>
of the Northwest Territories in a portion of <lb/>
the country where extraordinary progress <lb/>
and development must be expected. I ven<lb break="no"/>ture to think that an Act of this kind will <lb/>
be productive of more harm in that por<lb break="no"/>tion of the country than anywhere else in <lb/>

and progress to a very unusual degree in <lb/>
the immediate future.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Why, the very form of section 16 and of <lb/>
the substituted section show that the govern<lb break="no"/>ment are not serious in the contention which <lb/>
the right hon. gentleman has made. What <lb/>
had they inserted in this Bill before we <lb/>
came to section 16? They had inserted <lb/>
section 2, which I will read to the House : <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> 2. The provisions of the British North
America <lb/>

comprised in the Dominion, as if the said pro<lb break="no"/>vince of Alberta had been one of the provinces <lb/>

            <p>Has not the right hon. gentleman over <lb/>
and over again in this House, both upon the <lb/>
first reading of this Bill and in the speech <lb/>
which he made this afternoon, told us that <lb/>
it is his intention solely and absolutely to <lb/>
apply to the Northwest Territories of Can<lb break="no"/>ada the provisions of that constitution un<lb break="no"/>der which all Canadians live. Now I ask <lb/>
him, and I ask every hon. gentleman on <lb/>
the other side of the House who proposes <lb/>
to deal with this question, why section 2 <lb/>
is not sufficient to apply to the Northwest <lb/>
Territories of Canada, every provision of <lb/>
the constitutional statutes which it enumer<lb break="no"/>ates ? If my right hon. friend proposes to <lb/>
stand on the rock of the constitution, what <lb/>
portion of the rock of the constitution is omit<lb break="no"/>ted from section 2? It goes further, I believe, <lb/>
in the direction in which the right hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman desires to persevere, than it should <lb/>
go having regard to the fact that this is <lb/>
not a province already constituted coming <lb/>
into the Dominion, but is a province to be <lb/>
created by the very Bill we are now dis<lb break="no"/>cussing. I will have something more to <lb/>
say about that when this Bill is in com<lb break="no"/>mittee. But putting aside for the moment <lb/>
that question, is or is not my right hon. <lb/>
friend sincere, are or are not his colleagues <lb/>
sincere, when they tell this House that they <lb/>
desire the control of education in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories to be regulated solely by <lb/>
the provisions of the constitution ? If they <lb/>
are sincere, then I say that they have every<lb break="no"/>thing in section 2 that can possibly be given <lb/>
—if they stand as the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
says he does stand, on the rock of the cons<lb break="no"/>titution. Why, the matter is not arguable. <lb/>
For what reason do they insert these words? <lb/>

                  so much <lb/> what has been said by the press as the <lb/> knowledge that the
                  right hon. gentleman, <lb/> in this Bill, has in express terms departed <lb/> from
                  the provisions of the constitution. The <lb/> British North America Act, 1867 to
                  1886, is <lb/> to apply to these two provinces, to apply <lb/> absolutely and in
                  their whole terms. Are <lb/> they ? Let the right hon. gentleman an<lb break="no"/>swer in the terms of his own measure: <lb/> No. they are only to apply 'except
                  in <lb/> so far as varied by this Act.' And yet <lb/> with that provision staring
                  him in the <lb/> face, not only in section 2 but in section <lb/> 16 of the Bill,
                  he ventures, on his authority <lb/> as a public man of long experience, on his
                  <lb/> responsibility as Prime Minister of Canada, <lb/> on his honour as leader of

                  constitution, that he stands upon the rock <lb/> upon which it is founded. Why,
                  surely, <lb/> the matter is not arguable. If the right <lb/> hon. gentleman is
                  sincere, let him strike <lb/> out these words ' in so far as varied by this <lb/>

            </p>
            <p>I was under the impression that a great <lb/>
deal of the agitation and dissatisfaction <lb/>
said to prevail in certain quarters on the <lb/>
other side of the House, was occasioned by <lb/>
the provision contained in subsection 3 of <lb/>
section 16 of the Bill as originally drafted. <lb/>
That subsection reads as follows: <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> In the appropriation of public moneys by
the <lb/>
legislature in aid of education, and in the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of any moneys paid to the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the said province arising from the <lb/>
school fund established by the Dominion Lands <lb/>
Act, there shall be no discrimination between <lb/>
the public schools and the separate schools, <lb/>
and such moneys shall be applied to the
sup<lb break="no"/>port of public and separate schools in
equitable <lb/>
shares or proportion. <lb/>
            </quote>






            <p>It was murmured—I
know not with what <lb/>
truth—that one of the special reasons ad<lb break="no"/>vanced by my hon. friend the ex-Minister of <lb/>
the Interior (Mr. Sifton) for his disagree<lb break="no"/>ment with his colleagues was the circum<lb break="no"/>stance that this amendment had been made, <lb/>
and that thereby the moneys set apart for <lb/>
a certain purpose under the provisions of <lb/>
the Dominion Lands Act were supposed to <lb/>
be diverted from the purpose for which they
<lb/>
were originally intended. Has that been <lb/>
changed ? Let us read the provision which <lb/>
is now proposed to be substituted for it, <lb/>
and I will venture to say that there is a <lb/>
great deal less difference between the amend<lb break="no"/>ed section and the original section proposed <lb/>
by the government than there is between <lb/>
either one or other of these sections and <lb/>
section 93 of the British North America <lb/>
Act. The amendment does not differ so <lb/>
much from the section as originally draft<lb break="no"/>ed as either one or the other of those sec<lb break="no"/>tions departs from the terms of the British <lb/>
North America Act. Here is the amended <lb/>
section in regard to public moneys: <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> In the appropriation by the legislature
or dis<lb break="no"/>tribution by the government of the province of  <lb/>
any moneys for the support of schools organized <lb/>
and carried on in accordance with said chapter <lb/>
29 or any Act passed in amendment thereof, or <lb/>
in substitution therefor, there shall be no dis<lb break="no"/>crimination against schools of any class de<lb break="no"/>scribed in the said chapter 29. <lb/>
            </quote>
            <p>Almost ipsissimis verbis and certainly <lb/>
not in the slightest degree different in sub<lb break="no"/>stance.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>What, after all, is the position in which
<lb/>
we find ourselves to-day under
the proposal <lb/>
of the government ? Parliament under<lb break="no"/>takes to interpret some provisions
and to <lb/>
amend others of a constitution which it has <lb/>
not power to alter. If the constitution <lb/>
is to be followed, and if parliament <lb/>

          is to keep within its terms, the proper
course <lb/>
is simply to provide that the general pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the British North America Act <lb/>
shall apply, in so far as they are applicable <lb/>
to the new provinces. It is the only course <lb/>
to pursue, and I stated a moment ago, what <lb/>
I now repeat that if the government <lb/>
of this country, instead of embarking <lb/>
on their present course had simply con<lb break="no"/>fined themselves to a proposal of that <lb/>
kind, protecting the rights of all parties <lb/>
under the constitution, as it was originally <lb/>
framed, there would have been no arousing <lb/>
of passion, or prejudice, or strife, and this <lb/>
difficult and delicate question could, I think, <lb/>
have been settled without any such discord <lb/>
as that which we have unfortunately known <lb/>
in this country during the past few weeks. <lb/>
If the constitution imposes on the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces the restrictions which have been <lb/>
spoken of, why is it necessary to distort, to <lb/>
amend, to alter its language or
to inter<lb break="no"/>pret the Acts referred to ? Sir, it is not wise <lb/>
to follow a course which arouses passion, <lb/>
discord and discontent. Let the rights of <lb/>
all be governed according to the constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, and no injustice will be done; and, <lb/>
more than that, no injustice will be felt. <lb/>
The right hon. gentleman and his colleagues <lb/>
have been advocates of provincial rights, <lb/>
champions of conciliation, in the past, and <lb/>
after all conciliation is better than coercion. <lb/>
The Prime Minister has laid that principle <lb/>
down many times, and I am sorry he has <lb/>
been so forgetful of it on the present occa<lb break="no"/>sion. Let us listen to what he
said in 1890 : <lb/>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> What I understand by provincial
rights—and <lb/>

Why should there be any fear ? Is not the <lb/>
question of language something to my <lb/>
friends in the province of Quebec? I am <lb/>
led to believe and I do believe that next to <lb/>
the faith to which they are attached and of <lb/>
which they are proud, they take a legitimate <lb/>
pride in their own language. And why <lb/>
should they not? I am English speaking <lb/>
and Protestant, I am not ashamed of the <lb/>

faith to which I hold and it is for that very <lb/>
reason that I honour the French Canadians, <lb/>

which he sprang, cannot be a good Can<lb break="no"/>adian and it is well for the future of this <lb/>
country, it is well for the future of
our <lb/>
people as a whole, that there should be in <lb/>
the two great races which dominate this <lb/>
country, a feeling on either side of attach<lb break="no"/>ment to language and of pride of race. <lb/>
My right hon. friend (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) <lb/>

that there should be any fear now ? But let <lb/>

            <p>Why Mr. Speaker, in the very speech <lb/>
which the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid <lb/>
Laurier) delivered on the first reading of <lb/>
this Bill, it seems to me that he uttered his <lb/>
own condemnation, and I shall leave it to <lb/>
the judgment of the House whether I shall <lb/>
not make good that observation. He was <lb/>
dealing with the boundary question in the <lb/>
early part of his speech and laid down the <lb/>
principle that it was absolutely essential in <lb/>
Canada, so far as possible, to have the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of about equal size, and he attached <lb/>
a special importance to that principle, in<lb break="no"/>deed, we can all see that it is more espe<lb break="no"/>cially important to carry out that prin<lb break="no"/>ciple, in the Northwest of Canada. He was <lb/>
giving a reason why the boundaries of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba should not be extended westerly, though <lb/>
Manitoba with 73,000 square miles of terri<lb break="no"/>tory adjoins Alberta and Saskatchewan,
<lb/>
each having an area of about 250,000 square <lb/>
miles. What was the reason that he gave ? <lb/>
Let me read his own words. <lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote"> But is there a member of this House who <lb/>

that he is willing to impose these restric<lb break="no"/>tions upon them in face of the strongest pos<lb break="no"/>sible protest by their Prime Minister, and <lb/>

Is there one principle to be applied to <lb/>
the question, whether or not territory <lb/>
shall be added to Manitoba, and is <lb/>
another principle to be applied to a <lb/>
subject which the right hon. gentleman <lb/>
himself knows from long experience is lia<lb break="no"/>ble to arouse feelings of discord and even <lb/>
of passion when the people think they are <lb/>
suffering any injustice? Why, any question <lb/>

far as sentiment goes, in comparison with <lb/>
that question which the right hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man has seen fit to fling abruptly into the <lb/>

any doubt about that. What does the right <lb/>

as a solemn reason why a principle which <lb/>

            <p>There is one other point upon which I
shall <lb/>
dwell for a moment and which is, perhaps <lb/>
a little out of its place here. I refer to the <lb/>
argument which my right hon. friend made <lb/>
not only to-day, but also a month ago with <lb/>
regard to the tax exemption of the Canadian <lb/>
Pacific Railway. In triumphant tones on <lb/>
both occasions he likened this matter to an <lb/>
obligation upon parliament to observe the <lb/>
terms of a contract ; he has said : in esta<lb break="no"/>blishing these Territories you cannot rid <lb/>
the people of the Northwest from that ex<lb break="no"/>emption which was imposed by a statute <lb/>
passed in 1880. He told us that no one <lb/>
would suggest any such thing, and that no <lb/>
one had ever attempted to suggest it. Well, <lb/>
the right hon. gentleman's memory is not <lb/>
very good. I myself had the temerity to <lb/>
suggest that very thing in this parliament. <lb/>
I said two years ago that I thought <lb/>
the government should seriously take into <lb/>
consideration the question of removing that <lb/>
exemption—and parliament can do it—but <lb/>
I said that parliament must strictly observe <lb/>
the terms of its obligation and that in such <lb/>
case it would be absolutely necessary for <lb/>
parliament to institute an inquiry and to <lb/>
make good to the Canadian Pacific Railway <lb/>
everything to which they were entitled by <lb/>
reason of the removal of the exemption. <lb/>

                  of the <lb/> Northwest, I will support the measure they <lb/> have brought down.
                  Why. Sir, the only con<lb break="no"/>tract which exists is in the terms of the

                  against <lb/> their will, I have one inquiry to make from <lb/> my right hon.
                  friend. The Prime Minister <lb/> of the Northwest Territories said that he <lb/>
                  was not consulted with regard to the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of section 16 as
                  originally drafted. <lb/> He has stated in a letter—and I have not <lb/> heard it
                  contradicted—that there was only <lb/> a casual reference made to the education
                  <lb/> question—one of the most important ques<lb break="no"/>tions of all,
                  surely—that there was only a <lb/> casual reference to it on the Friday be<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw type="num">2974</fw>fore this Bill was introduced, and that at <lb/> 12 o'clock on
                  the very day on which the <lb/> Prime Minister introduced the Bill a type<lb break="no"/>written copy of this provision was handed <lb/> to him across the
                  table. Mr. Haultain has <lb/> further stated, that the Prime Minister <lb/> was
                  not then present, that the Post<lb break="no"/>master General was not present,
                  that the <lb/> Minister of Justice was present for a short <lb/> time, but the
                  only gentleman who remained <lb/> present during the whole ot that interview,
                  <lb/> the only gentleman whom the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister of the Northwest
                  Territories had any <lb/> opportunity of consulting, (and that only <lb/> three
                  hours before the introduction of the <lb/> Bill) was the Secretary of State. What
                  was <lb/> the answer of the right hon. gentleman <lb/> to that assertion ? It was
                  this, that Mr. <lb/> Haultain—a gentleman, as he always is<lb break="no"/>had seen
                  fit to express, in the conclusion of <lb/> his letter, his appreciation of
                  courtesy <lb/> which had always been extended to his <lb/> colleagues and himself.
                  I would like to <lb/> ask the right hon. gentleman at this stage <lb/> whether or
                  not the provisions of that amend<lb break="no"/>ed section were at any time
                  submitted to <lb/> Mr. Haultain before they were submitted to <lb/> this
                  parliament? Has Mr. Haultain been <lb/> consulted with regard to this amended

                  liberties of the people. Once he was <lb/> ready to consult them. Once he was
                  ready <lb/> to meet their will. Once he was ready to <lb/> bow to their will when
                  constitutionally <lb/> expressed. But when the Prime Minister <lb/> of these
                  Territories, which, according to the <lb/> right hon. gentleman possess now almost
                  <lb/> complete rights of self-government, when <lb/> the Prime Minister of these
                  Territories and <lb/> his colleagues come to Ottawa to consult <lb/> with this
                  government, and when a great <lb/> question is raised, when passion and pre<lb break="no"/>judice are being appealed to, the right hon. <lb/> gentleman
                  deliberately refuses to take the <lb/> premier of the Northwest Territories into
                  <lb/> his confidence or seek his advice and as<lb break="no"/>sistance with regard
                  to this measure. There <lb/> were sunny ways in days gone by. There <lb/> seem to
                  be different ways now. I do not <lb/> know for what reason the First Minister
                  <lb/> of the Territories was ignored. He and <lb/> his colleagues are the
                  accredited represent<lb break="no"/>atives of the Northwest Territories. They
                  <lb/> were summoned to Ottawa, and are here, <lb/> for the very purpose of being
                  consulted and <lb/> of advising with regard to this measure. <lb/> But although
                  the situation is so serious, as <lb/> the right hon. gentleman has depicted it,
                  <lb/> he ventures, in the face of public opinion <lb/> in this country, to bring
                  down this measure <lb/> in its amended form without having given <lb/> the Prime

                  tories the right even to see it or examine <lb/> it before
                  it was finally decided upon. <lb/>
               </p>
            <p>Sir,
the conclusion of the whole mat<lb break="no"/>ter seems plain. The very basis of <lb/>
confederation, contemplating the event<lb break="no"/>ual inclusion of all British North <lb/>
America, provided for separate schools in <lb/>
the provinces of Ontario and Quebec only. <lb/>
This provision was the result of compact <lb/>
and agreement. But no restrictions on <lb/>
provincial powers were contemplated in the <lb/>
Northwest. None are mentioned in the <lb/>
Quebec resolutions. The terms of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution, if applied in their integrity to the <lb/>
new provinces, do not, in my humble opin<lb break="no"/>ion, restrict the powers of the provincial <lb/>
legislature. The people of the Northwest <lb/>
are, I believe, opposed to any such restric<lb break="no"/>tions. We have passed resolutions in this <lb/>
parliament in favour of home rule for Ire<lb break="no"/>land. Shall five and a half millions of <lb/>
people of Canada deprive half a million of <lb/>
people in the Territories of that home rule <lb/>
which is theirs under the terms of the con<lb break="no"/>stitution? Shall we, despite the terms of <lb/>
our national charter, impose upon a small <lb/>
minority of the people of Canada a res<lb break="no"/>triction which they will always resent and <lb/>
against which they will always struggle ? <lb/>
Are the people of the Northwest
competent <lb/>
to receive the rights of self government ? <lb/>
Why then should they not receive the same <lb/>
rights which were conferred upon the people <lb/>
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince <lb/>
Edward Island, and which are now enjoyed <lb/>
by them ? In the provinces of Ontario and <lb/>
Quebec there is, it is true, a compact
which <lb/>
is embodied in our constitution and which <lb/>
has always been—and must always be<lb break="no"/>observed for that very reason. But at <lb/>
the same time let us not forget that, <lb/>
if I am correctly informed, the rights <lb/>
of the minority in Ontario to-day are <lb/>
greater than they were at the time of <lb/>
confederation in respect of separate schools. <lb/>
That does not look like any desire or in<lb break="no"/>tention to coerce. Is there any oppression <lb/>
of the minority in Nova Scotia, New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick or Prince Edward Island? I can <lb/>
speak best for my own province, and I do <lb/>
not know that such question very <lb/>
much agitates its people. There is <lb/>
a modus vivendi, an understanding, an <lb/>
arrangement arrived at. Let no man <lb/>
suppose that I do not respect the at<lb break="no"/>titude of Catholics with regard to this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. No one can for a moment fail to rea<lb break="no"/>lize the position, so far as they are con<lb break="no"/>cerned. They say: It is a matter of our <lb/>
faith that our children should be under <lb/>
instructors of their own faith, that they <lb/>
should receive religious instruction at school; <lb/>
and so strongly do we adhere to that prin<lb break="no"/>ciple that we would rather pay the state tax <lb/>
and also support our own schools than sub<lb break="no"/>mit to any other system. I find no fault with <lb/>
that view. I only desire that such matters <lb/>
should be left to the people of the respec<lb break="no"/><cb/>
     <fw type="num">2976</fw>tive provinces and not be placed in the wide<lb/>
area of Dominion politics. Is there any<lb/>
reason to mistrust the people of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories? Are they disposed to be <lb/>
less generous than the people of Nova <lb/>
Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward <lb/>
Island? What does my right hon. friend <lb/>
himself say on that question? I have
al<lb break="no"/>ready pointed out what he has said with <lb/>
regard to the use of the French language <lb/>
as an official language of the Northwest <lb/>
of Canada. He was ready to trust that to <lb/>
the good sense of the people to their instinct <lb/>
of justice and fair play, and I venture to <lb/>
think to-day that if this question had not <lb/>
been hurled into the political arena by the <lb/>
right hon. gentleman, there would never
<lb/>
have been the slightest hesitation in the <lb/>
Northwest of Canada about continuing <lb/>
those privileges to the Catholics which they <lb/>
now enjoy. One of my hon. friends on the <lb/>
other side smiles at the idea.
Well, he is <lb/>
at liberty to enjoy his own opinion; but
I <lb/>
venture to say that there is no reason why <lb/>
we should suspect the honesty, good faith <lb/>
and fair play of these people. I have never <lb/>
heard very much complaint in my own pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and while I respect the people of that <lb/>
province as highly as those of any other <lb/>
in Canada—although they did not treat me <lb/>
very well at the last election—I am not dis<lb break="no"/>posed to admit that there would be in the <lb/>
Northwest less generosity, less fair play, <lb/>
less sense of what is right and due to the <lb/>
minority than there is in the province of <lb/>
Nova Scotia. W'hat did my right hon. friend <lb/>
himself say on this question? May I not <lb/>
appeal from the Sir Wilfrid Laurier of to<lb break="no"/>day to the plain Wilfrid Laurier of years <lb/>
ago? He said in 1890 :-<lb/>
            </p>

<p>Well, my hon. friend may smile at my <lb/>
words, but he will surely admit that his<lb/>

further on the Prime Minister says:<lb/></p>

<p>Sir, we are always ready and willing to 
     <lb/>
     acknowledge the sense of justice, the sense 
     <lb/>
     of what is right, which exists in the bosoms 
     <lb/>
     of the French-speaking citizens of Canada. 
     <lb/>
     But may I not, on behalf of my fellow 
     <lb/>
     countrymen in the Northwest of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     claim that they are animated by as just a 
     <lb/>
     spirit of what is right and fair ? If the 
     <lb/>
     record is good in one case, it seems to me 
     <lb/>
     that some consideration at least should be 
     <lb/>
     given it in the other. I can appeal to the 
     <lb/>
     Postmaster General (Sir William Mulock), 
     <lb/>
     because I have in my hand an expression 
     <lb/>
     of similar sentiments uttered by him.

            <p>Mr. Speaker, education was assigned to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces. Let any necessary agitation 
     <lb/>
     in respect to education, in respect to the 
     <lb/>
     rights and powers of legislatures with re<lb break="no"/>gard to education, be confined to provincial 
     <lb/>
     limits. That is the true solution of the 
     <lb/>
     question. Let the Dominion interfere 
     <lb/>
     and the agitation will be widespread. My 
     <lb/>
     proposition is to let the people settle the 
     <lb/>
     question for themselves, and the agitation 
     <lb/>
     if any—and I do not believe there will be 
     <lb/>
     any considerable agitation—will be confined 
     <lb/>
     within narrow limits, and, in the end, will 
     <lb/>
     be settled by some reasonable compromise, 
     <lb/>
     because, after all, we can always safely 
     <lb/>
     trust to the good sense of the people in 
     <lb/>
     this regard. As I said before, I firmly be<lb break="no"/>lieve that if this question had been left to 
     <lb/>
     the people of the new provinces, they would 
     <lb/>
     have dealt, and they will deal, fairly with 
     <lb/>
     the minority. But we must not oppress or 
     <lb/>
     coerce any part of the people to provide 
     <lb/>
     safeguards that have not a warrant in the 
     <lb/>
     constitution. The constitution of Canada 
     <lb/>
     does not always protect minorities by any 
     <lb/>
     definite safeguards. There are nearly 50,<lb break="no"/>000 Nova Scotian electors who, at the last 
     <lb/>
     general election, voted for Conservative or 
     <lb/>
     independent candidates, and about 55,000 
     <lb/>
     or 56.000 who voted for candidates support<lb break="no"/>ing the government. There are today in par<lb break="no"/>liament 18 men representing the 55,000 or 
     <lb/>
     50,000 electors, and the 50,000 men who voted 
     <lb/>
      
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2978</fw>
      
     for other candidates have not one single 
     <lb/>
     representative in parliament. What about 
     <lb/>
     the rights of that minority? Have these 
     <lb/>
     rights been safeguarded? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. Oh, oh.

            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. Have they been <lb/> safeguarded in the
                  sense which hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>men intend by this Bill? It is true that
                  <lb/> in one sense the eighteen men who have been <lb/> elected represent the
                  whole people of Nova <lb/> Scotia ; but in another sense these 50,000 <lb/>
                  electors to whom I refer have no repre<lb break="no"/>sentative in this
                  parliament, <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>One further word I would like to say and 
     <lb/>
     it is this: That restrictions of this char<lb break="no"/>acter imposed upon the majority for the 
     <lb/>
     benefit of the minority do not always work 
     <lb/>
     out in the way intended. For example 
     <lb/>
     subsection 3 of section 93 of the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act provides: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">

     <lb/>

            <p>If the people of Nova Scotia, or New

     by law, they would at once bring them<lb break="no"/>selves within the purview of Dominion inter<lb break="no"/>ference. Because, it is not only from any 
     <lb/>
     act or decision prejudicially affecting these 
     <lb/>
     rights established before confederation that 
     <lb/>
     the appeal would lie, but from any act or 
     <lb/>
     decision of a provincial authority in any 
     <lb/>
     wise affecting such rights or privileges 
     <lb/>
     that the appeal will lie. And the very fact 
     <lb/>
     that there is a restriction of that kind may 
     <lb/>
     possibly act as a deterrent in these three 
     <lb/>
     provinces to which I have called attention. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Now, Mr. Speaker, I apologize for having 
     <lb/>
     so long detained the House; I had hoped 
     <lb/>
     to conclude in a very much shorter time. 
     <lb/>
     I trust that I shall not be misunderstood 
     <lb/>
     by any of my fellow-countrymen with regard 
     <lb/>
     to the position II have taken in this matter. 
     <lb/>
     I base my case and my contention upon 
     <lb/>
     the terms of the constitution. I do not 
     <lb/>
     argue against separate schools ; I do not 
     <lb/>
     argue for separate schools. It is not for 
     <lb/>
     me to determine that question for the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Northwest; it is for the people 
     <lb/>
     of the Northwest, under the terms of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution, to determine that matter for 
     <lb/>
     themselves. I shall always endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     respect the opinions of my fellow-country<lb break="no"/>men, of whatever race and of whatever 
     <lb/>
     creed. But I do not think it is wise to 
     <lb/>
     attempt to step outside of the limits of the 
     <lb/>
     constitution to provide remedies which 
     <lb/>
     have no warrant within the terms of our 
     <lb/>
     national charter. The battle cry of hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen opposite in 1896 was 'Hands off 
     <lb/>

     a perfectly constitutional power, should ring 
     <lb/>
     to-day in thunder tones in the ears of those 
     <lb/>

     to the House what action I shall take at

     <lb/>
     Bill withholds from the new provinces any 
     <lb/>rights to which I think they are justly 
     <lb/>entitled under the terms of the constitution, 
     <lb/>I am not in favour of it. I shall, therefore, 
     <lb/>adapt a course which has in the past been 
     <lb/>adopted by hon. gentlemen opposite on more 
     <lb/>than one occasion, a course for which there 
     <lb/>is ample precedent, both in the parliament

                  placed on the <lb/> order paper on a subsequent day, and it will <lb/> go to
                  committee with the opinion of this <lb/> House in favour of the principle which I
                  <lb/> have advocated. That is the position which <lb/> I think I ought to assume
                  under the circum<lb break="no"/>stances ; at all events, that is the position
                  <lb/> which I do assume, and by which I am <lb/> prepared to stand. <lb/>

                  Mr. Speaker, I do not quite under<lb break="no"/>stand the procedure under which
                  my hon. <lb/>
                  <!--<p>Mr. R. L. BORDEN. 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
                  <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2980</fw> friend the leader of the opposition has pro<lb break="no"/>posed this
                  amendment and, so far as I do <lb/> understand it, I do not agree with him as
                  <lb/> to the effect which it may have upon the <lb/> measure that is now before
                  the House. The <lb/> motion now before the House is that this <lb/> Bill be now
                  read a second time. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. ' Be now read.' <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. That is the motion <lb/> which has been placed
                  in your hands. The <lb/> motion is that this Bill be read a second <lb/> time. My
                  hon. friend moves to strike out <lb/> all the words after 'that,' and express a
                  <lb/> pious opinion on one portion of the Bill. <lb/> It seems to me that after
                  you have struck <lb/> out all the words of the motion that the Bill <lb/> be now
                  read a second time, there is no Bill <lb/> left. It is certainly not the usual
                  method <lb/> whereby anybody moves an amendment. <lb/> If an hon. member regards
                  the main pur<lb break="no"/>pose of a Bill—whatever he may be pleased <lb/> to
                  consider its main purpose—with favour <lb/> and disapproves of some minor part of
                  it, <lb/> his obvious duty is to support the second <lb/> reading of that Bill,
                  and when in committee <lb/> we reach the clause to which he objects, <lb/> then is
                  the proper moment to move that that <lb/> clause be struck out and something else
                  be <lb/> substituted. 1 think the method of my hon. <lb/> friend is a mistaken one
                  ; however, I do <lb/> not attach much importance to that, and <lb/> I prefer to
                  proceed with the discussion. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>I need hardly say, Sir, that I do not rise 
     <lb/>
     for the purpose of following my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     in the very lengthy argument, he has ad<lb break="no"/>dressed to this House on what he is pleased 
     <lb/>
     to regard as the constitutional questions in<lb break="no"/>volved in the consideration of this measure. 
     <lb/>
     If I felt, as he appears to feel, that the con<lb break="no"/>stitutional questions involved are the over<lb break="no"/>shadowing questions, I need hardly say that 
     <lb/>
     I would not presume to address the House 
     <lb/>
     at this moment, but I would leave the ques<lb break="no"/>tion to be dealt with by hon. members of 
     <lb/>
     the legal profession, who are supposed to 
     <lb/>
     understand such matters better than those 
     <lb/>
     of us who are laymen. But it is because I 
     <lb/>
     do not agree with my hon. friend that the 
     <lb/>
     constitutional question is the overshadow<lb break="no"/>ing question that I venture to discuss the 
     <lb/>
     matter at the present stage. I do not be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the people of Canada will consent 
     <lb/>
     that any one of us shall shelter himself be<lb break="no"/>hind the fence of an alleged constitutional 
     <lb/>
     question. This school question is a vexed 
     <lb/>
     question, a troublesome question. We can 
     <lb/>
     all say with the fullest sincerity that it is 
     <lb/>
     a misfortune that we have to deal with it. 
     <lb/>
     But once we have it here, my belief is that 
     <lb/>
     our constituents, the people of Canada, will 
     <lb/>
     expect us not to evade it, but to meet it 
     <lb/>
     fairly, boldly, to discuss it openly, discuss 
     <lb/>
     it in a generous spirit, and endeavour to 
     <lb/>
     find some solution of the difficult problem. 
     <lb/>
     I do not agree with my hon. friend that we 
     <lb/>
     are not called upon to discuss the question 
     <lb/>
     of separate schools or common schools. I 
     <lb/>
     believe that the people of the Dominion to<lb break="no"/>day are not occupying their minds with an 
     <lb/>
     elaborate analysis of constitutional questions 
     <lb/>
            
            <pb n="2981" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-22_Page_2981.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">2981</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 22, 1905</fw> 
           
     which nine out of ten of them will never 
     <lb/>
     read, and which the whole ten will fail to 
     <lb/>
     understand. I believe that the people of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, since this unpleasant question is 
     <lb/>
     brought before us, will expect us to meet 
     <lb/>
     it plainly and openly, and discuss it with the 
     <lb/>
     hope of finding a happy solution. So I put 
     <lb/>
     aside the constitutional question, not for a 
     <lb/>
     moment under-valuing it--<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. The right hon. <lb/> Prime Minister did not
                  put it aside. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The Prime Minister did <lb/> not discuss it in
                  the sense that was attri<lb break="no"/>buted to him by the hon. gentleman. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p>Some hon. MEMBERS. No. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I do not propose to go <lb/> into that
                  constitutional question, not be<lb break="no"/>cause I say it should not receive
                  any con<lb break="no"/>sideration, but because I say it is not the <lb/> great
                  question involved, and I prefer to go <lb/> on and deal with the practical
                  questions <lb/> which are before us. If it is a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional
                  question above all others, then, per<lb break="no"/>haps the best thing we can do
                  will be to <lb/> request the legal members of this House <lb/> to adjourn to the
                  Railway Committee room <lb/> and thresh it out, while we who have not <lb/> the
                  good fortune to belong to that learned <lb/> profession will stay down here and
                  discuss <lb/> the practical questions involved, or proceed <lb/> with the ordinary
                  business of the House. <lb/> But, if it is the case that there are ques<lb break="no"/>tions other than the constitutional question <lb/> and greater than
                  the constitutional question <lb/> involved, these are the matters that I may <lb/>
                  venture to proceed to discuss before <lb/> this House. Now. the first question to
                  be <lb/> considered. only for a moment, because, <lb/> happily, there is no
                  division of opinion upon <lb/> it, is whether or not the time has come <lb/> when
                  we shall give a provincial con<lb break="no"/>stitution to these new Territories
                  in <lb/> the west. Happily, I say, there is no differ<lb break="no"/>ence of
                  opinion on that. It is now thirty- <lb break="yes"/> five years since these lands
                  were acquired <lb/> and brought under the control of the Can<lb break="no"/>adian
                  authorities. From the beginning, <lb/> governments and legislatures have gone on
                  <lb/> preparing the people for the work of self- <lb break="yes"/> government. At
                  an early stage the province <lb/> of Manitoba was carved out and set up in <lb/>
                  housekeeping. At a later stage the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories were
                  given another form <lb/> of organization. That form was developed <lb/> from time
                  to time and at this moment they <lb/> have in the Northwest Territories a very
                  <lb/> considerable measure of self-government, <lb/> but inasmuch as it falls
                  short of the ordin<lb break="no"/>ary powers, privileges and authority of a <lb/>
                  province, we all agree that the time has come <lb/> when we shall give a
                  provincial constitution <lb/> to the people who inhabit those lands. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>Then, we come to the question whether 
     <lb/>
     these Territories shall come under the oper<lb break="no"/>ation of one government, as at present, or 
     <lb/>
     whether they shall be divided into two or 
     <lb/>
    
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2982</fw>
           
     more provinces. There is not much dis<lb break="no"/>pute on that point, happily. I think my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend the leader of the opposition had 
     <lb/>
     previously entertained the view that one 
     <lb/>
     province was sufficient. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I never expressed <lb/> any opinion on the
                  subject. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I think some opinions <lb/> have come from the
                  other side of the House <lb/> on that point. However, I am not saying <lb/> that
                  for the purpose of arguing it but I am <lb/> only mentioning it incidentally. When
                  we <lb/> consider the question of the population of <lb/> the Northwest
                  Territories to-day we can <lb/> readily agree that the population of the <lb/>
                  Territories is not too much for one pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The population in
                  the Territories <lb/> to-day is about the same as the population <lb/> of one of
                  our smaller provinces, or of the <lb/> greatest of the maritime provinces. But,
                  <lb/> we are well aware of the fact that the po<lb break="no"/>pulation of the
                  Territories will increase <lb/> very rapidly, and inasmuch as there is a <lb/>
                  vast area of land to be occupied it has <lb/> been deemed wise to divide the
                  Territories <lb/> into two portions and establish a separate <lb/> government for
                  each. There may be some <lb/> difference of opinion on that point. but it is <lb/>
                  not a very serious difference and we may <lb/> say that we are happily agreed that
                  there <lb/> shall be two provinces. <lb/>
               </p>

            <p>The next question to which we come is 
     <lb/>
     the question as to what shall be done with 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion lands. My hon. friend, (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     R. L. Borden) in the small portion of 
     <lb/>
     his speech in which he did not deal 
     <lb/>
     with the constitutional question, devoted 
     <lb/>
     himself to the question of Dominion 
     <lb/>
     lands. We have provided in this Bill 
     <lb/>
     that the Dominion lands shall be re<lb break="no"/>tained by the Dominion. My hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     takes very strong ground in favour of these 
     <lb/>
     lands being given over to the provinces. He 
     <lb/>
     argues that inasmuch as by the British 
     <lb/>
     North America Act the lands were left to 
     <lb/>
     the possession of the original provinces we 
     <lb/>
     should apply the same principle and leave 
     <lb/>
     these lands to the new provinces of Alberta 
     <lb/>
     and Saskatchewan. That argument is by 
     <lb/>
     no means conclusive. We know that there 
     <lb/>
     are strong reasons why these lands should 
     <lb/>
     be retained within the control of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion. We have not the slightest doubt 
     <lb/>
     that during the development of the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories it is a wise provision that 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion and not the provinces should 
     <lb/>
     retain the management and control of the 
     <lb/>
     public lands. My hon. friend can see no 
     <lb/>
     reason why a distinction should be made 
     <lb/>
     between our dealing with the land question 
     <lb/>
     in the case of the Northwest Territories and 
     <lb/>
     dealing with the land question in the case 
     <lb/>
     of the older provinces. Let me say to my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend that we think there are strong 
     <lb/>
     reasons. The question of immigration is 
     <lb/>
     one which is properly assigned to the Do<lb break="no"/>minion government. The question of immi<lb break="no"/><pb n="2983" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-22_Page_2983.jpg"/>
            <fw type="num">2983</fw>  gration and the question of the settlement 
     <lb/>
     of the public lands are closely associated. 
     <lb/>
     In most of the older provinces the amount 
     <lb/>
     of available land is not very great ; at all 
     <lb/>
     events the land which is likely to attract 
     <lb/>
     settlers immediately is not very great—not 
     <lb/>
     so great as it is in the far west. Then, if 
     <lb/>
     we expect population to flow rapidly into 
     <lb/>
     the west, if we are to control the immigra<lb break="no"/>tion policy, if we are to be able to 
     <lb/>
     carry out that vigorous policy which during 
     <lb/>
     the past few years has been converting that 
     <lb/>
     land into busy hives of industry in many 
     <lb/>
     sections, if, I say, we are to be able to 
     <lb/>
     carry on that vigorous policy which has 
     <lb/>
     built up the Northwest Territories in the 
     <lb/>
     last eight years, it is necessary that there 
     <lb/>
     shall be a retention of those lands in the 
     <lb/>
     hands of the Dominion government. But, 
     <lb/>
     if we make a mistake at this point we, at 
     <lb/>
     all events, have the comfort of knowing 
     <lb/>
     that we err in good company, in company 
     <lb/>
     which my hon. friends opposite will be 
     <lb/>
     bound to consider very good company. My 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend did not note the fact that when 
     <lb/>
     the province of Manitoba was created, just 
     <lb/>
     as we are to-day creating these two pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the 
     <lb/>
     land question was considered and that for 
     <lb/>
     the very reasons which I have ventured to 
     <lb/>
     advance to-night the government of Sir 
     <lb/>
     John Macdonald decided that it would not 
     <lb/>
     be wise to give the province of Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     control of its own lands. If for good and 
     <lb/>
     sufficient reasons, the same reasons as those 
     <lb/>
     which have been advanced by this govern<lb break="no"/>ment, it was deemed well that in the case 
     <lb/>
     of the province of Manitoba, the lands 
     <lb/>
     should remain under the control of the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, why is it not an equally sound argu<lb break="no"/>ment to-day to say that the lands in the 
     <lb/>
     case of these new provinces of Alberta and 
     <lb/>
     Saskatchewan shall remain in the hands of 
     <lb/>
     the Dominion? But, that did not settle 
     <lb/>
     the question. After the lapse of some 
     <lb/>
     years the province of Manitoba revived the 
     <lb/>
     question. The province of Manitoba ad<lb break="no"/>vanced the very reasons which my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend has advanced in favour of having 
     <lb/>
    control of these lands. They were not con<lb break="no"/>tent to rest under the constitution which 
     <lb/>had been given to them. They came to 
     <lb/>Ottawa and they asked the government, 
     <lb/>on more than one occasion if I am 
     <lb/>not mistaken, to change that provision of 
     <lb/>the constitution and to give the province of 
     <lb/>Manitoba control of the lands. I have in 
     <lb/>my hand the decision of the government of 
     <lb/>Sir John Macdonald in the usual form of a 
     <lb/>certified copy of a report of a committee 
     <lb/>of the honourable the Privy Council ap<lb break="no"/>proved by His Excellency the Governor 
     <lb/>General in Council on the 22nd May, 1884. 
     <lb/>The memorandum says :

     the following conclusion :

            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>The lands of Manitoba hold a very different 
     <lb/>
     position in relation to the Dominion govern<lb break="no"/>ment from the lands of the other provinces. 
     <lb/>
     Shortly after the union of the old provinces,

     the governent formed from that union pur<lb break="no"/>chased at a large price in cash, all the rights,

     The great attraction which the Canadian gov<lb break="no"/>ernment now offers, the impressive fact to the

     that a well known and recognized government

            <p>And so against the contention of my

     hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) to-day 
     <lb/>
     that it is a wise policy to surrender these 
     <lb/>
     lands to the local authorities we have the 
     <lb/>
     deliberate conclusion of the Dominion gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of earlier days, the government of 
     <lb/>
     that distinguished statesman, whose name 
     <lb/>
     is always so warmly honoured by hon. gen[tle]<lb break="no"/>men on the other side, we have the decision 
     <lb/>
     of Sir John Macdonald at the time of the 
     <lb/>
     creation of the province of Manitoba and 
     <lb/>
     afterwards when the question was revived 
     <lb/>
     by the provincial government, we have the 
     <lb/>
     decision of that eminent statesman that in 
     <lb/>
     the true interests of this Dominion the 
     <lb/>
     lands of Manitoba and the Northwest should 
     <lb/>
     remain under the control of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Next, Sir, we may come briefly to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the financial arrangements. At the 
     <lb/>
     time of confederation it was agreed that the 
     <lb/>
     various provinces which form the union 
     <lb/>
     should surrender their customs and excise 
     <lb/>
     duties to the common treasury at Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     But they required as a condition of confeder<lb break="no"/>ation that some portion of these moneys 
     <lb/>
     should be returned to the provinces to assist 
     <lb/>
     in the maintenance of the provincial govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and thus there was established the 
     <lb/>
     system of provincial subsidies. The princi<lb break="no"/>ples governing the distribution of money to 
     <lb/>
     the provinces are pretty well laid down. As 
     <lb/>
     the first step we give a certain fixed sum, 
     <lb/>
     having due regard to the responsibilities 
     <lb/>
     of the various provinces, in the way of 
     <lb/>
     allowance for government. Then there is a 
     <lb/>
     sum of 80 cents per head on the population, 
     <lb/>
     and finally there is an adjustment of the 
     <lb/>
     debt account whereby in some cases 
     <lb/>
     an allowance is made to the province in the 
     <lb/>
     form of interest on a public debt which that 
     <lb/>
     province might owe but which in the par<lb break="no"/>ticular case does not happen to exist. So 
     <lb/>
     far the principles under which these sub<lb break="no"/>sidies and aids to provinces may be granted 
     <lb/>
     are pretty well understood, and they are 
     <lb/>
     applied in this case to the new provinces to 
     <lb/>
     be created, taking an estimated population 
     <lb/>
     which is probably a fair and liberal one 
     <lb/>
     upon which they shall receive the sums set 
     <lb/>
     down in the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>One other financial question remains and 
     <lb/>
     it is one which arises out of the retention 
     <lb/>
     of the lands by the Dominion government. 
     <lb/>
     Since we have allowed the other provinces 
     <lb/>
     to retain the lands, and since they have 
     <lb/>
     them as a source of revenue, and since in 
     <lb/>
     the case of the Northwest Provinces we 
     <lb/>
     withhold the lands from them and they are 
     <lb/>
     deprived of that source of revenue, it fol<lb break="no"/>lows that we must make some allowance to 
     <lb/>
     them. and it will be admitted that we should 
     <lb/>
     make a reasonable and generous allowance. 
     <lb/>
     1 have seen comparisons made in criticism 
     <lb/>
     of this measure between the sums which 
     <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2986</fw>
           
     will be received by these provinces in the 
     <lb/>
     west from the Dominion treasury and the 
     <lb/>
     sums which are received by some of the 
     <lb/>
     other provinces. I have seen a comparison 
     <lb/>
     made in the case of my own province par<lb break="no"/>ticularly. Comparisons of that nature are 
     <lb/>
     very unfair and may easily be misleading. 
     <lb/>
     If I turn to the latest returns which I have 
     <lb/>
     at hand 1 find that in the case of Ontario 
     <lb/>
     the province receives about $1,500,000 a 
     <lb/>
     year of revenue from its lands. The 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Provinces will receive nothing 
     <lb/>
     to correspond with that and therefore we 
     <lb/>
     must make a liberal allowance to them. 
     <lb/>
     Quebec receives about $1,300,000 per annum, 
     <lb/>
     according to a recent report, in the way of 
     <lb/>
     revenue from lands, forests and minerals. 
     <lb/>
     My own province, Nova Scotia, received last 
     <lb/>
     year over $600,000 from its lands, mines and 
     <lb/>
     minerals. We deprive the new provinces in 
     <lb/>
     the west of these sources of revenue, and 
     <lb/>
     of course we should make up the sum to 
     <lb/>
     them by liberal allowances. I do not think 
     <lb/>
     that, on the whole, we can complain much of 
     <lb/>
     the financial terms. It may be that when we 
     <lb/>
     come to deal with the Bill in committee 
     <lb/>
     seine questions may arise that may require 
     <lb/>
     further consideration. but speaking gener<lb break="no"/>ally I think the most that can be said about 
     <lb/>
     the financial terms is that they are liberal<lb break="no"/>and I am sure that on both sides of the 
     <lb/>
     House we would desire to be liberal as 
     <lb/>
     respects these two provinces which will 
     <lb/>
     have a large territory and will begin with 
     <lb/>
     a comparatively sparse population. We all 
     <lb/>
     realize that a population scattered over a 
     <lb/>
     wide territory requires man for man more 
     <lb/>
     money for the expenses of government than 
     <lb/>
     a population which is closely settled to<lb break="no"/>gether. I think therefore on the whole, 
     <lb/>
     reserving any discussion of details until we 
     <lb/>
     go into committee on the Bill, that the 
     <lb/>
     terms are liberal to these two provinces, 
     <lb/>
     they are generous. but not more generous 
     <lb/>
     than hon. gentlemen on both sides would 
     <lb/>
     desire we should make them.
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>But I know that all these questions, im<lb break="no"/>portant though they may be, are over<lb break="no"/>shadowed in the public mind by this great 
     <lb/>
     question of education. I believe that to—day 
     <lb/>
     most of the people of Canada are not think<lb break="no"/>ing very much about the financial terms, the 
     <lb/>
     lands or anything of that sort, but they are 
     <lb/>
     very must disturbed in many quarters in 
     <lb/>
     consequence of reports that have gone 
     <lb/>
     abroad as to the nature and effect of the 
     <lb/>
     resolutions proposed in relation to the public 
     <lb/>
     schools. Now this belongs to a class of ques<lb break="no"/>tions that at any time should be approached 
     <lb/>
     with all possible deliberation, especially in a 
     <lb/>
     country like Canada. with our diversity of 
     <lb/>
     race and creed. He would be a rash man 
     <lb/>
     who would plunge into a discussion of this 
     <lb/>
     question without a disposition to be consid<lb break="no"/>erate with regard not only to the opinions 
     <lb/>
     and convictions. but possibly even to the 
     <lb/>
     prejudices of his fellow men. It is in that 
     <lb/>
     spirit that we should approach the question. 
     <lb/>

     We should be prepared to listen to all that 
     <lb/>
     may be said and to make an honest effort 
     <lb/>
     to meet the views of those who differ from 
     <lb/>
     us in opinion. We should aim as far as 
     <lb/>
     possible to have a system brought 
     <lb/>
     about which would come as nearly as 
     <lb/>
     possible to our own particular views : yet 
     <lb/>
     surely each of us must realize that if we are 
     <lb/>
     to carry on the government of the country 
     <lb/>
     we must not insist on our individual views, 
     <lb/>
     but must try to meet the views of those who 
     <lb/>
     may differ from us, must try to find common 
     <lb/>
     ground of action. For myself I do not like 
     <lb/>
     the principle of separate schools. I regret 
     <lb/>
     that such a large number of my fellow 
     <lb/>
     citizens in Canada are obliged to take the 
     <lb/>
     view, conscientiously as they say and as I 
     <lb/>
     believe, that they cannot support a system 
     <lb/>
     of free common schools. I think it would be 
     <lb/>
     a great thing for our country if in the 
     <lb/>
     growth that is now coming so rapidly upon 
     <lb/>
     us, our children of all races and sections and 
     <lb/>
     creeds could meet from day to day and 
     <lb/>
     mingle together in work and in play, in the 
     <lb/>
     school room and on the play-ground, and if 
     <lb/>
     we could happily agree upon such a policy it 
     <lb/>
     would do much for the grander upbuilding 
     <lb/>
     of the country of which we are so proud. I 
     <lb/>
     say unhesitatingly that if 1 were to have my 
     <lb/>
     own way only, if one could afford to insist 
     <lb/>
     that his opinion must prevail regardless of 
     <lb/>
    the wishes of his brethren, I would like 
     <lb/>to see a school law which did not call for 
     <lb/>this word 'separate.' But we must take 
     <lb/>things as they are. We have to recognize 
     <lb/>the fact that forty one per cent of the people 
     <lb/>of this Dominion do not think as I think 
     <lb/>on that question ; do not think as the 
     <lb/>majority of Protestants think. What then ? 
     <lb/>Shall we say that they are in the minority 
     <lb/>and that therefore we shall have no regard 
     <lb/>for them ? Shall we say that they are but 
     <lb/>forty-one per cent and we are fifty-nine per 
     <lb/>cent, and therefore, we will be indifferent to 
     <lb/>them ? No, Mr. Speaker, you cannot govern 
     <lb/>Canada by any such rule as that. Let us 
     <lb/>remember that the Roman Catholics are 
     <lb/>not in a minority everywhere ; there is 
     <lb/>one great province in which our Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic brethren are in the majority, 
     <lb/>overwhelmingly in the majority. Suppose 
     <lb/>we insisted upon this doctrine of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights right down to the last point 
     <lb/>as was argued to-night, what would be the 
     <lb/>condition of our Protestant brethren in 
     <lb/>the province of Quebec ? Suppose that un<lb break="no"/>der the sacred name of provincial rights 
     <lb/>an effort were made to do away with the 
     <lb/>separate school system and with the rights 
     <lb/>of the minority in the province of Quebec, 
     <lb/>what would we find ? We would find the 
     <lb/>table of this House and the table of the 
     <lb/>greater parliament at Westminster—because 
     <lb/>the law would have to pass the imperial 
     <lb/>parliament—we would find the table of this 
     <lb/>parliament and the table of the imperial 
     <lb/>parliament loaded down with petitions, not 
     <lb/>of the character of so many that come to 
     <lb/>
         
            <!--<p>Mr. FIELDING. 
     <lb/>
            </p>-->
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">2988</fw>
            
     us now insisting upon the doctrine of pro<lb break="no"/>vincial rights, but with petitions demanding 
     <lb/>
     that the name of provincial rights should not 
     <lb/>
     be used for such a purpose, demanding 
     <lb/>
     that the majority should not have the right 
     <lb/>
     to control, demanding that the rights of the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority in the province of Que<lb break="no"/>bec should prevail instead of the wish of 
     <lb/>
     the majority. Let us not forget that, as 
     <lb/>
     my hon. friend the Prime Minister has 
     <lb/>
     shown, in preparing the constitution of con<lb break="no"/>federation, the strongest advocates of separ<lb break="no"/>ate schools were the representatives of the 
     <lb/>
     Protestant minority in Quebec. And, Sir, 
     <lb/>
     if it was necessary then to make an ar<lb break="no"/>rangement to protect the minority in that 
     <lb/>
     province, is it a dreadful thing that the mi<lb break="no"/>nority elsewhere should ask to receive con<lb break="no"/>sideration ? I venture to say that in the 
     <lb/>
     minds of the Protestants of Quebec that 
     <lb/>
     thought will sink deep to-day, and that they 
     <lb/>
     will be influenced by the Golden Rule ; 'Do 
     <lb/>
     unto others as you would have others do 
     <lb/>
     unto you.' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>There are three great lines of thought to<lb break="no"/>day on the question of public education. 
     <lb/>
     One, held by a great many people, is that 
     <lb/>
     the secular system of education is the only 
     <lb/>
     system which we should have in the public 
     <lb/>
     schools. There are many people, altogether 
     <lb/>
     Protestants I think, who claim that it is 
     <lb/>
     useless to introduce anything like religion 
     <lb/>
     into the schools, and that all we can do is 
     <lb/>
     to devote ourselves to secular education. 
     <lb/>
     The second line of thought is that which is 
     <lb/>
     held by a large number of the advocates 
     <lb/>
     of what may be called national schools. 
     <lb/>
     These people think that with secular edu<lb break="no"/>cation you may associate a certain degree 
     <lb/>
     of what may be properly called religious 
     <lb/>
     instruction ; that you may say to the 
     <lb/>
     teacher : thou shalt not teach the 'isms' 
     <lb/>
     of any denomination, but you may and you 
     <lb/>
     should—in the words of the Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     school law-<lb/>
            </p>

            <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">inculcate by precept and example a respect 
     <lb/>

     temperance and all other virtues.

            </quote>
   
            <p>Well, Mr. Speaker, if under a system of 
     <lb/>
     public schools the teacher by precept and 
     <lb/>
     example inculcates those virtues, I do 
     <lb/>
     not know whether all will call it religion, 
     <lb/>
     but in my view the pupils of those schools 
     <lb/>
     will receive a very considerable amount or 
     <lb/>
     the very best kind of religion. However that 
     <lb/>
     may be, many think that it is quite possible 
     <lb/>
     to associate with secular instruction a cer<lb break="no"/>tain amount of instruction—you may call 
     <lb/>
     it moral instruction if you like or you may 
     <lb/>
     call it religious instruction—and an effort 
     <lb/>
     is made in some provinces of the Dominion 
     <lb/>
     to do that. The citation I have made is 
     <lb/>
     from the Nova Scotia school law and I 
     <lb/>
     think it will be found to be substantially 
     <lb/>

     the same in the law and regulations of the 
     <lb/>
     other maritime provinces. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Then we come to the third line of thought. 
     <lb/>
     It is that which is held by our Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic fellow-citizens, it is also held 
     <lb/>
     by many Protestants, and it is: that you 
     <lb/>
     cannot have education and religion separ<lb break="no"/>ated. A great writer has expressed the

            <p>Our Roman Catholic brethren attach more 
     <lb/>
     importance than our Protestant friends as 
     <lb/>
     a rule do (though many Protestants agree 
     <lb/>
     with them) to this question of religious edu<lb break="no"/>cation. They say that with them it is a 
     <lb/>
     matter of conscience; they say they must 
     <lb/>
     have their children taught by persons of their 
     <lb/>
     own faith who can give instructions in their 
     <lb/>
     own creed, and they would be very much 
     <lb/>
     pleased if we could adopt their views. They 
     <lb/>
     say—and who shall contend that there is 
     <lb/>
     not much truth in their assertion—they say 
     <lb/>
     that you cannot rely upon children receiving 
     <lb/>
     proper religious instruction in the home. I 
     <lb/>
     fear there is something in that statement ; 
     <lb/>
     a little more to—day than there was in the 
     <lb/>
     good old times. Who shall say that to-day 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction receives as much at<lb break="no"/>tention in the homes of Canada as it did in 
     <lb/>
     the days of our grandparents ? We are liv<lb break="no"/>ing in a very rapid age, and I am afraid 
     <lb/>
     there is some room for the contention of 
     <lb/>
     our Roman Catholic brethren that religion 
     <lb/>
     will not be taught to the children of Canada 
     <lb/>
     unless the foundation of it is given to them 
     <lb/>
     in the schools. We who form the Protest<lb break="no"/>ant majority may not be able to agree with 
     <lb/>
     them on that point, but it is not because 
     <lb/>
     we object to religious instruction ; most of 
     <lb/>
     us I think, would be pleased that our child<lb break="no"/>ren should receive some measure of relig<lb break="no"/>ious instruction in the schools ; but the trou<lb break="no"/>ble is that you cannot unite the people of 
     <lb/>
     any community in an agreement as to what 
     <lb/>
     is religion. Religion to many is creed and 
     <lb/>
     dogma and there will be differences of creed 
     <lb/>
     and dogma, and inasmuch as it is not pos<lb break="no"/>sible to bring the people of a community to 
     <lb/>
     a common line of thought and action on 
     <lb/>
     that subject, we who form the Protestant 
     <lb/>
     majority say that we see difficulty in teach<lb break="no"/>ing any special form of religion in the 
     <lb/>
     schools. But while we may not agree with 
     <lb/>
     our Roman Catholic brethren on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion. we. I think, can agree that their view 
     <lb/>
     of the matter~that is as to the need of 
     <lb/>
     religious instruction in the schools—is en<lb break="no"/>titled to our profound respect, and that it 
     <lb/>
     is held to-day, not by Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     only, but to a very large extent also by 
     <lb/>
     Protestants. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>It is argued by some persons that we 
     <lb/>
     cannot make any change in the conditions

     friend the First Minister has not declared

     that it is not within the power of this par<lb break="no"/>liament to make a change. He has not 
     <lb/>
     declared that there is any legal or binding

     obligation resting on the parliament of Can<lb break="no"/>ada to reenact the clauses of the Act of 1875.

<p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. I think the First Minis<lb break="no"/>ter
                  expressly claimed that it was binding. <lb/></p>
<p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The point of difference <lb/> is this. The
                  First Minister does not, as I <lb/> understand it, deny the absolute right and
                  <lb/> freedom of every member of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to vote on this
                  question as his con<lb break="no"/>science and intelligence shall direct him.
                  <lb/> I, at all events, take that view, and that <lb/> is what I understood to be
                  the view of my <lb/> right hon. friend ; but what my right hon. <lb/> friend does
                  say is that if you read the <lb/> whole history of the question, you will come
                  <lb/> to the Conclusion that though, as a matter <lb/> of law, there may be no
                  binding obligation <lb/> —though in that sense you may not be able <lb/> to
                  produce a written contract, signed, seal<lb break="no"/>ed and delivered, as my
                  hon. friend the lead<lb break="no"/>er of the opposition demanded a few mo<lb break="no"/>ments ago—there may arise out of the whole <lb/> history of this
                  matter an obligation which <lb/> the parliament, of Canada should consider, <lb/>
                  and which many men regard as a moral <lb/> obligation which this House should
                  fulfil. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. The right hon. the First <lb/> Minister went
                  much further than to speak <lb/> of it as a moral obligation, because he used
                  <lb/> the expression that the constitution provides <lb/> that we must do it.
                  <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I do not think he said <lb/> that the
                  constitution provides that we must <lb/> do it. I do not think my right hon.
                     col<lb break="no"/>league is aware of any method by which <lb/> any member of
                  this parliament can be com<lb break="no"/>pelled to vote in any other way than his
                     in<lb break="no"/>telligence and conscience dictates. But what <lb/> I
                  understood him to say is that the spirit of <lb/> the constitution created an
                  obligation, and <lb/> there he will be supported by very many <lb/> men on both
                  sides of the House. For the <lb/> purpose of record let me read the section in
                  <lb/> the Act of 1875—section 11, chapter 49, Act <lb/> 1875 : <lb/>

            <p>That is the clause in the Act of 1875, and 
     <lb/>
     with the change of a few words, which in 
     <lb/>
     no way disturbs its substance, that is the 
     <lb/>
     clause we find to-day in the Northwest 
     <lb/>
     Territories Act. It is curious, in view of the 
     <lb/>
     wide discussion and agitation which are tak<lb break="no"/>ing place to-day, that when this Act of 1875 
     <lb/>
     was passed, there was practically no dis<lb break="no"/>cussion of it in this House. There was 
     <lb/>
     certainly no adverse discussion. It is re<lb break="no"/>markable that the parliament of Canada 
     <lb/>
     passed that clause and put it upon the 
     <lb/>
     statute-book by a unanimous vote of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Commons. Again I say I do not 
     <lb/>
     for a moment contend, and I do not under<lb break="no"/>stand that my right hon. friend contended, 
     <lb/>
     that, as a matter of constitutional right 
     <lb/>
     fixed by the words of the statute, we are 
     <lb/>
     obliged to re-enact that clause. I go further. 
     <lb/>
     I do not hesitate to say that in my view, at 
     <lb/>
     any time since 1875, it was within the power 
     <lb/>
     —I do not say the moral right—but un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly within the power of this parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to repeal the Act of 1875. Therefore, 
     <lb/>
     I am not claiming that there is any binding 
     <lb/>
     legal obligation, but I do say that we are 
     <lb/>
     obliged to look carefully into the circum<lb break="no"/>stances under which that Act was passed ; 
     <lb/>
     and if we find that at the time it was regard<lb break="no"/>ed by its friends and supporters, and parlia<lb break="no"/>ment generally, as an Act which was pass<lb break="no"/>ed, not only for the present but the future, 
     <lb/>
     that creates a moral obligation which this 
     <lb/>
     House may well take into consideration. 
     <lb/>
     The Bill was introduced in 1875 and carried 
     <lb/>
     with practically no opposition. It is worth 
     <lb/>
     while remembering that the government 
     <lb/>
     of the late Mr. Mackenzie was then 
     <lb/>
     in power. The Bill, as first introduced, did 
     <lb/>
     not contain any provision respecting educa<lb break="no"/>tion. Attention was drawn to that omission, 
     <lb/>
     and a provision was made a little later. 
     <lb/>
     The chief speaker on that occasion was the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Edward Blake—a very eminent mem<lb break="no"/>ber of this parliament, a very able constitu<lb break="no"/>tional lawyer, and a gentleman whose 
     <lb/>
     Protestantism, I believe, is beyond ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Mr. Blake, speaking on that Bill.

            <p>The task which the ministry had set for

     itself was the most important it was possible

     to conceive. To found primary institutions 
     <lb/>
     under which we hope to see hundreds of thou<lb break="no"/>sands, and the more sanguine of us think, mil<lb break="no"/>lions of men and families settled and flourish<lb break="no"/>ing, was one of the noblest undertakings that

     could be entered upon by any legislative body,

     and it was no small indication of the power

     the task was one that required time, consider<lb break="no"/>ation and deliberation, and they must take care

     the institutions for the Northwest Territories

     <lb/>
     Blake) believed that it was essential to our 
     <lb/>
     obtaining a large immigration to the North<lb break="no"/>west that we should tell the people beforehand 
     <lb/>
     what those rights were to be in the country in 
     <lb/>
     which we invited them to settle. . . . . . . 
     <lb/></p>
<p>He regarded it as essential, under the cir<lb break="no"/>cumstances of the country, and in view of the 
     <lb/>
     deliberation during the last few days, that a 
     <lb/>
     general principle should be laid down in the 
     <lb/>
     Bill with respect to public instruction. He 
     <lb/>
     did believe that we ought not to introduce into 
     <lb/>
     that territory the heartburnings and difficulties 
     <lb/>
     with which certain other portions of the Dom<lb break="no"/>inion and other countries had been afflicted. 
     <lb/>
     It seemed to him, having regard to the fact 
     <lb/>
     that, as far as we could expect at present, 
     <lb/>
     the general character of that population would 
     <lb/>
     be somewhat analogous to the population of 
     <lb/>
     Ontario, that there should be some provision in 
     <lb/>
     the constitution by which they should have 
     <lb/>
     conferred upon them the same rights and pri<lb break="no"/>vileges in regard to religious instruction as 
     <lb/>
     those possessed by the people of the province 
     <lb/>
     of Ontario. The principles of local self-gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and the settling of the question of 
     <lb/>
     public instruction seemed to him ought to be 
     <lb/>
     the cardinal principles of the measure.

            <p>Is it not evident that at that time, in 
     <lb/>
     advancing that view as to the necessity of 
     <lb/>
     settling the education question, Mr. Blake 
     <lb/>
     had the idea that it should be settled, not 
     <lb/>
     for that day only, not as a temporary mat<lb break="no"/>ter, but settled then and for ever ?

     that, in this House, as I have stated, there 
     <lb/>
     was no objection—the Bill passed without 
     <lb/>
     any division. The Bill went to the Senate, 
     <lb/>
     and was discussed there by several gentle<lb break="no"/>men, among others by Hon. Mr. Scott, then 
     <lb/>
     as now Secretary of State, who was in 
     <lb/>
     charge of the Bill. Whatever he said might 
     <lb/>
     fairly be assumed to express the view of 
     <lb/>
     the government of the day, the view of Hon. 
     <lb/>
     Alexander Mackenzie and his colleagues. 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Scott in the course of the discussion

     said :-<lb/>

     not presenting a legal argument; I quote

     these words simply to show that Mr. Scott, 
     <lb/>
     representing the government of the day, 
     <lb/>
     judged by the language he used, must have 
     <lb/>
     contemplated that the clause which they 
     <lb/>
     then adopted was intended, even though we 
     <lb/>
     might have the power to repeal it, to con<lb break="no"/>tinue in force for ever in the Northwest Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories. Then I find also that the dis<lb break="no"/>tinguished leader of the Conservative op<lb break="no"/>position in the Senate at that time, Sir 
     <lb/>
     Alexander Campbell, also discussed the 
     <lb/>
     question. Sir Alexander Campbell was a 
     <lb/>
     lawyer, and for a time was Minister of 
     <lb/>
     Justice. He refers to an amendment which 
     <lb/>
     had been removed by Mr. Aikins, to strike 
     <lb/>
     out the separate school clause, and this is 
     <lb/>
     what he said :

     It would be much to be regretted if the

     Ontario and Quebec, and which had worked so 
     <lb/>
     well in the interest of peace and harmony with

     the different populations of these provinces.

     He thought the fairer course, and the better

     same system as prevailed in Ontario and 
     <lb/>
     Quebec ?' Not only to establish but to 'per<lb break="no"/>petuate.' Did that mean a temporary ar<lb break="no"/>rangement? Surely, if the English language 
     <lb/>
     means anything, Sir Alexander Campbell 
     <lb/>
     meant when he spoke that day that the Bill 
     <lb/>
     he was supporting, though leader of the 
     <lb/>
     opposition, was meant to establish and per<lb break="no"/>petuate in some way a system of separate 
     <lb/>
     schools in the Northwest Territories. Then 
     <lb/>
     the Hon. George Brown spoke. Reference 
     <lb/>
     has already been made to his part in this 
     <lb/>debate ; but the words he used may be<lb/>
    quoted again. In the course of the discus<lb break="no"/>sion he supported the amendment that was 
     <lb/>moved by Mr. Aikins to strike out the 
     <lb/>separate school clause and he used these 
     <lb/>words:

     of the men who passed the legislation—the

     government who proposed it and the men 
     <lb/>
     in the opposition who supported it. There

     is one sentence in the speech of Hon. Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Blake in this House that I would like

     to repeat :

     He (Mr. Blake) believed that it was essential 
     <lb/>
     to our obtaining a large immigration to the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories that we should tell the 
     <lb/>
     people beforehand what these rights were to be 
     <lb/>
     in the country to which they were invited.

            </quote>

            <p>I have no doubt, from information that 
     <lb/>
     has reached me, that many immigrants have 
     <lb/>
     come into the Northwest Territories upon 
     <lb/>
     representations that the schools there would 
     <lb/>
     he conducted in accordance with their re<lb break="no"/>ligious views. I believe this to be cor<lb break="no"/>rect. I may mention a little incident bear<lb break="no"/>ing on that point. I had occasion recently 
     <lb/>
     to come into official contact with the re<lb break="no"/>presentative of one of the continental na<lb break="no"/>tions. I was discussing with him the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of immigration—we wished to have im<lb break="no"/>migrants come to Canada from his country. 
     <lb/>
     In the course of our conversation he said : 
     <lb/>
     If you are to get immigrants from our coun<lb break="no"/>try, this school question that is coming up 
     <lb/>
     becomes one of very great importance to 
     <lb/>
     us. I have no doubt therefore that it can 
     <lb/>
     be shown that some of the immigrants who 
     <lb/>
     have come to the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     have come—for we have many Roman 
     <lb/>
     Catholic settlers in that country—on the 
     <lb/>
     faith of representations that their schools 
     <lb/>
     were to be conducted in accordance with 
     <lb/>
     the views of the Roman Catholic minority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>I find that not only is there the evidence 
     <lb/>
     I have referred to, showing the intention 
     <lb/>
     at the time this Act was passed, but later on 
     <lb/>
     there were further discussions which may 
     <lb/>
     be cited in the same direction. I find that 
     <lb/>
     some years afterwards, in 1894, there was 
     <lb/>
     a discussion in this House with regard to 
     <lb/>
     some amendments of the Northwest Act 
     <lb/>
     that were proposed. I find that the 
     <lb/>
     late Mr. Dalton McCarthy, who de<lb break="no"/>sired that the separate school clause 
     <lb/>
     should be repealed, who was an oppo<lb break="no"/>nent of separate schools as hon. gentlemen 
     <lb/>
     well remember, in a speech at that time laid 
     <lb/>
     down the principle that if you should con<lb break="no"/>tinue to allow that separate school clause 
     <lb/>
     to remain on the statute-book, if you should 
     <lb/>
     go on year after year allowing the North<lb break="no"/>west people to possess this system of sep[er]<lb break="no"/>ate schools up to the moment at which they 
     <lb/>
     would be brought in as a province, then they 
     <lb/>
     would be in a position to come to us and 
     <lb/>
     say : It is too late for you to change that

     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. McCarthy, course, was desirous 
     <lb/>
     that the system should be changed, 
     <lb/>
     but in the meantime he did not shrink from 
     <lb/>
     the responsibility of saying that if the 
     <lb/>
     parliament of Canada desired to change it. 
     <lb/>
     it must act quickly, and not wait until the 
     <lb/>
     time arrived for the creation of the pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. I find the words of Mr. McCarthy 
     <lb/>

            <p>Mr. McCarthy, it will be observed, as all 
     <lb/>
     opponent of the system of separate schools, 
     <lb/>
     took the ground that if the parliament of 
     <lb/>
     Canada wished to destroy that system it 
     <lb/>
     must not wait until it undertook to create 
     <lb/>
     a province. His argument is that if you 
     <lb/>
     leave these Northwest people in possession 
     <lb/>
     of the separate school system, if you go on 
     <lb/>
     year after year permitting it, encouraging 
     <lb/>
     it ; if you allow them to pass ordinances 
     <lb/>
     in accordance with it, if you have these or<lb break="no"/>dinances sent to Ottawa year after year and 
     <lb/>
     you approve of them and allow them to go 
     <lb/>
     into operation, then you are confirming the 
     <lb/>
     system of separate schools to those pro<lb break="no"/>vinces ; and when the moment shall arrive 
     <lb/>
     that these lands shall pass from the status 
     <lb/>
     of territories into the larger status of pro<lb break="no"/>vinces. it will then be too late for you to 
     <lb/>
     come in and say ; we will deprive you of 
     <lb/>
     this system of separate schools. Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Carthy and Sir John Thompson had some

     Now the House will have to use its own

     judgment on this question. What I say is 
     <lb/>
     this : That if this question of separate schools 
     <lb/>
     is to remain in its present position until we 
     <lb/>
     grant provincial autonomy to any portion of 
     <lb/>

     been entitled to, what Manitoba was entitled

     to, and what I submit under the circumstances 
     <lb/>
     every province would be entitled to. Now, let

     me draw attention to the constitution con<lb break="no"/>ferred upon Manitoba in that regard. I have 
     <lb/>
     not got it under my hand, but it will be found

     on consulting it that when we conferred au<lb break="no"/>tonomy upon the province of Manitoba, we did 
     <lb/>
     it by reference to the British North America 
     <lb/>
     Act. What we declared was that where not

     otherwise provided for in the Act, all the

     provisions of the British North America Act 
     <lb/>
     should apply to the province of Manitoba, and 
     <lb/>
     I think the very same words were contained

     that we have got that precedent before us ; 
     <lb/>
     that was the promise upon which we admitted 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, and looking at the character of the 
     <lb/>
     legislation. I do not think that there can be 
     <lb/>
     any doubt that the same rule must apply when

     the Remedial Bill of 1896 to override an Act 
     <lb/>
     of the legislature of Manitoba, passed by 
     <lb/>
     the voice of the people of that province, and, 
     <lb/>
     as subsequently was maintained, entirely 
     <lb/>
     within the legislative authority of that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. We do not propose to override any Act 
     <lb/>
     of any legislature. What we propose to-day 
     <lb/>
     is to confirm and continue for all future time 
     <lb/>
     a measure which the free voice of the North<lb break="no"/>west legislature has placed upon the statute- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     book of the Territories. So that, on that 
     <lb/>
     point, there is a wide difference between the 
     <lb/>
     condition of affairs in respect to Manitoba 
     <lb/>
     and the condition of affairs in respect to 
     <lb/>
     the Northwest Territories. Then again it 
     <lb/>
     was said and with some justice that an 
     <lb/>
     effort was made to coerce the province of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba, because it was proposed to pass 
     <lb/>
     an Act against which the government of 
     <lb/>
     Manitoba entered a solemn protest. There 
     <lb/>
     is no protest from the government of the 
     <lb/>
     Northwest Territories against this measure. 
     <lb/>
     I make that statement advisedly. The pre<lb break="no"/>mier of the Northwest Territories, an esti<lb break="no"/>mable gentleman who has been taking part 
     <lb/>
     in this discussion, as properly he should, 
     <lb/>
     has written a letter to the Prime Minister 
     <lb/>
     of Canada, but I am informed and believe 
     <lb/>
     that that letter expresses his individual 
     <lb/>
     opinion and it is not authorized by the gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the Northwest Territonies. So, in 
     <lb/>
     the case of Manitoba I repeat that the propo<lb break="no"/>sition was to do something against which the 
     <lb/>
     government of Manitoba protested. In this 
     <lb/>
     case we are doing something against which 
     <lb/>
     the government of the Northwest Territories 
     <lb/>
     have entered no protest whatever. Then, 
     <lb/>
     there is a further consideration. I suppose 
     <lb/>
     the people in the Northwest Territories have 
     <lb/>
     the best right to speak through their 
     <lb/>
     acknowledged representatives. I have no 
     <lb/>
    right to say what will be the views ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by my hon. friends from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories on the other side of the 
     <lb/>House, but it is understood—I do not state 
     <lb/>it from direct communication with my hon. 
     <lb/>friends from the Northwest Territories—but 
     <lb/>it is understood and believed that this legis<lb break="no"/>lation is accepted and will be supported by 
     <lb/>seven out of ten members from the North<lb break="no"/>west. Well, if there is no great matter of

     principle involved. and I hope to be able to 
     <lb/>show in the few remarks with which I<lb/>propose to detain the House before I close<lb/>that there is no great matter of principle<lb/>involved in this measure, and if seven out<lb/>of ten representatives from the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories are satisfied that thist<lb/>is a good law for the people, who shall<lb/>dare to say that we are coercing the people<lb/>of the Northwest Territories ? I would say,<lb/>Sir, that any argument which is designed to<lb/>prove that we are dealing in this matter in<lb/>the way of coercion is entirely unjustifiable.<lb/>What is this law which we are going to<lb/>confirm and to continue in the new pro<lb break="no"/>vinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan? We<lb/>are told that this provides for a system<lb/>of separate schools. Well, a system of<lb/>separate schools may mean one thing in<lb/>one quarter and another thing in another<lb/>quarter. It is. in a measure, a system of <lb/>separatc schools. That expression in the<lb/>minds of many people means a great deal.<lb/>I do not think I am mistaken when I say<lb/>that in the minds of a great many Protes<lb break="no"/>tant people in the country when you talk<lb/>about separate schools immediately un<lb break="no"/>derstand that you are talking about schools<lb/>that come under the control of some religious<lb/>body, and particularly schools which come<lb/>under the control of the Roman Catholic<lb/>church. That is the common idea of sep<lb break="no"/>arate schools in many quaters. Whatever<lb/>may be said as respects other countries, or<lb/>other provinces, it would be utterly mis<lb break="no"/>taken to say that we are giving to the North<lb break="no"/>west Province separate schools in that<lb/>sense of the words. I submit to this<lb/>House that the system of schools which<lb/>we have to-day in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories is national school system, and if<lb/>it has all the elements of a national school<lb/>system then I say there is no principle in<lb break="no"/>volved in this discussion which would<lb/>justify us in having a quarrel over it. What<lb/>is this system ? One would suppose from<lb/>the frequent references that are made to it<lb/>that it is some iniquitous system, something<lb/>which if continued would prejudice the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the people in these Territories for all<lb/>time to come. The system of schoosl which<lb/>prevails to-day in the Northwest Territories<lb/>exists by virtue of chapters 29, 30 and 31 of<lb/>the ordinances of the Northwest Territories.<lb/>So far as the principle of separate schools<lb/>is concerned, of course, that principle was to<lb/>be found in the Act of 1875 and the ordi<lb break="no"/>nances adapted themselves to it. But if you<lb/>read these three ordinances of the Northwest<lb/>Territories you will rise from the perusal of<lb/>them with the conviction that in that coun<lb break="no"/>try they have a system of national schools<lb/>which may well challenge the administration of<lb/>the people in other portions of this country.<lb/>What then are the essential elements of <lb/>national schools ? I take it for granted that<lb/>if you have a school which is established<lb/>by the public authorities, if the management<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3000</fw>
         
     of the school derives all its authority and 
     <lb/>privileges from a regulation of the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the state, if you have a system of<lb/>schools under which the proper authorities of<lb/>the state, or the province, or territory as the<lb/>case may be, themselves specify the school<lb/>books, establish the course of study, provide<lb/>for the inspection of the schools and for<lb/>the distribution of the money, if you have all<lb/>those elements, then, I say you have a system<lb/>of state-created, state-managed and state-<lb break="yes"/>supported public schools. Every one of<lb/>these conditions exists to-day in the public<lb/>school system of the Northwest Territories.<lb/>A member of teh government of the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories becomes commissioner of education<lb/>and the powers of the commissioner are set<lb/>forth in detail. I shall only read the clause<lb/>under the heading of ' Regulations of the De<lb break="no"/>partment.'

            <p>What is there, Sir, in all this to which<lb/>anybody can take exception ? These details<lb/>constitute the essential elements of a na<lb break="no"/>tional school system. That system prevails<lb/>to-day in the Northwest Territories, and<lb/>that system we propose to constinue by the<lb/>legislation which we have presented in this<lb/>House. The difference between a minority<lb/>school and a majority school in the North<lb break="no"/>west Territories is so exceedingly small<lb/>that he who would attempt to make a de<lb break="no"/>finition of it would find himself in difficulty.<lb/>The difference is with respect to one half<lb/>hour's instruction in religious matters at<lb/>the close of the school. The school laws of<lb/>the Northwest Territories provide for re<lb break="no"/>ligious instruction, not as a matter of ob<lb break="no"/>ligation ; they empower the trustees to<lb/> <lb/>
authorize religious instructions within cer<lb break="no"/><pb n="3001" facs="final/images/AB_SK_H_of_C_1905-03-22_Page_3001.jpg"/>
           <fw type="num">3001</fw> <fw type="dateline">MARCH 22, 1905</fw> tain limits. That authority for religious in<lb break="no"/>struction is not confined to separate schools; 
     <lb/>
     it applies to all schools in the Territories. 
     <lb/>
     It is provided that wherever the trustees 
     <lb/>
     so wish, wherever the local conditions per<lb break="no"/>mit, there shall be religious instruction in 
     <lb/>
     all schools in the Northwest Territories, not 
     <lb/>
     in the minority schools only. Then there 
     <lb/>
     is a further provision that all schools may 
     <lb/>
     be opened with the reciting of the Lord's 
     <lb/>
     Prayer. Does anybody object to that ? I 
     <lb/>
     hope not ; I trust that in any case where 
     <lb/>
     the trustees of a school authorized that, it is 
     <lb/>
     not objectionable. But then there is this half 
     <lb/>
     hour of religious education. From the hour 
     <lb/>
     at which these schools open in the morning 
     <lb/>
     up to half-past three in the afternoon they 
     <lb/>
     are absolutely alike ; there is no difference ; 
     <lb/>
     the teachers have the same duties, the same 
     <lb/>
     qualifications; the same examinations, the 
     <lb/>
     same course of study, the same books are 
     <lb/>
     prescribed by the government, the regula<lb break="no"/>tions are made by the government, the in<lb break="no"/>spector is appointed by the government. I 
     <lb/>
     repeat that from the hour of opening in the 
     <lb/>
     morning up to half-past three in the after<lb break="no"/>noon there is no shade of difference in all 
     <lb/>
     these schools in the Northwest Territories. 
     <lb/>
     So it has come to this, that we have a shade 
     <lb/>
     of difference as respects the half hour of re- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     religious instruction, from 3.30 to 4 o'clock. 
     <lb/>
     I submit, Mr. Speaker, to this House 
     <lb/>
    that on a question like this that half 
     <lb/>hour of religious instruction is not and 
     <lb/>should not be a cause of conflict. Where 
     <lb/>the majority of the people and the 
     <lb/>trustees are of the Protestant faith, 
     <lb/>that half hour of religious instruction 
     <lb/>will, of course, take the form of the faith 
     <lb/>of the majority ; it will be Protestant reli<lb break="no"/>gious instruction. Where the majority of 
     <lb/>the people and the trustees are Roman 
     <lb/>Catholics, that half hour of religious in<lb break="no"/>struction will follow the faith of the Roman 
     <lb/>Catholic majority. In each of these cases 
     <lb/>the minority, if they wish, may have a 
     <lb/>separate school. I am firmly persuaded that 
     <lb/>the difference is so slight that if we reach a 
     <lb/>wise decision now, if we refrain from 
     <lb/>fanning the flame of political passion—I 
     <lb/>withdraw that word political, I am not dis<lb break="no"/>cussing this from a party standpoint, and I 
     <lb/>did not intend to use that word, and I with<lb break="no"/>draw it—if we refrain from doing or saying 
     <lb/>anything which can fan the flame of reli<lb break="no"/>gious excitement in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories now, my honest conviction is that 
     <lb/>the separate schools will diminish, and the 
     <lb/>free common public schools will increase. 
     <lb/>I am persuaded that the difference is so 
     <lb/>small that the mass of the people in the 
     <lb/>Northwest Territories will hardly find it to 
     <lb/>their advantage to keep it up except in a 
     <lb/>few instances. I am reminded of one point : 
     <lb/>I had forgotten to state that even with 
     <lb/>respect to that half hour, it is not a matter 
     <lb/>of obligation, but if the parents of any child 
     <lb/>disapprove of that religious instruction for 
     <lb/>that half hour, the child may withdraw. 
     <lb/>There is, therefore, liberty of conscience in 
     <lb/>the highest degree. I do not hesitate to 
     <lb/>

     say, Protestant that I am, that I do not 
     <lb/>
     think that half hour of religious instruc<lb break="no"/>tion given by a Roman Catholic teacher 
     <lb/>
     will hurt the children ; I think that half 
     <lb/>
     hour of instruction given by a Catholic 
     <lb/>
     teacher to Catholic children—I think that 
     <lb/>
     we may reasonably feel that if there is 
     <lb/>
     enough of it to have any influence on the 
     <lb/>
     life of the child, it will make a boy a better 
     <lb/>
     citizen, a better Canadian. I want the 
     <lb/>
     House to consider seriously, I submit the 
     <lb/>
     proposition again, that if it be true as I 
     <lb/>
     say, and I believe I am correct beyond the 
     <lb/>
     power of contradiction, that from the mo<lb break="no"/>ment that the school opens in the morning 
     <lb/>
     up to half-past three in the afternoon there 
     <lb/>
     is no difference between a separate school 
     <lb/>
     and a free national school, and if the only 
     <lb/>
     point of difference between them is that 
     <lb/>
     half hour of religious instruction, is there 
     <lb/>
     enough in it to quarrel about, and to have 
     <lb/>
     public meetings and agitation throughout 
     <lb/>
     the length and breadth of this land ? I be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the great mass of the people to<lb break="no"/>day who are joining in petitions and hold<lb break="no"/>ing meetings have not had time to under<lb break="no"/>stand this question. I believe that they 
     <lb/>
     have an erroneous view as to what the 
     <lb/>
     condition in the Northwest Territories is 
     <lb/>
     and as to what is the condition which we 
     <lb/>
     propose to perpetuate. When they discover, 
     <lb/>
     as they will, in the light of the debate which 
     <lb/>
     will take place in this House now and in 
     <lb/>
     the next few days, when the people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada shall learn that we have in the west<lb/>to-day a system which is practically a na<lb break="no"/>tional school system, and that the only 
     <lb/>point of difference between us is with re<lb break="no"/>spect to the small matter of a half hour of<lb/>religious instruction, I think the great mass 
     <lb/>of the Protestant people of Canada will say 
     <lb/>that they regret that there has been any 
     <lb/>agitation on the subject.

            <p>My hon. friend the leader of the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) referred to-day to 
     <lb/>
     the conditions of education in the province 
     <lb/>
     of Nova Scotia. We are proud to-day. Sir, 
     <lb/>
     of the national school system in that pro<lb break="no"/>vince. We rejoice that from time to time 
     <lb/>
     we hear our public men of all parties and 
     <lb/>
     all creeds cite the province of Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     as an example of toleration and good will. 
     <lb/>
     The happy conditions which exist in that 
     <lb/>
     province have many a time been referred 
     <lb/>
     to by my right hon. friend the Prime Minis<lb break="no"/>ter, who has held the people of Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>
     up as examples of moderation and tolera<lb break="no"/>tion. We have a free common national sys<lb break="no"/>tem of education in the province of Nova 
     <lb/>
     Scotia. The principle of that system is, as 
     <lb/>
     I stated at an earlier stage of my speech : 
     <lb/>
     Thou shalt not teach any 'ism' but thou 
     <lb/>
     shalt teach by precept and example, 
     <lb/>
     the Christian virtues. This is the es<lb break="no"/>sential point, and happily we have got 
     <lb/>
     along very well. But do not make any 
     <lb/>
     mistake. Let no man imagine that that 
     <lb/>
     happy condition has been brought about 
     <lb/>
     without conciliation and compromise. We 
     <lb/>
     have no separate schools by law in 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, but I say that we could not

     have brought about that happy condition if 
     <lb/>we had not been disposed to meet our Ro<lb break="no"/>man Catholic brethren in a generous spirit,<lb/>with due regard to their religious convic<lb break="no"/>tions. There is no separate school system<lb/>by law in the province of Nova Scotia, but<lb/>I tell this House to-night that the principle<lb/>of separate schools is more emphatically<lb/>recognized in the province of Nova Scotia<lb/>than it is to-day in the Northwest Terri<lb break="no"/>tories.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Come with me down to the fair city of 
     <lb/>Halifax and what will you find? The Ro<lb break="no"/>man Cahtolic Archbishop builds the school<lb/>and leases it to the school trustees. What<lb/>would they say to that in the Northwest ? <lb/>The Roman Catholic authorities receive con<lb break="no"/>sideration and this is one of the means<lb/>whereby we bring about the happy con<lb break="no"/>dition which obtains down there. The sister<lb/>of charity teaches in our schools wearing<lb/>the garb of her order, and many of the sis<lb break="no"/>ters are among the best teachers in our<lb/>provinces. There are schools in the city of<lb/>Halifax which will be pointed out to you<lb/>as Roman Catholic schools, and so they<lb/>are. The Prime Minister once when in<lb/>Halifax visited one of these schools and he<lb/>alluded to it as a separate school, and<lb/>one of the sisters interrupted him and said :<lb/>no, Sir, it is a public school of the province<lb/>of Nova Scotia. And so it was, but it was<lb/>a school which was recognized as a Roman<lb/>Catholic school and it was attended only<lb/>by Roman Catholic pupils, and it was taught<lb/>by the Roman Catholic sister of charity<lb/>wearing the garb of her order and the crossu<lb/>upon her breast. We have made conces<lb break="no"/>sions for our Roman Catholic brethren in<lb/>the province of Nova Scotia. Why, if a<lb/>vacancy occurs in the teaching staff of one<lb/>of the Catholic schools of Halifax, the<lb/>Protestant commissioners have no vote in<lb/>the selection of a successor ; the Catholic<lb/>Commissioners only have the right to vote.<lb/>Such is the system in the city of Halifax,<lb/>and substantially the same system exists in<lb/>many of the larger communities in the prov<lb break="no"/>ince, because it is only in a large community<lb/>that this condition can be brought about. I<lb/>am less familiar with the conditions in New<lb/>Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, but I<lb/>think I am right in saying that they are sub<lb break="no"/>stantially the same.<lb/>

                  hesitate not to make the state<lb break="no"/>ment that in my own province of

                  our Roman Catholic brethren. <lb/>What interest has suffered ? There was a
                  <lb/>little friction years ago, but there is none<lb/>to-day. The sensible people
                  of Nova Scotia<lb/>have made up their minds that this is a<lb/>matter in which we
                  can please our Roman<lb/>Catholic brethren without hurting ourselves,<lb/>and when
                  we can do tht why should we<lb/>not make an effort to do it? I repeat

                  often referred to<lb/>—which I myself have again and again<lb/>spoken of with
                  pride—has been brought<lb/>about by paying due regard to the rights, <lb/>and the
                  feelings of the Roman Catholic<lb/>minority.<lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPRO2">Mr. SPROULE</persName>. Does the minister think<lb/>that the people of the
                  Northwest Territor<lb break="no"/>ies would be less liberal or less
                  generous<lb/>than the people of Nova Scotia ?<lb/>
               </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. Perhaps they would not,<lb/>but if forty-one per
                  cent of the people of<lb/>Canada think that there is a danger, we<lb/>might well
                  see if some compromise, some<lb/>arrangement could not be made. We have<lb/>to-day
                  before us perhapsthe most important<lb/>measures that have ever engaged the
                     atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the parliament of Canada. They are<lb/>measures
                  which are wide-reaching in their<lb/>effect. Whether we have regard to the in<lb break="no"/>terest which is manifested by the people<lb/>throughout the country
                  to-day or whether<lb/>we have regard to the future welfare of<lb/>this Dominion
                  which all, irrespective of<lb/>party, are so anxious to advance, we may<lb/>feel,
                  I am sure, that these are great mea<lb break="no"/>sures, and that we should
                  approach them<lb/>
                  <lb/>with the utmost care, with the utmost<lb/>deliberation, with a desire to find
                  a happy<lb/>settlement of any differences that may arise.<lb/>Let us not conceal
                  from ourselves certain<lb/>facts ; let us be frank with one another.<lb/>Let us
                  say that the gravity of this situation<lb/>is even more serious than many think.
                  If<lb/>my right hon. friend the Prime Minister<lb/>is to retire from office, as he
                  would be oblig<lb break="no"/>ed to do, if this Bill were defeated, what<lb/>then
                  ? Under ordinary circumstances the<lb/>retirement of a minister or the
                  retirement<lb/>of a government means very little after all.<lb/>The public adapt
                  themselves to new con<lb break="no"/>ditions ; one government goes out
                  and<lb/>another comes in. Party interest may suf<lb break="no"/>fer. But that is
                  not the situation to<lb break="no"/>day. There are interests involved in
                  this<lb/>question which far outweigh any mere party<lb/>consideration. What
                  matters it if one gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should go out and another come<lb/>in
                  ? But think for a moment of what<lb/>would happen under the present state
                  of<lb/>affairs. Some one will say : what matter<lb/>if the Prime Minister goes
                  out, somebody<lb/>else will come in. Sir, no government<lb/>could be formed under
                  such circumstances<lb/>

                   which would command the confidence of <lb/> this
                  parliament. I make that statement after <lb/> due deliberation. But, somebody will
                  say: <lb/> What of that ; if you Liberals cannot form <lb/> a government we
                  Conservatives will take <lb/> charge. Will you? I doubt it. I have <lb/> no right
                  to speak for my hon. friend the <lb/> leader of the opposition, but if I know him
                  <lb/> at all I venture to remark that he would <lb/> shrink from the formation of
                  a govern<lb break="no"/>ment in which he would be obliged to draw <lb/> religious
                  lines. As a high-minded man, with <lb/> due regard for the future of his country,
                  <lb/> he would shrink from the formation of a <lb/> government under which he
                  would be oblig<lb break="no"/>ed to exclude from office and vote and pow<lb break="no"/>er forty-one per cent of the people of this <lb/> Dominion. The
                  leader of the opposition <lb/> has acknowledged to-day that there is no <lb/>
                  union among his party on that question. <lb/> He chaffed the Prime Minister for a
                     mo<lb break="no"/>ment; he said this question was not mak<lb break="no"/>ing
                  for the unity of the <choice>
                     <sic>goverment</sic>
                     <corr>government</corr>
                  </choice>. May I <lb/> venture to suggest that it is not making for <lb/> the
                  unity of the opposition ? The leader of <lb/> the opposition acknowledged
                  to-day—it was <lb/> right that he should acknowledge it—that <lb/> he and some of
                  the men with whom he <lb/> sits were not able to see eye to eye. He <lb/> warned
                  us that he spoke to—day for him<lb break="no"/>self only and that he did not
                  presume to <lb/> speak in the name of his party. What does <lb/> that show us ?
                  Does it not prove that if <lb/> my right hon. friend shall be obliged to <lb/>
                  retire from office on this question, my hon. <lb/> friend the leader of the
                  opposition would <lb/> shrink from the formation of a government <lb/> under such
                  conditions? The matter is too <lb/> grave to permit of its being treated lightly
                  <lb/> for a single moment, but I venture to say <lb/> that it will be impossible
                  to repress a smile <lb/> on both sides of the House when I suggest <lb/> the
                  picture that would be presented of my <lb/> hon. friends from East Grey (Mr.
                  Sproule), <lb/> Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk), Beauharnois <lb/> (Mr. Bergeron), and
                  Victoria and Haliburton <lb/> (Mr. Sam. Hughes) sitting down to prepare <lb/> a
                  resolution with respect to separate schools. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. We could not make <lb/> a much worse mess
                  of it than the govern<lb break="no"/>ment has up to the present. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I think my hon. friend <lb/> is entirely wrong.
                  He will find, when the <lb/> vote is taken, that we have a united gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and a united party, and he will <lb/> find, according to
                  his own confession, that <lb/> he will not have a united party supporting <lb/>
                  him. My hon. friend made merry at our <lb/> differences a few days ago, but I
                  suspect he <lb/> has been having a few bad quarters of an <lb/> hour himself. Let
                  us not, in our momentary <lb/> good nature. fail to see the gravity of the <lb/>
                  situation presented to the House. I say <lb/> deliberately—and every hon.
                  gentleman who <lb/> listens to me knows it—that if this Bill be <lb/> not passed,
                  if we should be unable to carry <lb/> a measure on this subject. then my right <lb/>
                  <cb/>
     <fw type="num">3006</fw> hon. friend will be obliged to retire and no <lb/> other government can be
                  formed which will <lb/> command the confidence of this parliament. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:HUGH2">Mr. SAM. HUGHES</persName>. Is that the reason <lb/> why the Finance
                  Minister is back into line ? <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The only way a gov<lb break="no"/>ernment could
                  be formed by hon. gentlemen <lb/> opposite would be by the hon. member for <lb/>
                  Victoria and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. Hughes) <lb/> coming forward to sit cheek by
                  jowl with <lb/> the hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber<lb break="no"/>geron) as
                  an advocate for separate schools, <lb/> and I do not think that my hon. friends
                  <lb/> would care for the combination. I am <lb/> speaking in all seriousness. This
                  is no <lb/> matter for levity. I repeat that there is <lb/> in a certain sense a
                  crisis. There is no <lb/> party crisis, but there is a crisis with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the administration of public busi<lb break="no"/>ness in
                  Canada by any government and any <lb/> party. If my right hon. friend should re<lb break="no"/>tire on an issue like this, then the only <lb/> thing that could
                  possibly happen, if my <lb/> hon. friend the leader of the opposition <lb/> should
                  agree to form a government at such <lb/> a time, would be that he must form a
                     Pro<lb break="no"/>testant government and he must have a <lb/> general
                  election. <lb/>

            <p>An hon. MEMBER. Shame.

            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. I do not think that the <lb/> hon. member for
                  West Toronto (Mr. Osler) <lb/> has paid me the compliment of trying to <lb/>
                  understand what I was presenting to the <lb/> House. Again I repeat—and I want to
                  <lb/> guard against any misapprehension, I want <lb/> to give the hon. gentleman
                  who said 'shame' <lb/> an opportunity to say it again, because I <lb/> want to
                  state the situation as it actually <lb/> exists. I say this is becoming a
                  religious <lb/> question. Who denies it? My hon. <lb/> friend the leader of the
                  opposition said as <lb/> much to-day. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName>. I beg my hon. <lb/> friend's pardon, I said
                  nothing of the kind. <lb/> If so understood, I desire to disclaim any <lb/> such
                  intention. I argued this question, as <lb/> my right hon. friend the First
                  Minister did <lb/> in the first instance, on the constitutional <lb/> ground
                  because in his remarks to this <lb/> House, both on the 21st February and again
                  <lb/> to-day, he put the question solely on that <lb/> ground. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:FIEL1">Mr. FIELDING</persName>. The point is not im<lb break="no"/>portant. I
                  understood my hon. friend, the <lb/> leader of the opposition, to have spoken, in
                  <lb/> the course of his speech to-day, of the re<lb break="no"/>ligious
                  differences which unhappily would <lb/> arise in this matter. I think that will be
                  <lb/> found somewhere in 'Hansard'; but it is <lb/>

                   not important, and if he says he made no <lb/> allusion
                  of the kind, I Withdraw the remark. <lb/> But I say that it is in the minds of a
                  large <lb/> portion of the people of Canada a religious <lb/> question. I take the
                  responsibility of say<lb break="no"/>ing—and every man opposite knows it<lb break="no"/>that this question today is largely shaping <lb/> itself as a
                  religious question. We have on <lb/> the one side the Roman Catholic body, lar<lb break="no"/>gely united, and on the other side a large <lb/> portion of the
                  Protestant body who are agita<lb break="no"/>ting against this Bill on what may be
                  called <lb/> religious lines. I am not discussing their <lb/> motive or purpose,
                  but the line of separ<lb break="no"/>ation is religion, and no one can contest
                  <lb/> that. I say that inevitably if the right hon. <lb/> the First Minister had
                  to retire from office <lb/> on this question and my hon. friend the <lb/> leader
                  of the opposition were called on to <lb/> form a government to settle this school
                  <lb/> question in the Northwest, he could not <lb/> unite the hon. member for East
                  Grey (Mr. <lb/> Sproule) and the hon. member for Jacques <lb/> Cartier (Mr. Monk)
                  and the hon. member <lb/> for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron). There is <lb/> nothing
                  wrong in saying that. We all <lb/> know that these gentlemen have their differ<lb break="no"/>ences on this question and could not agree. <lb/> I say that the
                  government then would have <lb/> to be formed on religious lines, and that <lb/>
                  would be the greatest calamity that could <lb/> occur to the Dominion of Canada.
                  Surely <lb/> in the presence of such a condition of things, <lb/> we would all do
                  well to see if it be not <lb/> possible to find some solution of this great <lb/>
                  question. This is a time of great promise <lb/> for our country. Canada united,
                  happy and <lb/> harmonious. will present a picture which <lb/> will command the

                  request com<lb break="no"/>plied with at the earliest possible moment, <lb/> for
                  we are now in the midst of a discussion <lb/> on the second reading, and, if the
                     informa<lb break="no"/>tion is to be of any value, it must be avail<lb break="no"/>able at the earliest possible moment. <lb/>
               </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. Will the hon. <lb/> gentleman (Mr. R. L
                  Borden) tell me to what <lb/> information he particularly refers? <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:BORD2">Mr. R. L. BORDEN</persName> If the Prime Min<lb break="no"/>ister will

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAUR5">Sir WILFRID LAURIER</persName>. I understand <lb/> from the Minister of
                  Justice (Mr. Fitzpat<lb break="no"/>rick) that he has ordered everything avail<lb break="no"/>able to be brought down. If the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr.

                  me either <lb/> to-night or to-morrow, I will try to have it <lb/> ready. <lb/>

                  <lb/> I have not found among the papers. It is <lb/> dated Regina, 30th of
                  September, 1893, and <lb/> is signed by Thomas Brown, Secretary of <lb/> the
                  Council of Public Instruction. I would <lb/> like to know if it can be found
                  printed <lb/> among the ordinances or Orders in Councils <lb/> of the Northwest
                  Territories ? I shall be <lb/> glad to place this manuscript copy in the <lb/>
                  hands of the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz<lb break="no"/>patrick) that, if
                  possible, a printed copy <lb/> may be found and brought down. <lb/>

            <p>The SPEAKER took the Chair at Three <lb/>

            <p>QUESTIONS. <lb/>
TRANSCONTINErNTAL SURVEYS. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. SLOAN asked: <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>1. Has the government any information
that <lb/>
the Grand Trunk Pacific has completed the <lb/>
necessary surveys, or any portion thereof, for <lb/>
the building of the new Transcontinental line <lb/>
in British Columbia ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. If so, is it the intention of the
govern<lb break="no"/>ment to urge the early construction of this <lb/>
section or the Grand Trunk Pacific ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Hon. H. R. EMMERSON (Minister of Rail<lb break="no"/>ways and Canals). In reply to the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman's first question, there appears to be <lb/>
no information on the subject in the depart<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>As respects the second part of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion, it is the intention of the government <lb/>
to urge the early construction of this as <lb/>
well as of other sections of the Grand Trunk <lb/>
Pacific Railway. <lb/>

            <p>FRUITS MARKS ACT CONVICTIONS. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. GUNN asked : <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>How many convictions have been made under
<lb/>
the Fruit Marks Act to date ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Hon. SYDNEY FISHER. (Minister of <lb/>
Agriculture). Ninety-six, upon information <lb/>
laid by the staff of the fruit division of the <lb/>
department. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to these, there have been
con<lb break="no"/>victions upon information laid by others, <lb/>
but the department is not aware of the <lb/>
number, as the cases have not been report<lb break="no"/>ed. The department has heard of three such <lb/>
cases. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>CIRCULATION OF AMERICAN CURRENCY. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. BICKERDIKE asked : <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>1. Is the government aware that a very
large <lb/>
amount of American currency is at present in <lb/>
circulation at par in Canada? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. Is it within the knowledge of the
govern<lb break="no"/>ment that in most cases Canadian currency is <lb/>
refused in the United States, and when accept<lb break="no"/>ed, only taken at a very heavy discount ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>3. Is it the intention of the government
to <lb/>
introduce a measure the present session for <lb/>
the purpose of preventing the circulation of <lb/>
United States coin in the Dominion ? <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Hon. W. S. FIELDING (Minister of Fin<lb break="no"/>ance) : <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>1. Yes.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. Yes. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is not the intention of the govern—
<lb break="maybe"/>
ment to introduce any measure to prohibit <lb/>
the circulation of American coin, but we 
<lb/>
anticipate that we will be able to make <lb/>
such regulations as will largely displace <lb/>
that coin. <lb/>

            <p>PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT IN THE<lb/>
NORTHWEST. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>House resumed adjourned debate on the <lb/>
proposed motion of Sir Wilfrid Laurier for <lb/>
the second reading of Bill (No. 69) to estab<lb break="no"/>lish and provide for the government of the <lb/>
province of Alberta, and the amendment of <lb/>
Mr. R. L. Borden thereto. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>Mr. T. S. SPROULE (East Grey). Mr. <lb/>
Speaker, in continuing the discussion on this <lb/>
most important question, I do not propose <lb/>
to endeavour to enlighten the House upon <lb/>
any legal points involved in it, beyond a <lb/>
passing reference to some views of the <lb/>
British North America Act as they appear <lb/>
to me and their relation to the Bill now <lb/>
before us. Before commencing the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of the subject proper, I
would like to <lb/>
refer to some remarks made by the Minister <lb/>
of Finance (Mr. Fielding) in closing the <lb/>
debate last evening. His speech sounded to <lb/>
me very much like a threat or a doleful <lb/>
foreboding, and it occurred to me that it <lb/>
was delivered for the purpose of holding his <lb/>
own followers together rather than of fore<lb break="no"/>shadowing what might be the result in the <lb/>
event of this Bill being defeated. He used <lb/>
