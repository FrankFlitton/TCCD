<head rendition="simple:centre">THE NEW NORTH-WEST TERRITORY.</head>

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName> moved the <lb/>
second reading of the "Bill respecting <lb/>
"the North-West Territories, and to <lb/>
"create a separate territory out of part <lb/>
"thereof." He said—I have very little <lb/>
to say in addition to the remarks I made <lb/>
in introducing the Bill. The intention <lb/>
is simply to appoint the Governor of <lb/>
Manitoba to govern the territory im<lb break="no"/>mediately east and north of the present <lb/>
Province—to detach, in other words, <lb/>
all the portion known as the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territory east of Manitoba and <lb/>
Lake Winnipegoosis, and to create a <lb/>
new territory, which shall in the <lb/>
meantime be governed by the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor of Manitoba. It is uncertain when <lb/>
we may have the boundary on the <lb/>
west and east side of Ontario de<lb break="no"/>termined. The boundaries of the <lb/>
North-West Territories on the east <lb/></p> 



<cb/>
<p>
are equally uncertain, and it is <lb/>
considered desirable in the interest of <lb/>
the good government of the country <lb/>
that we would have this arrangement <lb/>
made. As soon as the western bound<lb break="no"/>ary of Ontario is determined, and if the <lb/>
Province of Manitoba take no action <lb/>
for the enlargement of the boundaries <lb/>
of that Province, another arrangement <lb/>
may be made. <lb/></p> 

<p>The first section of the Bill is de<lb break="no"/>voted entirely to a description of the <lb/>
boundary and the Territory. I cannot <lb/>
remember the name for it at the pre<lb break="no"/>sent, but it is an Indian name. <lb/></p> 

<p>The second section repeals certain <lb/>
provisions which are not made appli<lb break="no"/>cable under this Act. <lb/></p> 

<p>The third section provides that the <lb/>
Lieut.-Governor of Manitoba shall be <lb/>
 <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex officio</hi> Governor of this district. <lb/></p> 

<p>We take power in the fourth section <lb/>
to constitute and appoint a Council if <lb/>
need be. We do not anticipate there <lb/>
will be any necessity for it, nor do we <lb/>
make provision for paying any mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Council. It is merely to en<lb break="no"/>able us, if necessary, to constitute per<lb break="no"/>sons to advise the Lieut.-Governor for <lb/>
the time being. <lb/></p> 

<p>The other provisions of the Act are <lb/>
practically making applicable the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the general Act of last Ses<lb break="no"/>sion and the schedules at the end of the <lb/>
Bill of the Acts that relate to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of the North-West Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p>In the seventh section provision is <lb/>
made for the transmission by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor of that Province to the Governor <lb/>
in Council at Ottawa, within ten days <lb/>
from the passage of any law, a copy <lb/>
thereof: this is in accordance with <lb/>
existing provisions of the law. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MASS2">Mr. MASSON</persName>—I would like to know <lb/>
why clause 11 in the North-West Ter<lb break="no"/>ritories Act is left out of this Bill; <lb/>
whether it has been found unnecessary <lb/>
or impracticable? A great many <lb/>
powers are taken from the Territorial <lb/>
Government, among them those <lb/>
which provide for taxation for local <lb/>
purposes. The Hon. Premier will, of <lb/>
course, give us his reasons for curtail<lb break="no"/>ing powers which, last session, he <lb/>
thought it necessary to confer to so <lb/>
large an extent. I would like to know <lb/>
what means the Local Government <lb/>
will have to provide for improvements <lb/>
and for the education of the people. <lb/>

Will they be obliged to appeal to the <lb/>
Federal Government to provide for <lb/>
these things? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—The Bill is <lb/>
only temporary in its character. Sec<lb break="no"/>tion eleven refers only to the Act of last <lb/>
Session. The laws established by this <lb/>
Bill are those in force at the present <lb/>
moment in the North-West Territories <lb/>
—neither more nor less. The Act of <lb/>
last Session proposed the creation of a <lb/>
municipal system and conferred prac<lb break="no"/>tically all the powers of self-govern<lb break="no"/>ment as a Province. It is only when <lb/>
such powers are exercised that the <lb/>
clause in question comes into opera<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MASS2">Mr. MASSON</persName>—How will the people <lb/>
of that country be educated or provided <lb/>
with public improvements? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—They will <lb/>
have precisely the same power they <lb/>
have at present in the North-West <lb/>
Territories under the existing laws. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Mr. TUPPER</persName>—Does this Bill <lb/>
affect the powers conveyed by the <lb/>
North-West Territories Act, so far as <lb/>
its jurisdiction goes? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—It detaches <lb/>
this section of country from the juris<lb break="no"/>diction of the North-West Territories' <lb/>
Government. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Mr. TUPPER</persName>—Does this Bill <lb/>
provide for Municipal Government? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—It pro<lb break="no"/>vides for no municipal purposes of any <lb/>
kind. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MASS2">Mr. MASSON</persName>—How does it provide <lb/>
for education? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—We make <lb/>
no provision for that in this local Act. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MASS2">Mr. MASSON</persName>—I understand the <lb/>
Government last Session when they in<lb break="no"/>troduced their Bill thought it advisable <lb/>
to provide for education. They now <lb/>
give no power for municipal taxation <lb/>
or the education of the people. Is <lb/>
there any law in that Territory which <lb/>
gives to the people there those rights <lb/>
and privileges assured to them by the <lb/>
11th clause of the Act of last Session? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Hon. Mr. BLAKE</persName>—The Act of last <lb/>
Session has not yet been put in force. <lb/>
At present all the Territories of the <lb/>
North-West are governed from Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. The Act of last Session pro<lb break="no"/> 

<cb/>

posed, and I think rightly proposed a <lb/>
system which gave rudimentary repre<lb break="no"/>sentative institutions coincidently with <lb/>
its going into effect. The Bill of this <lb/>
Session takes off a very small portion <lb/>
of the enormous territories of the <lb/>
North-West for the particular purpose <lb/>
which my hon. friend, the Premier, <lb/>
clearly explained. He pointed out <lb/>
in the present condition of that <lb/>
country, with its comparatively limited <lb/>
means of access, with its vast unsettled <lb/>
plains, and with a portion of the terri<lb break="no"/>tory lying partly east of Manitoba, <lb/>
that it was advisable as a mere tempor<lb break="no"/>ary measure to adopt this system of <lb/>
government in that country for a <lb/>
short time. He pointed out as soon <lb/>
as the boundary of Ontario and the <lb/>
North-West Territories was settled, <lb/>
the question would immediately arise <lb/>
whether a portion of any territory, for <lb/>
present purposes annexed to Manitoba, <lb/>
would belong to that Province. If not <lb/>
annexed to Manitoba it would be under <lb/>
the jurisdiction of the Government at <lb/>
Fort Pelly. If this territory is  <lb/>
annexed to Manitoba the laws of that <lb/>
Province relating to schools will apply <lb/>
to it. If re-anne: ed to the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories, clause 11 of the Act <lb/>
of last Session will apply. But this <lb/>
cannot be done without at the same <lb/>
time conferring powers of taxation, <lb/>
and no such powers can be exercised <lb/>
without representative institutions.— <lb/>
We could not give to the few people <lb/>
there representative institutions, and <lb/>
therefore we continue for that part of <lb/>
the Territories the primitive system of <lb/>
government—the same system which <lb/>
the right hon. gentleman opposite <lb/>
thinks should continue for a long <lb/>
time to come. Now, that is not the <lb/>
view of the Government, as the <lb/>
Premier explained. He said the Act <lb/>
was passed last Session with the inten<lb break="no"/>tion of bringing it into operation at <lb/>
the earliest practicable moment; but <lb/>
pending the settlement of the bound<lb break="no"/>ary question it is proposed to leave <lb/>
the few people who will be outside of <lb/>
this territory in the position that they <lb/>
now occupy. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>—As I <lb/>
stated at the time the Bill was intro<lb break="no"/>duced last Session, I think that terri<lb break="no"/>tory might well be governed from <lb/>
Manitoba without a separate Legisla<lb break="no"/>

 <fw type="num">196</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">The New North-West Territory.</hi></fw> <fw type="running">[COMMONS.]</fw> 

ture, but I did not at all contemplate <lb/>
that country would remain for a long <lb/>
time without a government of its own. <lb/>
My contention was that the constitu<lb break="no"/>tional Governor of Manitoba had so <lb/>
little to do he could economically <lb/>
enough for a good many years govern <lb/>
the whole of the Territories under the <lb/>
provisions of the Bill of last Session. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Hon. Mr. BLAKE</persName>--I am very glad <lb/>
to hear that. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>—The <lb/>
hon. gentleman will find if he looks <lb/>
back that I approved of the Bill, and <lb/>
the only objection was that a separate <lb/>
Government was unnecessary. This <lb/>
Bill is a permanent one on the face of <lb/>
it, and I think a clause should be in<lb break="no"/>troduced to say that it is temporary. <lb/>
Under this Act there can be no taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. Then any expense or cost in <lb/>
working the machinery of the <choice><sic>Govern<lb break="no"/>mernment</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice> of this country will, I take <lb/>
it, be chargeable on the Dominion Trea<lb break="no"/>sury. <lb/></p> 

<p>My hon. friend will no doubt explain <lb/>
later in the Session why the Act of last <lb/>
year was not brought into force. If <lb/>
I recollect aright, when that Bill was <lb/>
introduced to this House, I ventured <lb/>
to state, with the sparse population <lb/>
of the West, outside the boundary of <lb/>
Manitoba, that the Lieut.-Governor of <lb/>
that Province would perform all the <lb/>
duties of government required for a <lb/>
time in the Territories, and there would <lb/>
be no necessity for establishing a sepa<lb break="no"/>rate Government until the country had <lb/>
been better settled. But it was stated <lb/>
by my hon. friend that it was highly <lb/>
expedient that there should be a Lieut-<lb break="yes"/>Governor and a Government appointed <lb/>
for the Territories without any delay. <lb/>
Delay has taken place; and I venture to <lb/>
say that that portion of the country <lb/>
need not be brought under the opera<lb break="no"/>tion of the law at present. The reason <lb/>
is still stronger now than it has been <lb/>
since last Session, as part of the terri<lb break="no"/>tory is taken away under this Act, <lb/>
the part which has the most population. <lb/>
As I understand the boundaries, the <lb/>
bulk of the territory that will come <lb/>
under the provisions of this Act lie to <lb/>
the east of the western boundary of <lb/>
this Province, and to the east and <lb/>
north of the eastern boundary of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba. The majority of the people who <lb/> 

<cb/>

have gone into our Western country <lb/>
are settled in this district; at <lb/>
all events, a large percentage <lb/>
of them have settled about Lake Win<lb break="no"/>nipegoosis in the immediate vicinity of <lb/>
Manitoba, although not within the <lb/>
limits of its jurisdiction; therefore there <lb/>
is less reason for the establishment of <lb/>
the new Government under the Act of <lb/>
last Session. There can be no satis<lb break="no"/>factory legislation by a Government of <lb/>
this kind, even if the population were <lb/>
there, for you cannot have educational <lb/>
legislation or impose taxes. Even <lb/>
though they had Municipal Councils <lb/>
they have not the authority to confer <lb/>
on them powers which they do not pos<lb break="no"/>sess themselves, to impose school taxes; <lb/>
therefore the ordinances passed by the <lb/>
Lieut.-Governor in Council would be <lb/>
of a very unsatisfactory and inadequate <lb/>
description. It would, no doubt, be <lb/>
satisfactory to the House to ascertain <lb/>
how long the hon. gentleman thinks <lb/>
that that country will be governed <lb/>
under this Act. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—There are <lb/>
several reasons why the Act of last <lb/>
Session was not put in force, some of <lb/>
which I can mention to the House. In <lb/>
the first place it was very desirable we <lb/>
should obtain the utmost possible in<lb break="no"/>formation as to the probably distribu<lb break="no"/>tion of population that would settle in <lb/>
the different districts of country. The <lb/>
Great Lone Land, as Mr. Butler terms it, <lb/>
was but imperfectly known, and it is <lb/>
only by recent explorations that many <lb/>
facts concerning it have come to our <lb/>
knowledge—facts that seem to be essen<lb break="no"/>tial in considering the question of creat<lb break="no"/>ing the seat of Government. We had de<lb break="no"/>termined on a vigorous course of action <lb/>
with regard to the expulsion of offenders <lb/>
by the North-West Mounted Police, <lb/>
and through their efforts we have been <lb/>
able to vindicate the majesty of the <lb/>
British law in these territories. By <lb/>
their means we have been enabled to <lb/>
acquire a great deal of information <lb/>
respecting the settlement and resources <lb/>
of certain parts of the country of which <lb/>
very little was previously known. <lb/>
We find that a large population is <lb/>
rapidly settling at the north bend of the <lb/>
Saskatchewan River, where there is a <lb/>
population already of between 500 and <lb/>
1,000 souls. South of that, where the <lb/>
railway is to cross, the land at the south <lb/>

branch is being located, and one person <lb/>
has erected a saw and grist mill this <lb/>
year. Assuming the Jaspar House and <lb/>
Lake Winnipeg are the central points, <lb/>
the place where we shall likely estab<lb break="no"/>lish the seat of Government is 250 <lb/>
miles from Fort Pelly, and 550 miles <lb/>
distant from the town of Winnipeg. <lb/>
At one time we thought Fort Pelly <lb/>
was the best place for the establish<lb break="no"/>ment of the Government House, but <lb/>
other information leads us to the con<lb break="no"/>clusion that it would be better to <lb/>
remove it further west. A vast terri<lb break="no"/>tory can be developed, and is now <lb/>
partly developed, in the Peace River <lb/>
District. Fort Pelly appears to be too <lb/>
far east, and Government would be <lb/>
more difficult if located there than if <lb/>
it were established at the center of the <lb/>
Territories. It is already difficult to <lb/>
reach remote settlements by any <lb/>
authority that we can put in <lb/>
motion, and we must have an <lb/>
authority that can easily extend to the <lb/>
different points. The place which we <lb/>
shall probably select as the seat of <lb/>
Government must be one favourable <lb/>
for the location of a considerable <lb/>
town; it ought also to be favourable <lb/>
as an agriculatural district, with an <lb/>
abundance of fuel and timber, and <lb/>
easy access from the different posts <lb/>
established by the Government in the <lb/>
Territories. I have far less doubt now <lb/>
than ever of the wisdom of establish<lb break="no"/>ing this authority, and of the utter <lb/>
impossibility of the Governor of Mani<lb break="no"/>toba governing that vast territory. <lb/>
The Indian question itself, is a very <lb/>
serious one. We have found it neces<lb break="no"/>sary to ask Lieut.-Governor Morris, <lb/>
who has devoted himself earnestly and <lb/>
with an assiduity beyond all praise to <lb/>
make himself useful in developing that <lb/>
territory, to travel 200 or 300 miles <lb/>
to meet the Indians in treaty, and <lb/>
it was impossible for him to make <lb/>
that journey in less than two or three <lb/>
weeks. We cannot expect him, when <lb/>
we are obliged to meet and treat with <lb/>
other Indian bands in the Far West, to <lb/>
leave his Government for eight weeks <lb/>
at a time on this business. We find it <lb/>
necessary therefore to have another <lb/>
officer of superior rank, equal to that of <lb/>
the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, <lb/>
to meet those Indians, although <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor Morris has not <lb/>

<cb/>

his hands so full that he could not <lb/>
give his attention to more work in his <lb/>
immediate vicinity. It is a different <lb/>
thing when he is asked to travel 400 <lb/>
or 500 miles from his own Province, <lb/>
when matters pertaining to the Terri<lb break="no"/>tories would demand his consideration. <lb/>
I have felt myself at liberty to consult <lb/>
with Lieutenant Governor Morris on <lb/>
all these matters. Although we were <lb/>
not politically allied, it does not pre<lb break="no"/>vent us from entering cordially into <lb/>
matters connected with these Terri<lb break="no"/>tories, and it was entirely his opinion, <lb/>
as well as the opinion of this Adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, that until this boundary ques<lb break="no"/>tion between Ontario and the North-<lb break="yes"/>West Territories is settled, the portion <lb/>
east of Manitoba should be governed by <lb/>
the authority settled in that Province. <lb/>
We cannot apply the laws of Onatrio <lb/>
to any part of that territory, although <lb/>
it may belong to this Province, until <lb/>
the boundary is decided on. Ontario <lb/>
claims the whole of it to Manitoba; <lb/>
while others assume that the boundary <lb/>
is as far east as Fort William, and that <lb/>
the terminus of the Pacific Railway <lb/>
there is really in the North-West <lb/>
Territories. If all the territory west <lb/>
of Fort William is given to Ontario, <lb/>
then the laws in relation to Onatrio <lb/>
will come into immediate operation <lb/>
there; on the other hand if the North-<lb break="yes"/>West boundary is found to be at Fort <lb/>
William, then the laws applicable to <lb/>
the North-West Territories will be en<lb break="no"/>forced there, and we can conceive of no <lb/>
difficulty that can arise that will prevent <lb/>
us from being able to determine these <lb/>
boundaries by legislation next Session <lb/>
of Parliament. The only settlement <lb/>
of any consequence east of Lakes Win<lb break="no"/>nipegoosis and Manitoba, is the settle<lb break="no"/>ment of Icelanders on the shores of <lb/>
Lake Winnipeg. There are very few <lb/>
settlers in that region, and though our <lb/>
friends claim that there is but little <lb/>
land in that direction that can be <lb/>
settled, recent explorations have lead <lb/>
us to a different opinion. Settlement <lb/>
has gone south of Lake Manitoba, <lb/>
and north of Lake Winnipeg there <lb/>
is also a very considerable settle<lb break="no"/>ment. The prospect is that there will <lb/>
also be a very large population on the <lb/>
slope of the Rocky Mountains, where <lb/>
Colonel McLeod is stationed with the <lb/>
Mounted Police force, near Fort Benton. <lb/>

198 The New North-West [COMMONS] Territory.

Our officers there collected in some<lb break="no"/>thing like six months $6,000 in duties <lb/>
on articles imported from the United <lb/>
States. The territory there is develop<lb break="no"/>ing into a very rich country. It is a <lb/>
very fine grazing section, although <lb/>
from its greater elevation it is a little <lb/>
more subject to frosts than the other <lb/>
parts of the country of less elevation. <lb/>
There can be no doubt that the country <lb/>
from Lake St. Henry to the North <lb/>
Saskatchewan and a little beyond it is <lb/>
eminently favourable for settlement. <lb/>
There is a steady descent from the <lb/>
boundary northward. At the boundary <lb/>
the elevation of the prairie land is not <lb/>
far from 5,000 feet. At the Jaspar <lb/>
House it is about 3,500 feet on the <lb/>
average. Progressing northward to<lb break="no"/>wards Smoky River, it is not more <lb/>
than 2,000 feet. Where the Peace River <lb/>
bends southward we find that the eleva<lb break="no"/>tion of the prairie is not much more <lb/>
than 1,000 feet above the level of the <lb/>
sea, and with its declination north <lb/>
the climate grows milder, and the iso<lb break="no"/>thermal lines appear to follow the level <lb/>
of the country. This indicates two <lb/>
things:—That there is a rich country fit <lb/>
for settlement from the United States <lb/>
boundary all the way north to Lake <lb/>
Arthabaska, and that as we go north<lb break="no"/>ward the land is better than in the south. <lb/>
There is no reason why a very large <lb/>
population should not pass into that <lb/>
vast country, stretching northward <lb/>
seven hundred miles, and enjoy a <lb/>
climate as favourable as in any part of <lb/>
Canada proper, except, perhaps, the <lb/>
south-west peninsula of Ontario. These <lb/>
considerations render it necessary, in <lb/>
our opinion, that this central authority <lb/>
should be established; that the people <lb/>
abroad who read our reports and seek <lb/>
for information about our country <lb/>
should understand that we have not <lb/>
merely an immense extent of fertile <lb/>
territory in the North-West, but that <lb/>
it is in a position that law and order <lb/>
can be enforced; that there is nothing <lb/>
to be feared from the wandering tribes <lb/>
of aborigines, and that everything has <lb/>
been done to prepare for the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion and settlement of the large popu<lb break="no"/>lation that may naturally be expected <lb/>
to arrive from Europe. These measures <lb/>
have been adopted after due considera<lb break="no"/>tion, and the Bill is to provide for a <lb/>
difficulty of only temporary existence <lb/>

<cb/>

in consequence of the delay in ascer<lb break="no"/>taining the western boundary of <lb/>
Ontario and the eastern boundary of <lb/>
the North-West Territories. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACD1">Sir JOHN A. MACDONALD</persName>—My <lb/>
hon. friend will see that a permanent <lb/>
Act doing away what that clause might <lb/>
create misunderstanding, and probably <lb/>
dissatisfaction. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>—I shall <lb/>
consider whether it will be necessary <lb/>
to insert the words mentioned before <lb/>
the third reading of the Bill. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:KIRK3">Mr. KIRKPATRICK</persName>—I think it very <lb/>
desirable that it should be a temporary <lb/>
Act, for in its wording I think that there <lb/>
are some very objectionable features. It <lb/>
assumes the delegation of our authority, <lb/>
not only to the Governor in the Council, but <lb/>
further to the Lieutenant-Governor in <lb/>
Council, and the Lieutenant-Governor <lb/>
is to have the authority and power of <lb/>
altering our laws; that is, he is to have <lb/>
greater power than we give to any Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Legislature, greater than we <lb/>
gave last year to the Lieutenant-Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor in Council, in the North-West <lb/>
Territory, advised by an Elective <lb/>
Council. I do not think that is right, <lb/>
nor do I consider that it was intended <lb/>
such power should be granted to <lb/>
an irresponsible body, or the Lieuten<lb break="no"/>ant-Governor in Council. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen present, who were in the House <lb/>
some years ago, will remember how <lb/>
sarcastically the present Chief Justice <lb/>
of Manitoba used to refer to this new <lb/>
institution of the Governor in Council; <lb/>
and this is now to be extended in a most <lb/>
remarkable manner. We are delegating <lb/>
these powers to the Lieutenant-Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor, with the power of altering, <lb/>
amending, and modifying any Acts, or <lb/>
Act, of the Parliament of Canada, or <lb/>
any parts thereof. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Hon. Mr. BLAKE</persName>—Would my hon. <lb/>
friend allow me to tell him that this is <lb/>
simply a consolidation of the laws <lb/>
under which that Territory is governed <lb/>
to-day? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:KIRK3">Mr. KIRKPATRICK</persName>—I think that <lb/>
my hon. friend is mistaken, I cannot <lb/>
find it in the North-West Territories <lb/>
Act. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Hon. Mr. BLAKE</persName>—I am not speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the North-West Territories Act <lb/>
of 1875, which is not in force, but of <lb/>
laws passed by my hon. friend's leader. <lb/></p>

 <p><persName ref="pers:KIRK3">Mr. KIRKPATRICK</persName>—If the right <lb/>
hon. gentleman passed an objectionable <lb/>
law, I do not think that we should <lb/>
re-enact it. It is no reason because he <lb/>
is an ass, that you should be a basilisk. <lb/>
This would be over-riding the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion of the country, and I think that <lb/>
when my hon. friend, the Minister of <lb/>
Justice, looks into it closely, he will see <lb/>
what I contend is really the case. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Hon. Mr. BLAKE</persName>—I may say in <lb/>
answer to my hon. friend that this <lb/>
Bill has been, I believe, prepared with <lb/>
great care. Instructions were given <lb/>
that this should be done in the consolida<lb break="no"/>tion of the existing laws under which <lb/>
the territory is governed. We repeal <lb/>
the three Acts which are at present in <lb/>
force there, and simply re-enact a <lb/>
a measure giving precisely the same <lb/>
powers; we did not intend to alter, <lb/>
and I do not believe that we have <lb/>
altered, these powers in any particular. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Mr. TUPPER</persName>—I would like to <lb/>
ask the Head of the Government at <lb/>
what time he proposes to put the <lb/>
North-West Territories Act into opera<lb break="no"/>tion? <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Mr. MACKENZIE</persName>— I cannot <lb/>
answer that question at the present <lb/>
moment. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Mr. Tupper</persName>— With reference <lb/>
to this Bill I congratulate the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment on the conclusion at which they <lb/>
have arrived, after careful considera<lb break="no"/>tion, concerning the other measure. <lb/></p> 

<p>Last year we had the North-West <lb/>
Territories Bill introduced and <lb/>
passed. Provision had formerly been <lb/>
made for the Government of that Pro<lb break="no"/>vince by the Government of Manitoba, <lb/>
and a Council composed of a <lb/>
number of gentlemen of high standing <lb/>
and of great ability, who had given a <lb/>
great deal of time and attention to any <lb/>
legislation, or any measures found <lb/>
necessary in this connection. The <lb/>
Administration thought it wise to intro<lb break="no"/>duce a Bill last Session, for the govern<lb break="no"/>ment of these Territories, abolishing <lb/>
this unpaid Council, and providing for <lb/>
the appointment of an independent and <lb/>
separate Government and Council, with <lb/>
the varioous other machinery required. <lb/>
It was also at the time announced <lb/>
to the House that it was the intention <lb/>
to establish that Government at Fort <lb/>
Pelly. It appeared to me that it would <lb/>

<cb/>

be wise to pause before incurring this <lb/>
new expenditure. We had already all <lb/>
that was necessary for the government <lb/>
of Manitoba. This Session we are <lb/>
asked to create a new authority, <lb/>
and what was the reason given? <lb/>
That there was a number of in<lb break="no"/>habitants in the adjacent district, and <lb/>
that it was desirable that they should <lb/>
be brought under the influence of the <lb/>
Local Government, but only until the <lb/>
time when the boundaries were <choice><sic>estab<lb break="no"/>tablished</sic><corr>established</corr></choice> between Ontario and the <lb/>
North-West Territory. I undersood  <lb/>
my hon. friend to say he hoped that <lb/>
matter would be adjusted when <lb/>
Parliament would meet at the next <lb/>
Session. If this be the case I cannot <lb/>
understand why we should go to this <lb/>
expense. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:MACK1">Hon. Messrs. MACKENZIE</persName> and  <lb/>
 <persName ref="pers:BLAK1">BLAKE</persName>— There will be no expense. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Mr. TUPPER</persName>— The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen provides for the establishment of <lb/>
a Council. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:BLAK1">Hon. Mr. BLAKE</persName>— There will not <lb/>
be a dollar of expense. <lb/></p> 

 <p><persName ref="pers:TUPP1">Hon. Mr. TUPPER</persName>— Very well, <lb/>
I do not then understand why it is <lb/>
necessary to alter the North-West <lb/>
Territories Act in relation to this <lb/>
section, if it is intended to put the Act <lb/>
in force at all, especially when my hon. <lb/>
friend told the House that he in<lb break="no"/>tended to ask for different legislation <lb/>
at the next Session of Parliament <lb/>
touching this matter. This is a <lb/>
question to which I am sure the House <lb/>
will give its most careful consider<lb break="no"/>ation. I think that the facts <lb/>
quite justify a postponement as <lb/>
well as the wisdom of obtaining still <lb/>
further legislation with respect to this <lb/>
whole country before we materially <lb/>
change its form of Administration. <lb/>
It is besides inexpedient to adopt <lb/>
legislation for a single season. No <lb/>
doubt, it is very important that what <lb/>
is designed for new countries in this <lb/>
relation, shall be changed as seldom as <lb/>
possible, for the people have become famil<lb break="no"/>iar with laws of a certain kind, and <lb/>
with a certain mode of Government, <lb/>
and it is not well that a year after<lb break="no"/>wards this legislation should be swept <lb/>
away to be replaced by another system. <lb/>
Experience shows the wisdom of a little <lb/>
delay in connection with such matters, <lb/>

  <fw type="num">200</fw> <fw type="running"><hi rendition="simple:italic">Salaries of County Court Judges.</hi></fw> <fw type="running">[COMMONS.]</fw> 

and we should comply with the dictates <lb/>
of experience in the present instance, <lb/>
if we permit the measure to stand <lb/>
over for a time. <lb/></p> 

<p><persName ref="pers:SMIT3">Mr. SMITH</persName> (Selkirk)—It must be <lb/>
evident to everyone, and more <lb/>
especially to those who are intimately <lb/>
acquainted with the subject, that a <lb/>
territory of such vast extent, cannot be <lb/>
properly and suitably governed from <lb/>
a point so distant as Winnipeg. At the <lb/>
same time I was very glad to hear the <lb/>
observations and explanations given by <lb/>
the Prime Minister—and that is, that <lb/>
the seat of Government of the pro<lb break="no"/>posed new Province is to be removed <lb/>
a considerable distance further west. <lb/>
In the North-West there are already <lb/>
very large settlements at different <lb/>
points near Bow River and the South <lb/>
Saskatchewan, and again beyond <lb/>
Edmonton, and at Fort Albert, &amp;c.,— <lb/>
perhaps altogether comprising four or <lb/>
five thousand people; but there <lb/>
is also a district to the north of <lb/>
that again, equally well fitted <lb/>
for settlement with the region <lb/>
south of the Saskatchewan. A few <lb/>
days ago I received a letter from a <lb/>
gentleman in the Peace River District, <lb/>
who has travelled over the greater <lb/>
portion of the northern part of the <lb/>
territory, and he states his belief that <lb/>
for one acre of good land to the south <lb/>
of the Saskatchewan, there are five <lb/>
acres to the north. I am not quite so <lb/>
sanguine; but, at the same time, I <lb/>
know that there is a very large extent <lb/>
of country to the north which is as <lb/>
well suited for settlement as the portion <lb/>
to the south. Settlers will come both <lb/>
from the United States in the direction <lb/>
of Bow River, and also from British <lb/>
Columbia and the United States by <lb/>
way of Peace River, and it is abso<lb break="no"/>lutely necessary that there should be <lb/>
some legal Government to give atten<lb break="no"/>tion to any difficulties which may arise. <lb/></p> 

<p>It must be further recollected that <lb/>
in this portion of the Territory, the <lb/>
great body of the Indian population is <lb/>
found; there are very different to <lb/>
those in the south, and if there are any <lb/>
troubles to be experienced, danger is to <lb/>
to be apprehended from the Indian <lb/>
tribes living on the upper portion of <lb/>
the Saskatchewan. I do not, myself, <lb/>
fear any such troubles, but many do, <lb/> 


<cb/>

and I consider that it would be only <lb/>
prudent to take the necessary precau<lb break="no"/>tions. With regard to the section it is <lb/>
proposed to detach from the North-West <lb/>
Territory, I am of opinion that the <lb/>
provisions of the former Act would be <lb/>
found quite sufficient for the time <lb/>
being. That Act has been there <lb/>
administered during three or four <lb/>
years by a Council, which instead <lb/>
of having too much power, I consider <lb/>
had scarcely enough authority in <lb/>
several instances. Indeed, it was more <lb/>
an Advisory Council than anything <lb/>
else, and the Government has really <lb/>
been controlled from Ottawa; but <lb/>
nevertheless I must say that the <lb/>
Dominion Government has, on most <lb/>
occasions, given every consideration to <lb/>
the recommendations of this Council, <lb/>
and carried them out. I do think that <lb/>
for the moment the provisions of the <lb/>
old Act will be quite sufficient as <lb/>
regards the comparatively small portion <lb/>
settled, and of the district which it is <lb/>
to detach, nine-tenths or ninety-nine <lb/>
hundredths, or nine hundred and <lb/>
ninety-nine thousandths, will have no <lb/>
settlement for many, many years <lb/>
to come; and neither require legis<lb break="no"/>lation respecting taxation or schools, <lb/>
or almost any other purpose dur<lb break="no"/>ing that period. Settlement will be <lb/>
somewhat tardy between the Lakes <lb/>
Winnipegoosis and Winnipeg, also <lb/>
a small portion near the mouth <lb/>
of the Winnipeg River, and possibly <lb/>
near Fort Francis or Rainy <lb/>
River. I trust that the Government <lb/>
will persevere with the measure, and <lb/>
carry out the promises of the Act of <lb/>
last Session as concerns the large sec<lb break="no"/>tion of the territory west and north of <lb/>
Lake Winnipegoosis, which can be <lb/>
properly governed by any Council such <lb/>
as that which is proposed for the por<lb break="no"/>tion to be detached in this Bill. <lb/></p> 

<p>The Bill was read the second time. <lb/></p>
