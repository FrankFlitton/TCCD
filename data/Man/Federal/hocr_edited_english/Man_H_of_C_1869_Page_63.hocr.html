               petitions which had come in had been carried 
               <br />
               round by bank clerks (hear, hear), and an ex- 
               <br />
               pression had been forced from the country. 
               <br />
               He deprecated entering into a controversy 
               <br />
               with the large and important interests of the 
               <br />
               country; but a government unable to deal with 
               <br />
               such a question was unworthy of its position. 
               <br />
               It had been represented that the Government 
               <br />
               should have been overawed by this manifesta- 
               <br />
               tion of public opinion; but the same opposition 
               <br />
               had been manifested in England to Sir Robert 
               <br />
               Peel’s measure, the same opposition had to be 
               <br />
               overcome in France; and the same in India 
               <br />
               when Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Lang, introduced 
               <br />
               a measure similar in principle to that em- 
               <br />
               bodied in these resolutions. He wished it to be 
               <br />
               remembered that there were three distinct sys- 
               <br />
               tems now in operation within the Dominion, 
               <br />
               and the large public works going on in the 
               <br />
               East, and soon to be going on in the West, 
               <br />
               would create a larger field for banking opera- 
               <br />
               tions, that would render these three separate 
               <br />
               systems utterly unreliable and dangerous to 
               <br />
               the public interests. His hon. friend had 
               <br />
               spoken as if there was entirely a new sys- 
               <br />
               tem of banking proposed; but the only changes 
               <br />
               in the system were with respect to the power 
               <br />
               of the banks to issue notes. When they found 
               <br />
               themselves at the beginning of a new national 
               <br />
               existence they required a policy suited to the 
               <br />
               altered circumstances of the country. This 
               <br />
               measure had been spoken of as a proposal by 
               <br />
               the Government to take from the banks the 
               <br />
               powers they possessed, but was that the case? 
               <br />
               The bank charters are about to expire; the 
               <br />
               powers of the banks are about to lapse, and 
               <br />
               as they come to ask for a renewal of their 
               <br />
               charters the Government lay down the condi- 
               <br />
               tions upon which these charters may be ex- 
               <br />
               tended. This was a very different measure 
               <br />
               from that of Sir Robert Peel, which prohibi- 
               <br />
