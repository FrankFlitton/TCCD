               terminable negotiation, he thought it a wise 
               <br />
               step to close up the matter at once. He had 
               <br />
               never doubted that the Hudson’s Bay Com- 
               <br />
               pany had territorial rights in certain sections. 
               <br />
               But on the other hand he never had any 
               <br />
               doubt that they had no territorial rights in 
               <br />
               any portion of the territory likely to become 
               <br />
               valuable to this country. He dissented alto- 
               <br />
               gether from the view expressed by the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Public Works, who considered the 
               <br />
               payment of one million and a half net a large 
               <br />
               sum to get possession of all the North Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan Valley, Hudson’s Bay and what- 
               <br />
               ever portion of Labrador the Company had. 
               <br />
               There was one matter which the delegates 
               <br />
               ought to have insisted on more strongly. From 
               <br />
               Sir Stafford Northcote’s letter it was easily 
               <br />
               to be inferred that he thought the claim of 
               <br />
               the Company to the fertile Belt could not be 
               <br />
               maintained, and he could not conceive why, 
               <br />
               under the circumstances, the delegates should 
               <br />
               have assented to the Company’s getting one- 
               <br />
               twentieth of this fertile tract to which they 
               <br />
               could maintain no title. He observed too, that 
               <br />
               the Canadian delegates in their note conveying 
               <br />
               the acceptance of the terms offered require 
               <br />
               that the proposal should be accepted pure 
               <br />
               and simple as submitted by Earl Granville, 
               <br />
               but the hon. gentleman subsequently accepted 
               <br />
               a modification of these terms, which was, in 
               <br />
               his (Mr. Mackenzie’s) opinion, very objec- 
               <br />
               tionable. By Earl Granville’s letter the North 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan was made the boundary of the 
               <br />
               fertile belt in which the Company might 
               <br />
               choose lands; but our delegates agreed to 
               <br />
               allow the Company to choose their one-twen-<br />
               tieth on the north instead of the south branch 
               <br />
               of the Saskatchewan. The best portion of the 
               <br />
               land being on the north branch, it would be 
               <br />
               seen that the Company would in this instance 
               <br />
               make a most proﬁtable exchange. Then, again, 
               <br />
               the delegates most unwisely agreed to the 
               <br />
               proposition that the townships to be formed 
               <br />
               on the north branch should not extend to a 
               <br />
               greater depth than ﬁve miles. In that case, 
               <br />
               the Company could obtain their twentieth 
               <br />
               within ﬁve miles of the river, while the 
               <br />
               settlers would have to go beyond the ﬁve 
               <br />
               miles, and allow the Company’s land to be 
               <br />
               in front. The Company ought to have been 
               <br />
               bound to accept their one-twentieth in every 
               <br />
               section of the survey, no matter how far 
               <br />
               north it extended. Again, another condition 
               <br />
               agreed to was that no taxation should be 
               <br />
               imposed for a period of 10 years on the Com- 
               <br />
               pany’s land. In this way it was agreed that 
               <br />
               the Company should not be bound to select 
               <br />
               their twentieth till the expiration of ten years, 
               <br />
               and during that period they would have the 
               <br />
               right to withhold the taxes from the munici- 
               <br />
               palities which might be formed.
