               held in Norfolk in order to consider whether 
               <br />
               it was possible for that hon. gentleman to 
               <br />
               secure his re-election. The meeting, he pre- 
               <br />
               sumed, turned out to be rather unsatisfactory 
               <br />
               in its results, and a careful investigation of 
               <br />
               the wording of the Act enabled the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment to come to the conclusion that it was 
               <br />
               possible, in violation of the spirit of the law, 
               <br />
               to allow the hon. gentleman to continue to sit 
               <br />
               here without obtaining from his constituents 
               <br />
               their sanction to his acceptance of ofﬁce. How 
               <br />
               were they to know to what extent this might 
               <br />
               not be pushed; if this were permitted what 
               <br />
               safeguard was there against the ﬁlling of this 
               <br />
               House with <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">office-holders?</span> During the last 
               <br />
               session of Parliament there had been con- 
               <br />
               siderable discussion on matters of economy; 
               <br />
               and the hon. gentleman with whom he 
               <br />
               claimed connection, had endeavoured to en- 
               <br />
               force economical principles on the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment. Various large amounts were asked 
               <br />
               for by the Administration. They wanted 
               <br />
               $5,000,000 for fortiﬁcations; but in common 
               <br />
               with others he had contended most earnestly 
               <br />
               against granting any such sum for the forti-<br />
               ﬁcation of an impossible frontier. It had 
               <br />
               been claimed by the Minister of Justice that 
               <br />
               Mr. Howe had not taken a position against 
               <br />
               the Government, having come here pledged 
               <br />
               to adherence to no party in the House. Now 
               <br />
               he (Mr. Mackenzie) had happened to have 
               <br />
               taken down the words of that distinguished 
               <br />
               gentleman. He desired to speak with all pos- 
               <br />
               sible respect of him and say as little as 
               <br />
               possible against him until he was present, 
               <br />
               if he was to be present, and able to defend 
               <br />
               himself. But speaking of the acquisition of 
               <br />
               the North-West Territory, Mr. Howe said— 
               <br />
               “in speaking on this question, I shall try 
               <br />
               to consider myself a Canadian, and speak 
               <br />
               from that point of view.” Mr. Howe then 
               <br />
               spoke as a Canadian, supposing the Union to 
               <br />
               be consummated. He was not speaking merely 
               <br />
               as a Nova Scotian, but he gave his views as a 
               <br />
               distinguished member of the House, and 
               <br />
               these views were not only hostile, but <span style="font-style: italic;">bitterly</span> 
               <br />
               hostile to the hon. gentlemen opposite. 
               <br />
               (Hear, hear.) Who did not recollect the 
               <br />
               powerful language in which he denounced 
               <br />
               the entire fortiﬁcation scheme of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment and ridiculed the absurdity of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion Government, assuming control of the 
               <br />
               management of the far North-West. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman then seemed to prefer rather 
               <br />
               that the territory should fall into the hands 
               <br />
               of <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">the United</span> States, than that it should be- 
               <br />
               come part and parcel of the Dominion. On 
               <br />
               that policy he was at entire variance with 
               <br />
               the Government, and it would be instructive 
               <br />
               to know whether he has reversed his opinion 
               <br />
               on this question, or whether the Government
