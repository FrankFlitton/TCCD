               bound to say, however, that so far as he

               could judge from the papers which had been 
               <br />
               published, he conceived we had nothing

               whatever to congratulate ourselves upon 
               <br />
               in the result of the mission to England.

               <br />
               he could judge from these papers, that our 
               <br />

               We had now, perhaps, an opportunity of
