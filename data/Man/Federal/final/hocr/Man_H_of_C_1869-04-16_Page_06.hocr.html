               Mr. Bolton, in seconding the Address, said 
               <br />
               he would not trouble the House at any great 
               <br />
               length. It was gratifying to have His Excel- 
               <br />
               lency’s assurances of the prevalence of peace- 
               <br />
               ful counsels among the nations of the earth, 
               <br />
               giving the Dominion the assurance that it 
               <br />
               might continue to enjoy the peace it had 
               <br />
               hitherto been blessed with. In future, he 
               <br />
               trusted their resources would be devoted to 
               <br />
               the extension of the peaceful and industrial 
               <br />
               interests of the Dominion. In view of pros- 
               <br />
               pective large additions to the Dominion, it 
               <br />
               was to be hoped that those peaceful senti- 
               <br />
               ments would continue to prevail, and that 
               <br />
               the resources of the Dominion would be large- 
               <br />
               ly increased. Having expressed his grati- 
               <br />
               ﬁcation that Newfoundland had asked for 
               <br />
               admission into the Union, he expressed the 
               <br />
               pleasure he felt at the prospect that the dis- 
               <br />
               content of Nova Scotia would be allayed. He 
               <br />
               was sure that for wrong done to Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               if any, reparation would be made. That was 
               <br />
               something against which not a voice would 
               <br />
               be raised. There were other topics of great 
               <br />
               importance alluded to in the speech; but they 
               <br />
               did not at that stage require a more extended 
               <br />
               notice. He had great pleasure in seconding 
               <br />
               the motion for the adoption of the address.
