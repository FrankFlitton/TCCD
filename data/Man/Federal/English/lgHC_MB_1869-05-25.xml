               next the House resolve itself into Committee

               of the Whole to consider the North-West

               resolutions, which he said were not yet print<lb break="no"/>ed, on account of yesterday having been a

               holiday. They would be in the hands of mem<lb break="no"/>bers to-morrow. The object of the resolutions 
               <lb/>
               was merely to give effect to the preliminary 
               <lb/>
               arrangement entered into by the Minister of

               <lb/>
               which had been ratiﬁed by their colleagues.

               The report and all the correspondence with

               reference to this important subject, were in 
               <lb/>
               the hands of members, and he hoped there 
               <lb/>
               would be no objection to his making this 
               <lb/>
               motion, although the resolutions were not 
               <lb/>
               printed, his objection being to expedite busi<lb break="no"/>ness.

               Sir George E. Cartier begged also to state 
               <lb/>
               that two despatches had been accidentally

               of members before the discussion came on. 
               <lb/>
               They were a despatch from the Colonial Sec<lb break="no"/>retary acknowledging the reply to the ad<lb break="no"/>dress by both Houses of Parliament, and his 
               <lb/>
               subsequent despatch stating that on account

               advised not to comply with the request in the

               address. This despatch was mentioned in one 
               <lb/>
               of the resolutions which it was intended to
