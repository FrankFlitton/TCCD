               Hon. Mr. Connell addressed the House at 
               <br />
               considerable length. The question before them 
               <br />
               was undoubtedly one of the very greatest im- 
               <br />
               portance to the Dominion. It was a question 
               <br />
               not merely of accession of territory, but one 
               <br />
               which must for weal or woe affect the desti- 
               <br />
               nies of the Dominion for all time to come 
               <br />
               (hear, hear). During the last session he had ob- 
               <br />
               jected to the course pursued by the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment in this matter, on somewhat similar 
               <br />
               grounds to those more recently alluded to by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Sherbrooke,——that this 
               <br />
               territory should be purchased by the Imperial, 
               <br />
               and not the Dominion authorities,—if purchas- 
               <br />
               ed at all. And he had also objected, because 
               <br />
               the people of New Brunswick did not under- 
               <br />
               stand, at Confederation, that any such pur- 
               <br />
               chase was needed. Not merely in New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, but in Nova Scotia the people 
               <br />
               were led to believe by the public men 
               <br />
               of Canada that this territory belonged to 
               <br />
               Canada; and, speaking as a representa- 
               <br />
               tive from New Brunswick, he was well 
               <br />
               aware that the action of the Ministry in bring- 
               <br />
               ing down a measure authorizing them to pur- 
               <br />
               chase this territory, was altogether unexpected 
               <br />
               by the people of his Province. He had carefully 
               <br />
               looked over the records connected with this 
               <br />
               Hudson Bay Territory, and had long ago come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that the company had rights 
               <br />
               to a portion of that territory—the northern 
               <br />
               or fur-bearing section; but that the other por-
