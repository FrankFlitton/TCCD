<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That the native tribes have diminished in
<br />
numbers during the past two centuries is <br />
without doubt, though there is some difﬁculty <br />
of agreement amongst travellers and others <br />
as to the exact causes. On this point no par— <br />
ticular beneﬁt can arise from speculation, and, <br />
concording the fact, the question arises, how <br />
is it best to treat with Indians whenever their <br />
rights of property will interfere with the <br />
opening up of the country, whether merely <br />
for roads of approach or for actual settle- <br />
ment? It is true that the Hudson Bay Com- <br />
pany have not hesitated to take whatever <br />
lands they required, unasked and unmolested, <br />
their interests not being inimical to those of <br />
the Indians. Under the Government of this <br />
Dominion, and with the system of free grants <br />
of lands, agricultural and mineral, a new state <br />
of things thus inaugurated will require, and <br />
doubtless receive, a wise and judicious course <br />
of action. That the Indians consider them- <br />
selves “Lords of the Soil,” is evident from the <br />
reports of Mr. Dawson and others. This will <br />
also, no doubt, form one of the primary con- <br />
siderations of Government. So long as the <br />
operations are conﬁned to providing access to <br />
Red River and the adjacent country, no great <br />
difﬁculty will likely arise in dealing with the <br />
Indians, who have already signiﬁed their wil- <br />
lingness to grant a right of way. However, <br />
with a view of protecting those who may be <br />
attracted to this rich and fertile region, in <br />
search of either mineral or <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">agricultural</span>
wealth, <br />
a large and comprehensive treaty will be <br />
found necessary. Of the accuracy of this state- <br />
ment, both Canada and the United States <br />
have precedents in previous treaties. <br />
