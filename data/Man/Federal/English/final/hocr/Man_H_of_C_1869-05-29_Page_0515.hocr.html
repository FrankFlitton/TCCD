               Sir George E. <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cartier</span> moved the second 
               <br />
               reading of the Bill respecting Patents of In- 
               <br />
               vention, from the Senate. It was, he said, the 
               <br />
               same in many respects as the Bill adopted 
               <br />
               by <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> House last Session, with an additional 
               <br />
               clause enabling a person in New Brunswick 
               <br />
               or elsewhere in the Dominion to obtain under 
               <br />
               the new measure a patent which could cover 
               <br />
               the whole territory in the Dominion, provided 
               <br />
               that he was a British subject, and that the 
               <br />
               subject matter of the invention had not been 
               <br />
               already used in any other part of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion. To some extent, also, this measure 
               <br />
               amended a provision of the former law ap- 
               <br />
               plicable to the late Province of Canada. By 
               <br />
               that law it was necessary that an applicant 
               <br />
               for a patent should be a British subject; but 
               <br />
               by the present measure, a residence in any 
               <br />
               of the Provinces for a year or more, irre- 
               <br />
               spective of being a British subject, entitled 
               <br />
               a person to apply for a patent. Under the 
               <br />
               former Bill, a person introducing an inven- 
               <br />
               tion from any foreign country except Eng- 
               <br />
               land or the States, could get a patent for it 
               <br />
               here. That provision of the law was now set 
               <br />
               aside, as the present moment, when negotia- 
               <br />
               tions were expected between ourselves and 
               <br />
               the States in regard to reciprocity, was hard- 
               <br />
               ly the time for conceding to the Americans 
               <br />
               any advantage. Nothing could be done in 
               <br />
               that way until they had established more 
               <br />
               reciprocal commercial relations between the 
               <br />
               two countries.

               Mr. Mackenzie desired to ask an explana-

               in New Brunswick were to be made to cover 
               <br />
