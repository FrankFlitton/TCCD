               tion, the fertile belt, belonged to Canada, 
               <br />
               (hear, hear). Hon. gentlemen would see that in 
               <br />
               sanctioning the resolutions before the House 
               <br />
               they assumed a great deal of responsibility. 
               <br />
               But they had now virtually assumed that 
               <br />

               responsibility, and must see to it that they 
               <br />
               made their position a good one. He could easily 
               <br />
               <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">see</span> that in passing these resolutions we might, 
               <br />
               in some respects, be only doing that which 
               <br />
               would prove a beneﬁt to the United States. 
               <br />

               Once we had acquired the Northwest, unless 
               <br />
               we took proper steps to open it up, and organ- 
               <br />
               ize it, we would, as he had said, beneﬁt our 
               <br />
               neighbours across the line, and not ourselves. 
               <br />
               But he sincerely hoped another course of 
               <br />
               action would be taken. It certainly behooved 
               <br />

               us to be very careful, now that we were as- 
               <br />
               suming responsibilities of the greatest magni- 
               <br />
               tude. We had passed the Intercolonial Rail- 
               <br />
               Way Loan—had voted $50,000 annually to the 
               <br />
               Governor-General—and there was undoubted- 
               <br />
               ly some ground for apprehending that if we 
               <br />

               continued on as we had been doing for the 
               <br />
               past two years, we would inevitably ﬁnd our- 
               <br />
               selves in the condition recently alluded to by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Militia, of having to resort to 
               <br />
               direct taxation in order to meet our engage- 
               <br />
               ments (hear, hear). That was an evil which 
               <br />

               threatened us in the future, and from which 
               <br />
               he saw but one way of escape, and that was 
               <br />
               by assisting, as far as practicable, in promo- 
               <br />
               ting public works for the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />
               Dominion (hear, hear). If this Dominion is 
               <br />
               ever to be prosperous, beyond all question we 
               <br />

               must bring our energies to bear in organising 
               <br />
               a system of public improvements. With a well- 
               <br />
               planned system, such as this, we can hope to 
               <br />
               draw amongst us, and provide for, thousands 
               <br />
               of the over-crowded populations of Europe. 
               <br />
               But without it, we can do nothing. We have 
               <br />

               fertile lands almost boundless in extent, but 
               <br />
               unless we can promote their settlement, they 
               <br />
               are worse than useless to us. What he wanted 
               <br />
               to impress on the House was this. We are now 
               <br />
               about to acquire a vast domain in the North- 
               <br />
               west, and we must at once take measures to 
               <br />

               open it up. Let there be communication by a 
               <br />
               railway or some other means, but let the mat-<br />
               ter be set about promptly. The interests of the 
               <br />
               people of New Brunswick were not so im- 
               <br />
               mediately bound up with the acquisition and 
               <br />
               development of this territory, as were those of 
               <br />

               the people in the west. But he felt that if this 
               <br />
               Dominion was ever to be anything, it must be 
               <br />
               by acting as a united people, who sought ear- 
               <br />
               nestly the development, not of a section mere- 
               <br />
               ly, but of the whole country (cheers). And in 
               <br />
               this particular instance they had a very heavy 
               <br />

               stake in following out the course he alluded 
               <br />
               to. If this North West Territory were only 
               <br />
