               Sir George E. Cartier said the member for

               Lambton had taken the correct view of the 
               <br />
               matter. When these resolutions passed an 
               <br />
               address would be sent from here, and we 
               <br />
               would then have to wait until effect was 
               <br />
               given to it by an Order in Council, or a 
               <br />
               proclamation by Her Majesty; and it would 
               <br />
               be necessary also to have an Imperial Act 
               <br />
               granting the Imperial guarantee. But mean- 
               <br />
               while, as soon as the address passed, the 
               <br />
               Government would bring a measure before 
               <br />
               the House to obtain authority to form a Pro- 
               <br />
               vincial Government in that part of the Terri-

               tion, in order that as soon as the Queen’s 
               <br />
               Proclamation issued no time might be lost in 
               <br />
               laying out townships for settlement. It would 
               <br />
               also be necessary for the Parliament of Can- 
               <br />
               ada to make adequate provision for establish-

               <br />

               visional communications which might be 
               <br />
               established almost immediately, and the ques-

               tion of permanent communication, which 
               <br />
               would require a larger expenditure of money, 
               <br />
               would also have to be considered after the 
               <br />
               Provisional Government was established and

               further information obtained as to the re-

               <br />
               were most suitable for cultivation. The 
               <br />
               Government would then be better prepared
