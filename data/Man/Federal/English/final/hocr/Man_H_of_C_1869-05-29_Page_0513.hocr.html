               was not to be added to the Dominion until 
               <br />
               the <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁnancial</span> conditions of the Federal

               Government was such as to admit of it. The

               ﬁnances of the Dominion were clearly not in 
               <br />
               that condition at present. The people of the 
               <br />
               Maritime Provinces certainly were led to ex-

               shouldered till they were better able to bear 
               <br />
               it. There was very little doubt, too, but that

               <br />
               <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be necessarily enormous, more than

               could be borne, and, in his view, the Govern-

               ment had been altogether premature in this 
               <br />
               measure. The £300,000 asked for at the outset 
               <br />
               was but a small amount compared with that 
               <br />
               which would be needed for the opening up 
               <br />
               and governing of that country. For one he 
               <br />
               was dissatisfied with the course adopted by 
               <br />
               the Government on this point.

               Hon. Mr. Tilley denied that any advocate of

               Confederation in the Maritime Provinces, and 
               <br />
               especially in New Brunswick, had ever stated 
               <br />
               that this Territory would not be assumed un- 
               <br />
               til some indeﬁnite period in the future, when 
               <br />
               the Dominion would be very rich, any more 
               <br />
               than they pretended the Intercolonial Railway 
               <br />
               would be postponed until the annual revenue 
               <br />
               would bear the cost of it. No such statement 
               <br />
               was ever made by him, at all events. He al- 
               <br />
               ways spoke of that Territory as one which 
               <br />

               Mr. Brown advocated prompt action in the

               interests of the settlers in the North West, as 
               <br />
               well as of the people of Canada. The settlers 
               <br />
               in the Red River section had for years ap-

               <br />
               they had the further mortification of seeing 
               <br />
               that while England and Canada neglected the

               tected their people. They had established a 
               <br />
               consulate there, and in many ways showed a 
               <br />
               due care for their fellow <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">citizens—while</span> they

               were doing this, what was the state of affairs 
               <br />
               among the British settlers? A cruel and grasp- 
               <br />
               ing monopoly oppressed and kept them down, 
               <br />
               and even illegally fined and imprisoned them. 
               <br />
               Facts of this nature he could establish by an 
               <br />
               <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">affidavit</span> which showed that very great in-

               justice indeed had been perpetrated by the

               to take the most prompt and energetic action

               in order to bring about a new state of affairs 
               <br />
               in that country. As to the question of route, 
               <br />
               by way of Minnesota was a very good one,
