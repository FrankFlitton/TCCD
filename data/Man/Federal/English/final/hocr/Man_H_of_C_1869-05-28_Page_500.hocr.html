               <br />
               and a liberal policy is requisite. The distance 
               <br />
               of the fertile belt of this rich country from 
               <br />
               Canada, proper renders it somewhat difﬁcult 
               <br />
               of access and at whatever period we desire 
               <br />
               to open up and colonize the country, rapid 
               <br />
               means of communication must, as a necessary 
               <br />
               consequence, be obtained. If this vast territory 
               <br />
               is worth purchasing, it is also worth having 
               <br />
               a communication with—and that without loss 
               <br />
               of time. Money invested so as to yield an 
               <br />
               adequate return, must have a solid project 
               <br />
               to back up the expenditures. Our American 
               <br />
               neighbours have just completed the Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railroad, in itself the great marvel of the age 
               <br />
               —next to the Atlantic telegraph. The enter- 
               <br />
               prise is truly characteristic of the time. It 
               <br />
               was a question of sublime audacity whoever 
               <br />
               thought it possible to lay down thousands of 
               <br />
               miles of track, climbing mountains 8,000 feet 
               <br />
               high, leaping gorges, and causing the Atlantic 
               <br />
               and Paciﬁc shores to join in an iron bond of 
               <br />
               Union. Whoever ﬁrst conceived the idea ranks 
               <br />
               with a Watt, a Stevenson, and a Brunel. In 
               <br />
               1850 there only 9,000 miles of road in that 
               <br />
               country, and at present there are 60,000 miles. 
               <br />
               Men are not now content with the old way 
               <br />
               of accomplishing things. The Paciﬁc Railroad 
               <br />
               is a specimen of the new and bolder system 
               <br />
               that now prevails. Man’s intellectual power 
               <br />
               is gaining increased strength, so as to cor- 
               <br />
               respond with the magnitude of modern im- 
               <br />
               provements. When the Italian masters ﬂour- 
               <br />
               ished, literature had its periods of dazzling 
               <br />
               brightness, such as the Elizabethian age. To- 
               <br />
               day is the period of grand conception and 
               <br />
               enterprises; and we Dominionists should feel 
               <br />
               proud of this age in which we live. The pro- 
               <br />
               tracted life of ancient times did not enable 
               <br />
               man to know even as much as is now accom- 
               <br />
               plished in a limited life time. To turn, how- 
               <br />
               ever, to our own soil, we here in Ottawa, 
               <br />
               are geographically and politically in the very 
               <br />
               heart of the world, equidistant from Europe 
               <br />
               on the one side, and Asia on the other; and 
               <br />
               the reasons why we should, and must, in the 
               <br />
               course of time, have a Paciﬁc road of our 
               <br />
               own, are self-evident. It is all very well to 
               <br />
               theorise upon the point; but the fact is we 
               <br />
               cannot afford to have our right ﬂank en- 
               <br />
               veloped by the extending lines of the neigh- 
               <br />
               bouring country. If we can do like the 
               <br />
               Americans, in the construction of the Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               railway, utilize our domain, the time is not 
               <br />
               far distant when we may have a Canadian 
               <br />
