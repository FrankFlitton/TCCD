               <br />
               of the minority element. (Hear, hear). 
               <br />
               Some of the Conservative organs, indeed, 
               <br />
               had claimed that, as at the last election, the 
               <br />
Conservative element came a majority 
               <br />
               amongst the representatives of Ontario; 
               <br />
               therefore, the Ontario Conservatives were 
               <br />
entitled to three seats in the Cabinet, and the 
               <br />
               Reformers to but two. With reference to this 
               <br />
               he (Mr. Mackenzie) contended that this result 
               <br />
               had been obtained by its being sedulously 
               <br />
               urged upon the people that it did not matter 
               <br />
               whether a Conservative or a Reformer was 
               <br />
               elected, and that the only question with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to a candidate should be whether he 
               <br />
               would support the Government. In this way, 
               <br />
               by the joint action of the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               and the Premier of Ontario, the Reformers 
               <br />
               had been cheated out of a fair representation 
               <br />
               in this House.

               Mr. Mackenzie said they had tried to 
               <br />
               beat him, but had completely failed. The 
               <br />
               honourable gentleman ventured to make a 
               <br />
               pilgrimage into his (Mr. Mackenzie’s) county, 
               <br />
               but was compelled to beat an ignominious 
               <br />
               retreat, and his majority was twice the num- 
               <br />
               ber of the electors, if not of the souls, in the 
               <br />
               whole constituency. (Hear, hear). He had 
               <br />
               thought it expedient to call the attention of 
               <br />
               the Liberals in the House to the manner in 
               <br />
               which they had been treated by honourable 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite. He had never expected 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Public Works would be 
               <br />
               either the representative or the protector of 
               <br />
               the Reform party in the Cabinet; but he had 
               <br />
               expected that some decent measure of atten- 
               <br />
               tion would have been paid to the position 
               <br />
               that was taken in the organization of the 
               <br />
               Government. Mr. Mackenzie then said he 
               <br />
               would refrain from entering on any more full 
               <br />
               discussion of the matters embraced in the 
               <br />
               address, until the papers were brought down, 
               <br />
               and again congratulated the House on the 
               <br />
               prospect we had that we should soon be not 
               <br />
               merely in theory, but in fact, a Confederation 
               <br />
               of the British North American Provinces— 
               <br />
               knit together in such a way as to promote

               our fatherland and our connection with it.
