               Mr. A. P. McDonald approved of the resolu- 
               <br />
               tions; but differed from the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works as to the best mode of opening up com- 
               <br />
               munication with the territory. The great dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty with regard to it was the want of 
               <br />
               access to it. We had to take a jump of 400 
               <br />
               miles before we reached the edge of it. The 
               <br />
               proposed mixed route he did not think was 
               <br />
               either feasible or practicable. Would an emi- 
               <br />
               grant be induced to go 1,200 miles by a mixed 
               <br />
               route to reach the Red River, when at Cleve- 
               <br />
               land or Detroit he could meet railway com- 
               <br />
               munication to take him into the Western 
               <br />
               States. He maintained that the only way by 
               <br />
               which we could make that Territory available, 
               <br />
               was by building a railway, giving grants of 
               <br />
               land to aid its construction. He ventured to 
               <br />
               say that with a mixed route, 10,000 emigrants 
               <br />
               would not be induced to go into that Country. 
               <br />
               Without a railroad, the North West Territory 
               <br />
               would be a mill-stone round the neck of this 
               <br />
               Dominion. The million and a half now asked 
               <br />
               for would not pay for <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Territory. The 
               <br />
               200,000 Indians found there, would claim as 
               <br />
               much for their rights as the Hudson’s Bay 
               <br />
               Company. He went on to contend that a rail- 
               <br />
               road would pay for its own construction, and 
               <br />
               was the only feasible means of ﬁlling up the 
               <br />
               country with an industrious population. The 
               <br />
               acquisition of the North West had been a 
               <br />
               leading plank in the platform of the Govern- 
               <br />
               ment party. Now that they had got it, he 
               <br />
               hoped they would ﬁnd the beneﬁt of it, and 
               <br />
               that they would not discover they had got an 
               <br />
               elephant and a white one at that.
