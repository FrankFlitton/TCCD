               was this country lying between Lake Supe- 
               <br />
               rior and Fort Garry. It was a country of lakes, 
               <br />
               and it would occasionally be necessary to 
               <br />
               deviate 30 or 40 miles from a straight line to 
               <br />
               <span style="background-color: transparent;" class="lowConfidenceOcr">avoid</span> these lakes. Until, therefore, the coun- 
               <br />
               try was better explored, and it was seen 
               <br />
               whether, as reported by the Indians, a level 
               <br />
               country was to be found farther to the north, 
               <br />
               the Government would be disposed to go on 
               <br />
               with the improvements already begun. It 
               <br />
               would be observed from Mr. Dawson’s report 
               <br />
               that last year’s exploration had resulted in 
               <br />
               the discovery of a route twenty miles shorter 
               <br />
               than the Dog Lake route formerly explored. 
               <br />
               The Government had assumed the respon- 
               <br />
               sibility of the appropriation of a sum of 
               <br />
               money for the relief of the distress of the 
               <br />
               Red River Settlement, and the amount thus 
               <br />
               appropriated having been expended in giving 
               <br />
               employment on a portion of the road from 
               <br />
               Fort Garry to Lake of the Woods,—35 miles, 
               <br />
               or one-third of the whole, had already been 
               <br />
               completed. If the House granted the necessary 
               <br />
               funds, he hoped that by another season there 
               <br />
               would be a line of wagon roads and water 
               <br />
               communication from the head of Lake Supe- 
               <br />
               rior to Fort Garry quite practicable for con- 
               <br />
               veying emigrants. It had been found that 
               <br />
               water communication was the best and 
               <br />
               cheapest for conveying emigrants, and also 
               <br />
               for a large proportion of the goods that would 
               <br />
               be taken west. In illustration of this proposi- 
               <br />
               tion, he quoted a statement by Mr. Hatch, 
               <br />
               showing that by the Erie Canal alone, as 
               <br />
               compared with railway communication, there 
               <br />
               had been effected a saving annually to the 
               <br />
               great consuming classes of the West of 
               <br />
               $36,800,000. He might mention, as showing 
               <br />
               what was thought among the monied men 
               <br />
               of New York, of the capabilities of the terri- 
               <br />
               tory he had now acquired, that no sooner 
               <br />
               was it known there that this territory was 
               <br />
               about to pass from the Hudson’s Bay Company 
               <br />
               into the hands of Canada, than steps were 
               <br />
               taken to push on immediately the railway 
               <br />
               from the head of Lake Superior to St. Paul. 
               <br />
               Some three or four millions of bonds for this 
               <br />
               purpose had been sold in the New York 
               <br />
               market, showing the conﬁdence the public 
               <br />
               had in the value of railways in that section 
               <br />
               from the trade that would spring up in the 
               <br />
               settlement of the interior country. It was un- 
               <br />
               necessary to dwell on the importance of this 
               <br />
               acquisition to the people of Canada. We had 
               <br />
               passed that period. It was manifest, however, 
               <br />
               we had obtained a great inheritance. The 
               <br />
               facts regarding its value were well stated in 
               <br />
               Mr. Russell’s recent work. Canada, with this 
               <br />
               country added to it, would be equal to the 
               <br />
               extent of Russia in Europe, which sustained 
               <br />
