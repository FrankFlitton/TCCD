               sixty-nine millions of people. To ﬁll up, and 
               <br />
               organize and develop, and govern such a 
               <br />
               country would give scope and employment 
               <br />
               enough for all our skill and energies. The 
               <br />
               utmost anxiety had been shown by the Duke 
               <br />
               of Buckingham, the Earl of Granville, and 
               <br />
               other British Ministers to obtain for Canada 
               <br />
               on terms which would not be burdensome to 
               <br />
               us, the control and management of the terri- 
               <br />
               tory, and it was evident that so soon as the 
               <br />
               transfer was made there would be in the 
               <br />
               mother country a strong desire on the part 
               <br />
               of those who wished to better their condition 
               <br />
               to emigrate to Canada, with the view of 
               <br />
               proceeding to the North-West, and there ﬁnd- 
               <br />
               ing new homes under the shelter of British 
               <br />
               institutions. That desire already existed, and 
               <br />
               it would be very much increased when it 
               <br />
               became known that we had taken posssession 
               <br />
               of the country and organized a suitable Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment over it. He considered we were now 
               <br />
               on the eve of obtaining the great objects we 
               <br />
               had in contemplation. When the Coalition 
               <br />
               Government of 1864 was formed the Minister 
               <br />
               of Militia had informed the House that there 
               <br />
               was at that time a prospect of securing the 
               <br />
               admission of Newfoundland. We knew that 
               <br />
               British Columbia was only waiting the settle- 
               <br />
               ment of the question with regard to the 
               <br />
               Northwest territory, to ask admission also; so 
               <br />
               that we might look forward to having our 
               <br />
               Confederacy extend in a short time from 
               <br />
               ocean to ocean, as was contemplated in the 
               <br />
               Quebec resolutions. At the time of the Toronto 
               <br />
               Convention, he (Mr. McDougall) was subjected 
               <br />
               to a good deal of unpleasant comments from 
               <br />
               his former political friends, the member for 
               <br />
               Lambton and others, for having resolved to 
               <br />
               maintain his position in the Government until 
               <br />
               the work they had undertaken was com- 
               <br />
               pleted. He recollected the sneer with which 
               <br />
               the acquisition of the North West was re- 
               <br />
               ferred to, as if it would take many years to 
               <br />
               bring that about, and as if he made the com- 
               <br />
               pletion of the work merely an excuse for re- 
               <br />
               maining in office. He was proud to believe 
               <br />
               that they were now on the eve of the com- 
               <br />
               pletion of that work, and that it would be 
               <br />
               entirely completed before this Government, 
               <br />
               in its present form, was dissolved. Only when 
               <br />
               it was so completed would he feel that he had 
               <br />
               accomplished the work which he set about 
               <br />
               in 1864; and all the assaults made on him 
               <br />
               would fall harmless in presence of the fact 
               <br />
               that they had achieved a successful result 
               <br />
               in ﬁnishing the great work they had then 
               <br />
               undertaken.
