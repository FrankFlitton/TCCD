               Mr. Chipman considered if they had 200,000

               trouble with them. He was afraid this whole

               scheme was to involve a great deal of in-

               <br />
               First they had to pay £300,000 to the Hudson’s 
               <br />
               Bay Company, besides the land they reserved. 
               <br />
               Then they had railways and telegraphs to 
               <br />
               build, and a long frontier to defend and after 
               <br />
               all they had 800 miles to travel before they

               However, if they were to make a fortune by

               Mr. Le Vesconte moved in amendment. 
               <br />
               “That in the opinion of this House it is in-

               expedient to acquire a territory likely to in-
