               believed that repeal would be successful, but 
               <br />
               what he had felt was that the vital interests 
               <br />
               of the Dominion required that the difﬁculty as 
               <br />
               respects Nova Scotia should be removed, and 
               <br />
               the Union enabled to present an unbroken 
               <br />
               front to the world. He had no hesitation, how- 
               <br />
               ever, in saying that the difﬁculty in that 
               <br />
               Province was very much exaggerated from 
               <br />
               the outset. He had never looked upon the 
               <br />
               issue of the elections of 1867 as evincing the 
               <br />
               desire of the people for Repeal. He had 
               <br />
               believed and had stated in the House the 
               <br />
               circumstances which warranted him in coming 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that by a moderate and 
               <br />
               judicious course of action all the difﬁculty 
               <br />
               might be removed. He had, indeed, always 
               <br />
               pressed upon the administration the neces- 
               <br />
               sity of making such arrangements. He felt 
               <br />
               that the sooner the representatives of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia were able to work out the constitution, 
               <br />
               the better for the interests of the whole Do- 
               <br />
               minion. Some time ago the Government had 
               <br />
               done him the honour of offering him a high 
               <br />
               and responsible position in the administra- 
               <br />
               tion, but having given that subject the fullest 
               <br />
               consideration, he felt it his duty to decline. 
               <br />
               And he had done so on the ground that he 
               <br />
               should consider how far the acceptance of 
               <br />
               ofﬁce would leave him free to advance the 
               <br />
               interests of his country. He had considered 
               <br />
               that the acceptance of such a position would 
               <br />
               mar his usefulness in connection with meas- 
               <br />
               ures that might reconcile the people to the 
               <br />
               Union. He did not hesitate to advise the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment—to say to them that he believed it 
               <br />
               was a solemn duty which they owed to the 
               <br />
               whole people of the Dominion to exhaust 
               <br />
               every means consistent with the honour and 
               <br />
               rights of the country, to bring representatives 
               <br />
               of the people of Nova Scotia into harmony— 
               <br />
               not with the Government of the country so 
               <br />
               much as with the institutions of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               The House would remember that in the most 
               <br />
               impassioned appeal he had made on the 
               <br />
               question, he had implored the anti-Union 
               <br />
               representatives, instead of standing outside 
               <br />
               of the constitution, to come forward and assist 
               <br />
               in perfecting these institutions. The Govern- 
               <br />
               ment had done him the honour to delegate 
               <br />
               him in England, for the purpose of giving the 
               <br />
               British Government all the information he 
               <br />
               possessed on the question.
