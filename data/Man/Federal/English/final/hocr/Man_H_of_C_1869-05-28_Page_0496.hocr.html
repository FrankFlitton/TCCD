               districts of British Columbia are not unlike

               Saskatchewan exceeds in this respect Brussels

               much milder winters than the more eastern 
               <br />
               districts. From well ascertained facts Mr. 
               <br />
               Taylor states that potatoes and the hardier 
               <br />
               garden vegetables, oats, rye, and barley can 
               <br />

               various kinds of fruit are safe as far as 52°

               opinion expressed by all explorers—British 
               <br />
               and American—as to the general productive- 
               <br />
               ness of the soil. The Red River Valley is by 
               <br />
               far the oldest part of the Winnipeg basin and 
               <br />
               its annual mean temperature is 34°—that 
               <br />
               of Montreal being 42°. The summer mean is 
               <br />
               68°, and exceeds that of Toronto which is 
               <br />
               only 64°, in fact it exceeds even that of 
               <br />
               Northern Illinois, Western Wisconsin, and 
               <br />
               Western Ontario, and on that account, affords 
               <br />
               an ample supply of summer heat to ripen the

               <br />
               admirably, and Taylor gives his ﬁrm expres- 
               <br />
               sion to the idea, “that in none of the prairie

               <br />

               <br />
               northern valleys.” Doubtless there are occa-

               sional periodical inundations in that region of

               country where the Saskatchewan joins the 
               <br />
               lakes; however, this applies only to a limited 
               <br />
               extent of country, which, like the plains 
               <br />
               of Egypt on either side of the Nile will 
               <br />
               become centres of increased fertility. Accord-

               ing to Mr. Russell’s report, the extent of 
               <br />
               cultivated land stretches over an area two 
               <br />

               <br />
               supports 40,000,000 of people, and the cost to 
               <br />
               Canada at £300,000, which would amount to 
               <br />
               something less than half a cent per acre. The

               fertility of the Western States is proverbial

               ——and of these Minnesota is the youngest and 
               <br />
               farthest north, and has made the most rapid
