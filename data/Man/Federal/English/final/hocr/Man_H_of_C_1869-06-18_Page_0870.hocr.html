               He would call attention to the fact that for 
               <br />
               the services of the current year votes aggre- 
               <br />
               gating $250,000 additional were to be asked 
               <br />
               for, while the Supplementary Estimates for 
               <br />
               next year amounted to $5,465,675. It was fair, 
               <br />
               however, to reduce this by the amount which 
               <br />
               the House had already to pay for acquiring 
               <br />
               the possessionary rights of the Hudson’s Bay 
               <br />
               Company, $1,460,000. This would reduce the 
               <br />
               amount we had to vote for next year to about 
               <br />
               $4,000,000, a large amount of money even 
               <br />
               to us, who were accustomed to dealing with 
               <br />
               large ﬁgures under our new economy. There 
               <br />
               was one rather startling amount, that of 
               <br />
               $1,460,000 for opening up communication with 
               <br />
               the North-West Territory, establishing its 
               <br />
               Government, and providing for its settlement. 
               <br />
               Before considering this appropriation the 
               <br />
               House ought to be placed in a position to 
               <br />
               consider the whole question of opening up 
               <br />
               communication with and governing the Terri- 
               <br />
               tory. He did not say that the amount asked 
               <br />
               was excessive; but he maintained that the 
               <br />
               House ought not to be called on to vote so 
               <br />
               large a sum until the Government declared 
               <br />
               what policy was to be pursued in regard to 
               <br />
               these Territories; whether it was to be a bold 
               <br />
               and comprehensive policy, looking to the early 
               <br />
               settlement of the country, or whether we were 
               <br />
               in this respect to die as it were of depletion; 
               <br />
               whether we were to spend hundreds of thou- 
               <br />
               sands of dollars in this question annually with 
               <br />
               no policy, and as usually happened in such 
               <br />
               cases, without accomplishing any definite re-<br />
               sult, or whether we were to pursue such a 
               <br />
               settled wise policy as must advance our 
               <br />
               interest in that quarter.

               Hon. Mr. Rose said he would offer a few 
               <br />
               explanations in regard to the ﬁrst set of sup- 
               <br />
               plementary estimates, those which were 
               <br />
               additional for the current year, amounting in 
               <br />
               the aggregate to $380,000. It was but right 
               <br />
               the House should understand that this was 
               <br />
               not an additional sum over and above that 
               <br />
               which had been stated before as the expen-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> 
               <br />diture <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />for the year. They were brought in 
               <br />
               as supplementary estimates made in accord- 
               <br />
               ance with the rule laid down by the Gov-

               ernment of submitting every shilling of 
               <br />
               expenditure to the approbation of the House. 
               <br />
               A large portion of those estimates had already 
               <br />
               been laid before the House in the shape of 
               <br />
               unprovided items, with the particulars of 
               <br />
               which the House was already in possession; 
               <br />
               and we now bring them down in this shape
