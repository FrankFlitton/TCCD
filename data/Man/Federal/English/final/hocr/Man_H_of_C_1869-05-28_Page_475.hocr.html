               Hon. Mr. Howe thanked the member for 
               <br />
               Lambton in not raising this debate till his 
               <br />
               (Mr. Howe’s) strength had been somewhat 
               <br />
               restored. He thought it due to the House and 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman opposite, to state candidly and 
               <br />
               fairly the reason why he occupied his present 
               <br />
               position. He would say to them in all frank- 
               <br />
               ness that perhaps he might not have been on 
               <br />
               the Ministerial side at all, had the member for 
               <br />
               Lambton and the hon. gentlemen acting with 
               <br />
               him made the other side of the House at all 
               <br />
               habitable. (Laughter.) When he (Mr. Howe) 
               <br />
               attended the House and spent forty days on 
               <br />
               that side, had he as an old Reformer, and an 
               <br />
               old Liberal, found that sympathy and support 
               <br />
               he thought himself entitled to, perhaps he 
               <br />
               might have remained with them. (Laughter). 
               <br />
               The men on the Ministerial side had accepted 
               <br />
               the situation—were committed to it, were the 
               <br />
               executive instruments by which it was to be 
               <br />
               carried out, and on the other side of the House 
               <br />
               almost every member, including the member 
               <br />
               for Lambton himself, was equally committed 
               <br />
               to the act of Confederation. If he understood 
               <br />
               the member for Lambton then he (Mr. Howe) 
               <br />
               was to place himself in this position: he was to 
               <br />
               attend that House, obey the law, and submit 
               <br />
               to the Act of Confederation, which had been 
               <br />
               gained by the pressure of both parties in 
               <br />
               Canada—and to occupy an isolated position, in 
               <br />
               such a happy position, commanding no sym- 
               <br />
               pathy on the one side of the House nor the 
               <br />
               other, he was to spend the remainder of his 
               <br />
               days for the ediﬁcation and amusement of 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen on both sides (Hear and 
               <br />
               laughter). Had he devoted himself to an 
               <br />
               isolated existence of that kind he should 
               <br />
               certainly be a martyr to a very high sense 
               <br />
               of honour, but if he needed such justiﬁcation 
               <br />
               he might almost make an excuse for oc- 
               <br />
               cupying his present position by saying that 
               <br />
               he was only following the custom of the 
               <br />
               country. (Laughter.) Were he to believe the 
               <br />
               half of what he heard, and he was free to 
               <br />
               say he did not, were he to believe the charge 
               <br />
               which he had heard ﬂung by public men 
               <br />
               at each other across the ﬂoor of the House 
               <br />
               during the forty days he had ﬁrst attend- 
               <br />
               ed it, he could consider that the tone of 
               <br />
               political morality was so high in Canada 
               <br />
               that he had violently transgressed it in cros- 
               <br />
               sing the ﬂoor of the House. (Laughter.) 
               <br />
               He came there a stranger and would do 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen the justice to say that he
