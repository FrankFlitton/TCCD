               and force brought to bear against his posi- 
               <br />
               tion was too great to resist. Therefore he felt 
               <br />
               that there was nothing to do but to accept 
               <br />
               the situation or enter into a hopeless, dreary 
               <br />
               contest, which could have but one result. 
               <br />
               (Cheers.) Just at that time, when we tried 
               <br />
               everything else and failed, hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               from this side of the House came down to us 
               <br />
               and said—“We cannot repeal this Act, and do 
               <br />
               not wish to do so, but we are willing to re- 
               <br />
               examine the ﬁnancial part of the scheme, and 
               <br />
               if it is shown that by it injustice has been or 
               <br />
               is to be done to Nova Scotia, we will en-<br />
               deavour to repair the injustice.” His ﬁrst 
               <br />
               policy was to test the sincerity of these pro- 
               <br />
               fessions. Negotiations went on, and bye and 
               <br />
               bye it was quite apparent to the Finance 
               <br />
               Minister of Canada and the Auditor General 
               <br />
               that a gross injustice had been done Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia; and when this acknowledgement was 
               <br />
               made there was a fair ground for negotiations 
               <br />
               for better terms. Shutting out for the present 
               <br />
               any reference to these better terms, as that 
               <br />
               branch of the subject would come up in a 
               <br />
               few days, he would merely say that the ne- 
               <br />
               gotiations were brought to a close and Mr. 
               <br />
               McLelan and himself were satisﬁed that jus- 
               <br />
               tice would be done Nova Scotia. The Ministry 
               <br />
               by that act established a larger claim to his 
               <br />
               respect and conﬁdence. The Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice then did him the honour to renew an 
               <br />
               offer made months before to take a seat in 
               <br />
               the Cabinet. He felt they had established a 
               <br />
               claim on him, and said frankly, “if you think 
               <br />
               it will strengthen your hands in carrying this 
               <br />
               measure through Parliament to have my aid 
               <br />
               and assistance in the Cabinet, you can have 
               <br />
               it. As far as I am concerned, I would rather 
               <br />
               continue as I am.” He made one reservation, 
               <br />
               however. He had no hope from the new Gov- 
               <br />
               ernment established in England, but many in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia hoped to get repeal from them. 
               <br />
               The reservation he made was this: The mo- 
               <br />
               ment the Local Government got their answer 
               <br />
               from the Gladstone Government, if it was 
               <br />
               unfavourable, as he expected, he was to con- 
               <br />
               sider himself free to take office. The answer 
               <br />
               came, was unfavourable, and he had then no 
               <br />
               hesitation. As to his opposition to the pur- 
               <br />
               chase of the Hudson’s Bay Territory, he had 
               <br />
               opposed that purchase with all sincerity, be- 
               <br />
               lieving that it should have been the work of 
               <br />
               the Imperial authorities, and not of the 
               <br />
               Dominion, but the policy of the majority of 
               <br />
               the House opposed to that was carried out. 
               <br />
               The delegates went to England, the purchase 
               <br />
               was made, and arrangements completed al- 
               <br />
               most before he entered the Cabinet. Now, 
               <br />
               what would the member for Lambton have 
               <br />
               him to do? Was he to regard that as a 
               <br />
               stumbling-block in the way of entering the 
               <br/><br />
