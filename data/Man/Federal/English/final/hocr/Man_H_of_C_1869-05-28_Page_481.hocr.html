               into the subject at once and to show that the 
               <br />
               contemplated arrangement should be cheer- 
               <br />
               fully acquiesced in by the House. The papers 
               <br />
               showing the proceedings of himself and his 
               <br />
               colleague in England had been laid before the 
               <br />
               House. In considering the acquisition of so 
               <br />
               important a territory we were naturally in- 
               <br />
               duced to consider the history of the successive 
               <br />
               acquisition of territory by our neighbours in 
               <br />
               the United States. The original 13 States com- 
               <br />
               prised a territory much more limited than that 
               <br />
               which the United States now possessed; but 
               <br />
               no sooner did they acquire their independence 
               <br />
               than they entered on a policy of losing no 
               <br />
               opportunity of acquiring new territory. First, 
               <br />
               they got Louisiana. Some Americans were 
               <br />
               opposed to this, thinking they had territory 
               <br />
               enough; but the other idea prevailed, and 
               <br />
               that territory was acquired, affording the ma- 
               <br />
               terial out of which ﬁve States have been 
               <br />
               erected. Not satisﬁed with this, American 
               <br />
               statesmen looked to the necessity of extending 
               <br />
               their territory from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc, 
               <br />
               and that idea was ﬁnally accomplished. It had 
               <br />
               taken them, however, nearly 50 years to 
               <br />
               complete this project; but if the measures 
               <br />
               now before the House was carried out, we 
               <br />
               would acquire almost by one act a greater 
               <br />
               extent of territory, and in some respects more 
               <br />
               important, than what the United States had 
               <br />
               acquired during the last 50 years; for British 
               <br />
               Columbia was standing ready to meet us 
               <br />
               as soon as we took possession of the North- 
               <br />
               west. It was a matter of gloriﬁcation to us 
               <br />
               that in so short a time since we entered into 
               <br />
               Confederation, we had made such progress. 
               <br />
               Who, under such circumstances, could say that 
               <br />
               this Confederation had not been successful? 
               <br />
               In this measure we were completing the terri- 
               <br />
               torial element for which protective provision 
               <br />
               had been made in the Act of Confederation. 
               <br />
               He would not go into the whole history of the 
               <br />
               negotiations in England, as all the facts were 
               <br />
               known to the House. He might explain, how- 
               <br />
               ever, the reason why he and his colleague had 
               <br />
               been detained so long in conducting these 
               <br />
               negotiations. They had been entered upon 
               <br />
               with the late Government, and when the 
               <br />
               change of Government took place, they had 
               <br />
               to be commenced again from the beginning. He 
               <br />
               thought any one acquainted with the facts 
               <br />
               would admit that he and his colleague had not 
               <br />
               unnecessarily delayed the proceedings. The 
               <br />
               severe illness which nearly proved fatal to his 
               <br />
               colleague, aggrieved by intelligence of the fatal 
               <br />
               illness of the being dearest to him in life, was 
               <br />
               another cause of delay. What they had suc- 
               <br />
               ceeded in achieving, however, he was sure 
               <br />
               would redound to the prosperity of this coun- 
               <br />
               try, and the country should be especially
