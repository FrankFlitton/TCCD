               482 COMMONS 
               DEBATES May 28, 1869<br /></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               grateful to his colleague, who had done his 
               <br />
               work and done it well, under the most trying 
               <br />
               circumstances. The agreement entered into 
               <br />
               resolved itself into two principal points as 
               <br />
               regarded what Canada had to pay for the 
               <br />

               acquisition of the North-West Territory; the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst being a money payment of £300,000, and 
               <br />
               the second a reserve to the Company of one- 
               <br />
               twentieth of the land in the Fertile Belt. The 
               <br />
               other points were matters of detail. The mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Chateauguay had declared that Canada 
               <br />

               had got the worst of the bargain. He chal- 
               <br />
               lenged the hon. gentleman to make good that 
               <br />
               assertion in the course of this debate, and to 
               <br />
               criticise freely the arrangement made in all its 
               <br />
               details. Some misconceptions had in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance arisen from certain hostile criticisms 
               <br />

               in the press; but these had very much dis- 
               <br />
               appeared in consequence of the explanation 
               <br />
               given by himself and his colleague since their 
               <br />
               return to Canada. He was prepared to contend 
               <br />
               that this agreement gave us the territory on 
               <br />
               more favourable terms than those on which 
               <br />

               we would have acquired it had the address of 
               <br />
               last session been carried out. Under that 
               <br />
               address we would have got the sovereignty of 
               <br />
               country without territory. Under this arrange- 
               <br />
               ment we get both, on making a moderate 
               <br />
               money payment. That payment of £300,000 
               <br />

               raised on Imperial Guarantee at 3½ <br />per cent 
               <br />
               interest, with a sinking fund to extinguish the 
               <br />
               debt in 45 years would not involve a charge of 
               <br />
               more than £13,000 or £14,000 a year, while 
               <br />
               on the other hand we would get customs dues 
               <br />

               of nearly that amount. Sir Curtis Lampson the 
               <br />
               Deputy Governor of the Company, had stated 
               <br />
               that they were willing to pay £10,000 a year 
               <br />
               in commutation of customs dues. For this 
               <br />
               triﬂing amount we secured this immense terri- 
               <br />
               tory. The question arose what should we do 
               <br />

               with it? Should we at once commence a rail- 
               <br />
               way through the territory, or should we be 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with Provincial work which would 
               <br />
               furnish the necessary summer communication? 
               <br />
               That question was not at present before the 
               <br />
               House and he merely referred to it for the 
               <br />

               purpose of saying that whether we decided 
               <br />
               on a railway or provisional communication, 
               <br />
               we had acquired means sufﬁcient to accom- 
               <br />
               plish either object, as it was well known that 
               <br />
               the United States had built their Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way by grants of lands along the line. He 
               <br />

               proceeded to refer to the increase our credit 
               <br />
               had received in the money markets in the 
               <br />
               world. The Dominion of Canada was now as 
               <br />
               well known as the United States, and it was 
               <br />
               known that we intended to be great. He did 
               <br />
               not mean that we were to be independent. All 
               <br />

               our dependence now, consisted in England 
               <br />
               giving us a Governor General, and he was 
               <br />
