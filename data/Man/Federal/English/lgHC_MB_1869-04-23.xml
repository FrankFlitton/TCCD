            <p>
               Mr. Bowell would be happy to proceed at 
               <lb/>
               once if he thought he could have the assistance 
               <lb/>
               of the member for Chateauguay. 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Hon. Mr. Holton would lend his assistance 
               <lb/>
               in going on, at all events.

            <p>
               Mr. Bowell said it was the practice of mem<lb break="no"/>bers to select their own time to proceed with 
               <lb/>
               their Bills, and he would do so. Others had 
               <lb/>
               already done so that day.

               The matter then dropped.

               Mr. Casault enquired whether it was the

               intention of the Government to cause to be 
               <lb/>
               erected at Quebec, the Post Ofﬁce for which 
               <lb/>
               an appropriation was made by the Parliament 
               <lb/>
               of the former Province of Canada, and 
               <lb/>
               whether the same is still available for the 
               <lb/>
               construction of that building. 
               <lb/>

            <p>
               Sir John A. Macdonald replied that the vote 
               <lb/>
               of the late Parliament of Canada had fallen 
               <lb/>
               with the Parliament itself. As to the Post 
               <lb/>
               Ofﬁce, the Government would see about it. 
               <lb/>

               Mr. McConkey enquired whether, in view

               of the acquisition of the North-West territory 
               <lb/>
               it was the intention of the Government to ask

               for an appropriation to open a communication 
               <lb/>
               between Fort William and Fort Garry, and if

               Sir John A. Macdonald said Parliament

               must ﬁrst consent to the acquisition of that 
               <lb/>

               Cameron was never dismissed. The Post Ofﬁce

               Mr. Street differed with the member for 
               <lb/>
               Lambton in his statement, that the trustees 
               <lb/>
               were not exercising all the vigilance they 
               <lb/>
               could in respect to the realization of this prop<lb break="no"/>erty. It was property very difﬁcult to realize, 
               <lb/>
               but both from personal knowledge and inter<lb break="no"/>views with the administrators from time to 
               <lb/>
               time, he felt convinced that they were making 
               <lb/>
               every effort in their power to bring to a real<lb break="no"/>ization at as early a period as possible the 
               <lb/>
               property under their control. He believed it 
               <lb/>
               would be found on enquiry that they were 
               <lb/>
               exerting themselves by every means in their 
               <lb/>
               power to convert that property with a regard 
               <lb/>
               to the interest of the creditors, and to the ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of the shareholders, and every other 
               <lb/>
               party having an interest in the winding up of 
               <lb/>
               this estate. His object in rising was simply to 
               <lb/>
               inform the mover of the resolution, that he 
               <lb/>
               had fallen into an error in thinking that the 
               <lb/>
               trustees did not exercise necessary vigilance 
               <lb/>
               and discretion.

               <lb/>
               vigilance or discretion of the trustees. He 
               <lb/>
               merely questioned the delay and expressed 
               <lb/>
               the opinion that the affairs of the Trust ought 
               <lb/>

               Mr. Mackenzie said, if there was any report 
               <lb/>
               from Mr. Dawson, regarding the exploration 
               <lb/>
               of the present read, perhaps it would be ad<lb break="no"/>visable to include it in the papers to be sent 
               <lb/>
               down. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Hon. Mr. McDougall said, Mr. Dawson was 
               <lb/>
               not strictly in the employ of the Government 
               <lb/>
               at present, but it was understood that he was 
               <lb/>
               preparing a report on the subject of his last 
               <lb/>
               exploration. Last year he had been asked to 
               <lb/>
               make a more thorough exploration of the 
               <lb/>
               country between Lake Superior and the Lake 
               <lb/>
               of the Woods, and he had done so, and had 
               <lb/>
               been very successful in ﬁnding a road much 
               <lb/>
               superior in every way to that formerly pro<lb break="no"/>posed. On this subject he would make a full 
               <lb/>
               and, it was to be hoped, a satisfactory report. 
               <lb/>
               All the papers connected therewith would be 
               <lb/>
               brought down. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               In answer to Mr. Macfarlane, 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               Hon. Mr. McDougall said Mr. Dawson 
               <lb/>
               chieﬂy devoted his attention to the district 
               <lb/>
               between the head of Lake Superior and the 
               <lb/>
               Lake of the Woods. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               The motion carried. 
               <lb/>
               
            </p>
            
         
            
            <p>
               The House adjourned at 4:30 o’clock. 
               <lb/>
