               shorter one could be made across our own

               Territory. After speaking some time on the 
               <br />
               subject of route, Mr. Brown said in reference 
               <br />
               to the people of this country leaving for the 
               <br />
               United States many causes had been assigned, 
               <br />
               but there was one which he might mention, 
               <br />
               though perhaps it might appear invidious to 
               <br />
               do so. In the county he had the honour to 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the Legislature, who had for years en- 
               <br />
               couraged people to leave the county of Brant, 
               <br />
               and settle in Arkansas. If the American 
               <br />
               Government could secure emigrant agents, 
               <br />
               within the very walls of our Legislature, it 
               <br />
               was no wonder that people left this country, 
               <br />

               Mr. Ferguson desired to say a word or two 
               <br />
               in reply to the member for Westmoreland. 
               <br />
               To begin with that gentleman’s opposition 
               <br />
               was too late. An agreement had been signed 
               <br />
               for the purchase of the Territory, but un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly the £300,000 to be paid as pur- 
               <br />
               chase money, would be so much thrown away 
               <br />
               unless followed up by the expenditure of 
               <br />
               much large sums for the opening out of the 
               <br />
               country. He felt very well satisfied with the 
               <br />
               mission of the delegates to England on this 
               <br />
               subject, and thought they deserved every 
               <br />
               credit. The hon. gentleman advocated the 
               <br />
               making of good roads into that country, and 
               <br />
               strongly urged that very soon something better 
               <br />
               than waggon roads should be constructed 
               <br />
               to open up communications with the North- 
               <br />
               West. He hoped the Government would not 
               <br />
               only borrow as much money as would enable 
               <br />
               them to purchase that Territory, but also a 
               <br />
               sum sufficiently large to establish a good per- 
               <br />
               manent line of steam communication. The 
               <br />
               Territory which they had acquired was mag- 
               <br />
               nificent, and would be cheap at one million 
               <br />
               instead of £300,000. He believed that to-day 
               <br />
               the Americans would gladly give twenty 
               <br />
               millions of dollars for it.

               Mr. Thompson. (Ont. N.) strongly advocated

               the construction of a railroad to open up 
               <br />
               this splendid North West. By judicious ex-

               yearly increasing emigration to that country

               <br />
               the greatest importance, and trusted that it
