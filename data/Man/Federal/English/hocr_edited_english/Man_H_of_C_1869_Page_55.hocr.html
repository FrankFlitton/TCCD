               <br />

               fourteen years that he had been leading the

               his colleagues in public had been guilty of 
               <br />
               tergiversation. As regarded his not having

               been pending. He had not intended to omit

               <br />
               fulness with regard to this question. It was 
               <br />
               well known to this Parliament and throughout

               <br />
               took with reference to this question in the

               proceedings of the delegates to England in 
               <br />
               1865, and it was with great pleasure he found 
               <br />
               on his recent return from England that when 
               <br />
               there were some attempts to prejudice the 
               <br />
               public mind with reference to some arrange- 
               <br />
               ments, Mr. Brown had stood up for his prin- 
               <br />
               ciples and defended those arrangements. In 
               <br />
               the despatch of June, 1865, which Mr. Brown, 
               <br />
               with his delegates, signed and agreed to, it 
               <br />
               was stated that after the settlement of the 
               <br />
               question it would be necessary to pay a sum of 
               <br />
               money that the imperial guarantee should be 
               <br />
               obtained, and it was following up the arrange-

               of Mr. Brown from this House he (Sir George 
               <br />
               Cartier) did, and if he had been here he would 
               <br />
               not, because he had mentioned his name in
