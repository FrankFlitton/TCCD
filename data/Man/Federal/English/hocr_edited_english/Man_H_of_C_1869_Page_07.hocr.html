               and other material points of their policy when

               they asked him to assume oﬁice with them. 
               <br />
               These observations had been made by Mr. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie simply in consequence of the state- 
               <br />
               ments of the Minister of Justice that he had 
               <br />
               occupied a neutral position in the House. Had 
               <br />
               the remarks not been made, he should not 
               <br />
               have taken the liberty of dealing with the 
               <br />
               President of the Council in his absence. Re- 
               <br />
               verting to the question of fortiﬁcations, he 
               <br />
               (Mr. Mackenzie) expressed his surprise that 
               <br />
               nothing had been said as to the progress of 
               <br />
               these extensive works. Last year they were 
               <br />
               considered necessary, because the Ministry 
               <br />
               were apprehensive of war. The House was 
               <br />
               now assured that there was no danger of such 
               <br />
               a calamity. It would be well they should be 
               <br />
               informed as to what had been done in the 
               <br />
               way of fortiﬁcations, and if anything had 
               <br />
               been performed during the recess. He had 
               <br />
               visited certain portions of the country. He 
               <br />
               had been up the Ottawa through the interior, 
               <br />
               and had observed a number of points on the 
               <br />
               Ottawa and Lake Superior admirably adopted 
               <br />
               for fortiﬁcations if hon. gentlemen could only 
               <br />
               induce the Yankees to come to these particular 
               <br />
               places to make their attacks. (Laughter.) He 
               <br />
               felt at present as he felt last Session, that they 
               <br />
               had a most extravagant mode of conducting 
               <br />
               the public affairs of the country. In their 
               <br />
               attempts to re-organize their Departments; 
               <br />
               and even in their Militia Law, what was it 
               <br />
               but the same story—expense, expense con- 
               <br />
               tinually! Take the Militia Law as a sample. 
               <br />
               Under the former law, the enrollment was 
               <br />
               effected without expense. The same service 
               <br />
               had cost $63,000; and what was the grand 
               <br />
               result of their attempt at improving the 
               <br />
               Militia system? Simply that a more ridicu-

               <br />
               never perpetrated on any civilized country. 
               <br />
               In the western Province they had old super- 
               <br />
               annuated men, who, for social and other 
               <br />
               reasons were appointed as captains and 
               <br />
               colonels. Men in every local city, as far as 
               <br />
               he knew, had been appointed to ofﬁcer the 
               <br />
               battalions without any reference to their 
               <br />
               military qualiﬁcations. Then they had Mili-

               which it was supposed would be of advantage 
               <br />
               in this respect, that when they had been in 
               <br />
               operation some years, they would have turned 
               <br />
               out a body of trained officers, capable of dis-<br />

               but he believed that in his own county, though

               many respectable men had been appointed,
