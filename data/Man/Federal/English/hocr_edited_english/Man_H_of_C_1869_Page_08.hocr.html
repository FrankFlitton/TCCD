               not among them a man who could make any 
               <br />
               pretentions to military knowledge, and he 
               <br />
               believed matters to be worse still in the 
               <br />
               county adjoining. These appointments had 
               <br />
               been avowedly made from one little party; 
               <br />
               and they had the hon. gentleman who was in- 
               <br />
               trusted with this selection avowing in his own 
               <br />
               paper that, until all his Tory friends had been 
               <br />
               satisﬁed, not one should get a commission who 
               <br />
               had opposed the Government or himself at 
               <br />
               the last election. (Hear, hear.) This was the 
               <br />
               new mode of administering the Militia affairs 
               <br />
               of the Dominion. (Hear, hear.) In the Militia 
               <br />
               administration there had not only been ex- 
               <br />
               travagance, but there had been a direct viola- 
               <br />
               tion of the votes passed by this House, and 
               <br />
               the utmost practical inefﬁciency. He was told 
               <br />
               the other day, on good authority, that in one 
               <br />
               parish, where it was known there were alto- 
               <br />
               gether only 65 male adults, a return had been 
               <br />
               made of something over 300, in order to in- 
               <br />
               crease the amount allowed per head for 
               <br />
               enrollment. He made these complaints with 
               <br />
               profound regret. He was desirous to see the 
               <br />
               Militia force organized on an efﬁcient footing, 
               <br />
               and he was sorry to say that, so far as he had 
               <br />
               been able to observe, this had not been done. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Militia was not directly to 
               <br />
               blame, having been absent from the country 
               <br />
               for six months, but some one ought to be held 
               <br />
               responsible. Until the papers were brought 
               <br />
               down, it would be manifestly inexpedient to 
               <br />
               discuss the question as to the admission of 
               <br />
               Newfoundland into the Confederation; but 
               <br />
               as a sincere friend of the Union of the Prov- 
               <br />
               inces and British connection, he congratu- 
               <br />
               lated the Government, the House and the 
               <br />
               country on the application of another of our 
               <br />
               North American Colonies to be admitted 
               <br />
               into the Union, and he begged to say that 
               <br />
               anything he could do to aid the Government 
               <br />
               in carrying this matter to a successful com- 
               <br />
               pletion should be done most heartily and 
               <br />
               most cheerfully. (Hear, hear.) In regard to 
               <br />
               the opening up of the North-West Territory, 
               <br />
               he hoped the propositions of the Government 
               <br />
               would be so well considered that it would 
               <br />
               not be necessary for the hon. gentlemen acting 
               <br />
               with him to propose any serious amendment, 
               <br />
               as it was for the interest of the country that 
               <br />
               all questions connected with the opening up 
               <br />
               of that vast Territory should be settled as 
               <br />
               soon as possible, and upon as equitable a 
               <br />
               basis as possible. It was a serious matter to 
               <br />
               undertake the government of that great Prov- 
               <br />
               ince, as it soon would be, and the whole 
               <br />
               matter was one which would require the 
               <br />
               utmost attention of the Government and all 
               <br />
               other members of this House. He particularly 
               <br />
               recognized in that his own responsibility, as 
               <br />
               a member of the House, and should aid in 
               <br />
