               able, should express his views on a matter 
               <br />
               of such great importance as that contain- 
               <br />
               ed in the proposition placed before the 
               <br />
               House by the First Minister. It is not 
               <br />
               likely that in our time we shall again be 
               <br />
               called upon to set aside territory to form 
               <br />
               two such great new provinces. The Dom- 
               <br />
               inion does not contain such another fertile 
               <br />
               belt as that contained in the two proposed 
               <br />
               provinces out of which to form other pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i'inces</span> of like value, like fertility and like 
               <br />
               resources. The right hon. gentleman, in 
               <br />
               introducingthis measure to the House, dwelt 
               <br />
               very fully upon that matter, in a way that 
               <br />
               commended itself to both sides of the House, 
               <br />
               inasmuch as we all realize that a great 
               <br />
               heritage has been given to us, and that we 
               <br />
               ought, so far as we are able, to develop 
               <br />
