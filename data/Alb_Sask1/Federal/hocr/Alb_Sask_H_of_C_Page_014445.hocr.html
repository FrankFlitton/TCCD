               ious restrictions that can be a source of 
               <br />
               vexation, turmoil and strife amongst the 
               <br />
               mixed population inhabiting that part of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. Some of these people are 
               <br />
               our fellow Canadians from the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces; some are our fellow British sub- 
               <br />
               jects from England, Scotland and Ireland, 
               <br />
               some come from the more advanced Euro— 
               <br />
               pean races and many come from the repub- 
               <br />
               lic to the south. All these classes of settlers 
               <br />
               at any rate come from countries where they 
               <br />
               have been in the enjoyment of the greatest 
               <br />
               amount of constitutional liberty and they 
               <br />
               will look for and expect the same liberty 
               <br />
               in their new homes. We are therefore legis- 
               <br />
               lating at the present time not merely for 
               <br />
               existing conditions but for the whole future 
               <br />
               of that country. We can afford, nay it is 
               <br />
               our duty, it is an imperative duty that we 
               <br />
               should deal not only justly, but generously 
               <br />
               in starting these new provinces house- 
               <br />
               keeping on their own account. There may 
               <br />
               have been reasons of a ﬁnancial character 
               <br />
               that prevented this Dominion from dealing 
               <br />
               with some of the other provinces, upon their 
               <br />
               entering into confederation, with equal gen- 
               <br />
               erosity, but because of that lack of liberty 
               <br />
               and generosity repeated demands have been 
               <br />
               made on the treasury of this country by 
               <br />
               those provinces and we should guard against 
               <br />
               anything of that kind in the initial dealings 
               <br />
               with these new provinces of the west. I 
               <br />
               am sure there is a desire on the part of the 
               <br />
               older settled provinces not only to accord' 
               <br />
               the very best possible treatment of a ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial character, but to grant the greatest 
               <br />
               amount of constitutional liberty and legis- 
               <br />
               lative freedom in our dealings with these 
               <br />
               new provinces. The ﬁnancial arrangements 
               <br />
               should not be entered into in any niggardly 
               <br />
               spirit nor should they be carped at be- 
               <br />
               cause they happen to be more generous 
               <br />
               than those accorded to the several provinces 
               <br />
               in which we each reside. Nor should this 
               <br />
               government deny or withhold from these 
               <br />
               provinces of the west the management of 
               <br />
               certain affairs, the control of certain fea- 
               <br />
               tures of their policy, simply because of a 
               <br />
               reluctance on the part of this government 
               <br />
               to part with What has undoubtedly been in 
               <br />
               the past and will be in the future great 
               <br />
               political party levers, features of admin-

               Bill proper. One of these is incidental to 
               <br />
               this Bill and was dealt with by the Primal 
               <br />
               Minister in his introductory remarks; I 
               <br />
               refer to the reasons he assigned for refusing 
               <br />
               the reasonable request of the people of 
               <br />
               Manitoba through their legislators for an 
               <br />
               extension of the boundaries of that province. 
               <br />
               The Prime Minister stated that this request 
               <br />
               had been made not only upon his govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but upon other governments in the 
               <br />
               past. It was a request most reasonable in 
               <br />
               its character, a unanimous request joined 
               <br />
               in by both political parties, but a request 
               <br />
               which even at this most opportune moment 
               <br />
               when the delimitation of the western pro- 
               <br />
               vinces is being made, he and his govern- 
               <br />
               ment could not entertain. And what are 
               <br />
               the reasons he has given? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">First</span> because 
               <br />
               the government of Sir John A. Macdonald 
               <br />
               had a similar request made to them some 
               <br />
               20 years ago, and if it could not be enter- 
               <br />
               tained on that occasion it could not be en~ 
               <br />
               tertained to-day; yet in the earlier por- 
               <br />
               tion of his remarks the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               admitted that the Canada of those days 
               <br />
               was not the Canada of to-day. That was 
               <br />
               very true and he might have said further 
               <br />
               that the Manitoba of those days was not 
               <br />
               the Manitoba of to-day. At that time Mani- 
               <br />
               toba was supposed to extend as far east 
               <br />
               as the head of lake navigation. All of that 
               <br />
               portion of country east of Rat Portage 
               <br />
               to Port Arthur which was looked upon as 
               <br />
               disputed territory had been counted in as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belonging</span> to Manitoba, and that province 
               <br />
               was supposed to constitute an area of 154,- 
               <br />
               000 square miles, but to—day we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               owing to the decision given in connection 
               <br />
               with the boundary award all that portion 
               <br />
               east of Rat Portage has been handed over 
               <br />
               to Ontario thus diminishing the area of 
               <br />
               Manitoba by more than one-half. So I say 
               <br />
               that the request of 1905 is a much more 
               <br />
               reasonable one and an entirely diﬁerent 
               <br />
               one inasmuch as it is a request on behalf 
               <br />
               of a province that we know for a certainty 
               <br />
               contains only some 73,700 square miles, 
               <br />
               whereas the request of twenty years ago 
               <br />
               was on behalf of a province which we im- 
               <br />
               agined contained 154,000 square miles. Per- 
               <br />
               sonally I would have preferred to have seen 
               <br />
               Manitoba’s western boundary extended still 
               <br />
               further west as far as the 105th Meridian 
               <br />
               of west longitude, having one province west 
               <br />
               of that line extending to the eastern boun- 
               <br />
               dary of the province of British Columbia. 
               <br />
               Thus we would have two good sized provin- 
               <br />
               ces whose areas would have been more in 
               <br />
               conformity with those of British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia, Ontario and Quebec. By doing this 
               <br />
               we would have done away with this dupli- 
               <br />
               cation of governments and the increased 
               <br />
               cost as a consequence thereof. We have 
               <br />
               been told frequently in times gone by that 
               <br />
               Canada is already over-governed, because 
               <br />
               of this multiplication of provinces whose 
               <br />
               areas are too small. With such a division of. 
               <br />
               territory as I suggest we would have avoid-
