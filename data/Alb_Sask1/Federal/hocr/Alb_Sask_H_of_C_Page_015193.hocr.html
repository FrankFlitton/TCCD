               press an opinion now, as I understand the 
               <br />
               question may come before the House. But 
               <br />
               it seems to me that it is a question to he 
               <br />
               handled with a great deal of care. The 
               <br />
               fathers of confederation. when they ﬁxed 
               <br />
               the powers of the provinces on the present 
               <br />
               basis had in mind that the provinces would 
               <br />
               impose just what my right hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tSir</span> 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) said a moment ago they 
               <br />
               were so much afraid of—direct taxation. 
               <br />
               That is why they were not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> a great deal 
               <br />
               of power. I understand that one man who 
               <br />
               was looked upon as a great authority on the 
               <br />
               Liberal side at that time. Mr. Holton, ex- 
               <br />
               pressed the opinion that it was the duty of 
               <br />
               the provinces. and their safeguard, to impose 
               <br />
               direct taxation. I imagine why the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment came to the conclusion of granting 
               <br />
               the provinces their demand. It would be 
               <br />
               only for a few years. But it is the way in 
               <br />
               which they carry on their ﬁnances, that is 
               <br />
               the cause of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> in which the old 
               <br />
               provinces are to—day. Of course, that is not 
               <br />
               the subject under consideration, and I do not 
               <br />
               want to discuss it any further. But I Wished 
               <br />
               to say that, in my opinion, there is a good 
               <br />
               deal in what my hon. friend from Halton 
               <br />
               IMr. Henderson) said, that if we gave 80 
               <br />
               cents per head of population to the older 
               <br />
               provinces it was because we were taking 
               <br />
               something from the provinces, but that we 
               <br />
               are taking nothing in the same way from 
               <br />
               the new provinces.

               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. There is force in

               <br />
               I quite agree with the Prime Minister in 
               <br />
               his criticism of what was done at the

               time of confederation, though I am dis- 
               <br />
               posed to admit that I do not see exactly 
               <br />
               what could have been substituted for that 
               <br />
               arbitrary allowance. It seems to be en- 
               <br />
               tirely arbitrary. It is said that it was in 
               <br />
               lieu <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of!</span> the customs and excise. Well, 
               <br />
               then, surely it was illogical to ﬁx an ar— 
               <br />
               bitrary amount and to fix the limit of 
               <br />
               population. I submit that for two reasons. 
               <br />
               The province of Nova Scotia is limited to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">400.000,</span> and the province of New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick is limited to 400,000. The province 
               <br />
               of Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Scotia</span> may reach a population of 
               <br />
               800,000, and when it does, the amount which 
               <br />
               it will contribute to the customs and ex- 
               <br />
               cise will be very much greater than the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount’which</span> it contributes when it has a 
               <br />
               population of only 400,000. The same is 
               <br />
               true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> regard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toi</span> ithe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> of 
               <br />
               Quebec and Ontario, and with regard to 
               <br />
               the amounts payable to them. But'thete 
               <br />
               is another reason why this allowance made 
               <br />
               to the different provinces is absolutely i]-

               logical. Every [one who has made the 
               <br />
               slightest study of political economy knows 
               <br />
               that the producing power of money varies 
               <br />
               from time to time. Therefore, 80 cents 
               <br />
               per head of the population of the provinces 
               <br />
               in 1905, is an absolutely different thing to 
               <br />
               what 80 cents per head was in 1867. In 
               <br />
               this connection I may say that one of the 
               <br />
               provinces of confederation is at the present 
               <br />
               time making a claim which, perhaDS. may 
               <br />
               be entitled to some consideration, whether 
               <br />
               we agree with it or not; the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01.</span> 
               <br />
               British Columbia is making a claim at 
               <br />
               the present time, as I understand, upon 
               <br />
               this government for the reason that it 
               <br />
               costs so much more to construct public 
               <br />
