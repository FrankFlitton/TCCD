               One other thing came to my mind. I 
               <br />
               could not help but look alternately from 
               <br />

               <br />

               gious fervour and enthusiasm, a fervour and 
               <br />
               enthusiasm that does him inﬁnite credit, 
               <br />
               declaring. as the culmination of his argu— 
               <br />
               ment, that it was impossible for Catholics 
               <br />
               to thoroughly enjoy their religion unless 
               <br />
               they have complete control of their educa-

               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">L'abelle,</span> or of any other good Catholic, 
               <br />
               I quarrel with no man's belief. It has been 
               <br />
               the fashion during this debate. and it fol-

               <br />
               to enter upon that apology, or to even afﬁrm 
               <br />

               tice to myself. I have been in public life 
               <br />
               since 1882, I have been on the back benches 
               <br />
               and on the front benches. I have spoken 
               <br />
               considerably often in this House (gentle-

               <br />
               spoken a good deal through the country, and 
               <br />
               my speeches have been reported; if any

               for myself. But this is what I mean: If

               member for Labelle sat the ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, who, the other day, whittled it

               all down to the one half hour of religious 
               <br />
               teaching; whittled it down to only that 
               <br />
               and nothing more. There, near the member 
               <br />
               for Labelle, sat the Prime Minister, who. in 
               <br />
               1896, had the opportunity to prevent what 
               <br />
               the member for Labelle deplored as the 
               <br />
               robbery of the rights of the minority in the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba. Never before in the

               history of confederation had such an oppor- 
               <br />

               <br />
               never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:arrive</span> again. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               told us, with a convenient forgetfulness 0f 
               <br />
               the whole clause 93: I was opposed to re- 
               <br />
               medial legislation in 1896, because the law 
               <br />
               of the province of Manitoba had been de— 
               <br />
               clared to be a valid law, and I was against 
               <br />
               forcing Manitoba to relinquish what Mani— 
               <br />
               toba had the right to enact. Is that the 
               <br />
               worship of the constitution that my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend has; is that the only part of 
               <br />
               the constitution he reads? There were 
               <br />
               two things in the Manitoba case in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">189G.</span> 
               <br />
               They had a right to their law and it was 
               <br />
               valid on one count, and that count was, that 
               <br />
               before Manitoba became a province there 
               <br />
               was no system of sectarian or denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools by law or practice. But there 
               <br />
               was another point which was covered by 
               <br />
               the British North America Act, and for 
               <br />

               <br />
               America Act was framed to cover. W'hen 
               <br />
               Manitoba became a province it enacted a 
               <br />
               separate school law, and in 1890 it repealed 
               <br />
               that separate school law, and, under such 
               <br />
               circumstances the British North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span>

               way in which it possibly could come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> 
               <br />
               Does my right hon. friend deny the fact;

               does he deny the constitution?
