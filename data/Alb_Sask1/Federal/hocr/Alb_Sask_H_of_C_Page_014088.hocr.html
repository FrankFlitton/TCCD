               goes through parliament without changes 
               <br />
               and amendments. That is perfectly true.

               tutional law, he has ever found a case where 
               <br />
               the leader of a government introduced a 
               <br />
               Bill and, contrary to the ordinary practice 
               <br />
               not only explained its provisions, but made 
               <br />
               an impassioned appeal to the House by all 
               <br />
               the principles of right, and by all the 
               <br />
               claims of justice, loyalty, and even religion,

               in accordance with constitutional procedure

               and more statesmanlike if this.consideration,

               this discussion, had taken place before the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> was thrown into the political arenal

               Would it not have been better to discuss

               the matter with his hon. colleagues, so that 
               <br />
               they might have a chance, before the Bill 
               <br />
               nas brought to parliament, to oppose the 
               <br />
               measure and to try, by resignation or in any 
               <br />
               other proper way, to compel a modiﬁcation of 
               <br />
               its terms? Would not this be better than, 
               <br />
               after parliament is called, the members 
               <br />

               <br />
               leader <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">('Mr.</span> R. L. Borden) asked the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) a most 
               <br />
               important question—it occurs to me the most 
               <br />
               important question in connection with this 
               <br />
               matter—which the right hon. gentleman did 
               <br />
               not answer. He inquired whether it was the 
               <br />
               intention of the government, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as'stated</span> in a 
               <br />
               newspaper ordinarily supposed to be one of 
               <br />
               the organs of the party of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite. to refer this question to the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court. Now, I do not know what the policy 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party or any other mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the Conservative party may be on this 
               <br />
               subject. But, speaking for myself, I op- 
               <br />
               pose any proposal to refer this matter to the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court. We know that even a wise 
               <br />
               man may be caught napping once, but no 
               <br />
               wise man will be caught napping twice in 
               <br />
               the same way. I remember a question sim- 
               <br />
               ilar to this that agitated this country nearly 
               <br />
               ten years ago. I remember that a consti- 
               <br />
               tutional question arose along lines similar 
               <br />
               to this in the province of Manitoba. After 
               <br />
               it had been decided that Manitoba had 
               <br />
               not the right to separate schools because 
               <br />
               there were no separate schools by law or 
               <br />
               practice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> the province at the time it entered 
               <br />
               into confederation, Manitoba claimed the 
               <br />
               right, under the remedial clauses of the law, 
               <br />
               to appeal to the Dominion parliament. The

               <br />
               discussed, and the House was asked to

               <br />
               its right to pass this legislation was an 
               <br />
               admission by the House that, Should it be 
               <br />
               held that parliament had the right to pass 
               <br />
               such a law, it was in reason and in honour 
               <br />
               bound to exercise that right. And it was 
               <br />
               for that reason, and not because we were 
               <br />
               advocating separate schools in Manitoba that 
               <br />
               I and many others like me, thought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that,</span> 
               <br />
               this House having asked whether it had the

               power to pass remedial legislation, it would 
               <br />
               be a monstrous absurdity, it would be a 
               <br />
               stultifying of ourselves not to pass it. To 
               <br />
               ask whether we had the right to act and, 
               <br />
               when that right was established refuse to 
               <br />
               act, would simply be playing a double game. 
               <br />
               It would be asking the Supreme Court and 
               <br />
               the Privy Council gravely whether our 
               <br />
               rights extended to a certain point while 
               <br />
               determined that even if they did extend that 
               <br />
               far, we would not act upon the right thus 
               <br />
               decided to be ours. There is a clear out 
               <br />
               line between the right hon. Prime Minister

               right of this House to pass the legislation 
               <br />
               now proposed. Of course, I do not propose 
               <br />
               to discuss that point at present. But I 
               <br />
               venture to say that no lawyer will look into 
               <br />
               the matter and not come to the conclusion 
               <br />
               that, at least, the question is open to argu- 
               <br />
               ment that it is doubtful whether this House 
               <br />
               has power to pass and enforce such legis- 
               <br />
               lation. But, if we should pass such legis-

               lation, and it should be decided to be ultra

               vires of our powers, the provinces will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that out for themselves and it will not be 
               <br />
               long before the people will ﬁnd that they 
               <br />

               <br />
               the question to the Supreme Court or Privy 
               <br />
               Council whether we have power to pass such 
               <br />
               educational clauses as are proposed; for 
               <br />
               all must see that, if this House should ask 
               <br />
               the Supreme Court whether we have that 
               <br />
               power to pass such clauses, it might be 
               <br />
               contended, as the right hon. Prime Minister 
               <br />
               said ten years ago, that, if it should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">decided</span> that we had the power, then we 
               <br />
               should be bound to show our sincerity and 
               <br />
               good faith by passing such legislation and 
               <br />
               so impose these clauses upon the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories for all time to come.
