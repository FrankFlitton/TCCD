               It is certainly intended, by the common con- 
               <br />
               sent of the House, that this sum shall be

               change has been made in the wording which 
               <br />
               makes it materially different, as we think,

               of a few words in the statute will be such as

               <br />
               my hon. friend will agree that the words

               recollection is that a question very similar 
               <br />
               to this came up, when Sir Richard Cart- 
               <br />
               wright asked the question of Sir Leonard 
               <br />
               Tilley whether it was the intention of the 
               <br />
               Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884</span> to pay over simply the 5 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1191’</span> 
               <br />
               cent yearly on the $2,848,000, or to pay over 
               <br />
               any part of the principal, and the answer of 
               <br />
               Sir Leonard Tilley was distinctly that the 
               <br />
               intention of parliament and the intention of 
               <br />
               the government at that time wasto pay only 
               <br />
               the annual sum. Sir Leonard Tilley seemed 
               <br />
               to be just as ﬁrm in his opinion as my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Minister of Finance is in his 
               <br />
               opinion now, but, notwithstanding that fact, 
               <br />
               lawyers and others, including the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance himself, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afterwards</span> inter- 
               <br />
               preted the meaning of parliament at that 
               <br />
               time as different, and the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               assented in fact to the payment over of a 
               <br />
               portion of the princial sum, or all of it, if it 
               <br />
               was called for. My objection of the wording 
               <br />
               of this clause is to the use of the word ‘in- 
               <br />
               terest.’ If the hon. minister could pay over 
               <br />
               the sum of $405,375 as an additional allow- 
               <br />
               ance, and make no reference whatever to 
               <br />
               interest, it would 'be better. As long as 
               <br />
               you leave the- reference to interest you 
               <br />
               will have some person coming up ten or 
               <br />
               ﬁfteen years afterwards and stating, as the 
               <br />
               late government in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               did, that where there is interest there must 
               <br />
               be principal, and they would simply capi- 
               <br />
               talize this sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$405,375</span> and say : As you 
               <br />
               owe us that much interest you owe us the 
               <br />
               capital sum. I said before that if the hon. 
               <br />

               <br />

               the word ‘ interest’ should be removed from
