               about face on this question, but they must 
               <br />
               not always expect every other person and

               newspaper to follow their lead in matters 
               <br />
               of this kind. It is interesting to analyse this 
               <br />
               question and to ﬁnd out ‘who it is who are 
               <br />

               <br />
               differ from those of the government upon
