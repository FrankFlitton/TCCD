               Mr. FISHER. I shall be glad to give the 
               <br />
               information up to the present time. That 
               <br />
               vote has been expended on statistical work, 
               <br />
               part of it, the usual statistical work always 
               <br />
               carried on in the department every year 
               <br />
               and part of it special statistical work, that 
               <br />
               is work drawn from the compilation of 
               <br />
               the census, and it has been found that a 
               <br />
               portion of that latter work has been of 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient value to be included probably in 
               <br />
               the ﬁnal reports or volumes of the census. 
               <br />
               The consequence is that I might almost say 
               <br />
               that a portion of it has been devoted to 
               <br />
               such work as is contemplated in this Bill, 
               <br />
               that I have now before the House, between 
               <br />
               the decennial census. It is largely the 
               <br />
               kind of work, although not all of the kind 
               <br />
               of work that the Bill contemplates and 
               <br />

               nial census year on the compilations of the 
               <br />

               friend (Mr. Taylor) the expenditure which 
               <br />

               days ago in committee, before the ﬁnancial

               I would like to do under this Bill, and I think 
               <br />
               that the amount which I then indicated 
               <br />

               contemplate or expect to do for several 
               <br />

               My hon. friend from Jacques Cartier has 
               <br />
               asked me to give an outline of what is 
               <br />
               proposed. We have had under the law a 
               <br />
               general census every ten years, and a cen- 
               <br />
               sus of Manitoba taken in the mid-year be- 
               <br />
               tween the regular decennial censuses. In 
               <br />
               1885 or 1886 We had a census of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories taken on the same bas1s 
               <br />
               as the census of Manitoba; but since that 
               <br />
               time there has been no special census taken 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories. Under this 
               <br />
               Act I propose to continue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> take every 
               <br />
               ten years a census of the whole Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada, and to take in the mid-year be- 
               <br />
               tween the regular census years, a census 
               <br />
               of Manitoba, and, if this parliament at the 
               <br />
               present session should create two new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in the Northwest Territories, or any 
               <br />
               provinces, to take a census of them in the 
               <br />
               same way that the census of Manitoba 
               <br />
               is taken. The Manitoba census is taken 
               <br />
               by virtue of a provision in the Subsidy 
               <br />
               Act. Nobody can say to—day what may 
               <br />
               be decided in regard to a new province 
               <br />
               or new provinces in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. But whatever is decided in regard 
               <br />
               to subsidies for those new provinces, I think 
               <br />
               it is well that this Act should provide for 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">censuses</span> to be taken in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba and iii the new provinces to be 
               <br />
               formed in the Territories. The ﬁgures

               which I have given do not include any ex- 
               <br />
               penditure which may be necessary in con- 
               <br />
               nection with those censuses. Those ﬁgures 
               <br />
               indicate what I expect the annual expendi— 
               <br />
               ture to be, in addition to which special pro- 
               <br />
               vision will have to be made for the taking 
               <br />
               of the decennial census and for the taking 
               <br />
               of the census of Manitoba and the other 
               <br />
               northwest provinces. As I have said, I be- 
               <br />
               lieve the value of this work will be very 
               <br />
               great; and. as the Work will grow, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> may 
               <br />
               be that a few years from now the minister 
               <br />
               will have to come down and ask for a lar- 
               <br />
               ger vote on this account; but, so far as our 
               <br />
               expectations or intentions go at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time, the money I have spoken of will. 
               <br />
               I think, cover the necessary expenditure for 
               <br />
               several years to come.
