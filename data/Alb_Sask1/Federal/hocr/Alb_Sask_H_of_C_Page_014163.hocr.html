               <br />
               it applies to all schools in the Territories. 
               <br />
               It is provided that wherever the trustees 
               <br />
               so wish, wherever the local conditions per— 
               <br />
               mit, there shall be religious instruction in 
               <br />
               all schools in the Northwest Territories, not 
               <br />
               in the minority schools only. Then there 
               <br />
               is a further provision that all schools may 
               <br />
               be opened with the reciting of the Lord’s 
               <br />
               Prayer. Does anybody object to that ? I 
               <br />
               hope not; I trust that in any case where 
               <br />
               the trustees of a school authorized that, it is 
               <br />
               not objectionable. But then there is this half 
               <br />
               hour of religious education. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.From</span> the hour 
               <br />
               at which these schools open in the morning 
               <br />
               up to half-past three in the afternoon they 
               <br />
               are absolutely alike ; there is no difference ; 
               <br />
               the teachers have the same duties, the same 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcations; the same examinations, the 
               <br />
               same course of study, the same books are 
               <br />
               prescribed by the government, the regula—

               tions are made by the government, the in— 
               <br />
               spector is appointed by the government. I 
               <br />
               repeat that from the hour of opening in the 
               <br />
               morning up to half—past three in the after- 
               <br />
               noon there is no shade of difference in all 
               <br />
               these schools in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               So it has come to this, that we have a shade 
               <br />
               of difference as respects the half hour of re- 
               <br />

               hour of religious instruction

               should not be a cause of conﬂict. Where 
               <br />
               the majority of the people and the 
               <br />
               trustees are of the Protestant faith, 
               <br />
               that half hour of religious 
               <br />
               will,,of course, take the form of the faith 
               <br />
               of the majority ; it will be Protestant reli- 
               <br />
               gious instruction. Where the majority of 
               <br />
               the people and the trustees are Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics, that half hour of religious in— 
               <br />
               struction will follow the faith of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic majority. In each of these cases 
               <br />
               the minority, if they wish, may have a 
               <br />
               separate school. I am ﬁrmly persuaded that 
               <br />
               the difference is so slight that if we reach a 
               <br />
               wise decision now, if we refrain from 
               <br />
               fanning the ﬂame of political passion—I 
               <br />
               withdraw that word political, I am not dis- 
               <br />
               cussing this fro-m a party standpoint, and i 
               <br />
               did not intend to use that word. and I with- 
               <br />
               draw it—if we refrain from doing or saying 
               <br />
               anything which can fan the ﬂame of reli- 
               <br />
               gious excitement in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories now, my honest conviction is that 
               <br />
               the separate schools will diminish, and the 
               <br />
               free common public schools will increase. 
               <br />
               I am persuaded that the difference is so 
               <br />
               small that the mass of the people in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories will hardly ﬁnd it to 
               <br />
               their advantage to keep it up except in a 
               <br />
               few instances. I am reminded of one point : 
               <br />
               I had forgotten to state that even with 
               <br />
               respect to that half hour, it is not a matter 
               <br />
               of obligation, but if the parents of any child 
               <br />
               disapprove of that religious instruction for 
               <br />
               that half hour. the child may withdraw. 
               <br />
               There is. therefore, liberty of conscience in

               My hon. friend the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion (Mr. R. L. Borden) referred to-day to 
               <br />
               the conditions of education in the province 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia. We are proud to-day. Sir, 
               <br />
               of the national school system in that pro- 
               <br />
               vince. We rejoice that from time to time 
               <br />
               we hear our public men of all parties and 
               <br />
               all creeds cite the province of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               as an example of toleration and good will: 
               <br />
               The happy conditions which exist in that 
               <br />
               province have many a time been referred 
               <br />
               to by my right hon. friend the Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter, who has held the people of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               up as examples of moderation and tolera- 
               <br />
               tion. We have a free common national sys- 
               <br />
               tem of education in the province of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia. The principle of that system is. as 
               <br />
               I stated at an earlier stage of my speech : 
               <br />
               Thou shalt not teach any ‘ism’ but thou 
               <br />
               shalt teach by precept and example. 
               <br />
               the. Christian virtues. This is the es- 
               <br />
               sential point, and happily we have got 
               <br />
               along very well. But do not make any 
               <br />
               mistake. Let no man imagine that that 
               <br />
               happy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conditionehas</span> been brought about 
               <br />
               without conciliation and compromise. We 
               <br />
               have no separate schools by law in 
               <br />
               Nova Scotia, but I say that we could not 
               <br />
