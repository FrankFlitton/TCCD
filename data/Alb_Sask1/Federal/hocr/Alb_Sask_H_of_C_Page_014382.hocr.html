               <br />

               <br />

               to be either; but there is one thing for 
               <br />

               had sent them to those members to be 
               <br />
               presented. Why, he was the manipulator,

               the whole thing, in connection with those 
               <br />

               <br />
               the agitation against this measure. It is 
               <br />
               a well known fact, Sir, that this campaign 
               <br />
               did not originate in the west, with the 
               <br />
               people most concerned, but in the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario. I believe that before the Bill 
               <br />
               was introduced into the House, there was 
               <br />
               absolutely no feeling in the Northwest 
               <br />
               against the perpetuation of the privileges 
               <br />
               granted to the minority. I have it from 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen from the west who sit oppo- 
               <br />
               site that they had to come to Ottawa to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">learn</span> that there was such a thing as a 
               <br />
               school question, for they had never heard 
               <br />
               of it up there. But, forsooth, the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman for East Grey and his friends had 
               <br />
               to start an agitation in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*the</span> province of 
               <br />
               Ontario among people who were more in- 
               <br />
               terested in the matter than the people di- 
               <br />
               rectly concerned. It is true, Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               told us some time ago that so far as he 
               <br />
               was concerned, he had no objection to sep~ 
               <br />
               arate schools—that if he were a dictator 
               <br />
               there, he would not think of abolishing 
               <br />
               them. I am told that the draft clause in 
               <br />
               the Bill which he submitted two years ago 
               <br />
               is very much on the lines of section 1(5 of 
               <br />
               this Bill. It is true, he has changed his 
               <br />
               mind about that.
