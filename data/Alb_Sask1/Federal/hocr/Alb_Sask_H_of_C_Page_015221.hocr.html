               Mr. FIELDING. I think that the argu-

               ment of the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />

               so far as touching the particular point he 
               <br />
               speaks of is concerned. He spoke of the 
               <br />
               value of these lands ten years hence. If 
               <br />
               they become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.more</span> valuable than now, it 
               <br />
               will largely be because of the large expen-

               diture by this government, and it would 
               <br />
               not be right to compensate the provinces— 
               <br />
               it compensate is the word to be used, though 
               <br />
               i do not admit that it is in view of this 
               <br />
               amendment—that compensation should not

               he on the value ten years hence, when 
               <br />
               that value will-be to a large extent the 
               <br />
               result of the expenditure of money by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               they are not worth more than $1.50 per

               (Mr. Fielding) will notice by the terms of

               the resolution that the value upon which 
               <br />
               we are to pay the Territories in ten years 
               <br />
               from this time is not raised to $3 per acre, 
               <br />
               but remains for all time at $1.50 per acre

               so much a matter of compensating the peo-

               least, that position ought to be adopted

               that, for the ﬁrst ten years, an advance

               would be made to those for whom we

               hold these lands in trust. But the mere

               creased population and their increased nec-
