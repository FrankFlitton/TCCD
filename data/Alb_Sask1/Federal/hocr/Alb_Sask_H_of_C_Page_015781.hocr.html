               <br />
               certain forms and expressions. He says 
               <br />
               that the word ‘ section ’ is not found in the 
               <br />
               legislation of the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               Then the hon. Minister of Justice with a 
               <br />
               triumphant wave of his hand asks my hon. 
               <br />
               friend what he means. The answer of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend is that if the word ‘ district’ is 
               <br />
               a better word the word ‘district’ can be 
               <br />
               used. But, I say that there were words in 
               <br />
               clause 15 which I have just referred to 
               <br />
               which had no meaning. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W'e</span> have had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legis‘</span>

               House 011 many occasions which required

               We had legislation of that kind brought 
               <br />
               down by the government last session. Take 
               <br />
               for instance the Railway Act of two years 
               <br />

               <br />

               Minister of Justice was extremely critical

               Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron) had behind him

               he intended. The Minister of Justice asks

               what the intention of the amendment is ‘2 
               <br />
               I have not read it carefully until this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mo«</span>

               ment. but I think I can see in it a very 
               <br />
               plain meaning. It seems designed to express, 
               <br />
               in somewhat plainer terms—outside of any 
               <br />
               verbal inaccuracies, such as those to which 
               <br />
               the minister called attention—the idea that 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister at least had in his 
               <br />
               mind when he ﬁrst introduced this Bill 
               <br />

               <br />

               the order paper. All that I desire to say at

               this moment is that I do not think that

               under the circumstances it is a fair way to 
               <br />
               treat an amendment put forward such as 
               <br />
               this, or a fair way to answer the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gen-</span>

               tleman who presented it in a very moderate

               and able speech, to say that it contains 
               <br />
               some inaccuracies of drafting. such as have 
               <br />
               occurred even in legislation brought down 
               <br />
               by the hon. Minister of Justice himself. I 
               <br />
               do not say that with the idea of taunting 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick). 
               <br />
               I have always recognized his ability and 
               <br />
               spoken of it. I regard him as an able law-

               yer, and a man who ﬁlls his position well. 
               <br />
               And he knows! as every one knows, who 
               <br />
               has had anything to do with the drafting 
               <br />
               of statutes or other difﬁcult documents, that 
               <br />
               it is impossible for a document of that kind 
               <br />
               to be at once framed in a way which will 
               <br />
               be above criticism as to its verbiage. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman will remember that, after 
               <br />
               this House had spent a great deal of time— 
               <br />
               too much time, according to hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men opposite—on the Transcontinental Rail- 
               <br />
               way Bill two years ago, it was found neces- 
               <br />
               sary to bring in, during the following ses 
               <br />
               sion, a Bill to correct an error so obvious 
               <br />
               that every member of this House should 
               <br />
               be ashamed that it escaped his attention 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst place, an error so obvious that 
               <br />
               when our eyes were directed to it in that 
               <br />
               following session, every one of us wondered 
               <br />
               how it could have escaped his notice in the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst place. Under these circumstances, I 
               <br />
               think my hon. friend from Beauharnois is 
               <br />
               entitled to more respectful answer than 
               <br />
               that given by the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick).
