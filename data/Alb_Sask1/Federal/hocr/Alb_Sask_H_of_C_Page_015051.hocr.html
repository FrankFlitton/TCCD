               Mr. GUTHRIE. The hon. members of 
               <br />
               this House who are of the legal profession 
               <br />
               will, I think, bear me out when I say that it 
               <br />
               is very questionable whether in the inter- 
               <br />
               pletation of a statute we have any right to 
               <br />
               go beyond the language of the statute itself. 
               <br />
               Sometimes it has been done, but the text 
               <br />
               writers on the construction of statutes are 
               <br />
               rather against allowing the language of de— 
               <br />
               bates in parliament or negotiations previous 
               <br />
               to the enactment, to inﬂuence them in any 
               <br />
               way in construing the enactment itself. I 
               <br />
               turn to section 146 of the British North Am- 
               <br />
               erica Act of 1867, and in this section, 1 sub- 
               <br />

               <br />

               146 which we must all recognize as the mode 
               <br />
               of admission. In one case colonies or pro- 
               <br />
               vinces could come in by agreement on a 
               <br />
               joint address; in the other case the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories must come in on an address of this 
               <br />
               House approved by an Order in Council. 
               <br />
               The distinction is this : the colonial entities 
               <br />
               referred to in section 146 were to come in 
               <br />
               as provinces having rights subject to the 
               <br />
               terms of the British North America Act as 
               <br />
               stated in these seven words I have quoted. 
               <br />
               But for the Territories, it was provided that 
               <br />
               they should merely come in as a territorial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enlargement</span> of the country, an increased 
               <br />
               area for Canada; that they should merely 
               <br />
               come within our boundaries and form a part 
               <br />
               of the Dominion of Canada, not subject to 
               <br />
               any agreement or compact they made but 
               <br />
               subject to our will approved by an imperial 
               <br />
               Order in Council. And that is the manner 
               <br />
               in which the provinces did come in. I notice 
               <br />
               that the leader of the opposition in one part 
               <br />
               of his speech takes grave objection to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposal</span> in section 2 of the present Bill, 
               <br />
               namely. that the British North America Act 
               <br />
               is made applicable to the new provinces 
               <br />
               with this exception:

               These words seem to create indignation 
               <br />
               in the mind of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               if one may judge by the way he denounced 
               <br />
               them. He said : parliament has no right to

               <br />
               and the words in section '2: except in so

               Turn to the case of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. The Manitoba Act was passed 
               <br />
               in 1870 before the Territory out of which the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba was created became 
               <br />
               a part 01‘ Canada, and in section 2 of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act you will ﬁnd that the British 
               <br />
               North America Act 1867 was made to apply :
