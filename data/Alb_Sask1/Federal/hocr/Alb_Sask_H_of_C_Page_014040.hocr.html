               clude with a motion. The very important 
               <br />
               matter to which I propose to call attention 
               <br />
               has reference to provincial rights, particu-

               <br />
               is in his place. It is largely because these

               hon. gentlemen have not chosen to call the 
               <br />
               attention of the House to this matter that
