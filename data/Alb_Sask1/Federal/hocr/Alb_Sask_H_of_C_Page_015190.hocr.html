               ion that the day is not far distant when 
               <br />
               that question will have to be considered, 
               <br />
               not merely on behalf of Quebec, but on 
               <br />
               behalf of all the provinces; and if a change 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> made, it must be on some principle that 
               <br />
               will apply to all. The essence of the pro- 
               <br />
               posal of the provinces was that the limita- 
               <br />
               tions with regard to population should be 
               <br />
               removed. In the resolutions which were 
               <br />
               adopted by the provincial premiers some 
               <br />
               years ago in Quebec, I think they included 
               <br />
               a provision that they should receive eighty 
               <br />
               cents per head up to a certain population, 
               <br />
               but that where a population was thickly 
               <br />
               settled and its needs would not be so great 
               <br />
               as those of a population sparsely settled, 
               <br />
               the subsidy for the additional population 
               <br />
               should be sixty cents a head.
