               The hon. member for Edmonton told us 
               <br />
               that all the petitions which have been com- 
               <br />
               ing here for the past month. the meetings 
               <br />
               that have been held. the resolutions that 
               <br />
               have been passed. were simply for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of creating political party capital. 
               <br />
               I would ask him if the Toronto ‘Globe‘ 
               <br />
               is so solicitous for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> welfare of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party that it is op- 
               <br />
               posing this Bill. I will give that news- 
               <br />
               paper the credit no matter how much 
               <br />
               it has tried to trim since, it did at 
               <br />
               one time take the proper ground and 
               <br />
               stand for the old landmark of provincial 
               <br />
               rights which Liberals advocated in the 
               <br />
               years gone by. Surely the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               does not mean to say that the Toronto 
               <br />
               ‘ Globe’ is animated solely with the desire 
               <br />
               of putting a Conservative government into 
               <br />
               ofﬁce. The whole independent press. al~ 
               <br />
               most without exception, are condemning the 
               <br />
               government on account of this Bill. And 
               <br />
               what about all these strong old time Lib- 
               <br />
               erals which the hon. member for Ottawa 
               <br />
               (Mr. Belcourt) called renegade Liberals be— 
               <br />
               cause they happened not to see eye to eye 
               <br />
               with the leader of the government and his 
               <br />
               colleagues in this matter. Is Mr. T. C. Robi-
