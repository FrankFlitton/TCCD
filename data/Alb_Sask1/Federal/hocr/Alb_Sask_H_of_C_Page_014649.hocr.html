               denouncing the government because of its 
               <br />
               coercion policy. The Liberals, on the other 
               <br />
               hand, were saying: Return us to power, 
               <br />
               and by methods of conciliation we will 
               <br />
               settle this question. The Conservatives 
               <br />
               made it clear .that they intended, if returned, 
               <br />
               to pass the Remedial Bill. The country re- 
               <br />
               turned the Liberals, and some kind of a 
               <br />
               settlement was made which was placed on 
               <br />
               the statute-book of Manitoba in evidence 
               <br />
               of its being a settlement. To my amaze— 
               <br />
               ment, I heard things yesterday that I had 
               <br />
               never heard before or dreamed of. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap«</span> 
               <br />
               pears that there are some diﬂiculties and 
               <br />
               disputes yet in regard to this question. 
               <br />
               There seem to be difﬁculties among 
               <br />
               the members of the church in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec which I never knew of until 
               <br />
               yesterday. But I do not think that any hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman will seriously say that the school 
               <br />
               question has formed a controversial question 
               <br />
               .in politics from 1897 down to 1905.

               011 the 21st February last the Bill which 
               <br />
               is now before the House was introduced. 
               <br />
               It contained clause 16. It contained a clause 
               <br />
               which did effectually fasten upon the new 
               <br />
               provinces, in my opinion, separate schools. 
               <br />
               The right hon. leader of the government (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) introduced it in a very elo- 
               <br />
               quent speech. He justiﬁed it upon grounds 
               <br />
               that I cannot agree with. He maintained 
               <br />
               that the constitution required him to do it, 
               <br />
               but nevertheless be justiﬁed it on grounds 
               <br />
               of policy; he said he was in favour of 
               <br />
               separate schools, that the minority were en- 
               <br />
               titled to them, and it was in the best in- 
               <br />
               terests of the country that this clause should

               the attention of the House to these words,
