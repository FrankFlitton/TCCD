               for instance, Ontario and Quebec as the hon. 
               <br />
               Postmaster General admitted to-night. He 
               <br />
               said-we have these schools here because we 
               <br />
               had them when we came into the union, and 
               <br />
               he then proves our case further by saying 
               <br />
               that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick do not 
               <br />
               have these schools because they did not 
               <br />
               have them when they came into the union, 
               <br />
               and that British Columbia did not have them 
               <br />
               when they came into the union. That was 
               <br />
               the reason why they did not have them. 
               <br />
               Now, here is where I begin to disagree with 
               <br />
               him. He says it is fair to say to the people 
               <br />
               in the Northwest: You are not a province, 
               <br />
               we are about to make you a province for the 
               <br />
               iirst time, we do not know whether you will 
               <br />
               establish separate schools or not but we will 
               <br />
               take you by the throat and make you do it. 
               <br />
               That is great logic. That is a wonderful 
               <br />
               argument to come from a statesman like the 
               <br />
               hon. Postmaster General, as he called him- 
               <br />
               self two or three times to—night, although no- 
               <br />
               body applauded him when he did it. That 
               <br />
               was the logic that came from this would be 
               <br />
               statesman. If we apply his logic it means 
               <br />
               this: Here are people twenty-one years of 
               <br />
               age having the right to vote who have voted 
               <br />
               for a certain thing, being fully enfranchised 
               <br />
               and entitled to vote on the question, while. 
               <br />
               on the other hand we are going to entran- 
               <br />
               chise another man who has not now a vote 
               <br />
               and make him vote What we direct all his 
               <br />
               life. That is a fair interpretation of the 
               <br />
               argument which the Postmaster General has 
               <br />
               made. We are going to say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span> we are

               <br />
               question. The hon. Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               was very anxious to get away from the legal 
               <br />
               question. He said that Christopher Robin- 
               <br />
               son’s opinion was not quite the same as that 
               <br />
               of the hon. leader of the oppostion. that they 
               <br />
               were both excellent lawyers—he spoke cor- 
               <br />
               rectly about that—that the hon. the Minister

               of Justice disagreed with the legal opinion 
               <br />
               of these gentlemen and that he was a good 
               <br />
               lawyer. But I have not seen the opinion of 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Justice yet. The hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs may know quietly. or 
               <br />
               through some secret channel of the cabinet.

               what the opinion of the hon. Minister of

               Justice is, but I do not know what it is. 
               <br />
               But, we will assume that it was contradic-

               my hon. friend the leader of the opposition.

               What was the wise solution of the Minister

               gave us in his great wisdom ? He says that

               as these lawyers differ about the question as 
               <br />
               to whether the Dominion of Canada has the

               The argument of the Minister of Customs

               was, that as the lawyers differed as to

               whether Canada has the power to enact

               settle the question was for this parliament 
               <br />
               to take the power. It is an easy thing for

               the Minister of Customs to get away from

               the legal and constitutional aspect of the

               question. but it never occurred to him that 
               <br />
               there was a still more common sense solu- 
               <br />
               tion. and that is that provinces could grant 
               <br />
               separate schools if they wanted to and no— 
               <br />
               body disputes that the provinces have the 
               <br />
               power—and that being so, it would be a 
               <br />
               wise thing to let the new provinces do as 
               <br />
               they like on the question of education. 
               <br />
               There is no dispute that the provinces have 
               <br />
               the power to legislate on education the 
               <br />
               whole dispute is whether the Dominion 
               <br />
               government has the right to force a par— 
               <br />
               ticular system of education upon them. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Customs could not see that 
               <br />
               the easiest solution of the difﬁculty was for 
               <br />
               us to say : as there is a great difference of 
               <br />
               opinion as to whether we have the right

               it, then let us trust the province. And so
