               remarks of the leader of the opposition who 
               <br />
               attempted to call down the Minister of the

               <br />
               I do not see that any construction can be

               Get right class of settlers ; go slow and wait 
               <br />
               for settlement. These are the words he used

               <br />
               the details in connection with the cost of 
               <br />
               bringing immigrants to this country, and 
               <br />
               the information I got from the Immigratiox 
               <br />
               Department was that the American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settlers</span> 
               <br />
               cost the country less per head than any 
               <br />
               others and that the British immigrants had 
               <br />
               more money spent on them than any other 
               <br />
               class. There was more spent on British 
               <br />
               immigration per head than any other class 
               <br />
