               <br />
               may be. the proposition in this legislation 
               <br />
               is a settlement of the question. Perhaps, 
               <br />
               as in the case of Manitoba, you may call it 
               <br />
               :1 compromise, and probably the two ex- 
               <br />
               tremes to the controversy may say that the 
               <br />
               legislation we propose is not satisfactory, 
               <br />
               but a compromise has to be reached between 
               <br />
               these extremes. You cannot get a compro—

               mise which will be absolutely acceptable 
               <br />
               to the extreme adherents of one side 
               <br />
               or the other, but you may get a compromise 
               <br />
               which will be acceptable to the common 
               <br />
               sense of the great mass of the people of this

               member which paper it was. The state-

               ment was that the people of Nova Scotia 
               <br />

               enough to see where a sentiment of that

               <br />
               In 1890 a request was made by certain peo-
