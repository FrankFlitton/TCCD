               We are told that this legislation is an

               infringement on what is called provincial

               But, as I have already demonstrated, the

               great evils to this Dominion. Our allegiance

               <br />

               <br />
               that, because a certain piece of legislation is 
               <br />
               Within the power of a local parliament, there- 
               <br />
               fore the legislation is not to be disturbed. By

               the . same Act of parliament by which the 
               <br />
               power is conferred upon the local legislature, 
               <br />
               the duty and power—because where there is 
               <br />
               a power there is a corresponding duty—are cast 
               <br />
               upon the Governor in Council to revise, and re- 
               <br />
               view, the Acts of the legislative bodies. If you 
               <br />
               are to say that because a law has been passed 
               <br />
               within the legislative authority of the province, 
               <br />
               therefore it must remain, we can easily see, 
               <br />
               Sir, that before long these provinces, instead 
               <br />
               of coming nearer together, will go further and 
               <br />
               further apart. We can see that the only way 
               <br />
               of making a united Canada, and building up a. 
               <br />
               national life and sentiment in the Dominion, is 
               <br />
               by seeing that the laws of one province are not 
               <br />
               offensive to the laws and institutions, and it

               It was clear that in conﬁding the general 
               <br />
               subject of education to the local legislatures, 
               <br />
               it was absolutely necessary it should be ac- 
               <br />
               companied with such restrictions as would pre- 
               <br />
               vent injustice in any respect from being done 
               <br />
               to the minority.

               Now this applied to Lower Canada, but it 
               <br />
               also applied, with equal force, to Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada and the other provinces, for in Lower Can— 
               <br />
               ada there was a Protestant minority, and in the 
               <br />
               other provinces a Catholic minority. The same 
               <br />
               privileges belong of right here, as belonged to 
               <br />
               the other right elsewhere. There could be no 
               <br />
               greater injustice to a population than to com-

               Therefore, I say, Sir, that I am within

               the scope of provincial rights in asking that 
               <br />
               this parliament should protect the minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest. But, there is some-

               thing else than provincial rights. We, the

               Liberal party, stand for provincial rights. 
               <br />
               That was the policy of our old leader, Alex-

               Oliver Mowat; it was the policy of Mr. 
               <br />
               Edward Blake. It is still the policy of the
