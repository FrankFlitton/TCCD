               The ﬁrst point is that the Act itself under 
               <br />
               which the petitioner was tried was ultra vires 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament to enact. That parlia- 
               <br />
               ment derived its authority for the passing of 
               <br />
               that statute from the imperial statutes, 34 and 
               <br />
               35 Vic., c. 28, which enacted that the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada may from time to time make 
               <br />
               provision for the administration, peace, order 
               <br />
               and good government of any territory not for 
               <br />
               the time beingincluded in any province. It 
               <br />
               is not denied that the place in question was 
               <br />
               one in respect of which the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada was authorized to make such provision, 
               <br />
               but it appears to be suggested.that any pro-

               vision differing from the provisions which in

               <br />
               sion that a particular enactment was not cal-

               <br />
               not the least colour for such a contention. The

               <br />
               that it was the desire of the Canadian par-

               <br />

               <br />
               might deem ﬁt to give them. That was the 
               <br />
               request made by the Canadian parliament,

               <br />
               of 1871 not only contains the provision 
               <br />
               which I have just read—and bear in mind 
               <br />
               the circumstances under which it was pass- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Which I spoke a moment ago, among which 
               <br />
               are the educational clause and the clause 
               <br />
               with respect to the ownership of public lands.

               The imperial authorities, having had notice 
               <br />
               from the Canadian parliament that it con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               right to deal with these two questions in the

               <br />
               lines in the future. It seems to me im- 
               <br />
               possible to ﬁnd a case in which the inten-
