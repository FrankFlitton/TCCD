               <br />
               the late government about this very thing. 
               <br />
               I regret that the Minister of the Interior, 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) was not in his place at the 
               <br />
               time when these provincial rights which he 
               <br />
               held at one time to be most dear to the 
               <br />
               people of Manitoba, were being assailed. I 
               <br />
               recollect when that hon. gentleman came 
               <br />
               down to the province of Ontario and told the 
               <br />
               people of Haldimand that of all things the 
               <br />
               people of Manitoba did not want separate 
               <br />
               schools or remedial legislation imposed upon 
               <br />
               them. He came to the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               for sympathy on that score and he got it. 
               <br />
               But now if we are to believe the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman’s organ, all that is to be taken 
               <br />
               back, the school lands are to be diverted 
               <br />
               from their proper purpose, and the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is bound, if he carries out what. 
               <br />
               he promised, to introduce this session, an

               Act to remedy the school grievances of the 
               <br />
               minority of Manitoba. If any such thing 
               <br />
               be attempted, the wrong will be done, pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights will be taken away, and to-day, 
               <br />
               in the absence of the two hon. gentlemen to

               as we have had from my hon. friend. He

               has given us a very modern exempliﬁcation

               of the old story of Don Quixote tilting

               otic in his views and methods. Take this 
               <br />
               item which he has just read from the ‘80]- 
               <br />
               eil’ and on which he has built so unwar- 
               <br />
               ranted a conclusion that the government 
               <br />
               contemplates introducing a Remedial Bill 
               <br />
               to amend the law of Manitoba. There is 
               <br />
               not a scintilla in the article of the ‘Soleil’ 
               <br />
               which can warrant any such conclusion. 
               <br />
               The whole thing is manufactured—I will

               how to characterize in what manner it was

               manufactured. Where is there a single

               all that the government since 1896 has never

               <br />
               object it must be to try and create a false 
               <br />
               impression to arouse prejudices somewhere.

               But the hon. gentleman began by express-

               ing his deep regret that the Minister of the

               toba, were not in their seats. Why, Sir, 
               <br />
               it would have been very easy for the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to secure their presence in their 
               <br />
               seats if he wanted them to be present. Why 
               <br />
               did he not notify them that he wanted to 
               <br />
               bring before the House some question re- 
               <br />
               quiring their presence, and which required 
               <br />
               them to make some defence to charges that 
               <br />
               he intended to bring against them. Did 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman notify the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior that he wanted him here to- 
               <br />
               day? Did he notify the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Lisgar that he desired his presence here to- 
               <br />
               day? I am in the judgment of the House 
               <br />
               when I say that the hon. gentleman, when 
               <br />
               he intended to bring charges against the 
               <br />
               members of the House. wilful and deliber- 
               <br />
               ate charges, has not had the manliness to 
               <br />
               notify them that he intended to do so. As
