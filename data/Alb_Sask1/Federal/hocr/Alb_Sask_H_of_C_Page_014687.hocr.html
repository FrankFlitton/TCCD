               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordinances.</span> It is only natural that when the

               people of Ontario hear the term ‘separate

               <br />
               schools as they exist in that province. 
               <br />
               When the people of Manitoba hear the ex-

               pression ‘separate schools’ they think of the

               <br />
               1890. I feel sure that if the people of the 
               <br />
               other provinces understood our school sys-

               ple of thewest are willing to give to any

               <br />
               show a claim. and they will give it the 
               <br />
               more cheerfully and criticise it the less close- 
               <br />
               ly because in this case it not only does not 
               <br />
               injure, but it increases the usefulness 
               <br />
               of our school system. Our schools are in

               completely and absolutely under the control

               same course of studies is followed. Practi- 
               <br />
               cally the same text books are used. The

               <br />
               ply in this case. I am not going to enter 
               <br />
               into a discussion on the advisability of 
               <br />
               having religious instruction in schools, but 
               <br />
               it is a well—known fact that many Protest- 
               <br />
               ants as well as Roman Catholics desire to 
               <br />
               have some religious instruction given in 
               <br />
               the schools. Now, to meet the wishes of 
               <br />
               such people as these, we permit the giving 
               <br />
               of religious instruction in the schools from 
               <br />
               3.30 to 4 o’clock in the afternoon. In this 
               <br />
               we treat all alike, all schools have the same 
               <br />
               privilege. Separate schools will not be 
               <br />
               formed unless the trustees of a public school 
               <br />
               try to deprive the minority of their right 
               <br />
               in this respect. Let us suppose a case. 
               <br />
               Suppose that in a certain district a major- 
               <br />
               ity of the people are Roman Catholics and 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic trustees are elected. They 
               <br />
               will, we suppose, engage a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               teacher. They will request or instruct him 
               <br />
               to give religious instruction in that school 
               <br />
               after 3.30 o’clock. The Protestant children 
               <br />
               of course are allowed to go home. If the 
               <br />
               parents or trustees of these children desire 
               <br />
               that their children should have religious in— 
               <br />
               struction in that school, they will no doubt 
               <br />
               appeal to the trustees and ask that they 
               <br />
