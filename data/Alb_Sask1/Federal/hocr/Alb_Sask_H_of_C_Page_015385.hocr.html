               <br />
               Sons of Scotland in Hamilton. I can the 
               <br />
               more shortly do that by reading 21 letter, 
               <br />

               On the let of April (Good Friday) there was 
               <br />
               an excursion from Hamilton to Buffalo per 
               <br />
               Toronto, Hamilton and Brantford Railway, and 
               <br />
               as usual a large number went. Amongst others 
               <br />
               in the excursion were John 'Stevenson and 
               <br />
               Thomas Mair, employees of the Sawyer-Massey 
               <br />
               Company. On reaching the bridge at the Falls, 
               <br />
               they were accosted by an American ofﬁcial, who 
               <br />
               interrogated them in the car as to how long 
               <br />
               they had been in Canada, &amp;c., and told them to 
               <br />
               follow him. He took them to the customs- 
               <br />
               house and told them to sit down, and demanded 
               <br />
               $2 each before they would be allowed to pro- 
               <br />
               ceed. They assured him both by letter—

               <br />
               to their folks in Buffalo, and were returning 
               <br />
               same evening, and showed their return tick- 
               <br />
               ets, and on that not satisfying him, offered to 
               <br />
               deposit $4 if it would be refunded on their 
               <br />
               return. But this he refused, and detained 
               <br />
               them in a cold room for over two hours and 
               <br />
               insisted on their return to Hamilton on the 
               <br />
               1.15 train. Neither had any luggage, being 
               <br />
               only on a. visit. This may seem small in it- 
               <br />
               self. not a very serious matter, but on behalf 
               <br />
               of Brother Scots, the Sons of Scotland of 
               <br />
               Camp Hamilton No. 21, have,asked me to lay 
               <br />
               it before you as a representative of Hamilton. 
               <br />
               that you may call the attention of the proper 
               <br />
               authorities to this unwarranted interference on 
               <br />
               the part of an ofﬁcial of a friendly nation.

               He adds that he has sent a copy to the 
               <br />
               member for West Hamilton (Mr. Zimmer- 
               <br />

               yesterday, the member for West Hamilton 
               <br />
               being away, and as he is still away, I delay 
               <br />
               no longer in calling the attention of the
