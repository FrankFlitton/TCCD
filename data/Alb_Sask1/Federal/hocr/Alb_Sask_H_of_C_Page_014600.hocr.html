               No doubt, at the instance of Premier Rob-

               lin, Attorney General Campbell and Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers intended to see the ablegate when 
               <br />
               they came down here in regard to this 
               <br />
               school question—there is not the slightest 
               <br />
               doubt about it—and they did go and see 
               <br />
               the ablegate. Now what took place ? We 
               <br />
               have a statement of alleged facts given 
               <br />
               to the people of this country. Is it issued 
               <br />

               ofﬁcial sanction to any statement of facts 
               <br />
               in regard to this matter? Not at all. Is 
               <br />
               it issued by the Attorney General of the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba, the man who had the 
               <br />
               interview with the ablegate? If we are 
               <br />
               going to have any ofﬁcial statement as to 
               <br />
               the negotiotions, as to what was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\said</span> and 
               <br />
               done, and if we are going to have this ﬂame 
               <br />
               of religious discord fanned in this country 
               <br />

               <br />
               should expect them to start this ﬂame ago- 
               <br />
               ing by some facts based upon the state- 
               <br />
               ment of a man who was present and who 
               <br />
               took part in the interview. Why, Sir, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the leader of the opposition is 
               <br />
               too good a lawyer—and we recognize him 
               <br />
               in our province as a good lawyer—he is 
               <br />
               too good a lawyer not to know that bear- 
               <br />
               say testimony is not worth anything, and 
               <br />
               the statement of Mr. Rogers upon which 
               <br />
               all this ﬂame of religious discord is to be 
               <br />
               started up is the worst kind of hearsay 
               <br />
               testimony, it is testimony that my learned 
               <br />
               friend, if he were a judge, would not listen 
               <br />
               to for one moment, and would reject it it 
               <br />
               were oifered in evidence. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now the result is that we have all this 
               <br />
               excitement based upon what ? Upon a state- 
               <br />
               ment of facts made by a gentleman in regard 
               <br />
               to certain things within his own knowledge? 
               <br />
               ;\'0, Sir, mark that. While We have been 
               <br />
               discussing in this House and the news- 
               <br />
               papers have been discussing for days cer- 
               <br />
               tain alleged facts in regard to certain things, 
               <br />
               no public man has yet ventured to state 
               <br />
               that he knows anything of these things of 
               <br />
               his own knowledge. But we have this hear- 
               <br />
               say statement, and hearsay statements as 
               <br />
               well as any other old statement are sufﬁcient 
               <br />
               material just now for certain gentlemen to 
               <br />
               fan a ﬂame of religious discord. We have 
               <br />
               in addition to the statement two insinu- 
               <br />
               ations. The ﬁrst insinuation is that Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid wanted time to enable the invita- 
               <br />
               tion of the Papal ablegate to be acted upon. 
               <br />
               Well, now, what do we ﬁnd ? We ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the interview with the premier of this coun- 
               <br />
               try took place on February 17, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the interview with the ablegate took 
               <br />
               place on February 23. In the meantime the 
               <br />
               policy of the government had been formu- 
               <br />
               lated in regard to the western boundaries of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and it was announced in this 
               <br />
               House and in the country what the policy of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t</span>

               <br />

               <br />
               asked him if something could not be done to 
               <br />
               improve the condition of the Catholics of his

               province with respect to education. I pointed 
               <br />
               out that in the cities of Winnipeg and Brandon,
