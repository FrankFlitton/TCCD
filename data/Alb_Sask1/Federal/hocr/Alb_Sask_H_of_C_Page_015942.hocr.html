               were the public lands in Manitoba dealt 
               <br />

               the Dominion of Canada, absolutely the 
               <br />
               same position which the public lands of 
               <br />
               the Territories occupy to-day, except that 
               <br />
               in the interval we have spent enormous sums

               nection with immigration, irrigation, and 
               <br />
               other matters. How did we deal with the 
               <br />
               case of Manitoba ? We dealt with it abso- 
               <br />
               lutely in the way in which we are dealing 
               <br />
               with the Territories. Were we to do 
               <br />
               otherwise and Manitoba were to come to 
               <br />
               us, are we to say to her: We have 
               <br />
               given these lands to the new provinces 
               <br />
               of Alberta and Saskatchewan, but so far 
               <br />
               as you are concerned lands occupying the 
               <br />
               same position are not to be dealt with 
               <br />
               in the same way ? Why should we distin- 
               <br />
               guish between the two ? But, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               we have more than that. This question 
               <br />
               has not been raised here for the ﬁrst time. 
               <br />
               It was the subject of much consideration 
               <br />
               by the government in power in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884,</span> and a 
               <br />
               report to Council was made by gentlemen, 
               <br />
               members of the government, who had been

               dealt with by the report of Council of May

               tion of education, we ﬁnd by section 93 
               <br />
               that it is a subject over which both the Do- 
               <br />
               minion and the provinces exercise legislative 
               <br />
               jurisdiction. Section 93 provides for this 
               <br />
               condition of things, that if a school system 
               <br />
               has grown up in a province under which any 
               <br />
               class in that particular province has ac- 
               <br />
               quired a right or a privilege, then that right 
               <br />
               or privilege is guaranteed that particular 
               <br />
               class for all time to come. That is the re- 
               <br />
               striction placed upon the powers of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro«</span> 
               <br />
               vince to deal with the subject of education. 
               <br />
               It can only deal with that subject under the 
               <br />
               restriction that all the rights and privileges 
               <br />
               therefore <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vested</span> in any class in that pro- 
               <br />
               vince cannot be interfered with. There can 
               <br />
               be no doubt on that point because it has 
               <br />
               been irrevocably settled as the result of two 
               <br />
               judicial decisions. If these Territories 
               <br />
               were a province now in existence. the school 
               <br />
               system there existing would be of necessity 
               <br />
