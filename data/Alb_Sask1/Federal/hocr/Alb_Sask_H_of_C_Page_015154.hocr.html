               Surely not. and the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               surely knows that not only do we give

               by statute. Let me read section 92 of the

               all time by what we commanded them to do, 
               <br />
               seems to me to be absolutely absurd. 
               <br />

               There is a further matter in connection 
               <br />
               with the Act of 1871. that I call attention 
               <br />
               to. When that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> was passed enabling us 
               <br />
               to establish provinces in the territory, that. 
               <br />
               territory was already part <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Dominion, 
               <br />
               and was entitled to all rights and privileges 
               <br />
               as provided in the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. Surely it cannot be contended that as 
               <br />
               to a Territory so entitled, this parliament, 
               <br />
               in the absence of most explicit words in 
               <br />
               that Act of 1871 can pretend to any author- 
               <br />
               ity to take away any right or impose any 
               <br />
               obligation. In every way you look at it 
               <br />
               the intendment of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">second</span> section was 
               <br />
               to enable us to simply organize new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, so that they might pass laws. and 
               <br />
               administer their affairs. In support of my 
               <br />
               contention that it was never contemplated 
               <br />
               that we should be given power to subvert 
               <br />
               the constitution. I quote from the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake, who speaking in 1869 said :
