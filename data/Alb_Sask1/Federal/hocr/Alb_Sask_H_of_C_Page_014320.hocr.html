               <br />
               with his political valise. Perhaps I am 
               <br />
               wrong in saying that he had only one prin—

               <br />
               ed his little valise was to deprive it of the 
               <br />
               presence in it of his principle of political 
               <br />
               independence. It stood in the way of his 
               <br />
               entering the cabinet. It was thrown over- 
               <br />
               board and he got a portfolio. But it was 
               <br />
               not enough to get a portfolio. It is one 
               <br />
               thing to get a portfolio ; it is another thing 
               <br />
               to retain a portfolio. He has had some ex- 
               <br />
               periencc in both of these. He had to get rid 
               <br />
               of his other principle, and prohibition was 
               <br />
               thrown overboard, and with it his little

               sessed of another principle. What was that 
               <br />
               principle ? He had taken ofﬁce. He had 
               <br />
               become a strict party man. It was essential 
               <br />

               <br />
               a principle that he was bound to live up to 
               <br />
               —that he should be true and loyal to his 
               <br />

               remain in his valise? It was there until it

               suited his purpose to dispose of it, and when 
               <br />

               <br />
               ministers and ex-ministers and in one of his 
               <br />

               Let the hon. gentleman be frank and tell

               us if he resigned on principle. A few months 
               <br />
               ago he told the electors of North Toronto, 
               <br />
               if he is reported correctly in his own organs, 
               <br />
               that he resigned ofﬁce on a question of 
               <br />
               policy. I was present in this chamber <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> 
               <br />
               he stated to this House the reasons why he 
               <br />
               resigned oﬂice, and in those reasons there 
               <br />
               was no question of principle involved. He 
               <br />
               then declared that there was no difference 
               <br />
               between himself and his leader on any

               question of principle or of policy. but what
