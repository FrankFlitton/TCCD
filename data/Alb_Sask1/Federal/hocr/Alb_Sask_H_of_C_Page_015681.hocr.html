               This is a mere change in detail which we 
               <br />
               think will be more satisfactory to the people 
               <br />
               of both electoral districts. By the change 
               <br />
               proposed the north boundary of Pincher 
               <br />
               would he the north line of township 11. 
               <br />
               Starting at the summit of the Ro'cky Moun- 
               <br />
               tains and running due east on the north 
               <br />
               line of township 11 to the 5th meridian, then 
               <br />
               south 6 miles on the 5th meridian, then 
               <br />
               east to the east line of township 29, then 
               <br />
               south 12 miles, instead of 6 miles as shown 
               <br />
               on the map. then east 6 miles to the west 
               <br />
               line of range 28, then south, as shOWn on 
               <br />
               the map, to the southwest corner of the 
               <br />
               Piegan reserve, then running easterly along 
               <br />
               the south boundary of the Piegan reserve 
               <br />
               to the line between ranges 26 and 27, then 
               <br />
               south to the Belly river and follow the Bel- 
               <br />
               ly river to the Cardston boundary, then fol- 
               <br />
               low the Cardston boundary to the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains, then follow the summit of the 
               <br />
               Rocky Mountains to the place of beginning. 
               <br />
               The changes, while they will make some 
               <br />
               considerable changes in area, will make 
               <br />
               very little change in the population and we 
               <br />
