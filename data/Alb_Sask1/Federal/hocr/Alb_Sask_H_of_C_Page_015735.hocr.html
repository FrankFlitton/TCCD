               the bases of the Roman Catholic religion, 
               <br />
               so far as teaching is concerned, is that the

               The provision with regard to the teaching 
               <br />
               of language was also changed. In the pre- 
               <br />
               ceding ordinances, even in 1888, Sir John 
               <br />
               Thompson pointed to one of the clauses as 
               <br />
               being unwantonly complained against by the 
               <br />
               minority. That clause was to the eifect that 
               <br />
               the teaching in English was imperative in 
               <br />
               the schools. On that point I share the opinion 
               <br />
               of Sir John Thompson. There was no harm 
               <br />
               in that. French Canadians do not object to 
               <br />
               it. We all wish to learn English. I may 
               <br />
               say, without boasting, that, so far as the 
               <br />
               study of the dual language is concerned, 
               <br />
               we are far in advance of any of the Eng-

               lish-speaking prOVinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Take,</span> for instance.

               only this House, and I ask what is the pro-

               portion of English members who have taken 
               <br />
               the trouble to learn French compared with 
               <br />
               the number of French-speaking members 
               <br />
               who speak English? In this country. where 
               <br />
               one-third of the population is French Cana- 
               <br />
               dian, where the whole system of our consti- 
               <br />
               tution is based on a fair understanding be- 
               <br />
               tween the two races, it should be the duty 
               <br />
               of every provincial government to insert in 
               <br />
               its education laws the provision that both 
               <br />
               languages should be taught in its schools. 
               <br />
               Let those gentlemen who are often so ready 
               <br />
               to give lessons in loyalty go to the mother 
               <br />
               country, and they will ﬁnd that no man in 
               <br />
               England considers his education complete 
               <br />
               unless he learns the French tongue. Here 
               <br />
               in this country, where the French is the 
               <br />
               mother tongue of one-third of the population, 
               <br />
               why should so many of our English-speaking 
               <br />
               fellow-citizens show that blind inexplicable 
               <br />
               hatred against the teaching of French in 
               <br />

               French Canadians the right to impart the

               most important part of our teaching in 
               <br />
               French. That I maintain is perfectly just. 
               <br />
               But under the ordinance of 1892 the teach—

               <br />

               matters should be taught in the English 
               <br />

               Albert some years ago, at which I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>

               tem, in so far as the teaching of languages 
               <br />
               was concerned, was absurd, unjust and 
               <br />
               criminal. He ridiculed the idea of forcing

               of the House language which will perhaps

               bring them back to a better understanding

               of this question. We are now told that

               <br />

               What were the remarks made by the late

               Sir John Macdonald upon this point? When

               that he is addressing these remarks to this

               side of the House. May I ask him if that 
               <br />
               proposal does not come from his own side 
               <br />
               of the House?
