               gives expression to the wish of the united

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I have absolutely

               no doubt about that. There may be some 
               <br />

               we submit that the territories now coming

               In supporting that motion I remember dis- 
               <br />
               tinctly that I referred to the custom which 
               <br />
               prevailed in this House, especially amongst 
               <br />
               lawyers, of pleading vested rights and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me</span> 
               <br />
               cedents as a justiﬁcation for continuing 
               <br />
               rights acquired, and I said because of that. 
               <br />
               because that might be plead in the future, 
               <br />
               I will feel constrained to vote with the mem- 
               <br />
               her for North Simcoe (Mr. Dalton McCar-

               moment was not convenient for me to give

               an answer as my hon. friend wanted to

               have, Simply yes or no. The question was 
               <br />
               asked: Why do you not apply the provi- 
               <br />
               sions of section 93 at once without anything
