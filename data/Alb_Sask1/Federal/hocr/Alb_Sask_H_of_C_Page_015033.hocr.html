               of antagonism to the idea of union has 
               <br />
               grown up. It is impossible that people who 
               <br />
               have any self-respect should submit to these 
               <br />
               threats or should give way to pressure of 
               <br />
               this kind. That feeling has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">growing.</span> 
               <br />
               and there is, further, a strong and rooted

               Oblection to throwing in their fortune with

               a province which has so many heavy and

               serious liabilities at this time. A union 
               <br />
               with Manitoba would be entirely out of the

               <br />

               that if a vote were taken on this question 
               <br />

               The school clauses of the Bill have been 
               <br />
               the subject of much criticism and much 
               <br />
               discussion, and their consideration has 
               <br />
               taken up most of the time of the House. 
               <br />
               I am not a lawyer and I cannot discuss the 
               <br />
               matter from a constitutional point of view, 
               <br />
               but I have heard the opinions of constitu- 
               <br />
               tional lawyers on both sides of the House, 
               <br />
               and I must say that the different conclu- 
               <br />
               sions at which they have arrived have con- 
               <br />
               fused rather than enlightened those who 
               <br />
               listened to them. I will speak on the school 
               <br />
               question from a point of view different from 
               <br />
               that taken by any other gentleman who has 
               <br />
               spoken on the subject. I have been living 
               <br />
               in the Northwest for many years. I have 
               <br />
               reared a family there. and I am going to 
               <br />
               speak on the subject from the point of 
               <br />
               view of the father of a family whose chil- 
               <br />
               dren have attended those schools which are 
               <br />
               under diseussion. I have availed myself 
               <br />
               of .the opportunity to somewhat carefully 
               <br />
               study our scho‘ol system since I went into 
               <br />
               that country. because I have always con- 
               <br />
               sidered the education of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> family to be a 
               <br />
               very serious matter. I can say this, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, and I can say it frankly and 
               <br />
               plainly, that in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               we have as good a school system as exists 
               <br />
               anywhere in Canada. The people who use 
               <br />
               these schools are satisﬁed with them. We 
               <br />
               can turn to our friends from Quebec and we 
               <br />
               can say to them: Your compatriots and 
               <br />
               your co-religionisfs in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories are satisﬁed with those schools ; and 
               <br />
               we can say to our friends from Ontario or 
               <br />
               any of the other Protestant provinces: We, 
               <br />
               the Protestants of the Northwest are satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed with our school system which has 
               <br />
               worked well and is satisfactory to every 
               <br />
               one concerned. Let me say, Sir, that from 
               <br />
               the constituency which I_ have the honour 
               <br />
               to represent I have had not a single peti- 
               <br />
               tion asking me to do anything else than to 
               <br />
               support the system of schools which is at 
               <br />
               present established in that country. I would 
               <br />
               like to say one thing further, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               and that is, that after listening to the 
               <br />
               speeches made from the opposition side of 
               <br />
               the House, I do not think that any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">011?-</span> 
               <br />
               of them described the actual state of affairs.

               great deal about shackling the new pro-

               mystery to the people of the west them-

               travelling on trains, passing through 
               <br />
               the country and meeting people of all 
               <br />
               kinds, I failed to ﬁnd a single man

               who really understood the exact state of 
               <br />

               <br />
               school clauses of thiS’Bill become law. The 
               <br />
               fact of the matter is that to ﬁnd any agita-

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ADAMISON.</span> There are at least eleven 
               <br />
               hundred schools now in operation in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. Any of the school 
               <br />
               districts have the power, if they choose to 
               <br />
               exercise it, to call into operation the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sepa‘</span> 
               <br />
               rate school clauses ot‘ the Act, but we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that less than one per cent of them have 
               <br />
               done so, and that one per cent is hardly 
               <br />
               noticed although both Protestant and Catho- 
               <br />
               lic children do attend these separate schools. 
               <br />
               I lived within twelve miles of one of these 
               <br />
               separate schools for a long time without 
               <br />
               knowing that there was a separate school 
               <br />
               there. I think every member of this House 
               <br />
               who seriously considers the question will 
               <br />
               acknowledge that this is just as close as we 
               <br />
               possibly can get to having a national school 
               <br />
               system. We had a very pleasant picture 
               <br />
               drawn by the member for Middlesex (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bison) of a condition of aﬁairs which he 
               <br />
               considered to be ideal, in which children 
               <br />
               grew up together knowing one another well, 
               <br />
               and becoming closer in friendship and more 
               <br />
               united in ideas. We all agree with that. 
               <br />
               The ideal state of aﬁairs possibly would be 
               <br />
               that, and I contend that in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories we have attained as near as is 
               <br />
               humanly possible to that ideal. Now, I do not 
               <br />
               say that religious instruction in the schools is 
               <br />
               good, nor do I say it is bad ; but, acting on 
               <br />
               the assumption that national schools are 
               <br />
               actual perfection, and seeing that the ex- 
               <br />
               treme limit of religious instruction which 
               <br />
               can be given in these schools amounts to 
               <br />
               one—half hour each day, then in the North- 
               <br />
