               the government schedule which lies on the 
               <br />
               table. I have just one more word to say. 
               <br />
               1 think that I have shown that when the 
               <br />
               government put into the Bill these words, 
               <br />
               'liaving due regard to the distribution of 
               <br />
               population and existing local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dinsions.’</span> they 
               <br />
               put in something that was not true. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.215</span> not been due regard paid to population, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> 11d existing locnl divisions have been abso- 
               <br />
               lutely ignored. And the dangerous port of 
               <br />
               it is that the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta</span> know and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deeply</span> feel the injustice that is being placed 
               <br />
               on the southern half of the population.

               Now, I want to submit this question to 
               <br />
               this House in, as near as I can, an .absolu- 
               <br />
               tely impartial spirit. You are about to 
               <br />
               create a new province; you are about to 
               <br />
               give to that new province 3 legislature 
               <br />
               which will be called upon to enact laws 
               <br />
               for the government of that province. That 
               <br />
               legislature, when it ﬁrst meets. will un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly have much important business 
               <br />
               which will require its immediate attention. 
               <br />
               If that legislature is eLected under that 
               <br />
               schedule. do you suppose that it will be 
               <br />
               able to give -to that business its closest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at-</span> 
               <br />
               tention‘? If the legislature is elected on 
               <br />
               that schedule, it will be composed of men 
               <br />
               a large majority of whom at least will be 
               <br />
               burning with resentment at the wrong done 
               <br />
               to them, and will endeavour to right that 
               <br />
               wrong. Is it wise for this House to 
               <br />
               launch the new province under such aus- 
               <br />
               pices as that? Is it wise to throw apples 
               <br />
               of discord into the midst of this new legis- 
               <br />
               lative body, and practically damn it at 
               <br />
               the commencement of its career with a 
               <br />
               quarrel which it will take years to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settle?</span> 
               <br />
               Why does the government endeavour to so 
               <br />
               juggle the cards that the north will have 
               <br />
               an advantage over the south in the selec- 
               <br />
               tion of the capital? Why does it put a
