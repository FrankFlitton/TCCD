               <br />
               section I want to point out this. A good 
               <br />
               many members of this House seem to have 
               <br />
               been labouring under the misapprehension 
               <br />
               that the effect of that clause is to embody 
               <br />
               all the provisions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oi</span> these ordinances as 
               <br />
               they exist, the llmita ions and duties of the 
               <br />
               minority. as well as their rights and privi- 
               <br />
               leges. Now, it requires not a very. close 
               <br />
               reading of that section to see that it in- 
               <br />
               cludes only the provisions which relate to 
               <br />
               rights and privileges. If this parliament 
               <br />
               had passed the original clause as it was pro- 
               <br />
               posed by the Prime Minister, the legisla- 
               <br />
               tures of the new provinces would have had 
               <br />
               a right to legislate with respect to educa- 
               <br />
               tion in any way they saw ﬁt, subject only 
               <br />
               to this condition—that it must always be 
               <br />
               provided by the law that there should be 
               <br />
               separate schools. I believe that, under the 
               <br />
               original section, the legislatures of the new 
               <br />
               provinces could have cut down the half 
               <br />
               hour of religious instruction. and they could 
               <br />
               have made any provisions they chose with 
               <br />
               respect to the schools, provided they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">main</span> 
               <br />
               tained a school which would pass as a 
               <br />
               separate school. Under the terms of sub-
