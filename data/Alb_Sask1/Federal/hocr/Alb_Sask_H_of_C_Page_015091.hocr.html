               <br />
               their rights and powers. I believe that the 
               <br />
               word ‘autonomy’ as mentioned in the Bill 
               <br />

               <br />
               it in common parlance and in the diction-

               <br />
               self—government.’ I desire to view this 
               <br />
               Bill purely from the standpoint of the legal 
               <br />
               and constitutional questions involved, and 
               <br />
               I regret that on this occasion we are call- 
               <br />
               ed upon to deal with acrimonious questions 
               <br />
               that were discussed in former days and 
               <br />
               which we had hoped were set at rest when 
               <br />
               confederation was formed. I believe it 
               <br />
               was the intention of the founders of con- 
               <br />
               federation to arrive at a ﬁnal decision as 
               <br />
               to what should be the underlying principles, 
               <br />
               the substrata of the confederation of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and it seems to me that the idea of 
               <br />
               the public men of that day was that the 
               <br />
               questions which we are now discussing 
               <br />
               were then ﬁnally settled. In my view the 
               <br />
               powers which the then provinces were to 
               <br />
               have, and that all new provinces were to 
               <br />
               be accorded were laid down in deﬁned and 
               <br />
               well understood axioms of our constitution. 
               <br />
               I believe that the educational question 
               <br />
               which is a very important one was sought 
               <br />
               to be set at rest by the Confederation Act 
               <br />
               of 1867, as amended by subsequent Acts. 
               <br />
               In looking at this Bill from a general stand- 
               <br />
               point the two most important features of 
               <br />
               it refer to the control of the lands and ques- 
               <br />
               tion of education. It is my opinion that 
               <br />
               the public domain of the new provinces 
               <br />
               should be controlled by those who are to 
               <br />
               administer the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs</span> of that country, and 
               <br />
               I found this opinion largely upon the state- 
               <br />
               ments of Hon. Alexander Mackenzie and 
               <br />
               the Hon. Edward Blake. which were made 
               <br />
               during the discussion in this parliament 
               <br />
               when the Northwest Territories were being 
               <br />
               admitted into the union as Territories, and 
               <br />
               when the question also arose as to the then 
               <br />
               proposed admission of Newfoundland. It 
               <br />
               was proposed that Newfoundland should be 
               <br />
               given $150,000 a year in lieu of its lands. 
               <br />
               and the Hon. Edward Blake is on record as 
               <br />
               having said : 
               <br />

               He was very strongly opposed to the Dom-

               <br />
               province of Ontario, in which we exer-

               British policy ; and the British North Am-

               ing these provinces an indemnity in lieu 
               <br />
               of their lands; and I venture to say that 
               <br />
               that is only a matter of guess work. We 
               <br />
               are giving them what is now considered a 
               <br />
               fair compensation for depriving them of 
               <br />
               their lands. That may or may not be an 
               <br />
               adequate amount in- the future. It may 
               <br />
               work out as a hardship on this parliament, 
               <br />
               or as a hardship on the Territories, as the 
               <br />
               case may be. Further, pursuing what I 
               <br />
               understand to be the policy of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party, the policy of decentralization, which 
               <br />
               has always commended itself to my mind, 
               <br />
               I think it is best to let the local authorities 
               <br />
               have such power as they are entitled to, 
               <br />
               and as it is reasonably possible to let them 
               <br />
               have, so as to prevent congestion at one 
               <br />
               particular point of interest which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> be 
               <br />
               diverse in character. _
