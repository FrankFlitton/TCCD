               English Protestant ministers out of seven 
               <br />

               there is at present in the Quebec legisla-

               Nova Scotia, representing a French Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />
               side of'the House and on the other side, 
               <br />
               English-speaking Protestants of Ontario re-

               presenting French Canadian counties in the

               that in creating only one province we would

               of the cabinet. I have no doubt they worked 
               <br />
               very hard to get more. I am willing to ac- 
               <br />
               cept what they have got, trusting that in 
               <br />
               the near future one of those provinces will 
               <br />
               have a majority of Catholics. That time 
               <br />
               may come in ten years, and then we shall 
               <br />
               see in which of those two provinces the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"Be</span> best respected. 
               <br />
               I trust that the spirit of British fair play 
               <br />
               which is now being stiﬂed by a portion of 
               <br />
               the Ontario press and some of the Ontario 
               <br />
               members will assert itself some day and 
               <br />
               give justice to the minorities in the North- 
               <br />
               west.
