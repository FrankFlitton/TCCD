               Mr. FISHER. It was the election of Mr. 
               <br />
               Langevin, in Charlevois. The case was tried 
               <br />
               in the courts. and the interference of the 
               <br />
               church was proved. Somebody on the other 
               <br />
               side of the House a little while ago talked 
               <br />
               about proof—when was proof required, when 
               <br />
               was proof given, and so on. I think it was 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Beauharnois (Mr. Ber— 
               <br />
               ger-on). I cannot quote the exact volume 
               <br />
               of the reports in which that case appears; 
               <br />
               but the hon. gentleman, who is a lawyer, 
               <br />
               can ﬁnd it himself, and he will see that 
               <br />
               the proof was given. I do not think it was 
               <br />
               the only case, but it was the one I had in 
               <br />
               my mind at the moment. The Papal dele- 
               <br />
               gate was sent to Canada. not to interfere 
               <br />
               in political matters, or with legislation, but
