               the security of the policy holders ought to

               have the best possible administration. I do

               not think the best administration of these 
               <br />
               funds can be secured when it is possible for 
               <br />
               their management to fall into the hands of 
               <br />
               two or three men who by controlling the

               shares of the proprietary company are free 
               <br />
               to do what they like with great funds of this

               kind. It is openly charged by the leading 
               <br />
               newspapers in the United States to-day that 
               <br />
               Harriman and Gould are anxious to get con-

               <br />
               with the $500,000,000 of trust money which 
               <br />
               is the absolute property of the policy holders, 
               <br />
               in order that they may use it for their great

               of reaching the same condition in this emin-
