               One of the questions which had to be 
               <br />
               considered in connection with this matter 
               <br />

               <br />
               may be permitted to say that I was my-

               self quite strnngly in favour of the propo- 
               <br />
               sition that only one province should be 
               <br />
               created; and even yet, looking at the ques- 
               <br />
               tion purely from the local and territorial 
               <br />
               point of View, I can see no reason why one 
               <br />
               government, one legislature, one set of ma- 
               <br />
               chinery, should not have been sufﬁcient for 
               <br />
               that territory. But, 011 the other hand, I 
               <br />
               was bound to recognize, as the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories generally have recognized. 
               <br />
               that the othEr partners <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> confederation had 
               <br />
               a right to an opinion in this matter, and 
               <br />
               the decision which has been come to, to 
               <br />
               create two provinces, is, I think, generally 
               <br />
               satisfactory to the people of the North-

               the dividing line was not looked upon, on 
               <br />
               my part at least, as being a contentious 
               <br />
               matter. From my point of View, it would

               have been better for my province, in one

               <br />

               responsibility as regards the line to divide 
               <br />
               the area. I may say that my own advice 
               <br />
               was that the present eastern boundary of 
               <br />
               Alberta should be selected as the dividing 
               <br />
               line and I still believe that the future will 
               <br />
               Show that that would have been the .most 
               <br />

               <br />
               vinces. looking to their future populations. 
               <br />
               It must not be forgotten that the province 
               <br />
               of Alberta will have in the extreme north :1 
               <br />
               large habitable area, the counterpart of 
               <br />
               which the province of Saskatchewan will 
               <br />
               not possess. My hon. friend from Calgary 
               <br />
               suggested that the area covered by the 
               <br />
               foothills in the Rocky Mountains should, so 
               <br />
               far as population is concerned, be elimi- 
               <br />
               nated. I do not agree with him at all in 
               <br />
               that regard. There are immense coal de— 
               <br />
               posits in that area. and I have no doubt 
               <br />
               that in the years to come there will be im-

               <br />
               inclined to think that they have more bear- 
               <br />
