               Mr. BRODEUR. I do not quite agree 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend. I have always be- 
               <br />
               lieved that every legislature in this country 
               <br />
               must be supposed to carry out the law with 
               <br />
               a certain degree of honesty and rectitude. 
               <br />
               Perhaps my hon. friend will not agree to 
               <br />
               that, but I may say this, that any law 
               <br />
               that might be passed in this parliament, if 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial]</span> authorities did not try to 
               <br />
               carry it out according to its terms, that law 
               <br />
               would be of no effect, even if drafted by 
               <br />
               the ablest men you can ﬁnd in this country. 
               <br />
               I say we must always rely to a large ex- 
               <br />
               tent upon the honesty and rectitude of the 
               <br />
               legislatures. I know very well, Mr. Speak- 
               <br />
               er, that in the province of Ontario, in spite 
               <br />
               of the law which now protects the minority 
               <br />
               in their rights, any provincial government 
               <br />
               could defeat the effect of that law without 
               <br />
               passing any legislation which would be de- 
               <br />
               clared illegal or unconstitutional under sec- 
               <br />
               tion 1. My hon. friend knows very well 
               <br />
               that the same thing could be done in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec with regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Pro</span> 
               <br />
               testant minority. But I repeat, we must 
               <br />
               have some faith in the rectitude and in the 
               <br />
               honesty of provincial legislatures. More- 
               <br />
               over, Mr. Speaker, why should we say 
               <br />
               that the rights of a minority are not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁ-</span> 
               <br />
               ciently protected when the minority itself 
               <br />
               does not even complain of What has oc- 
               <br />
               curred since 1892? In 1892 an ordinance 
               <br />
               was passed by the Northwest legislature by 
               <br />
               which the rights of the minority were toa 
               <br />
               considerable extent curtailed. The mino- 
               <br />
               rity came before this government for relief, 
               <br />
               and the government refused to disallow the 
               <br />
               ordinance. My hon. friend from Beauhar- 
               <br />
               nois (Mr. Bergeron) said the other day that 
               <br />
               the government refused to disallow that 
               <br />
               ordinance because it was too late ; and also, 
               <br />
               because Mr. Blake had made a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1110111011</span> 
               <br />
               by which the government could not dis-

               allow that ordinance. I suppose my

               Mr. BERGERON. I was speaking about 
               <br />
               the Manitoba law, not about the Northwest 
               <br />
               law. I gave another reason regarding the 
               <br />
               ordinances, I said that the ordinance of 
               <br />
               1892 was not disallowed because it was a 
               <br />
               reenactment of an ordinance of 1891, and 
               <br />
               that it was too late to disallow the“ordi-

               late, but the disallowance of the ordinance 
               <br />

               Mr. BRODEUR. At all events, the mino-

               rity since then has accepted that state of 
               <br />
               affairs. They had a right to come here and 
               <br />
               ask for remedial legislation. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) did not deny 
               <br />
               that they could have come to the govern- 
               <br />
               ment here and asked for remedial legisla- 
               <br />
               tion. But they did not do so, they accepted 
               <br />
               the situation, they abided by the decision of 
               <br />
               the government.
