               <br />
               I would ask the promoter of the Bill it' he 
               <br />
               has considered the nature of this amend~‘ 
               <br />
               ment, and whether he desires an amend- 
               <br />
               ment along that line. I understood the clause 
               <br />
               was desired in order to conform with the 
               <br />
               requirements of the Railway Committee.

               Mr. EMMERSON. If any one had the 
               <br />
               intention of proposing such an amendment 
               <br />
               he did not make it known before the com~ 
               <br />
               mittee. I would call my hon. friend’s at- 
               <br />
               tention to the fact that section 5 as now in 
               <br />
               the Bill is the standard section, and I think 
               <br />
               it we adopt the amendment it would be 
               <br />
               a departure from the course invariably pur-

               <br />
               which was drafted and put into my hands 
               <br />
               seems to be for the improvement of the 
               <br />
               Bill, to make it conform with what is gen- 
               <br />
               erally done in the Railway Committee. The 
               <br />
               clause makes reference to the construction 
               <br />
               of the railway authorized by the said Act 
               <br />
               of the province of British Columbia. Now 
               <br />
               are we not making a provision for the con- 
               <br />
               struction of the railway authorized by this 
               <br />
               Act? It seems to me that the clause otferetl 
               <br />
               is a limited clause, and will not in the event 
               <br />
               of section 3 being adopted cover the Whole
