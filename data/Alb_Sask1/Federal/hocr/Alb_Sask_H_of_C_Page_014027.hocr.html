               I need hardly remind the House that I have 
               <br />
               always opposed and continue to oppose the sys- 
               <br />
               tem of sectarian education, so far as the public 
               <br />
               chest is concerned. I have never had any 
               <br />
               hesitation on that point, I have never been able 
               <br />
               to see why all the people in the province, to 
               <br />
               whatever sect they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> belong, should not send 
               <br />
               their children to the same schools to receive 
               <br />
               the ordinary branches of instruction. I regard 
               <br />
               the parent and the pastor as the best religious 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               . ample opportunity afforded to the clergy to give 
               <br />
               religious instruction to the children of their 
               <br />
               ﬂocks, I cannot see any sound objection to mixed 
               <br />
               schools. But while in the conference and else- 
               <br />
               where I have always maintained this view, and 
               <br />
               always given my vote against sectarian public 
               <br />
               schools, I am bound to admit, as I have always 
               <br />
               admitted, that the sectarian system carried to 
               <br />
               the limited extent it has yet been in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada, and conﬁned as it" chieﬂy is to cities 
               <br />
               and towns. has not been a very great practical 
               <br />
               injury. The real cause of a line was that the 
               <br />
               admission of the sectarian principle was there, 
               <br />
               and that at any moment it might be extended 
               <br />
               to such a degree as to split up our school sys— 
               <br />
               tem altogether. There are about a hundred 
               <br />
               separate schools in Upper Canada, out of some 
               <br />
               4,000, and all Roman Catholic. But if the R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholics are entitled to separate schools 
               <br />
               and to go on extending their operations, so are 
               <br />
               the members of the Church of England, the 
               <br />
               Pr-eshyterians, the Methodists, and all other 
               <br />
               sects. No candid Roman Catholic will deny 
               <br />
               this for a moment; and there lays the great 
               <br />
               danger to our educational fabric, lest the sepa- 
               <br />
               rate system might gradually extend itself until 
               <br />
               the whole country was studded with nurseries 
               <br />
               of sectarianism,‘ most hurtful to the best in-

               <br />
               that so prodigal a system of public instruction 
               <br />
               must inevitably entail. Now, it is known to 
               <br />
               every hon. member of this House that an Act 
               <br />
               was passed in 1863 as a. ﬁnal settlement of this 
               <br />
               sectarian controversy. I was not. in Quebec at the 
               <br />
               time, but if I had been here, I would have voted 
               <br />
               against that Bill because it extended the facili- 
               <br />
               ties for establishing separate schools. It had, 
               <br />
               however, this good feature, that it was accept- 
               <br />
               ed by the Roman Catholic authorities and car— 
               <br />
               ried to parliament as a ﬁnal compromise of the 
               <br />
               question in Upper Canada. When, therefore, it 
               <br />
               was proposed that a provision should be insert— 
               <br />
               ed in the confederation scheme to bind that 
               <br />

               Sir, Mr. Brown told his friends that he 
               <br />
               did not believe in separate schools; but 
               <br />
               there were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fellovvvcitizens</span> of his in On- 
               <br />
               tario and in Quebec who believed in separate 
               <br />
               schools, and, in order to remove their 01)- 
               <br />
               jections and win their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cooperation</span> in the 
               <br />
               scheme which was the great work of his 
               <br />
               life, he agreed to make the sacriﬁce of his 
               <br />
               own convictions. In order to achieve the 
               <br />
               great object he had at heart, he agreed to 
               <br />

               which he did not believe, but in which 
               <br />
               others did believe. Sir, for more than twenty 
               <br />
               years Mr. Brown has been in his grave; 
               <br />
               but his memory is not dead. And if his 
               <br />
               teachings and his spirit be still alive. It is 
               <br />
               surely in the hearts of that staunch yeo-

               manry of Ontario who gave him such con-
