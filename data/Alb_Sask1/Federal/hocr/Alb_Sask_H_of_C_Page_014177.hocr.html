               question that appeals to my mind. If for

               centuries past the education of the French 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[topic</span> has been under the wing of the 
               <br />
               church and the church has directed it and 
               <br />
               worked into it its religious tenets and dog- 
               <br />
               ma, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«it</span> has resulted in giving them an 
               <br />
               uneducated people. I was told by a 
               <br />
               Frenchman a short time ago that France 
               <br />
               is a nation of atheists <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> I was 
               <br />
               told that by a Frenchman who ought 
               <br />
               to know. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And,</span> if that is What has been 
               <br />
               accomplished with full control of edu- 
               <br />
               cation in the hands of the church—if it 
               <br />
               means the turning out of a nation of illiter- 
               <br />
               ates and atheists, then surely, it is not amiss 
               <br />
               to place education wholly beyond the con- 
               <br />
               trol of the church. Is not that one of the 
               <br />
               strongest arguments that could be found in 
               <br />
               favour of that course ? And that is the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> reason that France is following that 
               <br />
               course to-day. President Loubet declares

               that it is proper and right, and that France 
               <br />
               must do it. And if we try to keep education

               flee from the control of the same church, 
               <br />
               is it to be said that we are fanatics? I can—
