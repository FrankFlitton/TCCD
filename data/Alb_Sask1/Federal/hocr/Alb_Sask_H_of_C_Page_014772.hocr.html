               <br />
               Were I not impelled by a sense of the 
               <br />
               responsibility which rests upon me, as 
               <br />

               up my voice in opposition to the clauses of

               this Bill which I believe interfere with 
               <br />
               British institutions and British traditions, 
               <br />
               I would leave the discussion of this matter

               entirely in the hands of the older and more 
               <br />
               experienced members of this House. But I 
               <br />
               feel bound by a sense of duty to put my 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> on record. The importance of this 
               <br />
               measure cannot be minimized. We have 
               <br />
               now reached a period in our history when 
               <br />
               our western Territories have developed 
               <br />
               to such an extent that they require 
               <br />
               greater autonomy and are entitled to 
               <br />
               be raised to the status of a province. 
               <br />
               What we are about to do is not to 
               <br />
               create new provinces in the sense of estab- 
               <br />
               lishing provinces with new peoples and new 
               <br />
               traditions, but we are simply lengthening 
               <br />
               the cords and strengthening the s‘altes of

               the rights, powers and authorities to which 
               <br />
               they are entitled under our Confederation 
               <br />
               Acts. In doing this. we should be actuated 
               <br />
               by that broad and liberal spirit which my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Peterborough (Mr Hall) 
               <br />
               tells us characterized the fathers of confed- 
               <br />
               eration ; we should seek to avoid being nig- 
               <br />
               gardly in the legislation by which we are 
               <br />
               conferring a constitution on these provinces. 
               <br />
               We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be careful not to impose on them 
               <br />
               any bonds or shackles which may give rise 
               <br />
               to heart-burnings in the future, but give 
               <br />
               them a broad and liberal constitution which 
               <br />
               in years to come they will regard as a 
               <br />
               measure that was conceived and discussed 
               <br />
               in the broadest spirit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> statesmanship. But 
               <br />
               that will be a realization which we cannot 
               <br />
               hope for, should this Bill go through with 
               <br />
