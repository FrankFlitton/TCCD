               Mr. HENDERSON. I think this case is

               <br />
               have the example of Quebec staring them 
               <br />
               in the face, and will possibly be warned 
               <br />
               by that. But leaving that aside. I think

               look forward to the time when these enor- 
               <br />
               mous subsidies are going to be a very heavy

               charge on this country. What is to become 
               <br />
               of the Dominion if we are going year after 
               <br />
               year to increase the revenues of the pro-

               <br />
               look forward to a time when possibly the 
               <br />
               revenues of the Dominion, which have been 
               <br />
               swollen of late years, will not increase so 
               <br />
               ra idly, and when we may possibly be 
               <br />

               try for the purpose of providing these large 
               <br />
               subsidies. I have made no calculation as 
               <br />
               to What additional sum would require to be 
               <br />
               paid by the Dominion on account of the 
               <br />
               creation of these new provinces, but I am 
               <br />
               under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> impresgion that the amount 
               <br />
               would be somewhat alarming. I would 
               <br />
               be glad if some hon. gentleman who has 
               <br />
               made the calculation would inform the

               committee just what it is at the present 
               <br />
               time; and it is not to the present alone 
               <br />
               that we must look, but also to the near 
               <br />
               future. The population of that country 
               <br />
               will increase from year to year, and when 
               <br />
               it reaches 800,000 in each province, the 
               <br />
               subsidy at 80 cents a head will amount to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$640000,</span> or double that for the two pro-

               Finance does not admit that it has been a

               failure: he claims that it has been a suc- 
               <br />
               cess. But I remember distinctly that some 
               <br />
               years ago the Hon. Edward Blake declared 
               <br />
               it to be a failure. Sir Richard Cartwright 
               <br />
               said the same thing. He said over and 
               <br />
               over again that he was opposed to the 
               <br />
               principle, because it only created an ambi-

               <br />
               that it would inevitably lead a political 
               <br />
               party in a province, when the same party 
               <br />
               was in power in the Dominion, to appeal 
               <br />
               to the electors for support on the ground 
               <br />
               that they were going to get the provincial 
               <br />
               subsidy increased or get the Dominion to 
               <br />
               assume a debt which they had improvident— 
               <br />
               ly rolled up: and thus they would have 
               <br />
               a powerful lever in their hands to induce 
               <br />
               the electorate to return them to power. Is 
               <br />
               it not a fact that a political party in the 
               <br />
               maritime provinces have run the elections 
               <br />
               more than once on that ground, declaring 
               <br />
               that if they were returned, their friends 
               <br />
               being in power in the federal parliament, 
               <br />
               they would have a better chance of getting 
               <br />
               the provincial subsidy increased than if the 
               <br />
               Conservative party were in power? And 
               <br />
               the result was that they were successful. 
               <br />
               The same question was raised in the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec and the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iparty</span> suc- 
               <br />
               ceeded. We have had it knocking at the 
               <br />
               doors of the federal parliament for an in- 
               <br />
               crease in the subsidy, and we have had the 
               <br />
               declaration of the First Minister to—day that 
               <br />
               we must deal with that question in the near 
               <br />
               future. Is not that an evidence that the 
               <br />
               principle is an unsound one 7 We should 
               <br />
               adopt a principle which would be a ﬁnality 
               <br />
               and under which we would not have this 
               <br />
               menace constantly before us. It is for 
               <br />
               these reasons that I draw attention to the 
               <br />
               matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today;</span> and when we are forming 
               <br />
               these new provinces, it seems to me a ﬁt- 
               <br />
               ting time to adopt a correct principle with 
               <br />
               regard to them, and then try to deal with 
               <br />
               the other provinces on a similar principle. 
               <br />
               I asked if there was some correspondence, 
               <br />
               because I assumed that if there had been 
               <br />
               no correspondence before the ﬁnancial de- 
               <br />
               tails were announced, there would not be 
               <br />
               much trouble at the present time. The 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial arrangement is quite liberal now, 
               <br />
               in view of the small population. At the 
               <br />
               present time, when each province is sup- 
               <br />
               posed to have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[population</span> of 250,000, it 
               <br />
               will give at least $1,100.000 to each pro- 
               <br />
               vince. Then a province of 250,000 people 
               <br />
               would be getting $1,124,000. That would be 
               <br />
               regarded as rather lavish taking into 
               <br />
               account the smallness of the population. 
               <br />
               But when they reach the maximum of 800.-
