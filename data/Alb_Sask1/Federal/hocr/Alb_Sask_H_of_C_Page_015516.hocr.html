               after we asked for them, the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) asked for 
               <br />
               the number of voters in each local constitu- 
               <br />
               ency and the number of votes polled, but 
               <br />
               notwithstanding that we have been waiting 
               <br />
               ever since for that information, it is only 
               <br />
               to—d-ay that it is vouchsafed to the House. 
               <br />
               In its absence we have been obliged to make 
               <br />
               calculations for ourselves; these calcula— 
               <br />
               tions we have made very carefully and they 
               <br />
               are very far apart from the ﬁgures given to 
               <br />
               the House by the First Minister. When the 
               <br />
               schedules were introduced in this House the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition stated that he had 
               <br />
               been advised by his friends from the west 
               <br />
               that the schedules were manifestly unfair, 
               <br />
               and it now devolves upon the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man from Alberta (Mr. Herron) and upon 
               <br />
               myself, to assume the responsibility of hav- 
               <br />
               ing made this statement to the member for 
               <br />
               Carleton (Mr. R. L. Borden). I hope to be 
               <br />
               able to show, before I take my seat, that 
               <br />
               there are a cousiderable number of people 
               <br />
               in Southern and Central Alberta who have 
               <br />
               characterized this schedule as being unfair. 
               <br />
               The Prime Minister says that certain con- 
               <br />
               stituencies have been left entirely as they 
               <br />
               were while others have been divided, and 
               <br />
               in the case of the constituencies which have 
               <br />
               been left as they were the kernel of the 
               <br />
               whole thing is that they all lie in the south- 
               <br />
               ern part of that province ; not one constitu- 
               <br />
               ency north of township 24 has been left as 
               <br />
               it was before, although they run up as high 
               <br />
               as township 60. That very fact should have 
               <br />
               been sufﬁcient to put the First Minister on 
               <br />
               his guard, and to have caused him to sus— 
               <br />
               pect that there was some discrimination 
               <br />
               against the southern part of that country. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman told us that Me~ 
               <br />
               dicine Hat in the south had been left pract- 
               <br />
               ically the same, but I desire to point out 
               <br />
               that at least 40 townships have been added 
               <br />
               to the old constituency Of Medicine Hat. 
               <br />
               Nothwithstanding that there is an addition- 
               <br />
               al representation in that province of 10 
               <br />
               members, the constituency of Medicine Hat 
               <br />
               has been enlarged by at least 40 townships 
               <br />
               of 6 miles square, indicating that instead of 
               <br />
               there being any development in that section 
               <br />
               of the country it probably has gone back- 
               <br />
               wards. The right hon. gentleman told us 
               <br />
               that Cardston has been left untouched ; but 
               <br />
               is Cardston just the same to-day as it was 
               <br />
               when the Northwest assembly made it a 
               <br />
               constituency in 1902, or has there not been 
               <br />
               an inﬂux of population into that constitu- 
               <br />
               ency ? We are told that Lethbridge has been 
               <br />
               left just as it was ; has there been no deve- 
               <br />
               lopment which required a change in Leth- 
               <br />
               bridge? We are told that Macleod is divided 
               <br />
               in two, that High River is left practically 
               <br />
               the same, that Banff is added to, that Cal- 
               <br />
               gary is practically the same—the city of 
               <br />
               Calgary is given one representative, but it 
               <br />
               had two members in the old House, one for 
               <br />
               East Calgary and one for West Calgary. As 
               <br />
               I have said, I hope to be able to satisfy the 
               <br />
