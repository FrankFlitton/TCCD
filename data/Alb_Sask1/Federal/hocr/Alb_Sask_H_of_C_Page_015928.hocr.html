               this year, because our immediate ﬁnancial needs

               approve of delay until all doubts of the Can-

               adian Paciﬁc Railway tax question is removed. 
               <br />
               I hope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> doubt will not exist very long. I

               <br />
               the position I take is that the gOVernment

               The situation in January last when the

               Now, I shall explain brieﬂy the leasou why
