               Therefore according to the statement of

               Under the New Brunswick Act as has al- 
               <br />
               ready been pointed out, a question arose

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> regard to the character of certain

               nominational and it was held that they 
               <br />
               were not denominational and therefore no

               but the word ‘denominational’ is changed 
               <br />
