               <br />
               say he cannot produce a map in any man- 
               <br />
               ner or shape which will not show a Liberal 
               <br />
               majority in both provinces. What is the 
               <br />
               use of charging gerrymander simply be- 
               <br />
               cause possibly these plans when worked 
               <br />
               out on last fall’s vote show a Liberal ma- 
               <br />
               jority in these provinces, if my hon. friend 
               <br />
               cannot produce any map which will not do 
               <br />
               so? It is not only the northern part that 
               <br />
               is Liberal, even by last fall's vote. It is 
               <br />
               true the north gave a Liberal majority of 
               <br />
               7.000. but the south also gaveaLiberal ma- 
               <br />
               jority, and the best possible proof that there 
               <br />
               is no injustice is that in-the ﬁve south ridings 
               <br />
               there was a Liberal majority of fully 1,000, 
               <br />

               liament in this country, that could be so 
               <br />
               absolutely justiﬁed as that Alberta redis- 
               <br />
               tribution was justiﬁed by the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior. However, there was a very 
               <br />
               material <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">djﬁerence</span> in the cases of Alberta 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan. In the case of Alberta 
               <br />
               ten seats had to be added to ﬁfteen, and it 
               <br />
               was necessary to very largely recast the 
               <br />
               lines of the old districts as they had existed 
               <br />
               for the purposes of representation in the 
               <br />
               legislature. In the case of Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               on the other hand. we were only compelled 
               <br />
               to add ﬁve to twenty seats, making it a 
               <br />
               very materially different proposition. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fol&lt;</span>

               lowing the general plan which was agreed 
               <br />
               upon at the outset, of giving incorporated 
               <br />
               cities :1 seat, we found it possible, by allow- 
               <br />
               ing three of the ﬁve to go to'the north and 
               <br />
               two to the south and by putting the two in 
               <br />
               the south in the two cities of Regina and 
               <br />
               Moosejaw, to leave the lines as arranged by 
               <br />
               the legislature three years ago absolutely 
               <br />
               untouched. There is not a single point of 
               <br />
               material change in the whole district of 
               <br />
               Assiniboia. I would say to my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle that if we take his word 
               <br />
               for it, and he has given us his word, that 
               <br />
               the distribution made by the legislative as- 
               <br />
               sembly was as near perfection as it was 
               <br />
               possible to make it. we will have to come to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that the greater part of this
