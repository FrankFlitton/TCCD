               —February 20, a letter was received from His 
               <br />
               Excellency, Monselgneur Sbarrettl, asking for a 
               <br />

               His Excellency then presented the following

               it would greatly facilitate an early settlement

               of our mission, the ﬁxing of our boundaries, 
               <br />
               which would be extended to the shores of Hud-

               According to this statement, it appears 
               <br />
               that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Colin Campbell, 
               <br />
               who were the delegates of the Manitoba 
               <br />

               <br />
               There has been a rumour in the press—not 
               <br />
               in the press, but at all events, about the 
               <br />
               corridors of this House—that this confer— 
               <br />
               ence had been brought about by means of 
               <br />
               one of my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colleagues.</span> I have to say to 
               <br />
               the House, and I have the authority of my 
               <br />
               colleague for this, that there never was any 
               <br />
               conference brought about by him between 
               <br />
               the delegates and Monseigneur Sbarretti, 
               <br />
               and I have to make the further statement 
               <br />
               that neither myself nor any of my col- 
               <br />
               leagues were the intermediaries between 
               <br />
               Monseigneur Sbarretti and the delegates of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. If there has been such a con— 
               <br />
               ference how it came about I cannot say. 
               <br />
               Perhaps <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Montseigneur</span> Sbarretti may have 
               <br />
               had previous communication with these 
               <br />
               gentlemen; I do not know. Perhaps he 
               <br />
               knew them and perhaps that is the reason 
               <br />
               why he called upon them to have a con- 
               <br />
               ference. At all events, it is no concern of 
               <br />
               mine. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> nothing, and I never knew 
               <br />
               anything of it until this day, nor did the 
               <br />
               government. What conversation took place 
               <br />
               between the papal ablegate, Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               and Mr. Colin Campbell I do not know. 
               <br />
               This is a question, perhaps, as to which 
               <br />
               there may be something later on; I do not 
               <br />
               know. But, I take the statement as I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               it here, and upon this statement I have the 
               <br />
               right to make some comments which may 
               <br />
               throw some light, perhaps, on what has 
               <br />
               taken place. Mr. Rogers says <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the

               <br />
               and resolutions were passed, I know, in 
               <br />
               1905. In 1905, these resolutions were fol- 
               <br />
               lowed by executive action, they were called 
               <br />
               to our attention, but neither in 1901 nor 
               <br />
               in 1902, were these resolutions passed by 
               <br />
               the legislature of Manitoba, followed by 
               <br />
               executive action or called to the attention

               ing, when I read the interview with Mr.

               at fault, and if there had been any com- 
               <br />
               munication sent to us, which, in the multi-

               <br />
               upon to deal, I might have forgotten. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               quired of my colleagues if they had any 
               <br />

               <br />
               they had no such recollection. I then in— 
               <br />
               quired from the clerk of the Privy Council 
               <br />
