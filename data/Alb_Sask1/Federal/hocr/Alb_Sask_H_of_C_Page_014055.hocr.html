               <br />
               the cabinet; but I presume that he was a 
               <br />
               prospective minister. I have been waiting 
               <br />
               to hear from another gentleman who sits 
               <br />
               close to that hon. member. I. refer to the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Ontario (Mr. Grant). 
               <br />
               At a by—election in that constituency, I had 
               <br />
               the honour to go there to say a word on 
               <br />
               behalf of the hon. member for North Tor- 
               <br />
               onto (Mr. Foster) who was then a candidate 
               <br />
               in North Ontario. And one of the principal 
               <br />
               things brought against the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto in that campaign, was 
               <br />
               that he had supported the Remedial Bill, 
               <br />
               and if elected would advocate the granting 
               <br />
               of separate schools in the Northwest. That 
               <br />
               was the principal argument used in that 
               <br />
               by—election to further the election of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Ontario, and I now expect 
               <br />
               to hear from him that he will follow the hon.

               <br />
               have spoken, some of Whom have said that 
               <br />
               they are unalterably opposed to clause 16 
               <br />
               of the Bills creating two new provinces in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, I would say on 
               <br />
               my own behalf, speaking for myself only, 
               <br />
               that I am nnalterably in favour of that 
               <br />
               clause 16 in the two Bills shortly to come 
               <br />
               up for a second reading. So far as I have 
               <br />
               been able to gather, the only point urged 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is that made by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) who says 
               <br />
               that the Bills are hurried ones. Surely he 
               <br />
               does not mean that these are new Bills. I 
               <br />
               remember last session hearing this matter 
               <br />
               discussed, it not in the House at all events 
               <br />
               around the House, and likewise the session 
               <br />
               before that. They are, I submit, two of 
               <br />
               the best considered Bills that have ever 
               <br />
               been brought forward; and although they 
               <br />
               may not have been as fully discussed with 
               <br />
               some members of the government as they 
               <br />
               might have been, still I venture to say that 
               <br />
               during the past ﬁve or ten years no ques- 
               <br />
               tion has received greater consideration. It 
               <br />
               I read parliamentary practise aright, if I 
               <br />
               understand Todd's parliamentary procedure 
               <br />
               and May’s usages of parliament, I believe I 
               <br />
               am correct in saying that it is the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister who should introduce measures of 
               <br />
               the kind we are now discussing; and if any 
               <br />
               of the members of his cabinet are not in 
               <br />
               accord with him, they have one duty to 
               <br />
               perform and that is to resign. If the ex- 
               <br />
               Minster of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) tound 
               <br />
               he could not support the government in this 
               <br />
               matter, he has taken the proper course; but 
               <br />
               as I understand the question. so far as it 
               <br />
               has now gone, there is a distinct desire on 
               <br />
               the part of hon. members opposite, evinced 
               <br />
               both in their speeches and their newspapers, 
               <br />

               torials in the ‘ Globe,’ in which that news- 
               <br />

               <br />
               sorry that the ‘Globe’ cannot see as the 
               <br />
               government do on this question, but the 
               <br />
               ‘Globe ’ is only one newspaper, and we are 
               <br />
               legislating for the whole Dominion. If the 
               <br />
               ‘Globe’ cannot see eye to eye with us, that 
               <br />
               is no reason whatever why we should turn

               the measure submitted to us is right
