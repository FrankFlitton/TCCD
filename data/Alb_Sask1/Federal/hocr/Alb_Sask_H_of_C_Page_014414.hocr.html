               <br />
               equally well that the hon. member for Lon—

               <br />
               discharging the duties for the past year. 
               <br />
               Yet in the face of that fact, this government 
               <br />
               are so much in terror of the Ontario <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">electo‘</span> 
               <br />
               rate, that they dare not open the seat in 
               <br />
               London to-day. You may boast that you 
               <br />
               have a majority of ﬁve hundred or six hun- 
               <br />
               dred for the hon. member for London in that 
               <br />
               city, but that majority was reduced to 
               <br />
               something like twenty in the last campaign. 
               <br />
               The excuse given by his friends is that they 
               <br />
               were over—conﬁdent or he would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re»</span> 
               <br />
               ceived his old-time majority. Well, this 
               <br />
               is the time and place in which, if the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment have a scintilla of conﬁdence in the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario, .to show that conﬁdence 
               <br />
               by throwing down the gauntlet and opening 
               <br />
               up the constituency of London. But if they 
               <br />
               should, the hon. member for London (Mr. 
               <br />
               Hyman) knows, and the cabinet knows, 
               <br />
               what will be the result. Here we have a 
               <br />
               cabinet in this humiliating position that it 
               <br />
               has only two ministers of the Crown on the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor of this House from Ontario. True, there 
               <br />
               are two in the Senate, but I do not suppose 
               <br />
               the public are much exercised about them. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) has 
               <br />
               been over the stony path and the thorny 
               <br />
               places. He spent all his life in the constitu- 
               <br />
               ency of South Brant but that constituensy 
               <br />
               ﬁnally turned him out. Then he went over 
               <br />
               the corduroy road in North Grey but did not 
               <br />
               dare return there, and ﬁnally sought solace 
               <br />
               in a haven of rest with a solid Liberal ma- 
               <br />
               jority of 1.000. but that hon. minister knows 
               <br />
               that so low has his party fallen in the esti— 
               <br />
               mation of the people of Ontario that nearly 
               <br />
               every seat went against it in the last local 
               <br />
               election. And what is the position of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North York (Sir William 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mulock)?</span> That riding was long in the Liberal 
               <br />
               fold. but the hon. gentleman knows that if 
               <br />
               it were open to—day it would return an 
               <br />
               opponent to the present government. Then 
               <br />
               there is my hon. friend from Centre York 
               <br />
               (Mr. Campbell), who. we all know, is knock— 
               <br />
               ing at the threshold fO‘ admission to the 
               <br />
               cabinet, and who represents a riding speci— 
               <br />
               ally constructed for him. He has been 
               <br />
               standing at the door waiting and watching 
               <br />
               long. but they dare not open it for him. and 
               <br />
               it is a notorious fact that another gentleman 
               <br />
               who has been aspiring to cabinet promotion, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Simcoe (Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy) has openly gone out in revolt against 
               <br />
               the government on this question. Yet the 
               <br />
               government intend to rush this Bill through 
               <br />
               the House this session. If we were in the 
               <br />
               last days of a last session of parliament. 
               <br />
               the government would never be able to put

               This government may force the Bill through 
               <br />

               <br />
               if it were parliamentary, or what I would 
               <br />
               call a servile majority, if the rules of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parlia-</span> 
               <br />
               ment would allow it; it may be voted

               <br />
               of preferment and place; but all I can say 
               <br />
               is that the government will not get prefer- 
               <br />
               ment at the hands of the electorate when 
               <br />
               they go before the country. There is one 
               <br />
               power which is irresistible and that is the 
               <br />
               power of the people, and those gentlemen 
               <br />
               who vote for this measure will certainly 
               <br />
               stultify themselves in the eyes of their con- 
               <br />
               stituents in the Northwest Territories. They 
               <br />
               know that they are stultifying themselves 
               <br />
               to-day. Their own leaders have told them, 
               <br />
               as the lion. member for St. John (Mr Stock- 
               <br />
               ton) told them a little while ago, that this 
               <br />
               cabinet is afraid to trust the people who 
               <br />
               are most vitally interested. It knows that 
               <br />
               it cannot have a cabinet minister elected 
               <br />
               in the west. What is the standing of the 
               <br />
               government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> in the great city of 
               <br />
               Toronto? Why, a large number of their 
               <br />
               friends want to precipitate a ﬁght there, 
               <br />
               but they will only do it on one condition 
               <br />
               and that is that the policy of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment on this question must be condemned. 
               <br />
               What a pitiable spectacle does not this 
               <br />
               government represent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> In a riding like

               <br />
               of three hundred in the last contest, this 
               <br />
               government and their followers dare not 
               <br />
               put up a candidate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> They call how-

               sure and to trust that in time it will be for- 
               <br />
               gotten. They should remember that there 
               <br />
               was a statesman named Stratton in Ontario 
               <br />
               who asked the people to forget, but the people 
               <br />
               (lid not; and we have a spectacle presented 
               <br />
               to-day by this government exactly similar to 
               <br />
               that which was presented by the Ross gov— 
               <br />
               ernment in Ontario. and in like manner 
               <br />
               when this government does go to the people 
               <br />
               it will have as little chance as it expects to 
               <br />
               have in Centre Toronto and share the same 
               <br />
               fate which overtook the late local govern- 
               <br />
               ment. It may win Russell and Prescott but
