               Brown the Liberal party had made a stand for 
               <br />
               the principle of local government and provincial 
               <br />
               rights. The Liberal party were returned to 
               <br />
               power in 1896 on that stand. . To pass 
               <br />
               the Autonomy Bills now before parliament 
               <br />
               would be a complete reversal of the policy, 
               <br />
               both of the Liberal leader and party. If Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier be sincere in his suggestion 
               <br />
               that the provisions of the British North Ameri- 
               <br />
               ca Act cover the ground, ‘why not leave the 
               <br />
               question to the Act ‘2 . . If Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier had told his policy in advance he would 
               <br />
               have come out of the election twenty short.
