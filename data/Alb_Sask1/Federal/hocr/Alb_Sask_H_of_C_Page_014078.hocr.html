               Speaker, this is the outcome of allowing too 
               <br />
               much latitude in debate. If members were 
               <br />
               to conﬁne themselves to the actual question 
               <br />
               before the House, probably you, Sir, would 
               <br />
               have less diﬂiculty in controlling the House, 
               <br />
               and probably it would be more creditable 
               <br />
               to members on both sides. A good deal has 
               <br />
               been said about the legality of these peti— 
               <br />
               tions, and I take it that probably there are 
               <br />
               Conservatives throughout the Dominion who 
               <br />
               are in favour of the legislation as well as 
               <br />
               those who are opposed to it, and both sides 
               <br />
               have a right to petition this House so long 
               <br />
               as as they do so in proper form. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> (Mr. Sam. Hughes) 
               <br />
               may have made some statements of a con- 
               <br />
               troversial character but I do not think he 
               <br />
               went to the extent which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Cape Breton (Mr. A. Johnston) charges 
               <br />
               him with going. If the hon. member (Mr. 
               <br />
               A. Johnston) wants to evince a disposition 
               <br />
               to allay strife and ill feeling in this country 
               <br />
