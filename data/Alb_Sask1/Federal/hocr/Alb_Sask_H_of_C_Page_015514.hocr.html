               <br />
               we gave it. The school question is not

               under our control <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where</span> and we are not able

               Mr. FOSTER. The pertinence of that

               lies here that you are looking for some-

               thing to base your action upon and it seems 
               <br />
               that you have based it simply upon the 
               <br />
               number of school districts. A fairer basis 
               <br />
               would be to get the number of schools and 
               <br />
               the number of children <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attending</span> these 
               <br />
               schools in each district. Where will the 
               <br />
               number of school districts lead you unless 
               <br />
               you know whether there are 5, 10 or 50 
               <br />
               Children attending a certain school? You 
               <br />
               do get something which is of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">value.</span> if 
               <br />
               you ﬁnd the number of children attending

               the schools in the different districts, but it

               this is all the information that_ the hon.

               minister has on the point, of course, we

               cannot cavil at him as far as making up 
               <br />
               his mind on such data is concerned; only,

               the data might be broader—that is all.

               number of school districts and even
