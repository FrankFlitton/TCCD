               that while most of them responded to the

               crack of the party lash, I am glad to be

               able to note that I see opposite me a gen-

               tleman who did not so respond, and I con- 
               <br />
               gratulate the Minister of the Interior who 
               <br />
               did not on that occasion respond to the 
               <br />
               crack of the party lash. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> of 
               <br />
               the Interior is to-day in this cabinet, he 
               <br />
               was acclaimed with great gusto, and he 
               <br />
               sits in this cabinet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> as a geographi- 
               <br />
               cal and a national freak. He sits there 
               <br />
               by reason of the fact that there must needs 
               <br />
               be a cabinet representative from the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, west of Lake Superior. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) went 
               <br />
               through the lobbies day after day, read the 
               <br />
               public prints day after day, and read with 
               <br />
               the greatest relish that he was to be made 
               <br />
               a cabinet minister, and received the con- 
               <br />
               gratulations of his friends. We remember 
               <br />
               when that hon. gentleman spoke ’in the 
               <br />
               House, and after he had spoken, how warm— 
               <br />
               ly he was congratulated as the next Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior. But unfortunately he 
               <br />
               was not nationally well placed, there were 
               <br />
               not enough <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gali'cians,</span> Roumanlans, Rus-

               sians and hundreds of other what-nuts in 
               <br />
               his constituency, and so perforce my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Edmonton had to be chosen. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman himself disclaimed that 
               <br />
               the school question was a burning question 
               <br />
               in ‘his re-election as minister. I see in the 
               <br />
               public press that he has announced that to 
               <br />
               be the case, and everybody knows to-day 
               <br />
               that the great question in the riding of 
               <br />
               Edmonton was whether or not Calgary 
               <br />
               should be the seat of government, or whe- 
               <br />
               ther it should be his own town of Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton. That question, fortiﬁed by the fact 
               <br />
               that two-thirds of the population were for- 
               <br />
               eigners who cared little about public 
               <br />
               schools, and, I suppose, much less about 
               <br />
               separate schools. explains how it is that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman to-night has dropped 
               <br />
               into the office of a cabinet minister. But I 
               <br />
               hope and expect that those kicking pro- 
               <br />
               clivities he has evinced in the past—if he 
               <br />
               will allow me to say so—which have sig- 
               <br />
               nalized him on different occasions when 
               <br />
               he made strong protests against the action 
               <br />
               of this government, will, even before this 
               <br />
               vote is taken, once again assert themselves, 
               <br />
               and that he will come out even at the last 
               <br />
               moment as an opponent of this Bill.

               Now, Sir, what was the action of the

               <br />

               ways that the salary of a cabinet minister 
               <br />
               went w1th it. It was a patent fact that 
               <br />
               he was coming back speedily, but this gov- 
               <br />
               ernment could not delay the introduction of 
               <br />
               the Bill until he returned, and so forsooth 
               <br />
               it was forced in before that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               could even place his foot in the" House. 
               <br />
               But worse than that. A special committee 
               <br />
               of this cabmet was formed to engineer the 
               <br />
               progress of this Bill, and the composition 
               <br />
               of that committee is a marvel to alimen 
               <br />
               who will look at it. First and foremost 
               <br />
               was the Prime Minister, who had a place 
               <br />
               on it as was to be expected by virtue of 
               <br />
               his position. I do not presume any claim 
               <br />
               will be made for the premier as being in 
               <br />
               the past a constitutional lawyer, or even 
               <br />
               at the present time. But he was expected, 
               <br />
               by virtue of his position in his government, 
               <br />
               to be accorded a place on that very select 
               <br />
               and supreme committee. Next to him 
               <br />
               came, of necessity, and probably by reason 
               <br />
               of his legal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attainments</span> as well as of his 
               <br />
               olﬁce, the Minister of Justice, and I am 
               <br />
               sure nobody will complain on that score. 
               <br />
               But in the name of all that is good in 
               <br />
               this country of representative institutions,

               <br />
               to be amenable to the people, they had to

               politicians, as it has been described by hon.

               gentlemen opposite in years gone by, and 
               <br />

               eighty years of age. The fact goes with-

               were well known. Then my own province

               prepared to distinguish men in this House

               on two great lines, either as statesmen or 
               <br />
               as lawyers—I refer to the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral. That hon. gentleman did not arro- 
               <br />
               gate to himself that he was a lawyer, but 
               <br />
               he does arrogate to himself that he is a

               statesman.

               Now, Sir, I fancy I see the meeting of 
               <br />
               that committee. The hon. Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice told us in reply to my hon. friend from

               Halton (Mr. Henderson) the other night that 
               <br />
               he prepared the Bill, word for word and 
               <br />
               line for line, and that he was responsible 
               <br />
               for every portion of it. I accept that. I 
               <br />
               believe that statement is true, and I fancy I 
               <br />
               see these four gentlemen drawn up together, 
               <br />

               Postmaster General saying: So mote it be. 
               <br />
               The hon. Postmaster General is never known 
               <br />
               to object, and it would not be expected that 
               <br />
               he would object to this Bill. 'Why was not
