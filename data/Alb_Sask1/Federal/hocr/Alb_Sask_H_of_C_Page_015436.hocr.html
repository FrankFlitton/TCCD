               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. the wealthiest 
               <br />
               corporation in this country. It -is paying 
               <br />
               large dividends on its stock. It is making 
               <br />
               handsome proﬁts every year. It is the 
               <br />
               richest corporation we have in Canada. The 
               <br />
               company has great possessions in the shape 
               <br />
               of lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in]</span> the west on which it pays no 
               <br />
               taxes. The poor settler in the west is pay— 
               <br />
               ing his taxes while the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway pays no taxes. Grant that the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway has a right; if 
               <br />
               that right could be commuted and if these 
               <br />
               lands could be immediately made subject 
               <br />
               to taxation an effort should be made to 
               <br />
               abolish this exemption. In the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario we know what tax exemptions 
               <br />
               are. They are an enormous burden on 
               <br />
               the people who have to pay taxes. In 
               <br />
               the city of Toronto there are millions 
               <br />
               and millions of dollars worth of property 
               <br />
               of the most valuable kind which is increas- 
               <br />
               ing in value every day and which is yet un- 
               <br />
               taxed. It is relieved from taxation by rea- 
               <br />
               son 0f exemptions granted years and years 
               <br />
               ago. We have had some of these exempt- 
               <br />
               ions removed. We have given a great deal 
               <br />
               of attention to the question of exemption 
               <br />
               from taxation in the province of Ontario.
