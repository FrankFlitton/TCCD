               <br />
               part of the Canadian family. In the very 
               <br />
               ﬁrst year of confederation, the very ﬁrst 
               <br />
               session of the ﬁrst parliament, resolutions 
               <br />
               were introduced into this House and adopted 
               <br />
               unanimously for the acquisition of Rupert's

               <br />
               the extinguishment therein of the title of the

               plished in a very short time, and as soon as 
               <br />
               accomplished, the government of that day,

               <br />
               toba out of the wilderness. and without any 
               <br />
               preliminary stage endowed it at once with 
               <br />

               If we go back to the history of those days, 
               <br />
               perhaps the opinion will not be unwarranted 
               <br />
               that it would have been a wiser course, if 
               <br />

               been reached by gradual stages extended 
               <br />
               over a few years. If that course had been

               adopted, perhaps some mistakes would have

               Very different was the course and policy 
               <br />
               of Mr. Mackenzie when he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came</span> into ofﬁce 
               <br />
               with regard to the Northwest Territory. 
               <br />
               Up to the year 1875 the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories had been administered under no spe- 
               <br />
               cial form of government. But in 1875 
               <br />
               Mr. Mackenzie, being then Prime Minister 
               <br />
               of Canada, introduced into this House and 
               <br />
               carried unanimously a measure, a very 
               <br />
               important measure, the object of which, 
               <br />
               as he said himself, was to give to the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories an ‘entirely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inde~</span> 
               <br />
               pendent government.’ This measure has 
               <br />
               been the charter under which the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories have come to their present state 
               <br />
               of manhood. It has never been repealed. 
               <br />
               Additions have been made to it from time 
               <br />
               to time, but it has remained and is to this 
               <br />
               day the rock upon which has been reared the 
               <br />
               structure, which we are about to crown with 
               <br />
               complete and absolute autonomy. By this 
               <br />
               measure it was provided that a Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor should be appointed for the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. The Lieutenant Governor 
               <br />
               was to be vested with executive power, and 
               <br />
               he was to administer that power with the 
               <br />
               assistance of a council to be composed of 
               <br />
               ﬁve members, the Lieutenant Governor and 
               <br />
               his advisers to be appointed by the Governor 
               <br />
               in Council. Apart from these adminis- 
               <br />
               trative powers the Lieutenant Governor was 
               <br />
               also invested with large legislative authority. 
               <br />
               He could make laws for taxation, for local 
               <br />
               and municipal purposes, property and civil

               ment in that measure to the effect that when 
               <br />

               <br />

               should thenceforward be entitled to elect 
               <br />
               a member to the council. There was 
               <br />
               also an important enactment with regard to 
               <br />
               education, introducing into that country 
               <br />
               the system of separate schools in force in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario. But I shall say 
               <br />
               nothing at the present time of this important 
               <br />
               part of the law of 1875, as I propose to come 
               <br />
               again to it at a later stage of the obser- 
               <br />
               vations which I desire to offer to the House. 
               <br />
               This Act remained in force without any im- 
               <br />
               portant modiﬁcations up to the year 1886, 
               <br />
               when the Territories were given representa- 
               <br />
               tion in this parliament. Two years later 
               <br />
               an important step in advance was also taken 
               <br />
               in their development, that is to say, in 1888. 
               <br />
               The executive council was abolished, so far, 
               <br />
               at all events, as its powers of legislation 
               <br />
               were concerned, and a legislative assembly 
               <br />
               was created, to be composed of twenty-ﬁve 
               <br />
               members,’ twenty-two of which were to be 
               <br />
               elected by the people and three to be 
               <br />
               known as legal experts, to be appointed 
               <br />
               by the Governor in Council; and a new 
               <br />
               executive council was to be appointed under 
               <br />
               the name of advisory council to advise 
               <br />
               the Lieutenant Governor upon all matters 
               <br />
               of ﬁnance. In 1891 another step forward 
               <br />
               was taken, and a very important one. The 
               <br />
               legislative assembly of the Territories was 
               <br />
               given additional powers; and if you take 
               <br />
               section 92 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               and compare it with the powers which were 
               <br />
               then given to the legislature, you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that that legislature was invested with 
               <br />
               powers almost as complete as those which 
               <br />
               are vested in the provinces under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. In fact, 
               <br />
               with the exception of borrowing money 
               <br />
               most of the essential powers which are 
               <br />
               now given to the provinces were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> 
               <br />
               to the legislative assembly of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. In 1894 another depart- 
               <br />
               ure, another change, was made—I call it a 
               <br />
               departure. The change which was then 
               <br />
               made was not, in my estimation, quite in 
               <br />
               accordance with the spirit of our consti- 
               <br />
               tution. It was that the legislative assem- 
               <br />
               bly could select four members of its own 
               <br />
               body to be called an executive committee 
               <br />
               to advise the Lieutenant Governor. This is
