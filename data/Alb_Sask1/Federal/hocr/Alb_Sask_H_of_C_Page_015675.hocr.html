               I was not very positive about it last night,

               miles away from railways, and which it 
               <br />
               is difﬁcult to get into. I think the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman‘s argument is preposterous on 
               <br />
               the face of it. I do not think even the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. who is a great ad- 
               <br />
               vocate of that northern country, will say 
               <br />
               that it is going to increase more rapidly 
               <br />
               than the south.

               that the Minister of Justice has some in-

               formation which I asked for yesterday,

               interest in this matter, I was not here, but 
               <br />
               I understood that the question was as to the 
               <br />
               school districts in Athabaska. I believe 
               <br />
               there is some information in the Depart- 
               <br />
               ment of the Interior on that subject, but it 
               <br />
               is only with respect to those schools which 
               <br />
               received grants. That is already included 
               <br />
               in the return which has been referred to.
