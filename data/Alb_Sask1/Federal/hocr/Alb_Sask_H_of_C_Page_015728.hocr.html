               hon. gentleman correctly. This then is the

               <br />
               The result would be, if we consider the po-

               sition of the Roman Catholics in the North-

               would be the logical and the actual result of 
               <br />
               the contention of my hon. friend. Well, I 
               <br />
               am not a lawyer. but I contend that is not 
               <br />
               the opinion of the legislators of 1875, that is 
               <br />
               not the opinion of Mr. Blake, who was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con‘</span> 
               <br />
               s1dered at that time, and is still considered

               throughout the British empire to be a 
               <br />
               lawyer of some eminence. I still adhere to 
               <br />
               the opinion which was expressed at that 
               <br />
               time by Mr. Blake, Mr. Campbell and Mr. 
               <br />
               Mackenzie, that what they meant is what 
               <br />
               they said; that is, they wanted to give the 
               <br />
               minorities in the Territories, whether Pro- 
               <br />

               they were Catholics they could have Cath-

               olic schools. and if they were Protestants 
               <br />
               they could have Protestant schools, and the
