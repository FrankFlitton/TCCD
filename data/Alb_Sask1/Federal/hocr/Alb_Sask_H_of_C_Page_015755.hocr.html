               Mr. LENNOX. I may say that I was not 
               <br />
               anxious to speak at this time. I have only 
               <br />
               spoken once upon the Bill, and I would not 
               <br />

               <br />
               East Grey been given fair-play. I feel 
               <br />
               that not only has an injustice been done to 
               <br />
               him, but a very great injustice has been 
               <br />
               done to the Orange body. I have a large 
               <br />
               number of the members of that order in my 
               <br />
               riding. They are amongst the best citizens 
               <br />
               of South Siincoe—they are not better than 
               <br />
               the others, but I do say emphatically 
               <br />
               that there are none better. I do not 
               <br />
               think I should be doing right it' I did 
               <br />
               not call attention to the matter which 
               <br />
               has cropped up in this way. I have re- 
               <br />
               frained from speaking on many occasions 
               <br />
               in this debate, because, in common with the 
               <br />
               Orange body of this country, I desire that 
               <br />
               peace and harmony shall prevail amongst 
               <br />
               all classes of the people, that we may 
               <br />
               unitedly work out the destiny of the coun- 
               <br />
               try without distinction of creed, and without 
               <br />
               emphasizing those prejudices which make 
               <br />
               for division. If we are to work in peace and 
               <br />
               harmony, it will not be because hon. gen-
