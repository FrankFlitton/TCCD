               the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> himself will not deny

               that the greatet part of Calgary’s growth

               has come, that a fair proportion of that

               districts. There is no other way for trade

               to go from Athabaska and Peace River to

               Calgary. There is no doubt that the trade

               of Calgary in that direction has increased

               will admit 'that there is evidence that Cal-

               gary was beneﬁted very greatly by the

               <br />
               ago and climbed down some. He now claims

               for Calgary a proportionate part of its busi- 
               <br />

               been developed in the Calgary. Peace River

               <br />
               that. but ten minutes ago he was arguing

               that the increase of these two districts was 
               <br />
               the greatest factor in the progress of Cal- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Calgary that increased Calgary’s growth 
               <br />
               and development and richness, but it was 
               <br />
               the population and development of the Atha- 
               <br />
               baska district. He said that while at one

               time there were two trains per week run- 
               <br />

               day or more, and that proves it. Proves 
               <br />
               what ? Proves that there is a proportional 
               <br />
               amount of increase of trade between Cal— 
               <br />
               gary and Peace River and Athahaska. It 
               <br />
               proves nothing of the kind.‘ It proves that

               friend. not on any better information than 
               <br />
               that a friend of his who knows pretty well 
               <br />
               that country came down here and told him 
               <br />
               so. at 5,000. W'e will not cavil at that; we 
               <br />
               will say it is 5,000. Five years ago it was 
               <br />
               not that. There Has been an increase from 
               <br />
               that time on. A large proportion of this 
               <br />
               population 18 Indian, another proportion is 
               <br />
               half-breeds, and another proportion is 
               <br />
               whites. I do not know the exact relation— 
               <br />
               ship as to the numbers of whites and half— 
               <br />
               breeds. My hon. friend does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> us 
               <br />
               that. But I take this as a fact. Then my 
               <br />
               hon. friend will admit that the amount of 
               <br />
               stuff that has been consumed in the north- 
               <br />
               ern portion of that country by that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popula.</span>

               tion within the Iast‘ﬁve years has. man for 
               <br />
               man, taken out of Calgary very much less 
               <br />
               than the same number of people within ten

               <br />
               gary would consume. The white population 
               <br />
               is not there to make a prosperous city. They 
               <br />
               are not large consumers. No class of people 
               <br />
               in the world are less consumer: in a lavish 
               <br />
               or generous way of imported goods or of 
               <br />
