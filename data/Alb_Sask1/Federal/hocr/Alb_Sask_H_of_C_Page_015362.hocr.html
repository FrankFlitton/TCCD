               Mr. SPROULE. I just wish to say a few

               words in reply to the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />

               that. Perhaps it is. At any rate I choose

               to say something in reply to him as well

               siring to abuse the people of Edmonton, 
               <br />
               and to say that in my judgment there was 
               <br />
               not one word said in reference to the peo-
