               Sir, the question whether separate schools 
               <br />
               should, or should not, be established is one 
               <br />
               which might well have been debated in 1863 
               <br />
               when that system was adopted for the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario; it is one which might well have 
               <br />
               been debated upon principle in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18167</span> and 1870 
               <br />
               when these schools were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> perpetuated 
               <br />
               under the Confederation Acts. But it is not a

               I have no right to take my preference on that 
               <br />
               principle into consideration in the least on this

               occasion, but that I am now called upon to deal 
               <br />
               with the question of a clause of the constitu-

               History, Sir, is making itself these eventful
