               the Question now before the committee. 
               <br />
               Why should the1e be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> tenure, 
               <br />
               why should the Hudson Bay Company be 
               <br />
               in a different position in that province from 
               <br />
               any other man who has a title from the 
               <br />
               Crown, whether from the imperial author- 
               <br />
               ities or the Dominion government? You 
               <br />
               do not know the extent of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tenure.</span> 
               <br />
               Will that pass over to the province 
               <br />
               in the same position as the right of 
               <br />
               every other man to land in that province? 
               <br />
               I do not expect the province will interfere 
               <br />
               or do anything that is wrong, or will make 
               <br />
               a breach of the contract. But why limit 
               <br />
               the power? As I said before, «every other 
               <br />
               province has exclusive jurisdiction ovei 
               <br />
               property and civil lights, and why make 
               <br />
               any limitatidn here? They have a right to 
               <br />
               do wrong if they like, they have a right 
               <br />
               to take your property or mine without com- 
               <br />
               pensation, or at least they have the power. 
               <br />
               if not the right; and if they have the 
               <br />
               power, why should that pmver be limited 
               <br />
               in reference to these lands?

               should have effect in the added territory. 
               <br />
               What the court held was that a contract 
               <br />
               was made with the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               that Manitoba had accepted it, that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba had not repudiated the contract at all, 
               <br />
               and that until Manitoba repudiated the con- 
               <br />
               tract the power of taxation did not arise at 
               <br />
               all. That is all that was decided in the 
               <br />
               matter.
