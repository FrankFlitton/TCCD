               <br />
               take note of the fact that the section 1 have

               friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott)

               suggested that this matter was up for con- 
               <br />
               sideration incidentally in the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               in connection with a number of cases of 
               <br />
               municipalities. two in the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories and one in Manitoba. These cases 
               <br />
               were to test the validity of by-laws taxing

               <br />
               the argument was put forward that if 
               <br />
               Manitoba chose to commit a breach of this 
               <br />
               agreement by taxing these lands, there was 
               <br />
               no power to prevent this. Thus there was

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I refer to Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, I was distinguishing it from the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. I do not know that 
               <br />
               there would be any special distinction be- 
               <br />
               tween the case of Manitoba and this terri- 
               <br />
               tory added to Manitoba, and the case of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. In consider- 
               <br />
               ing this section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is necessary to dis- 
               <br />
               tinguish absolutely between the question 
               <br />
               of legislative power and the duty of 
               <br />
               observing a contract made between the 
               <br />
               Crown and a company—they are two ab- 
               <br />
               solutely distinct things. Let me illustrate 
               <br />
               that in this way. The Crown made a con- 
               <br />
               tract with the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               Company, which has been ratiﬁed by Act 
               <br />
               of this parliament. The making of that 
               <br />
               contract does not take away from this par— 
               <br />
               liament its legislative .power; parliament 
               <br />
               may to-morrow destroy the effect of that 
               <br />
               contract by means of a statute, but it would 
               <br />
               be absolutely wrong, improper and even 
               <br />
               immoral to do so. So far as the legisla- 
               <br />
               tures of the new provinces are concerned, 
               <br />
               the matter is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pretty</span> much in the same posi- 
               <br />
               tion. I do not know whether the section 
               <br />
               which has beeen inserted in this Bill is in- 
               <br />
               tended as a constitutional limitation which 
               <br />
               deprives the new province of a certain power 
               <br />
               which it would otherwise have, or whether 
               <br />
               it is intended, as my hon. friend from La-
