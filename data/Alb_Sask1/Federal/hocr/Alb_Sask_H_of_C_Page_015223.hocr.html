               <br />
               must be remembered that the homestead

               from year to year. and that even if $3 an

               50,000,000 acres, the cost of administration 
               <br />
               of those lands also ought to be deducted. It

               may be pointed out too,—I think it was

               pointed out once or twice, that there was

               a tacit understanding that the Dominion

               sions to the fact that it was the intention 
               <br />
               of the government to continue the immigra-

               <br />
               amounting to 50,000,000 acres, there were
