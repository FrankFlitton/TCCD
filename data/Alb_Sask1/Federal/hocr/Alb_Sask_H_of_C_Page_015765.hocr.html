               <br />
               probably from most of the members of this 
               <br />

               would stand higher to-day than it does it 
               <br />

               joyment of all the rights to which they 
               <br />
               are entitled. That, to my mind, would be 
               <br />
               a better proof of the position which my com- 
               <br />
               patriots occupy in the confederation. These 
               <br />
               things show that some individuals are men 
               <br />
               of talent. but where is the race? A few 
               <br />
               of them shine. but where is the French 
               <br />
               Canadian race in the province of Manitoba? 
               <br />

               <br />
               passed? It seems to me that I am giving 
               <br />
               some food for reﬂection to the Solicitor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gen</span>

               <br />
               speaks again on this question. Now, Sir, 
               <br />
               it seems to me that we are confronted by 
               <br />
               two propositions very clear and distinct; the 
               <br />
               position taken by my hon. friend the leader 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party, which is, as he 
               <br />
               says, to stand by the constitution. by clause 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act and 
               <br />
               the position of my right hon. friend the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, who also says he wants to stand 
               <br />
               by the constitution, though at the same time 
               <br />
               he proceeds to amend it. The leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition says: We must leave everything 
               <br />
               to the provinces, without saying whether 
               <br />
               they shall have separate schools or not; we 
               <br />
               will have nothing at all to do with the 
               <br />
               schools. whatever they are. Well, that may 
               <br />
               be good policy,'but I do not think it is, 
               <br />
               and have shown it by my vote. I am very 
               <br />
               sorry to differ from my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, but I am bound to 
               <br />
               do so.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I do not know that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend (Mr. Bergeron) states my 
               <br />
               position exactly as I would like it stated. 
               <br />
               My position is that we ought to apply sec— 
               <br />
               tion 93 of the British North America Act 
               <br />

               in reply to my hon. friend the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice, I said that I thought 
               <br />
               that section would leave the new provinces 
               <br />
               free to enact legislation with regard to 
               <br />
               education. I said there was a difference of 
               <br />
               opinion as to that, but whatever the result 
               <br />
               might be, I was prepared to accept it loyally, 
               <br />
               because we would be applying the con-

               in that way, and if I am to judge by the 
               <br />
               remarks which were made by my hon. 
               <br />
               friend I will still persist in understanding 
               <br />
               it in that way. It seems to me that his 
               <br />
               remarks went to show that he had nothing 
               <br />
               at all to say in regard to the kind of' schools 
               <br />
               that they should have. I heard him say 
               <br />
               that if it suited the local legislature of these 
               <br />
               provinces to enact a separate school law, he 
               <br />
               would have nothing at all to say again-st 
               <br />
               it. Of course, this would fall under the 
               <br />
               principle of autonomy. Well, that is the posi— 
               <br />
               tion of my hon. friend. Although I do not 
               <br />
               agree with it, I want to say that it is a man- 
               <br />
               ly position whether it is good or bad. We 
               <br />
               know where he is. But, that is the posi- 
               <br />
               tion of my right hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). The 
               <br />
               position of my right hon. friend is a mix- 
               <br />
               ture. He wants to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> on the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion as much as he can, but at the same 
               <br />
               time he wants to do something else. I 
               <br />
               think he was right when he propoged un- 
               <br />
               der the ﬁrst clause 16 to apply something 
               <br />
               else to this question than the provision in- 
               <br />
               volved in section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. I voted for that. That 
               <br />
               was a plain, clear proposition. But we shall 
               <br />
               see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">la-ter‘on</span> Why he made that proposition. 
               <br />
               This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«amendment</span> which is now before us 
               <br />
               means nothing at all. It is neither standing 
               <br />
               by the constitution as deﬁned by section 93 
               <br />
               nor does it recognize the rights of or do 
               <br />
               justice to the minority in these two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. It is opportunis-m. Will you have 
               <br />
               it whi.te?—there it is. Will you have it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">black?—I</span> am giving it to you under clause 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act. That 
               <br />
               is why the amendment which I intend to 
               <br />
               propose calls things by their names. Some 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen from the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec will later on say and write in their 
               <br />
               papers that they are in favour 0f granting 
               <br />
               separate schools to the minority in the 
               <br />
               Northwest. But, if they are they will 
               <br />
               have to vote for the amendment which I 
               <br />
               propose, and not for the proposition 
               <br />
               which has been placed before the com- 
               <br />
               mittee by the government. Why was 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend prompted to do 
               <br />
               something for the minority? I want to 
               <br />
               give him the credit of saying that he did 
               <br />
               intend to be just to the minority. That 
               <br />
               brings me to say why I look upon this 
               <br />
               question—I am always tempted to speak of 
               <br />
