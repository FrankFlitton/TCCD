               unfortunately true that those who pay for

               the maintenance of these schools do not

               Catholic university of St. Boniface today

               In answer to my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               of Customs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Paterson), who had de- 
               <br />
               clared that the proceedings of the Manitoba 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> in abolishing separate schools 
               <br />
               in that province might have been obnoxious 
               <br />
               to somebody, the hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />
               said: 'Wcll, Sir, I am here to say that 
               <br />
               we cannot abolish abuses of that kind by 
               <br />
               handling people with kid gloves.’ No, we 
               <br />
               all know that he did not use kid gloves. 
               <br />
               We all know that not only was the minority 
               <br />
               in Manitoba robbed of its system of schools. 
               <br />
               not only was the French language abolished, 
               <br />
               which is something appreciated by those 
               <br />
               who speak that language, but their build- 
               <br />
               ings to the amount of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$14000</span> were stolen 
               <br />
               from them by the Manitoba government and 
               <br />
               were never given back to them. So when 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman says that he did not 
               <br />
               use kid gloves, he is right. I would rather 
               <br />
               say he used a crowbar or a pince—monseig- 
               <br />
               neur to steal the separate schools of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, or what they had and their buildings.

               My hon. friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iLabelle</span> (Mr. Bour- 
               <br />
               assa) speaks very well—I have heard him 
               <br />
               before—but he always comes to a conclusion 
               <br />
               entirely different from his premises. Every 
               <br />
               time I have heard him on these subjects. I 
               <br />
               have always seen him starting against the 
               <br />
               government and ﬁnishing by being entirely 
               <br />
               with the government. He thought he would 
               <br />
               make a point in his speech by criticising 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. 
               <br />
               He even went so far as to say that he had 
               <br />
               lost conﬁdence in the leader of the opposi-
