               invitation which went on the 20th of the

               <br />
               and what was the result? The next day 
               <br />
               when the announcement was made they 
               <br />
               were told through the Prime Minister’s 
               <br />
               speech in the House that their boundaries 
               <br />
               could not be extended. No reason was as— 
               <br />
               signed except that other provinces might be 
               <br />
               interested. Practically no reason whatever 
               <br />
               was assigned for it, but they have that silli- 
               <br />
               ple information. Robert Rogers says they 
               <br />
               were to get information in a few days. 
               <br />
               Afterwards Mr. Rogers writes a letter ask- 
               <br />
               ing whether the information was not forth— 
               <br />
               coming. The Prime Minister says he never 
               <br />
               received the letter but we have had evidence 
               <br />
               in this House that that letter was sent 
               <br />
               direct to the Prime Minister’s oWn house. 
               <br />
               That was established by indisputable evi-

               <br />
               has been submitted to this House, but 
               <br />
               that I think, is reliable and should be ac- 
               <br />
               cepted. Part of it is the evidence of an 
               <br />
               hon. minister of the Crown, part of it is that 
               <br />
               of an hon. member of parliament and the 
               <br />
               other portion of it is furnished by a mes- 
               <br />
               senger whom we believe to be telling the 
               <br />
               truth and by the record of the book which 
               <br />
               shows that the message was taken. What 
               <br />
               was the subject discussed ‘2 The extension 
               <br />
               of the boundaries of Manitoba; the school 
               <br />
               question. The Papal delegate admits that 
               <br />
               the suggestion was made that it will facili- 
               <br />
               tate business if you will make these two 
               <br />
               amendments to the school law. That is what 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers says; that is what the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate admits. And then the ablegate 
               <br />
               admits that the proposed clauses of the 
               <br />
               Act read substantially as he gave them. 
               <br />
               Put the story all together and what is 
               <br />
               it '3 It exactly conﬁrms the statement made 
               <br />
               in the main by the Hon, Mr. Rogers. Now, 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate has a connection with 
               <br />
               the Autonomy Bill, he has a conference and 
               <br />
               his success in fastening separate schools 
               <br />
               upon two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> naturally create a de- 
               <br />
               sire to go a little further and see if he could 
               <br />
               not extend that system to Manitoba. That 
               <br />
               is the most reasonable thing in the world. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Why</span> would he not do it ? He ventured to 
               <br />
               do it. What does this mean if it does not 
               <br />
               mean that there is interference with the 
               <br />
               duties of the state by somebody? Who 
               <br />
