               the same reason that this government has 
               <br />
               to—day for not doing justice, the principal 
               <br />
               reason probably was that Sir John Thomp- 
               <br />
               son, who had been attacked by a certain 
               <br />
               wing of his party, wanted to have himself 
               <br />
               forgiven for being a Roman Catholic. That 
               <br />
               was the political reason. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ostensible</span> 
               <br />
               reason given by Sir John Thompson was 
               <br />
               that the time was too short because he had 
               <br />
               received the petitions only a few day- be— 
               <br />
               fore the year elapsed, and he gave further 
               <br />
               this reason, that the complaint of the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics was rather based 
               <br />
               upon dangers which might arise from 
               <br />
               the ordinances of 1892 and that they 
               <br />
               had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘not</span> yet received any ill-treat— 
               <br />
               ment under these ordinances, that he 
               <br />
               did not see any special article under these 
               <br />
               ordinances which clashed, in his opinion, 
               <br />
               legally with the dispositions of the law of 
               <br />
               1875. As the Prime Minister has rightly 
               <br />
               stated this afternoon, the law of 1875 did 
               <br />
               not pretend to be a public instruction law, 
               <br />
               it was simply an organic law to be con- 
               <br />
               sidered the basis of future legislation.

               it had been a law from another province, 
               <br />

               <br />
               was not disallowed within the 12 months 
               <br />
               following its sanction by the Lieutenant

               <br />

               <br />
               parliament has always the right at any 
               <br />
               time on any occasion to remedy the in- 
               <br />
               justice that was committed in 1892. Is

               this not the very occasion when we are 
               <br />
               going to abandon all that right of sover-

               eignty which we now possess, when we are 
               <br />
               going to hand over for ever to the provinces

               the right to deal with these matters, re-

               empty right of remedial legislation under 
               <br />
               clause 93? If there is a time when we

               should not create injustice it is when we

               justice for which my hon. friend the Min-

               Liberal members of this House in 1894. I 
               <br />
               think this is the occasion and it is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">only</span>
