               as that which I pointed out to the First

               Minister the other day where a ﬂourishing

               <br />
               was placed on the dividing line of two 
               <br />
               constituencies. But we did not suggest that 
               <br />
               this should he done by a commission with 
               <br />
               any idea of getting any unfair advantage, 
               <br />
               because, of the three justices of the Sn-

               preme Court in the province of Alberta who 
               <br />

               Now, let us follow up the argument of the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior as to the pio- 
               <br />
               neers who should be entitled to representa- 
               <br />
               tion. I have tried to get from him, for the 
               <br />
               purpose of making a comparison, the num- 
               <br />
               ber of half-breeds in the Peace River and 
               <br />
               Athabaska local constituencies; because in 
               <br />
               the whole district of Athabaska, only half 
               <br />
               of which is being taken into the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta, there was, according to the census 
               <br />
               of 1901, a total population of 6,615 of whom 
               <br />
               3,716 were Indians. The ﬁgures given us 
               <br />
               to-day of the number of Indians in Atha— 
               <br />
               baska and Peace River show: In Atha- 
               <br />
               baska 735, and in Peace River 956, a total 
               <br />
               of 1,690. If we take 1,690 from the total 
               <br />
               Indian population, it will be found that there 
               <br />
               are 2,026 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{Indians</span> in the eastern section of 
               <br />
               Athabaska, which is getting no separate 
               <br />
               representation at all. The object of 
               <br />
               my question was to ﬁnd out the number 
               <br />
               of half-breeds in the proposed two new 
               <br />
               constituencies, to enable me to show 
               <br />
               that there were still a number left in 
               <br />
               the eastern section, which is in the 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan and is not get- 
               <br />
               ting any separate representation. I think 
               <br />
               that disposes of the hon. gentleman’s pion- 
               <br />
               eer argument; because if the section of Ath- 
               <br />
               abaska which is in the province of Alberta 
               <br />
               is entitled to special representation by rea— 
               <br />
               son of there being some pioneers in it, then 
               <br />
               the section which is in the province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan would be entitled to special re- 
               <br />
               presentation upon the same ground. With 
               <br />
               regard to the suggestion that Athabaska is 
               <br />
               contributing largely to the increase of 
               <br />
               wealth and development in the southern

               to hear an hon. member on this side of the

               House base an argument on that ground. 
               <br />
               The Prime Minister, in introducing this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, stated that he had taken into consider-

               ation existing conditions, population and 
               <br />
               geographical conditions. In regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex.</span> 
               <br />
               isting conditions, he applies the principle 
               <br />
               only in part. Where it can be applied with- 
               <br />
               out detriment to the object the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior has in View, he applies it, and

               where it can be applied detrimentally to 
               <br />
               that object he fails to apply it. It has not
