               <br />
               obtained at the time the census was taken 
               <br />
               in 1901. I will give the population of some

               <br />
               any extent. We will take. for instance, the 
               <br />
               rural riding of Nanaimo North. We ﬁnd 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               rural district of Nanaimo South; we ﬁnd 
               <br />

               <br />
               as large. Again, we will take the district 
               <br />
               of Lillooet East; we ﬁnd the population of 
               <br />
               only 789. In Lillooet West immediately 
               <br />
               adjoining it we ﬁnd a population of 3,196, 
               <br />
               and mark you, in each of these ridings that

               trict of Kootenay East, north riding there 
               <br />

               Kootenay West, Revelstoke riding. with a
