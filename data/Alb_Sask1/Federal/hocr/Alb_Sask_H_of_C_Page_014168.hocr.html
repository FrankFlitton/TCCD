               created the feeling of distrust which exists 
               <br />
               to-day. The right hon. gentleman declared 
               <br />
               that the press which supports the opposition

               <br />
               there were any such attempt, was it confined

               any efforts to inﬂame the public mind, is 
               <br />
               that to be traced to the Conservative press 
               <br />
               alone <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> No, Sir. the criticisms of the press 
               <br />
               throughout the country were not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confined</span>

               to the newspapers supporting any political 
               <br />

               ligious papers, independent papers. and 
               <br />
               political papers on both sides. And they all 
               <br />
               were agreed in the main that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is doing an improper thing, something 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calculated</span> to create a strong feeling of aver-

               sion throughout the country against the 
               <br />
               measure and the government itself. Is not 
               <br />
               that a fact, Mr. Speaker? Need I point to 
               <br />
               the very logical, moderate and fair <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">criticisms</span> 
               <br />
               of the ‘Globe ’—hhe organ above all others

               which ought to voice the sentiments of the

               present government—and criticisms which.

               I humbly submit, would do credit to any 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the country doing to-day ? The organs of

               public sentiment, sailing on the government
