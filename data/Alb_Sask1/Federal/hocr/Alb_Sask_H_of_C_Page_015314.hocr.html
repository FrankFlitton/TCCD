               Mr. MONK. Has the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               considered Whether this legislation does not 
               <br />
               clash to a certain extent With section 51 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Off</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">course</span> it seems equitable enough that the 
               <br />
               representation should be increased in a (115-

               trict where the population will increase so 
               <br />
               rapidly, but the terms of section 51 which 
               <br />
               affect the method of redistribution amongst 
               <br />
               the different provinces can only take effect 
               <br />
               every ten years. Under this legislation after 
               <br />
               live years there would be a complete re- 
               <br />
               distribution for these two new provinces

               of opinion that there is no clashing or con-

               <br />
               Act my hon. friend will notice, was adopted 
               <br />
               in section 5. And then if my hon. friend

               will look at the Manitoba Act he will ﬁnd

               the same principle applied there as far back

               the lines laid down in the Manitoba Act.

               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. I was somewhat 
               <br />
               impressed by the observation of the hon.

               I do not know whether I caught exactly 
               <br />
               the idea that he put forward, but it seemed 
               <br />
               to me to be this. It is quite competent 
               <br />
               under the Act of 1871 to provide at any 
               <br />
               time for increased representation or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">read-</span>

               justment of representation of the Territor- 
               <br />
               ies. When you have once constituted these 
               <br />
               Territories into provinces does not section 
               <br />
               51 of the British North America 'Act come

               extension of representation except upon a 
               <br />
               decennial census. Do you not limit your 
               <br />
               power as to that when you once establish 
               <br />
