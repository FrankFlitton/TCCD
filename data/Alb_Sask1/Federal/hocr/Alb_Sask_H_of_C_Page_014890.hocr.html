               I was referring, Mr. Speaker, to the his- 
               <br />
               tory of this question in relation to Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. In 1870, there existed in Manitoba a 
               <br />
               system of purely voluntary schools. They 
               <br />
               were entirely denominational, some main— 
               <br />
               tained by the Roman Catholics and some 
               <br />
               by the Protestants, but all supported by fees 
               <br />
               paid by the parents of the children who at- 
               <br />
               tended them and by the several churches to 
               <br />
               which these schools appertained. One short 
               <br />
               year after the creation of the province in 
               <br />
               1871, a law was passed by Manitoba estab- 
               <br />
               lishing a system of denominational schools. 
               <br />
               A Board of Education composed of two sec- 
               <br />
               tions was constituted, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">onehalf</span> Protestants 
               <br />
               and one-half Roman Catholics and the pro— 
               <br />
               vince was divided into twelve Protestant 
               <br />
               districts and twelve ‘ Catholic districts. 
               <br />
               Nothing could be fairer than this equal 
               <br />
               division as between the two denominations. 
               <br />
               This system was maintained until 1890 when 
               <br />
               the policy of the preceding nineteen years 
               <br />
               was reversed and the denominational system 
               <br />
               of schools swept away. The Public Schools 
               <br />
               Act of 1890 provided that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> schools be free 
               <br />
               schools, all were declared non-sectarian and 
               <br />
               no school not conforming to this Act and to 
               <br />
               the regulations of the Department of Educa- 
               <br />
               tion could participate in state funds. Such 
               <br />
               was the legislation down to 1890. In 1891, 
               <br />
               the minority, chaﬁng under this condition 
               <br />
               had recourse to the courts and to litigation 
               <br />
               and we have then the irritation, the agita- 
               <br />
               tion. the painful disquiet which has lasted 
               <br />
               in this country during six long years down 
               <br />
               to 1896. I am reminded that I am already 
               <br />

               to the fact that we have not yet before us 
               <br />
               the schedules to the two Bills, No. 69 and 
               <br />
               No. 70. These schedules are, of course, a 
               <br />
               very important part of the Bills which were 
               <br />
               presented on the 21st of February. and it 
               <br />
               seems to me we should have had the sche- 
               <br />
               dules long ago. Indeed, in the regular 
               <br />
               course, we should have had them when the 
               <br />
               Bills were introduced. I mentioned this 
               <br />
               matter to the Prime Minister last week, 
               <br />
               and he said he would give me the informa- 
               <br />
               tion later.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. The schedules 
               <br />
               have not been completed yet, for the reason 
               <br />
               that we had no absolute basis to go upon. 
               <br />
               We thought if we had the voters’ lists upon 
               <br />
               which the election took place in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories it would afford us the most 
               <br />
               reliable information we could get as to the 
               <br />
               actual population. These lists were placed 
               <br />
               on the table of the House only yesterday, 
               <br />
               and the schedules will be prepared.

               consideration from the government as well
