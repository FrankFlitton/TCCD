               <br />
               truth in the rumours that were alluded to 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Pictou (Mr <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mac</span> 
               <br />
               donald) that negotiations have been going 
               <br />
               on between the members of the Tory gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of Manitoba and the clerical digni- 
               <br />
               taries of the church in that country. Is that 
               <br />
               true or is it not? Are we to take their test 
               <br />
               again and say that because these gentle— 
               <br />
               men don’t deny it, therefore it is true? Are 
               <br />
               we to deal with them as they attempted to 
               <br />
               deal with the First Minister and the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice with regard to any rumours they

               hear-‘Z—and dear knows there are enough of 
               <br />
               them going about through the Tory papers 
               <br />
               nowadays—that because they don’t deny 
               <br />
               the rumours therefore they are true. Where 
               <br />
               is the denial that the Manitoba government 
               <br />
               have been negotiating with the dignitaries 
               <br />
               of the church? Is it true or is it not? Sir, 
               <br />
               I judge from what we see in the news- 
               <br />
               papers that they will come out and tell us 
               <br />
               what has taken place in these negotiations 
               <br />
               with regard to the improvement of the con— 
               <br />
               dition of the children of the minority in the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba, or at least what the 
               <br />
               minority consider would be an improve- 
               <br />
               ment. I cannot say more than what I see 
               <br />
               in the papers. Perhaps these hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men may be able to get an answer from 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers, or from Mr. Roblin, or from 
               <br />
               Mr. Campbell to know what has been done 
               <br />
               in that direction. But I want to say em- 
               <br />
               phatically that if it is the object of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon,</span> 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite—and I do not see what 
               <br />
               other object they could have—to fan the 
               <br />
               ﬂame of religious antagonism in this coun~ 
               <br />

               <br />
               creditable to any man who engages in it. 
               <br />
               I think the people will ask them whether 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada is the proper 
               <br />

               <br />
               portions of this community to endeavour to 
               <br />
               excite one portion against another on mat- 
               <br />
               ters that come very close to their hearts. 
               <br />
               Great love is professed by some of them for 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate. Oh, how they admire 
               <br />
               him, how they respect him, and so on; then 
               <br />
               in another breath they call him a man who 
               <br />
               is conspiring against the liberties of the 
               <br />

               Mr. PATERSON. I am glad to be cor-

               rected, because it would be too bad to make 
               <br />
               a mistake with reference to his name, lest 
               <br />
               the wrong person shbuld be summoned. But 
               <br />
               the organ of my hon. friend, known to be 
               <br />
               his organ because it is edited by one of his 
               <br />
               chief lieutenants, wants this reverend gen- 
               <br />
               tleman to be brought to the bar of the 
               <br />
               House. That is what they want to do with 
               <br />
               him. Now, then, I want to ask the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition, does he propose—it we 
               <br />
               are to hold him responsible, according to 
               <br />
               his own reasoning, for what appears in the 
               <br />
               Toronto ‘World’—does he propose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t)</span> bring

               fore the bar of the House? Is that the 
               <br />
               policy of the leader of the opposition and 
               <br />
               his party with reference to this matter '3
