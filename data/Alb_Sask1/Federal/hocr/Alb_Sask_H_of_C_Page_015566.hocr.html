               tale which bears on this question is a com- 
               <br />
               parison of the number of post oﬂices in two 
               <br />

               <br />
               ern part and the southern part of Alberta. 
               <br />
               The number of school sections in one part

               as compared with the number in another 
               <br />
               part is also a fair test. Of course, it would 
               <br />
               not be fair to compare one post ofﬁce with 
               <br />
               another ; but it is a fair comparison to take 
               <br />
               two sections with the same areas and in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               logical conclusion from such a comparison 
               <br />
               is that where there are more post ofﬁces 
               <br />
               there are more people. My hon. friend

               <br />
               comparing two western populations which

               What does the hon. gentleman propose? 
               <br />
               He says that the admission of Athabaska and 
               <br />
               Peace River district is a question of policy. 
               <br />
               That question would not be decided in the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament at all. That is a fair
