               for certain newspapers in this country to

               ba case the same principle was applied and

               from, notwithstanding the repeated and ur-

               gent requests of Manitoba. I shall not weary

               the House with a repetition of the answers-

               <br />

               and inure wholly to its beneﬁt and use. 
               <br />
               The government of Manitoba claimed. that: 
               <br />
               they were entitled from the date of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               which had eventually and after a process of 
               <br />
               selection been transferred. The Privy Coun- 
               <br />
