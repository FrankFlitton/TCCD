               It is certainly an oversight that Cartier does 
               <br />
               not already adorn the map of Canada in a

               <br />
               Quebec should have been named Cartier, but as 
               <br />
               it was not, do not let us now miss the oppor—

               Upon further thought, I ﬁnd that it would 
               <br />
               not strain the name to use the form ‘ Cartyan ’ 
               <br />
               or ‘Cartian.’ It therefore appears to me that 
               <br />
               ‘ Cartier’ is a very suitable name, for it is the 
               <br />
               name of the discoverer of Canada, and gives us 
               <br />
               a good name for a person living in a province 
               <br />
               named ‘ Cartier,’ namely. ‘Cartian.’

               I hope you see the matter as I see it. and 
               <br />
               that you will introduce the idea to the House. 
               <br />
               The government have given you a precedent: 
               <br />
               they have dropped ‘Assiniboia’ and 'Artha- 
               <br />
               baska.’ Why therefore not drop ‘Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan ’ ? Why should this unwieldy name be re- 
               <br />
               tained? It means nothing to the people of 
               <br />
               Canada, and less to any other people. ‘ Cartier ’ 
               <br />
               means everything to Canadians, and has a sig-
