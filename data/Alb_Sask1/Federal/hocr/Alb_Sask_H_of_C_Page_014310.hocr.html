               <br />
               1896 I stated my belief, as I state it now;

               I knew it was not politically to my ad-

               terior things, I said to myself: There is

               this empire, there is the minority coming 
               <br />
               with a grievance and having the right to 
               <br />
               appeal to the Dominion government and 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament, the only power 
               <br />
               that has jurisdiction to right their wrongs; 
               <br />
               I said to myself : I believe it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rightkl</span>

               believe in the policy of attempting to carry 
               <br />
               out the constitution. Let me ask this ques-

               tion: If my right hon. friend, in 1896, had 
               <br />
               thrown his forces with the forces that made 
               <br />
               for remedial legislation, who can doubt that 
               <br />
               we would have carried it in this parliament. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> one can doubt it. And why was it not 
               <br />
               carried? The ex-M-inister of the Interior 
               <br />
               told why when he said here the other day : 
               <br />
               The member for North Toronto wished to 
               <br />
               restore the schools, but he failed, and he 
               <br />
               failed because the right hon. the leader of 
               <br />
               this government threw himself across the 
               <br />
               way and prevented it.

               manded by the argument of the member for

               Labelle ? Must we again and again come to 
               <br />
               the conclusion, that with the member for 
               <br />
               Labelle it is the same as with the member 
               <br />
               for Brandon—they are both strong in the 
               <br />
