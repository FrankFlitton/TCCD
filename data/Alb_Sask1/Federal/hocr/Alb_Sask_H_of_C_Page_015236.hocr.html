               Mr. HERRON. I might say with reference

               to the comparison which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               drew between the lands of British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia and those of Alberta, that if we have 
               <br />
               no precious minerals in Alberta, still we 
               <br />
               have these immense coal deposits which 
               <br />
               are probably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inst</span> as valuable as the pre- 
               <br />
               cious metals. Some of the coal mines of 
               <br />
               Alberta have sold for as large a sum as 
               <br />
               some of these silver and copper mines of 
               <br />
               British Columbia. One of them sold for 
               <br />
               no less a sum than $3,000,000. Within 
               <br />
               twenty-ﬁve miles of the locality Where I 
               <br />
               live, I suppose we have ﬁfty coal mines just 
               <br />
               as good as the one I referred to. which sold 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,000,000.</span> Coal mines are being developed 
               <br />
               all over that country. Not more than a 
               <br />
               month ago, an eminent engineer reported 
               <br />
               on a mine newly developed within the last. 
               <br />
               year, and in his report he said that there 
               <br />
               were ten million tons of coal above tunnel 
               <br />
               levels. That is only one mine out of ﬁfty 
               <br />
               within twenty-ﬁve miles of where I live, 
               <br />
               It seems to me that a province with natural 
               <br />
               resources of that kind would have no dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty in raising a fair amount of revenue. 
               <br />
               You might also take into consideration 
               <br />
               our ﬁsheries, which may be of considerable 
               <br />
               importance. I think that if they were 
               <br />
               under the control of the Northwest gov- 
               <br />
               ernment we should. not see them leased at 
               <br />
               $10 a year for 21 years. If they were 
               <br />
               handled in .the proper way, they would be 
               <br />
               another considerable source of revenue. I 
               <br />
               consider the minerals of our country also 
               <br />
               very important. And I think we could make 
               <br />
               a law which would do more to promote the 
               <br />
               development of our mineral resources than 
               <br />
               can be done from here. The mining laws 
               <br />
               of the Dominion, I consider, very unsatis- 
               <br />
               factory to the people engaged in' mining. 
               <br />
               And something should be done to remedy 
               <br />
               this diiﬁculty.

               Mr. W. F. MACL-EAN. The Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior (Mr. Oliver) laid down the 
               <br />
               doctrine a little while ago, that not only 
               <br />
               should the Dominion have these lands, but it 
               <br />
               should also have the immense revenue from 
               <br />
               customs to be yielded by that country. That 
               <br />
               is, the Dominion is to have everything, and 
               <br />
               the old provincial righters have completely 
               <br />
               changed their doctrines. The minister spoke 
               <br />
               of this land being the land of the people. 
               <br />
               Formerly it used to be ‘the land for the 
               <br />
               province ’ but the minister covers the change 
               <br />
               by a general assertion of ‘ the land for the 
               <br />
               people. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> fact is he is abandoning 
               <br />
               the old platform on which he and his friends 
               <br />
               used to stand before this House and before 
               <br />
               the country. But I believe there is no 
               <br />
               change in the View that the people of the 
               <br />
               country take on this subject. As has just 
               <br />
               been stated by the hon. member for Alberta 
               <br />

               <br />
               these now are given over to the Dominion. 
               <br />
               Why not adopt this solution of the diﬂicnlty, 
               <br />
               take stock of what there is there and give 
               <br />
               half to the peODIe of the west and keep half 
               <br />
               for the Dominion ? I hold that those pro- 
               <br />
               vinces when established, should be started 
               <br />
               off with a large public domain of their own. 
               <br />
               They can give lands to the settler as well 
               <br />
               as the Dominion can. They can encourage 
               <br />
               mining by giving mineral grants. And per- 
               <br />
               haps they can do more than the Dominion 
               <br />
               can to develop the mineral lands by a policy 
               <br />
               similar to that of Nova Scotia. The province 
               <br />
               of Nova Scotia, for its size, is probably the 
               <br />
               richest province of the Dominion, by reason 
               <br />
               of its immense mineral deposits, especially 
               <br />
               in the way of coal. If there are these great 
               <br />
               coal deposits in the west that they say there 
               <br />
               are, and if coal is essential to thewest, as 
               <br />
               I believe it to be, it would be a good thing 
               <br />
               if the new provinces had this public domain. 
               <br />
               And, if they cannot have it all, they should 
               <br />
               share it. It may be the view of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite that the provinces should 
               <br />
               not have part of this domain. That may be 
               <br />
               the view of the Dominion government, but I 
               <br />
               do not think it is in accord with the speeches 
               <br />
               made in the west or with the resolutions in 
               <br />
               the territorial assembly, nor do I believe it
