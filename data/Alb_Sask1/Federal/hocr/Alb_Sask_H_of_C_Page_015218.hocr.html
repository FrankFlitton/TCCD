               we are giving away. The province of On—

               they do not know what the residuum is. 
               <br />
               they speak of it as wilderness and all that. 
               <br />
               but they should have an exact account kept

               to say at this stage of the discussion that

               we on this side of the House are very much

               opposed to the Dominion government ob- 
               <br />
               taining the lands in the new provinces. I 
               <br />
               wish to point out that the returns do not 
               <br />
               appear to have been brought down in such 
               <br />
               shape that one can possibly arrive at a con- 
               <br />
               clusion as to the basis on which the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have proceeded. In the returns that 
               <br />
               were brought down the respective areas 
               <br />
               were given of the districts of Saskatchewan, 
               <br />
               Assiniboia and Alberta. but nothing was 
               <br />
               said of Athabasca, which is to be taken into 
               <br />
               the new province. It is almost impossible 
               <br />
               to ﬁgure from these returns just what the 
               <br />

               North Toronto (Mr. Foster), a number of

               reports have been made as to that country

               <br />
               the attempt to withhold these lands from the 
               <br />
               new provinces ; and then, if they are to be

               Railway track, which was alienated for 
               <br />
               railway purposes by the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment, and, according to my ﬁgures, I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that there is annually paid to the province 
               <br />
               of British Columbia the sum of $100,000 for 
               <br />
               lands that were handed over to the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway. Estimating the area 
               <br />
               of that 20-mile strip on either side of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway track, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               this $100,000 is paid to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> of Brit- 
               <br />
               ish Columbia for practically only 13,000,000 
               <br />
               acres, whereas, in the new provinces, we are 
               <br />
               not getting one-quarter the compensation, 
               <br />
               and even when our population is doubled 
               <br />
               we do not get one-half. What I desire to point 
               <br />
               out is that the land in the province of Brit- 
               <br />
               ish Columbia is land taken along the rail— 
               <br />
               way track, a great part of it in country 
               <br />
               which is practically worthless, and yet a 
               <br />
               much more liberal allowance is made to the 
               <br />
               province of British Columbia for thatland 
               <br />
               which was taken away from it than is being 
               <br />
               made by the present administration for 
               <br />
               land that is just as much taken away from 
               <br />
               the provinces of Alberta and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan.</span> 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that these ﬁgures for the area of this 
               <br />
               land in British Columbia work out as fol- 
               <br />
               lows. taking the line as straight between 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,-</span> the diﬁt'erent points: Stephen to Beaver foot. 
               <br />
