               Why was there not an appeal or, Why were

               not those amendments vetoed by the govern-

               <br />
               Thompson has been brought into the discus- 
               <br />
               sion. Sir John Thompson’s opinions were 
               <br />
               well known on such subjects. I would not like

               to trouble the House With a great deal of 
               <br />
               reading, but I wish to point out ﬁrst of all 
               <br />
               that when the effect of the ordinance of 
               <br />
               1592 was felt it was found that it was an 
               <br />
               enactment of something which had been 
               <br />
               decided in 1891, and that the time within 
               <br />
               which it could have been disallowed was 
               <br />
               past. ~
