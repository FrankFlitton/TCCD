               my hon. friend may be right, but it so, it

               only adds one more to the extraordinary

               interpretations which we have been forced 
               <br />
               to place upon this Act of 1875. So far as 
               <br />
               the word ‘separate’ is concerned, I adhere, 
               <br />
               with all due deference, to the view that it 
               <br />
               means exactly what it says, a separate 
               <br />
               school, it implies nothing more. And when

               of yesterday’s debates that in replying to a 
               <br />
               question that was put to me by the hon. the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leader</span> of the opposition ('Mr. R. L. Borden), 
               <br />
               I gave a reply which certainly entitled the

               hon. gentleman to say later on in the de-

               something that led to an absurd conclusion. 
               <br />
               I see by reading the report that in fact I 
               <br />
               had not properly understood the question 
               <br />

               I had evidently misunderstood the ques- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> of the hon. gentleman. I was dealing 
               <br />
               at that time with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinction</span> that was 
               <br />
               established with regard to denominational 
               <br />
               schools, and meant to say that there was 
               <br />
               no other denominational school referred to 
               <br />

               testant schools and Catholic schools, and I 
               <br />
               understood the hon. gentleman’s question to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mean</span> that in case a majority would be com- 
               <br />
               posed partly of Protestant-s and partly of 
               <br />
               Mormons, they could establish any other 
               <br />
               denominational schools. Naturally the con- 
               <br />
               text to my remarks later on proved that I 
               <br />
               acknowledged the right of any majority to 
               <br />
               have a public school, but, as far as de- 
               <br />
               nominational schools are concerned, it would 
               <br />
               be either a Protestant or a Catholic school. 
               <br />
               Of course, I could have corrected this in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report</span> of the debate so as to make my 
               <br />
               thought clear, but I considered it would be 
               <br />
               a]: injustice to the hon. gentleman (Mr. R. 
               <br />
               L. Borden) on account of the further re- 
               <br />
