               another gentleman selected for that position

               lists for that division were printed in the

               without the permission of one of the min- 
               <br />
               isters. These lists were printed, they were

               not given to the Conservatives in that di-

               brought them to Ottawa and who ordered

               and it ill becomes the hon. Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior to throw the insinuation across the 
               <br />
               ﬂoor of the House that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Elgin is not an educated gen- 
               <br />
               tleman. I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not,know</span> what the qualiﬁ- 
               <br />
               cations of the hon. Minister of the Inte- 
               <br />
               rior are, but I do not believe, if we followed 
               <br />
               the matter up, we would ﬁnd that he occu- 
               <br />
               pies a very much higher scholarly p081ﬂ011 
               <br />
               than my hon. friend from East Elgin does. 
               <br />
               The hon. Minister of the Interior has given 
               <br />
               us a statement of the vote that was polled 
               <br />
               in the division that he represents in this 
               <br />
               House. I do not want to dispute that
