               Mr. SAM. HUGHES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
               <br />
               on a personal matter. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean) was this 
               <br />
               afternoon called to order on a certain point. 
               <br />
               After some hesitation. he obeyed the ruling 
               <br />
               of the chair and proceeded with the discus- 
               <br />
               sion, when the hon. gentlemen behind the 
               <br />
               First Minister, who are a little too prone to 
               <br />
               make unseemly interruptions, not only to 
               <br />
               the hon. member for South York but to 
               <br />
               other members of this House interrupted 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman. He paused, when I 
               <br />
               said to him: 'Don’t let them bluff you,’ 
               <br />
               I take the responsibility of the words I 
               <br />
               used, and I was justiﬁed in saying what I 
               <br />
               did. My remark had no reference to the 
               <br />
               Speaker, and I protest against being called 
               <br />
