               Mr. BRODEUR. There is one fact which 
               <br />
               cannot be disputed,——-that the Catholics had 
               <br />
               their schools which they controlled, and 
               <br />
               the Protestants had their -schools which 
               <br />
               they controlled. The people in the west 
               <br />
               were afraid that these rights would be 
               <br />
               taken away from them, and so they showed 
               <br />
               hesitation in accepting the terms of union. 
               <br />
               At last there was a promise made by the 
               <br />
               imperial government and by the Canadian 
               <br />
               government, and by Lord Strathcona, who 
               <br />
               had been sent out there to settle the difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culty, that these rights and privileges would 
               <br />
               be continued ;—that is to say, Catholics 
               <br />
               would have the right to their schools and 
               <br />
               Protestants to their schools. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our.</span> Sproule) will not deny, I suppose, that 
               <br />
               the delegates who came from the west were 
               <br />
               recognized by the Dominion government. In 
               <br />
               fact, the cable which was sent by Sir John 
               <br />
               Young, to Lord Granville, the Secretary of 
               <br />
               State for the colonies, recognizes them as 
               <br />
               such; and more than that, I am informed 
               <br />
               that the expenses of these delegates on their 
               <br />
               journey to Ottawa were paid by the Can- 
               <br />
               adian government. So. Mr. Speaker, there 
               <br />
               was a formal agreement, a formal compact 
               <br />
               by which these rights and privileges, should 
               <br />
               continue to be exercised by the Protestants 
               <br />
               and Catholics of the Northwest. There is 
               <br />
               no doubt about that. And, now that we are 
               <br />
               called upon to give autonomy to the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, some elements in this 
               <br />
               country would have the government and 
               <br />
               parliament not carry out the promise which 
               <br />
               was made to the minority by the imperial 
               <br />
               government, by the Canadian government 
               <br />
               and by Lord Strathcona. Sir, the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of this country will not commit such 
               <br />
               an injustice; we will not go back on the 
               <br />
               promise which was made in 1869-70. The 
               <br />
               government of this country will give the 
               <br />
               minority their rights which were guaranteed 
               <br />
               to them by the promise then made, the 
               <br />
               rights which they enjoy under the consti- 
               <br />
               tution. -

               While on the subject of compacts, and 
               <br />
               before dealing with the constitutional aspect 
               <br />
               of the question, I would like to say a word 
               <br />
               or two with regard to the compact with the 
               <br />
               other provinces. I noticed a few days ago 
               <br />
               in the Toronto ‘News,’ a statement which 
               <br />
               has been made time and again in the course 
               <br />
               of this controversy. The Toronto ‘News’ 
               <br />
               is a newspaper of great importance, but one 
               <br />
               which, perhaps, in this agitation, has not 
               <br />
               done its duty to the country as it should 
               <br />
               have done. The Toronto ‘News’ has said 
               <br />
               that the compact with regard to separate 
               <br />
               schools was one which affected only the

               British North America Act, 1867 ? There 
               <br />
               was a conference at Quebec in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1864,</span> at- 
               <br />
               tended by representatives of Upper Canada,

               Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Sco- 
               <br />
               tia, Prince Edward Island and Newfound- 
               <br />
               land. After discussing the question of con- 
               <br />
               federation for several days, the delegates 
               <br />
               came to the conclusion that the educational 
               <br />
               laws should be under the control of the le- 
               <br />
               gislatures of the several provinces. saving 
               <br />
               the rights and privileges which the minority 
               <br />
               in Upper and Lower Canada might enjoy. 
               <br />
               It is true that the compact then applied 
               <br />
               only to those two provinces, it is true that 
               <br />
               the compact then simply embraced Quebec 
               <br />
               and Ontario. But I am going to show, and 
               <br />
               I am going to put before this House con— 
               <br />
               clusive evidence, that the compact later 
               <br />
               on was extended to all the provinces, not 
               <br />
               only to those which had entered into con-

               federation, but to those which would come 
               <br />
