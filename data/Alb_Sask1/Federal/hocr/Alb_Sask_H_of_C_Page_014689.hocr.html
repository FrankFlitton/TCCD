               well for our system as compared with What

               country in the world can show such a good

               ment Railways Act. He said: There is 
               <br />
               legislation before the House with reference 
               <br />
               to the transfer of the Canada Atlantic Rail- 
               <br />
               way system to the Grand Trunk Railway 
               <br />
               Company of Canada, and by which legis- 
               <br />
               lative authority is sought to conclude the 
               <br />
               transaction. It was deemed advisable by 
               <br />
               the government in the public interest that 
               <br />
               notice should be given to the panties before 
               <br />
               this legislative authority is granted that 
               <br />
               certain running powers should be reserved 
               <br />
               over the Canada Atlantic Railway system 
               <br />
               for the government system of railways. 
               <br />
               The proposal in this Bill is to reserve run- 
               <br />
               ning powers for the Intercolonial Railway 
               <br />
               system and for any extension of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment railway system over the line from 
               <br />
               Montreal to Cdteau and over the main trunk 
               <br />
               line of the Canada Atlantic Railway and 
               <br />
               all its branches. This Bill provides that the 
               <br />
               government shall have the right to run 
               <br />
               through freight and passenger trains and 
               <br />
               to do a local passenger business over this

               line. It is provided also that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compen-</span>

               ment to the Grand Trunk Railway for this 
               <br />
               privilege shall be determined by the Rail- 
               <br />
               way Commission, from which there shall 
               <br />
               be an appeal to the Supreme Court of Can-

               cil, but as the government system of rail- 
               <br />
               ways would be under the control and man-

               agement of the Governor in Council, it
