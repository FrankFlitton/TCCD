               separate schools; it is quite true, we have

               men coming from a country where they

               have not enjoyed separate schools, but

               where they have a system of national

               <br />
               the Remedial Bill in 1896, that I believe that

               in this country, in every province, it would

               continue for all time to come. We are 
               <br />
               to saddle on these provinces, before the po- 
               <br />
               pulation that is to be in there will have 
               <br />
               anything to say on the question at all in 
               <br />
               the years that are to come, what we have 
               <br />
               in the province of Ontario. I am here to 
               <br />
               say—and I believe I have the conﬁdence 
               <br />
               and I have the conﬁdence and good will of 
               <br />
               many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Roman</span> Catholics—that the same op- 
               <br />
               inion prevails throughout the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario that prevails in the town in which 
               <br />
               I live, where there have been French Ro- 
               <br />
               man Catholic priests and Irish Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic priests, and where there is a large 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic population. In that town 
               <br />
               they want no separate school at all. What 
               <br />
               do the returns show as to the separate 
               <br />
               schools in the province of Ontario to—day? 
               <br />
               Let any hon. gentleman consult the returns, 
               <br />
               and he will ﬁnd that town after town of 
               <br />
               2.000. 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 population in 
               <br />
