               <br />
               existing circumstances that have entered 
               <br />
               into this ‘2 The Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               gives the answer. He says that the only 
               <br />
               thing that has entered into it was the vote 
               <br />
               that was polled. He says What entered next 
               <br />
               was population, and he says that was a 
               <br />
               guide; what they wanted to get as near as 
               <br />
               possible was equality of population in the 
               <br />
               different representative districts. That is 
               <br />
               what my right hon. friend put forth as 
               <br />
               his strongest argument, and to-day he re- 
               <br />
               iterated the same thing. He said: I do not 
               <br />
               care for north or south or the dividing line, 
               <br />
               I only want to see that the population is 
               <br />
               equally divided in these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituencies,</span> and 
               <br />
               that consequently every elector has his pro-

               portionate share in the government of the 
               <br />
               province. Who raised the point of north 
               <br />
               and south ? It was certainly not the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Calgary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy). The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst mention I heard of that line of north 
               <br />
               and south in this House was by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minis</span> 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior himself. It was not 
               <br />
               mentioned as a division which should be 
               <br />
               sectional or anything of that kind, it was 
               <br />
               taken as a dividing line to Show the popu—

               exhausted the argument as to twenty-three

               constituencies you havebrought it down to 
               <br />
               this agreement amongst gentlemen on the

               other side of the House that as far as these 
               <br />
               twenty-three constituencies are concerned 
               <br />
               there is not any very great inequalty 
               <br />
               shown. We have given fourteen to the 
               <br />
               north. You have given eleven north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer and eleven south, which makes 
               <br />
               twenty-two, and you have Red Deer in the 
               <br />
               centre. Consequently you have divided it 
               <br />

               you say pretty equally. Even in that divi-

               sion the hon. gentlemen took care that they 
               <br />
               would get a political advantage. They get 
               <br />
               on that division more members than the 
               <br />
               south get. After that has been done, my

               them to the north as well. Without these 
               <br />
               two it could not be shown that there was 
               <br />
               equality between the north and the south, 
               <br />

               northern district. One thing I would like 
               <br />
               to know, is as to the distribution of popu-

               lation in the Peace River and Athabaska 
               <br />

               <br />
               the voters who will be, in settlements, and 
               <br />
               if so, in what settlements <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> There must be 
               <br />
               some knowledge with reference to this. I' 
               <br />
               do not imagine that although the distance 
               <br />
               may be great you have a widely separated 
               <br />
               rural population up there. It‘ you have a 
               <br />
               nomadic population that is one element that 
               <br />
               makes it very diﬂicult to give them re- 
               <br />
               presentation, but it may be that not so great 
               <br />
               an injustice would be perpetrated by not 
               <br />
               giving the nomadic part of the population 
               <br />
               representation as by giving them triple or 
               <br />
               quadruple representation. If you have a 
               <br />
               sedentary population residing in settlements 
               <br />
               what are those settlements <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> Your Interior

               Department ought to give us that informa-

               tion, and we want that information from 
               <br />
               them if it is possible. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               says you cannot have a Canadian in this 
               <br />
               country and not have him exercising the 
               <br />
               rights of a free-born Canadian and a Brit- 
               <br />
               ish subject. We have many people in this 
               <br />
               country who cannot exercise their rights. 
               <br />
               Circumstances alter cases, and the circum—

               stances of distance and space and sparse- 
               <br />
               ness of population make it so that there are 
               <br />
               hundreds and thousands of people in this 
               <br />
               country who cannot practically be repre— 
               <br />
               sented. This is due to the circumstances of 
               <br />
               the life which they have chosen for them-
