               <br />
               think it is very much to the credit of this

               parliament that such should be the case. 
               <br />
               I think that the new provinces should be

               <br />
               will not be the case. I come from a prov-

               ince where we have free schools, where the

               <br />
               but it soon became a lnatter of compromise. 
               <br />
               There was a desire on the part of the people

               the House. I happened to be a member at 
               <br />
               that time, and I voted in favour of the Bill. 
               <br />
               I voted in support of the government. I was 
               <br />
               nine years younger in age then, and I had 
               <br />
               nine years less experience than I have now. 
               <br />
               I voted largely from party exigencies. I am 
               <br />
               frank in saying so, and I think I will have 
               <br />
               many- sympathizers amongst my friends who 
               <br />
               are supporting this measure on this occasion. 
               <br />
               I acknowledge that I made a mistake. I 
               <br />
               now, before this House and the country. 
               <br />
               disavow my action at that time. And why ? 
               <br />
               I found that when I went to my people, 
               <br />
               when I went to my Roman Catholic citizens 
               <br />
               and supporters, after voting in favour of the 
               <br />
               Remedial Bill, in the interest of that church 
               <br />
               and in the interest of the minority of Mani~ 
               <br />
               tolba. they would have none of it. I found 
               <br />
               that they were frank, honest. open and 
               <br />
               above-board. When I went to them I told 
               <br />
               them, and they knew as well as I could tell 
               <br />
               them. the position that I occupied. They 
               <br />
               were frank, open and square, and they told 
               <br />
               me they would not vote for me, that they 
               <br />
               were supporters of the Liberal party. and 
               <br />
               although they did not tell me so, I inferred 
               <br />
               that, inasmuch as the Right Hon. Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier was the leader of that party. it 
               <br />
               was particularly attractive to them. They 
               <br />
               received me in the most hospitable manner 
               <br />
               and spoke to me in pleasant terms, but vote 
               <br />
               for me they would not. Of course, this is 
               <br />
               a personal matter, but it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has-</span> some bearing 
               <br />
               on .my action on the Remedial Bill. At the 
               <br />
               close of the poll in the election of 1896, in 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed by the Liberal party at that time was 
               <br />
               adopted for party reasons and party reasons

               Catholic constituents, my fellow-citizens. 
               <br />
               treated me, and because of the manner in

               which the people of the Dominion of Canada 
               <br />
               treated Sir Charles Tapper, I felt absolved

               from any obligation to continue my support

               <br />
               I regret the vote I gave on that occasion. 
               <br />
               Had I voted against the government at that 
               <br />
               time it was a moral certainty that I would

               ave been successful in my appeal to my 
               <br />

               Manitoba agitation that certain agreements 
               <br />
               had been arrived at and put in shape. At 
               <br />
               that time, as you all know, there was a

               territorial government established to rule 
               <br />
               that country. Certain agreements had been
