               then, by following the course they have fol-

               lowed in this matter, the government are 
               <br />

               favours, and in that I would agree with him 
               <br />
               entirely. The hon. gentleman says he 
               <br />
               does not believe in separate schools, yet he 
               <br />
               is in favour of saddling these two provinces

               the minority are treated in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. All this is satisfactory to know. 
               <br />
               We_ Protestant. from the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario are very glad to hear that the minority 
               <br />
               1n Quebec are treated fairly, as I believe 
               <br />
               they are, and as I believe they always will 
               <br />
               be, regardless of what may be said in this 
               <br />
               debate. But the hon. gentleman stops there. 
               <br />
               He does not show that the minorities in 
               <br />
               other provinces are treated any worse than 
               <br />
               are the minority in the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               He simply suggests a contrast and shows 
               <br />
               that the minority are well treated in Que- 
               <br />
               bec. but does not show that they are not 
               <br />
               well treated elsewhere. But there is an 
               <br />
               innuendo, an insinuation, in the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s remarks, and that insinuation is that 
               <br />
               the minorities are not treated well in other 
               <br />
               provinces. Where is the hon. member for 
               <br />
               West Northumberland (Mr. McColl) ? That 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is a Roman Catholic and 
               <br />
               understands exactly how the minority are 
               <br />
               treated in the province of Ontario. And 
               <br />
               where is the hon. member for Kingston? 
               <br />
               (Mr. Harty). Why do not these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen stand upand tell this House and this 
               <br />
               country that the minority in the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario is basely treated, if such is the 
               <br />
               case. But, Sir, we have never had any com-

               <br />

               <br />
               is a province where, by law, separate schools 
               <br />
               do not exist, and yet the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               stated without any contradiction in this 
               <br />
               House that the Catholic minority were well 
               <br />
               treated in that province, that though they 
               <br />
               had by law no right to separate schools, yet 
               <br />
               separate schools existed there, and were 
               <br />
               ﬂourishing in the city of Halifax and other 
               <br />
               parts of the province. My hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) was ungenerous 
               <br />
               enough to say, oh, well, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ifiyou</span> have given

               separate schools to the Catholics in that pro-

               vince you did it because they were becoming 
               <br />
               so strong that you were obliged to. There 
               <br />
               is another instance. We ﬁnd the Minister 
               <br />
