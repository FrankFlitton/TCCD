               <br />
               may be said and to make an honest effort 
               <br />
               to meet the views of those who differ from 
               <br />
               us in opinion. We should aim as far-.as 
               <br />
               possible to have a system brought 
               <br />
               about which would come as nearly as 
               <br />
               possible to our own particular views: yet 
               <br />
               surely each of us must realize that if we are 
               <br />
               to carry on the government of the country 
               <br />
               we must not insist on our individual views, 
               <br />
               but must try to meet the views of those who 
               <br />

               <br />
               the principle of separate schools. I regret 
               <br />
               that such a large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number</span> of my fellow 
               <br />
               citizens in Canada are obliged to take the 
               <br />
               view, conscientiously as they say and as I 
               <br />
               believe, that they cannot support a system 
               <br />
               of free common schools. I think it would be 
               <br />
               a great thing for our country if in the 
               <br />
               growth that is now coming so rapidly upon 
               <br />
               us, our children of all races and sections and 
               <br />
               creeds could meet from day to day and

               <br />
               we could happily agree upon such a policy it 
               <br />
               would do much for the grander upbuilding 
               <br />

               Canada by any such rule as that. Let us 
               <br />
               remember that the Roman Catholics are 
               <br />
               not in a minority everywhere; there is

               Catholic brethren are in the majority,

               condition of our Protestant brethren in

               my hon. friend the Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               shown, in preparing the constitution of con-

               Protestant minority in Quebec. And, Sir,

               if it was necessary then to make an ar-

               <br />
               will be inﬂuenced by the Golden Rule : ‘Do

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There are three great lines of thought to- 
               <br />
               day on the question of public education. 
               <br />
               One, held by a great many people, is that 
               <br />
               the secular system of education is the only 
               <br />
               system which we should have in the public 
               <br />
               schools. There are many people, altogether 
               <br />
               Protestants I think, who claim that it is 
               <br />
               useless to introduce anything like religion 
               <br />
               into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools,</span> and that all we can do is 
               <br />
               to devote ourselves to secular education. 
               <br />
               The second line of thought is that which is 
               <br />
               held by a large number of the advocates 
               <br />
               of what may be called national schools. 
               <br />
               These people think that with secular edu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cation</span> you may associate a certain degree 
               <br />
               of what may be properly called religious 
               <br />
               instruction; that you may say to the

               the very best kind of religion. However that 
               <br />
               may be, many think that it is quite possible
