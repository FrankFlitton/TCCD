               but here is what I want particularly to 
               <br />
               draw your attention to. The person who 
               <br />
               led that procession was the man who had 
               <br />
               been instrumental in causing the mantle of 
               <br />
               the ex—Minister of the Interior to fall upon 
               <br />
               the shoulders of the people’s representative 
               <br />
               from that district. Who was that person <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'3</span> 
               <br />
               Who was the man who walked With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">magniﬁ-</span>

               cent strides and martial tread and nodding 
               <br />
               plumes on his head in front of that pro- 
               <br />
               cession? It was no less a person than 
               <br />
               ‘Autonomy Bill.’ He is the man who led 
               <br />
               the van, and he it was who was instru- 
               <br />
               - mental in causing this mantle to fall on the 
               <br />
               shoulders of Mr. Oliver. I want further to 
               <br />
               draw your attention to this fact, that the 
               <br />
               events of the day culminated by a large 
               <br />
               meeting held in the Thistle rink; and it is 
               <br />
               worth our while noticing this fact, because 
               <br />
               it stands out in large letters in the ‘Evening 
               <br />
               Journal’ of this city. Here is the heading 
               <br />
               of the ‘Journal’s' description: ‘The Hon. 
               <br />
               Frank Oliver elected by acclamation and 
               <br />
               enthusiastically endorsed at a mass meet- 
               <br />
               ing of the citizens.’ The ‘Journal’ goes on 
               <br />
               to mention those who were present and who 
               <br />
               spoke, and, among other things, it says that 
               <br />
               Mr. Oliver made a speech of an hour on the 
               <br />
               school question. which his admirers pro- 
               <br />
               nounced to be the best of his life, and then 
               <br />
               it adds: But the gallant member for South 
               <br />
               York (Mr. W. F. Maclean), having suffered 
               <br />
               great pain and distress, had dropped the 
               <br />
               chip from his shoulder which he was carry- 
               <br />
               ing on the 5th of this month, and was not 
               <br />
               present, and no opposition was oﬂered. I 
               <br />
               draw particular attention to the fact that 
               <br />
               there was no opposition. Even the gallant 
               <br />
               member for South York (Mr. W. F. Maclean), 
               <br />
               who is so valiant, who wanted everybody to 
               <br />
               resign, so that he could contest their con- 
               <br />
               stituencies with them—even that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman was not there. Why, Mr. Speaker. 
               <br />
               you know he wanted the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Centre York <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Campbell) to resign; he 
               <br />
               wanted the hon. member for North York 
               <br />
               (Sir William <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Mulock)</span> to resign; he went 
               <br />
               around with a chip on his shoulder like a 
               <br />
               very son of Donnybrook fair. He thought 
               <br />
               the people wanted somebody they could cheer 
               <br />
               for. He thought that was what the people 
               <br />
               wanted in the mayoralty election in Toron— 
               <br />
               to. But they thought they could ﬁnd some- 
               <br />
               body to cheer for without taking the advice 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman on that subject.

               I had given my opinion to the hon. member

               pose giving it now, and I am not ashamed 
               <br />
               or afraid to do it. either. Now, the ques- 
               <br />
               tion is, why do I support this Bill? I sup- 
               <br />
               port it, in the ﬁrst place. because the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister and his government, having care- 
               <br />
               fully considered the clauses of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act and ot‘ the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               which established the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories,</span> 
               <br />
               have come to the conclusion that power was 
               <br />
               constitutionally given .to the Northwest to 
               <br />
               establish separate schools. And, looking at 
               <br />
               the history of those Territories for the last 
               <br />
               thirty years, I ﬁnd that they have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ween</span> in 
               <br />
               the enjoyment of these separate schools. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd also that everybody who took part in 
               <br />
               the enactment of this Act of 1875 thought 
               <br />
               that the establishment of separate schools 
               <br />
               was a permanent thing. That being the 
               <br />
               case, I think we should act in good faith 
               <br />
               and maintain that system, especially when 
               <br />
               it has resulted in so much good. I believe 
               <br />
               that nations should have the same respect 
               <br />
               for their word that an individual has. And 
               <br />
               when a man gives his word he should stand 
               <br />
               by it. I believe with Voltaire who in his 
               <br />
               history of Charles XII., of Sweden, in- 
               <br />
               forms us that he could not see why a 
               <br />
               nation’s word should not be as true as 
               <br />
               the word of an individual. We have 
               <br />
               promised the people of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories that they should have the privilege 
               <br />
               of separate schools, and surely we are not 
               <br />
               going back on our word. Another reason 
               <br />
               why I believe this Bill should be passed 
               <br />
               is that it secures good public schools to the 
               <br />
               people in the Northwest Territories. You 
               <br />
               may call them separate schools, but in reality 
               <br />
               they are public schools. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Souris (Mr. Schai‘fner)—I think it was— 
               <br />
               sta-ted that he did not want these schools 
               <br />
               to be called separate schools, but to be called 
               <br />
               two sets of schools. 
               <br />
