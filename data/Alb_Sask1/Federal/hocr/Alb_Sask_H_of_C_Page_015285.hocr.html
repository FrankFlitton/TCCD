               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">INGRAM.</span> I would like to point out 
               <br />
               to the hon. Minister of the Interior that if he 
               <br />
               hopes to succeed as a minister and employs 
               <br />
               the tactics that he is now using he will 
               <br />
               know What to expect. As far as I am indi- 
               <br />
               vidually concerned I have no hesitation in 
               <br />
               stating that legislation such as this is the 
               <br />
               most unfair that I ever remember having 
               <br />
               heard introduced into this House. The Con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               time again with introducing legislation which 
               <br />
               was unfair, but I challenge hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite to place their ﬁnger on a single 
               <br />
               particle of legislation that can equal the 
               <br />
               legislation introduced by the government on 
               <br />
               this occasion. I have no objection to telling 
               <br />
               the government and the hon. Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior that I for one do propose to obstruct 
               <br />
               iegislation of this kind. I am responsible for 
               <br />
               my own actions in this House and I have 
               <br />
               no hesitation in saying exactly where I stand 
               <br />
               on this question and no threat from the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior will debar me from 
               <br />
               doing what I conceive to be my duty in 
               <br />
               regard to it. The government have attempt-

               <br />
               corners of these Bills the schedules which 
               <br />
               rightly belong to them. It is charged openly 
               <br />
               and above board that these schedules were 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               the Bills had been presented to the House.

               It is clear then that the schedules were pre-

               Mr. SPROULE. The remarks of the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver). it 
               <br />
               seems to me, were quite unnecessary and 
               <br />
               uncalled for, and if the hon. minister de- 
               <br />
               sired to prevent the passage of this measure. 
               <br />
               he could not have taken any means to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac«</span> 
               <br />
               complish it more effectively than the course 
               <br />
               which he has endeavoured to pursue. The 
               <br />
               tone of the remarks which the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man gave vent to and the fact that he en- 
               <br />
               deavours to treat members of the opposition 
               <br />
               as though they had no rights in this House, 
               <br />
               certainly will not assist us in the considera- 
               <br />
               tion of this measure. From the ﬁrst stage 
               <br />
               of this measure to the present the informa- 
               <br />
               tion that we have received is that the mem- 
               <br />
               bers from the Northwest Territories have 
               <br />
               considered this and decided so and so, and 
               <br />
               that the hon. Minister of the Interior has 
               <br />
               considered it and decided so and so, thereby 
               <br />
               assuming that the balance of the 214 mem— 
               <br />
               bers of this House have no rights what- 
               <br />
               ever. They have no right to exercise a 
               <br />
               judgment on this measure, but they are 
               <br />
               simply here to register the decree of the 
               <br />
               nine or ten members from the Northwest 
               <br />
               who have met together and arranged some- 
               <br />
               thing t‘or their own purposes—I was gomg 
               <br />
               to say for their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> 01‘ party <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Du!“-</span> 
               <br />
               poses—and that all the opposition can do is 
               <br />
               to register a decree of obedience to the-Will 
               <br />
               of these few Liberal members from the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. The sooner the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior learns that other mem- 
               <br />
               bers in this House have rights as well as 
               <br />
