               ting out of the difficulty and that a splendid

               opportunity presents itself for adopting an- 
               <br />
               other principle and possibly one that by-

               <br />
               under review by the government. We pro- 
               <br />
               pose to take away the lands. or rather re- 
               <br />
               tain the lands. I should prefer myself to 
               <br />
               use the expression ‘take away the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lands,’</span> 
               <br />
               because we are taking the lands which be- 
               <br />
               long to the provinces and giving them a 
               <br />
               consideration in return. When we do this 
               <br />
               can we not, on some broad principle, come 
               <br />
               to an arrangement by which this plan of 
               <br />

               <br />
               a head to these people would be got rid of ‘2 :

               I do not say for a moment that we should 
               <br />
               be niggardly in starting out these provinces 
               <br />
               in their new sphere. I think it would never 
               <br />
               do to adopt any plan which would not give 
               <br />
               these people sufﬁcient revenue, but we must 
               <br />
               admit the principle that where one govern- 
               <br />
               ment is collecting the revenue and another 
               <br />
               government is spending it, there is not the 
               <br />
               same inducement to the spending <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern«</span>

               ment to act with economy as if they were 
               <br />
               collecting it and directly responsible to the 
               <br />
               people from whom they took it. If we can 
               <br />
               in some way hold those people responsible 
               <br />
               to those who contribute the money. we 
               <br />
               would be making a radical change which 
               <br />
               might be taken advantage of at some future 
               <br />
               day possibly with regard to the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. At any rate I think we would be 
               <br />
               starting out on a basis that would conduce 
               <br />
               more to economy than the principle we are 
               <br />
               adopting at present. I do not think that in

               we can devise some plan under these new 
               <br />
               conditions, which would be more accept-

               would throw them upon their own resources

               now just what their revenues will be and 
               <br />
               had to work out their own destiny with 
               <br />
               what we give them now for all time, and 
               <br />
               if they were not in a position to come back

               time after time and ask for more, the new
