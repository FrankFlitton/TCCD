               Mr. BOURASSA. There is one point that

               <br />
               legislation of 1875 was not to deal with 
               <br />
               the minority of any particular district. but 
               <br />

               The conclusion to which the reasoning of

               the leader of the opposition would lead us 
               <br />
               is this, that the legislature of 1875 intend—

               ed to give some protection to either the

               was drafted, you ﬁnd that the object of

               <br />
               separation of schools is concerned. If the 
               <br />
               Catholics are in the majority they can or- 
               <br />

               <br />

               that is provided in the former portion of 
               <br />
               the section; and if the majority is Pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Protestant school or a non-sectarian school.

               sometimes they prefer sectarian and some-
