               Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bx'DNEY</span> A. FISHER (Minister of 
               <br />
               Agriculture). Mr. Speaker, when the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) sat 
               <br />
               down a few minutes ago, he stated that 
               <br />
               probably he would be accused of making an 
               <br />
               inﬂammatory speech. I can only take it that 
               <br />
               a guilty conscience enabled him to read the 
               <br />
               minds of those who listened .to the speech he 
               <br />
               made for certainly he was right in describ- 
               <br />
               ing it as an inﬂammatory speech. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman, in that speech, certainly tried to 
               <br />
               inﬂame the minds of those in this country 
               <br />
               who distrust or dislike the Catholic church 
               <br />
               and the Catholic religion. The whole tenor 
               <br />
               of the hon. gentleman's <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speech.</span> was such as 
               <br />
               to raise Protestant prejudice and Protestant 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> against this government because he 
               <br />
               implied that this government, led by a 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic, was in constant touch with 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic church in regard to 
               <br />
               secular affairs in this country. The hon. 
               <br />
               member himself on former occasions has 
               <br />
               complained, that he and his government 
               <br />
               when he was in the government, was sub- 
               <br />
               jected to similar attacks, not to similar at-

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               bers of the government then said, to raise 
               <br />
               Protestant and English speaking feeling 
               <br />
               against the government at that time. Sir, I 
               <br />
               would like the hon. member for North Tor- 
               <br />
               onto to recall a speech he made in 1896, 
               <br />
               when, replying to an interruption from the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey, he used these 
               <br />
               words, and I think perhaps he will admit 
               <br />
               that when he uttered these broad-minded 
               <br />
               words he was more of a statesman than he 
               <br />
               is to-day in making what he himself has 
               <br />
               characterized as an inﬂammatory speech. 
               <br />
               What did the hon. gentleman thensay? He 
               <br />
               was not then representing a strong Protes- 
               <br />

               <br />
               representing the maritime provinces, and 
               <br />
               he said this, referring to a speech which the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey had quoted or 
               <br />

               (Sir \Vilfrid Laurier) on implications and

               borne out, but are in fact absolutely re-

               futed by the statement issued by the Apos- 
               <br />
               tolic delegate. The hon. gentleman quoted

               some words from Mr. Rogers’ statement and 
               <br />
               he pointed out that something might be im- 
               <br />
               plied by that statement. I venture to say, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sir,</span> that anybody who reads the statement 
               <br />
               of Mr. Rogers, in Winnipeg, will say that 
               <br />
               there is a great deal more implied in that 
               <br />
               statement than there is actually contained 
               <br />
               in it, and that there is an evident intention 
               <br />
               by the wording of the statement to make im- 
               <br />
               plications and insinuations that the gentle- 
               <br />
               man who gave that statement did not dare 
               <br />
               to come out and state as matters of fact. 
               <br />
               These implications and insinuations are not 
               <br />
               founded on facts, but they are false to the 
               <br />
               record and they are untrue. Sir, the very

               ﬁrst thing that would strike anybody in

               reading that statement, the ﬁrst thing which 
               <br />
               i confess, myself, impressed me was that

               Mr. Rogers had met the ablegate here in 
               <br />
