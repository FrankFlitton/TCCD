               <br />

               These reasons, strong and forcible as they

               were in 1884, are even stronger and more 
               <br />
               forcible in 1905, because the current of im-

               <br />

               conceivable that if these lands were given to 
               <br />
               the new previnces, the policy of either one 
               <br />
               of them might differ from ours and clash

               with our efforts to increase immigration. It

               might possibly render these efforts nuga— 
               <br />
               tcry. For instance, if either of the new 
               <br />
               provinces, under the strain of ﬁnancial dif— 
               <br />
               ﬁculty, were to abolish the free homesteads, 
               <br />
               which have proved so beneﬁcial and so great 
               <br />
               an inducement to immigration, one can 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">readily</span> understand what a great blow that 
               <br />
               would be to our immigration policy. Or if 
               <br />
               the price of government lands for sale were 
               <br />
               to be increased over the present very moder- 
               <br />
               ate rate, that would also be another blow 
               <br />
               to that policy. But I frankly admit, and 
               <br />
               we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> all recognize, that the provinces in 
               <br />
               the west, in being deprived of the public 
               <br />
               lands. are deprived of a valuable source of 
               <br />
               income. And in that way they complain 
               <br />
               that they are put on a footing of inequality 
               <br />
               as compared with the older provinces of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. Realizing that fact, it is the 
               <br />
               duty of parliament to make ample, even gen- 
               <br />
               erous, provision which will compensate the 
               <br />
               provinces for the retention of the lands 
               <br />
               by the Federal government, and I believe 
               <br />
               that in makng this provision we shall have 
               <br />
               the full support of hon. members whether 
               <br />
               on one side or on the other.

               Now I come to the ﬁnancial terms which 
               <br />
               should be given to the new provinces. Our 
               <br />
               constitution, which is to be found in the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, contains a very 
               <br />
               remarkable provision. It contains the pro- 
               <br />
               vision that out of the Federal treasury 
               <br />
               there shall be paid to the provinces 
               <br />
               a large amount of money in the shape 
               <br />
               of subsidies to assist them in carrying on 
               <br />
               their business. This, I say, is a very extra- 
               <br />
               ordinary provision. It is, I believe. unique. 
               <br />
               At all events, so far as my information goes, 
               <br />
               I do not know that any similar provision is 
               <br />
               to be found in the constitution of any other 
               <br />
               federal government. It is a sound principle 
               <br />
               of ﬁnance, and a still sounder principle of 
               <br />
               government, that those who have the duty 
               <br />
               of expending the revenue of a country 
               <br />
               should also be saddled with the responsi- 
               <br />
               bility of levying and providing it. That 
               <br />
               principle has been departed from in our 
               <br />
               case, and no doubt was departed from with 
               <br />
               some object. What can have been the rea- 
               <br />
               sons which induced the fathers of confed- 
               <br />
               eration in 1867 to depart from so obvious a 
               <br />
               principle of ﬁnance and government. The 
               <br />
               reasons are simply these. Confederation 
               <br />
               was the result of several compromises. It 
               <br />
               would have been impossible to establish it 
               <br />
               if there had not been a policy of give and 
               <br />
               take adopted among all the constituent 
               <br />
               bodies. And I am quite sure, I am speak-
