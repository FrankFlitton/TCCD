               here of what George Brown said during the

               It has always appeared to me that the open-

               friends from Lower Canada. During the dis-

               cussion on the question for some years back I 
               <br />

               <br />
               into those singularly interesting narratives of 
               <br />
               life and travels in the Northwest in the olden 
               <br />

               commercial dominancy in the great fur-bearing 
               <br />
               regions. And it has always struck me that the 
               <br />
               French Canadian people have cause to look 
               <br />

               gentlemen, Messrs. Radisson and De Gros- 
               <br />
               eil, ﬁrst discovered the overland communi- 
               <br />
               cation between Canada and Hudson bay, 
               <br />
               and with these gentlemen originated the 
               <br />
               idea of the Hudson Bay Company. In 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1749.</span> an unsuccessful attempt was made 
               <br />
               in the imperial parliament to deprive the 
               <br />
               company of its character for non-user. The 
               <br />
               company had at that time four or ﬁve forts 
               <br />
               on the coast of Hudson bay, and in its ser- 
               <br />
               vice about 120 men. After the cession of 
               <br />
               Canada in 1763. numerous fur traders spread 
               <br />
               over the same country, and ﬁnally these in- 
               <br />
               dividual speculators combined into the 
               <br />
               Northwest Fur Company of Montreal. I 
               <br />
               need not refer to the settlement effected in 
               <br />
               that country under the auspices of Lord 
               <br />
               Selkirk, but I would like to refer to the 
               <br />
               license granted in 1821 to the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company and the Northwest Company. 
               <br />
               which two com-panics were then amalgamat- 
               <br />
