               The late Minister of the Interior said: ‘I 
               <br />
               am bound to say that the draftsman was 
               <br />

               the right he professed that he desired to

               give.’ But the Minister of Justice, in his 
               <br />
               explanation said: ‘When this federal par- 
               <br />
               liament was giving to Manitoba a constitu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               give, and I was bound to make no mistake 
               <br />
               in this case, but to use the language that 
               <br />
               would clearly confer the rights we intended 
               <br />
               to give, and we intended to give the min- 
               <br />
               ority the rights as to separate schools which 
               <br />
               were contained. in the Act of 187'5.’ But the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister said: ‘We intended to do

               <br />
               that what exists <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is not what existed 
               <br />

               minorities in both the Canadas may pos- 
               <br />
               sess as to their denominational Schools at 
               <br />
               the time when the union comes into opera- 
               <br />
               tion. That is all. There is nothing there 
               <br />
               to indicate any intention to bring all the 
               <br />
               province under the same right. But I want 
               <br />
               to draw attention to another point. When 
               <br />
               it was proposed to take home these resolu- 
               <br />
               ions and get an imperial enactment, the 
               <br />
               government declared that they would bring 
               <br />
               back nothing but an Act strictly upon the 
               <br />
               lines of these resolutions. I have here a 
               <br />
               motion that was made by the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Holton. What was it? It was that the 
               <br />
               imperial Act should not become law until 
               <br />
               it would be submitted to the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada and obtained the consent of that 
               <br />
               parliament. What reason did he give in 
               <br />
               support of his motion? He said he made 
               <br />
               his motion because of our experience in 
               <br />
               1854, when we got an imperial Act giving 
               <br />
               us a constitution which contained clauses 
               <br />
               it was never intended should be in it. In 
               <br />
               answer to that resolution, the Attorney Gen- 
               <br />
               eral of that day, the late Sir George Etienne 
               <br />
               Cartier, guaranteed on behalf of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment that they would bring back nothing 
               <br />
               but an imperial Act strictly based upon 
               <br />
               these resolutions. He said: 
               <br />

               Mr. Speaker, in reply to what the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Hochelaga (-Mr. Holton) has just said, I 
               <br />
               would merely tell the hon. members of this 
               <br />
               House that they need not become alarmed at 
               <br />
               the apprehensions and predictions of the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman. I have already declared in my own 
               <br />
               behalf and on behalf of the government that 
               <br />
               the delegates who go to England will accept 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the imperial parliament no Act but one 
               <br />

               and they will not bring back any other. I have 
               <br />
               pledged my word of honour on that point, and 
               <br />
               the word of honour of the government, and I 
               <br />
               trust that these will have at least as much 
               <br />
               weight with this House and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> as the 
               <br />
               apprehensions of the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> Hoohe-
