               <br />
               which usually result, before you can take 
               <br />
               possession of a piece of land to make or to 
               <br />
               deviate a road. If you had power to take 
               <br />
               the land and make the road it would not be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sr</span> bad, but if you had to wait until you get

               the consent of the government here it would

               be very inconvenient.

               Mr. SPROULE. I would think that would

               want to take a piece of land and suppose 
               <br />
               this government has some other object in 
               <br />
               View with reference to that land, then, sup- 
               <br />
               pose you got the Dominion Land Surveyor 
               <br />
               to survey the road, that you took possession 
               <br />
               of it. you are afraid to spend money be-

               the control of the Lieutenant Governor in

               Council a surveyor could be Sent out and 
               <br />
               survey what is needed, because the local 
               <br />
               conditions would be better known there
