               <br />
               growth which I have but roughly outlined, 
               <br />
               a great change has been coming over (Jan- 
               <br />
               ada. Our outlook has widened during the 
               <br />
               thirty-eight years that have gone. We have 
               <br />
               ceased to view matters from a provincial 
               <br />
               or narrow point of view; our outlook has 
               <br />
               become a Dominion, a continental one. And, 
               <br />
               especially during the last eight years has 
               <br />
               this development gone on in so remarkable 
               <br />
               a degree that I may be pardoned for refer- 
               <br />
               ring to it. One of the advantages of this 
               <br />
               marked advance of the last eight years is 
               <br />
               that old race and creed issues have been for- 
               <br />
               gotten, and from sea to sea men do not now 
               <br />
               stop to consider these things, but we realize 
               <br />
               in a way we never did before that we are 
               <br />
               Canadians one and all. There is coming to 
               <br />
               Canada, but more particularly to young 
               <br />
               Canada, a realization of the great resources 
               <br />
               and extent of our country which was not 
               <br />
               present with us even a few years ago. 
               <br />
               When we recall that, in Canada we have an 
               <br />
               area that is more than one-third of the 
               <br />
               whole British empire, and as that idea has 
               <br />
               permeated the whole life of our people, 
               <br />
               there has grown a patriotic pride and a 
               <br />
               feeling of interest in and devotion to our 
               <br />
               country which, in other nations and in 
               <br />
               other times, it has required the stern teach- 
               <br />
               ing of war to evoke. And our pride in our 
               <br />
               institutions, in our literature, in our rapid 
               <br />
               growth in national life, has been enhanced 
               <br />
               by our faith in our country’s resources, and 
               <br />
               by a realization of the fact that during the 
               <br />
               past eight years our trade increase has ex- 
               <br />
               ceeded that of every other country in the 
               <br />
               history of the world. I have already given 
               <br />
               some ﬁgures showing our position at 
               <br />
               the time of confederation. To-day, our 
               <br />
               railway mileage exceeds 20,000 miles; our 
               <br />
               postal revenue is over $6,000,000 a year; 
               <br />
               the deposits in our banks instead of being 
               <br />
               $38,000,000, as they were thirty-eight years 
               <br />
               ago, are close upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$000,000,000.</span> Once 
               <br />
               these facts are realized, we contemplate the 
               <br />
               position of Canada With growing exultation 
               <br />
               and pride. We realize that here in Canada, 
               <br />
               we have all the elements by which we may 
               <br />
               become the great ﬂour, paper, cheese, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but«</span> 
               <br />
               ter and provision producer, as well 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> woodenware manufacturing cen- 
               <br />
               tre of the world. These natural conditions 
               <br />
               are beginning to be appreciated, and 
               <br />
               are certain of early exploitation. But our 
               <br />
               outlook widening, as it has been on the 
               <br />
               federal and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continental</span> side, looks also to-

               way of reaching the end which he desires 
               <br />
               to see attained. There are those who are 
               <br />
               accustomed to say that Canada has done 
               <br />
               nothing towards paying her debt of 
               <br />
               gratitude to the empire. I think they 
               <br />
               forget the efforts that have been put forth 
               <br />
               by Canada, and the help that has been ren- 
               <br />
               dered by Canada in constructing already 
               <br />
               one great transcontinental line and prepar- 
               <br />
               ing for the immediate construction of 
               <br />
               another. The ﬁrst of these already has 
               <br />
               been, and both of them must be, tremendous 
               <br />
               factors in binding the empire together, whe- 
               <br />
               ther in peace or in war. In additiOn to that, 
               <br />
               Canada has shown herself, by her attitude 
               <br />
               at the time of the South African war, to be 
               <br />
               ready to stand by the empire in the hour 
               <br />
               of national necessity. We are going on 
               <br />
               with the inception of a Canadian navy—a ' 
               <br />
               small navy it may be, but we are moving 
               <br />
               along the proper line by arranging that 
               <br />
               when Canada spends 'her money on behalf 
               <br />
               of the empire she shall oversee that expen~ 
               <br />
               diture. It may. be true—it is true—that 
               <br />
               Canada must make some sacriﬁces in order 
               <br />
               that the problem of the empire may be 
               <br />
               solved. Those of us who believe in 
               <br />
               imperial connection and the future of the 
               <br />
               empire are ready that these sacriﬁces should 
               <br />
               be made. At the same time, Canada’s in- 
               <br />
               terests must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'be</span> guarded. and there must be 
               <br />
               corresponding sacriﬁces in every other part 
               <br />
               of the empire, in order that a harmonioas 
               <br />
               and a successful future may be assured. 
               <br />
               The next paragraph of the address to 
               <br />
               which I will refer announces that satisfac- 
               <br />
               tory progress has been made in carrying out 
               <br />
               the policy of a national transcontinental 
               <br />
               railway which was approved by parliament 
               <br />
               two years ago and reafﬁrmed last session. 
               <br />
               I am sure that hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               appreciate to—day, perhaps more even than 
               <br />
               they did in the past, the great importance 
               <br />
               to Canada of carrying to a successful issue 
               <br />
               the construction of this great railway. It is 
               <br />
               only fair to say that, although some of these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen, at the inception of this pro- 
               <br />
               position, were disposed to combat the idea 
               <br />
               that the new Transcontinental Railway was 
               <br />
               necessary, at the conclusion of the discus— 
               <br />
               sion of that question, they frankly admitted 
               <br />
               that it was a good thing to have the new 
               <br />
               railway. But they interjected into the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion a proposition which was utterly 
               <br />
               opposed to all the traditions of their party, 
               <br />
               when they suggested the government owner- 
               <br />
               ship and operation of that railway. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Today,</span> I am sure, they will join with us
