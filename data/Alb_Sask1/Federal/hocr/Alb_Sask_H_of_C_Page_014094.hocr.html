               that Mr. Haultain and Mr. Bulyea do not

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bered</span> that the claims of the Northwest Ter-

               ritories were set forth in the most distinct 
               <br />
               and deﬁnite terms—were set forth categor- 
               <br />
               ically—in a draft Bill which the premier 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories submitted to 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister more than three years 
               <br />
               ago. Those terms were discussed in the 
               <br />
               legislative assembly, and were for all prac~ 
               <br />
               tlcal purposes unanimously approved. I may 
               <br />
               say that there was a unanimous approval 
               <br />
               of the various terms of that draft Bill, with 
               <br />
               just one exception : that was as to whether 
               <br />
               there should be one or two provinces. On

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speaker,</span> to answer a remark which was 
               <br />

               <br />
               I will get at it more directly. The Prime 
               <br />
               Minister made a strong point of the fact 
               <br />
               that Mr. Haultain had objected to two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces being formed. That made a large 
               <br />
               part of his argument, and surely I should be 
               <br />
               allowed to say a few words in reference 
               <br />
               to that. What I wish to point out is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this;</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat</span> a very large majority of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members[</span>

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> should be formed—whether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there}</span>

               he advocated what was the very strong ver-

               I may say further that the terms of this

               the correspondence in connection with the

               draft Bill, and the draft Bill itself, so that 
               <br />
               there can be no question, seeing that Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain’s government was returned to pow- 
               <br />
               r with an overwhelming majority, that he 
               <br />
               was voicing the opinion 0f the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest in the demands which he has 
               <br />
               made in regard to the terms upon which the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Were to become pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. But, as the right hon; the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister says, he had discussed this ques— 
               <br />
               tion and had great advantage in the (US— 
               <br />
               cussion not only with the representatives of 
               <br />
               the Territorial government, but also with 
               <br />
               several western members, we must presume 
               <br />
               that the Bill was introduced with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span> 
               <br />
               cnrrence of these western members. We 
               <br />
               must assume that, or else these remarks of 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister would have no signiﬁc~ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">once</span> or meaning. I noticed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> that some

               Northwest members on the other side of the 
               <br />

               vigorous applause.

               Again I say that I consider that the pre-

               <br />
               this House is most necessary. A proposal 
               <br />
               is made in these draft Bills that the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion government should remain in possession 
               <br />
               of the public lands of the Northwest. i 
               <br />
               venture to assert that it has been found 
               <br />
               impossible in the past to administer the 
               <br />
               lands of that country, with satisfaction, from 
               <br />
               Ottawa and I think that if a close <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inquiry</span> 
               <br />
               were made into the conditions it would be 
               <br />
               found that there is a great deal of dissatis- 
               <br />
               faction in that country with the proclaimed 
               <br />
               policy of the Minister of the Interior with 
               <br />
               reference to the settlement of these lands. 
               <br />
               and that the administration of these lands 
               <br />
               is not satisfactory to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west. This House should have the fullest in-
