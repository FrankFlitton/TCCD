               Mr. OLIVER. I notice that our friends 
               <br />
               are squealing very quickly. They should 
               <br />
               not leave themselves so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'open,</span> and they 
               <br />
               would not have cause to complain. They 
               <br />
               claim to be the champions of the rights and 
               <br />
               liberties of the Northwest and of provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy in that country ; but when a sec- 
               <br />
               tion of the Northwest declares its mind ~con~ 
               <br />
               trary to their views, at once they proceed 
               <br />
               to attempt to discredit that expression 
               <br />
               of opinion and to argue that it is 
               <br />
               not worthy of consideration. I think, 
               <br />
               therefore, that in view of the attitude 
               <br />
               which has been assumed so energeti- 
               <br />
               ca‘lly by the hon. member for East Elgin 
               <br />
               (Mr. Ingram) and the Conservativepl‘ess 
               <br />
               throughout the country, the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Will take warning that if they 
               <br />
               want provincial rights they must not look to 
               <br />
               the party opposite for the advocacy or sanc- 
               <br />
               tion of those rights. Whether the people 
               <br />
               of the constituency of Edmonton are Gali- 
               <br />

               <br />
               residents of the Northwest, citizens of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, and British subjects, and they are the 
               <br />
               people upon whom this alleged iniquitous 
               <br />
               legislation is to be enforced. And if they 
               <br />
               are not entitled to be heard on that question, 
               <br />
               I would ask where are our rights of provin-

               <br />
