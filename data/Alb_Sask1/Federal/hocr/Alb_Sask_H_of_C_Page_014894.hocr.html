               <br />
               cognizing the convictions of those who 
               <br />
               claim and perhaps rightly claim that 
               <br />
               religious and secular education should 
               <br />
               to some extent at least go hand in hand.

               The Bill before the House involves the con- 
               <br />
               tinuance and perpetuation of an educational 
               <br />
               system which, while guarding fully and com- 
               <br />
               pletely the best educational interests of the 
               <br />
               whole people, is jealous of the religious con- 
               <br />
               victions of the minority. It involves, as i 
               <br />
               understand it, the continuance and perpetu- 
               <br />
               ation of a school system based upon just 
               <br />
               principles, fair play and justice, at least in 
               <br />
               the greatest measure, to all. It involves 
               <br />
               the continuance and perpetuation of the 
               <br />
               only scheme of education in our country 
               <br />
               which we can hope to be enduring and per- 
               <br />
               manent. and which is most likely to put 
               <br />
               an end, I hope, for ever to the shameful.
