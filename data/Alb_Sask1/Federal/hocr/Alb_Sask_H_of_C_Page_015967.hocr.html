               Mr. SCOTT. My hon. friends opposite 
               <br />
               applaud the remark. I am, therefore, giving

               an accurate discription of what they have

               attempted. We had some reference here

               a few days ago to a Northwest conference 
               <br />
               called by Mr. Haultain and to the matters 
               <br />
               discussed there. I proposed a motion at 
               <br />
               that conference with regard to the redistri- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               not as I stated, but was that we should 
               <br />
               hold out together to get our land and min-

               bution and two or three other matters. I re- 
               <br />
               peat that no motion was made at any confer- 
               <br />
               ence as is described by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Alberta <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Herron) either by myself, him- 
               <br />
               self or by the hon. member for Qu’Appelle 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lake) or by Mr. Haultain to the effect 
               <br />
               that we should stand out for the absolute 
               <br />
               transfer of our public lands. What I did 
               <br />
               at that conference however, was to attempt 
               <br />
               to get it to take the position—not by mo- 
               <br />
               tion, but by suggestion ; and that is doubt- 
               <br />
               less what has misled the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Alberta—that we should unitedly and resol- 
               <br />
               utely stand out for the principle that the 
               <br />
               public lands belong to the people of the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories and that we should have their actual 
               <br />
               transfer or a fair price.

               Mr. SCOTT. It is my hon. friend who 
               <br />
               admits the mistake. I suggested that 
               <br />
               we should unitedly take the position, 
               <br />
               and hold to it resolutely, that the lands 
               <br />
               were ours. and that we should get an 
               <br />
               actual transfer of them or a fair price. 
               <br />
               And in my opinion, and in that of the ma-

               said so in a public letter—we have got a

               <br />
