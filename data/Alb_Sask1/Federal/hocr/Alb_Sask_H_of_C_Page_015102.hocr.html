               the proposal that there should be provincial

               seen ﬁt to Shirk responsibility for import- 
               <br />
               ant legislation by resorting to plebiscites. 
               <br />
               That was the case in what was known as the 
               <br />
               temperance legislation of the Diminion. It 
               <br />
               was within the power of a strong govern- 
               <br />
               ment to bring about the enactment of so- 
               <br />
               called temperance legislation. And yet this 
               <br />
               government, when they had an opportunity 
               <br />
               to legislate on that subject, shrank from 
               <br />
               the task and took refuge behind the ram- 
               <br />
               parts of a so-called plebiscite. Why did 
               <br />
               not they, as they had no mandate from the 
               <br />
               people on this school question, refer the 
               <br />
               matter to a plebiscite? The reason is 
               <br />
               manifest. These hon. gentlemen knew well 
               <br />
               that they had stolen a march upon the peo- 
               <br />
               ple and were anxious for a ﬁve years to 
               <br />
               run their course after this legislation was 
               <br />
               passed with the hope that the question 
               <br />
               might meantime be forgotten.

               The Prime Minister, in introducing this 
               <br />
               Bill on February 2lst, made an address 
               <br />
               which certainly was not likely to conciliate 
               <br />
               all classes or to allay feeling. The principle 
               <br />
               feature of that address was a discussion of 
               <br />
               the utility or advantage of separate schools. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman must have known, 
               <br />
               and, judging by the forced speech he made, 
               <br />
               he did know, that he would draw upon him- 
               <br />
               self the ﬁre of those opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools in this country whether in this 
               <br />
               province or the new provinces. The right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman seems to have taken it in- 
               <br />
               to his head that there was only one way to 
               <br />
               drive this Bill through parliament, and that 
               <br />
               was by means of the bludgeon of force. 
               <br />
               Aside from the reference to separate schools, 
               <br />
               which was the prominent feature of his 
               <br />
               address, one of the startling statements 
               <br />
               made by him was that the government, 
               <br />
               in the introduction of this Bill—I refer 
               <br />
               particularly to the educational clauses— 
               <br />
               were threatened on both sides. Surely, the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman received no threats 
               <br />
               from the Conservative press. The fact is 
               <br />
               that the right hon. gentleman was threat- 
               <br />
               ened by men on his own side, and those 
               <br />
               threats have been carried into force in a 
               <br />
               very plain manner. Where is the press

               quite true that his course has not been
