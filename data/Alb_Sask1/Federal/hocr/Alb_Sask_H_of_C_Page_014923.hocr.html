               this clause emanate which has been thus

               was not the child of the Minister of Finance 
               <br />

               Now, Sir, a. word as to the changes we have 
               <br />
               made in that clause. I stated the other day 
               <br />
               that we propose to make a change and we have 
               <br />
               given notice of an amendment which we intend 
               <br />
               to move to clause 16. What is the reason of 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> ? It is a fair question to ask and 
               <br />
               a question to be answered. Sir, we have taken 
               <br />
               the ground on more than one occasion, we again 
               <br />
               take this ground, and it is the ground upon 
               <br />
               which we stand in dealing with the present 
               <br />
               case, that wherever a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools exists that system comes into force 
               <br />
               and is constitutionally entitled to the guaran~ 
               <br />
               tees which are emboided in section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. Be that system 
               <br />
               much. be it little, whatever it is, it is entitled 
               <br />
               to those guarantees. That is the position we 
               <br />
               take and when we introduce section 16, as it is 
               <br />

               Now, as you are aware, Mr. Speaker, I am

               not a lawyer, much less 'a constitutional 
               <br />

               I have common sense enough to take issue 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Justice when he says 
               <br />
               that this clause does not go one inch further 
               <br />

               <br />
               this clause goes as far as it possibly could

               go to rivet on the people of those new prov-

               tion of these ratepayers—that right is not to 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prejud‘ically</span> affected. Then they were 
               <br />
               to have the right to religious teaching in 
               <br />
               their schools from half-past three to four 
               <br />
               o’clock. Is there anything in this clause 
               <br />
               that would prevent religious teaching in 
               <br />
               those schools from 9 o’clock in the morning 
               <br />
               to 4 o‘clock in the afternoon ? I do not think 
               <br />
               so. I do not think that is within the four 
               <br />
               corners of the whole resolution. Certainly 
               <br />
               they could not prejudically affect the right. 
               <br />
               they could not limit it to a quarter of an 
               <br />
               hour in the afternoon. The power could be 
               <br />
               given, at any rate, if the Territories chose to 
               <br />
               use it, to have religious teaching from 9 
               <br />
               o’clock in the morning until 4 o’clock in the 
               <br />
               afternoon. Now how did it come about that 
               <br />
               this serious blunder has been made, that 
               <br />
               clause 16 as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">originally</span> put in the Bill found 
               <br />
               its way there instead of clause 16 of which 
               <br />
               the right hon. the First Minister has given 
               <br />
               notice to be inserted when the Bill comes 
               <br />
               before the Committee of the Whole? He 
               <br />
               says he did not authorize it, the ex~Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior tells us the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               did not draft it, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex»Minister</span> of the In- 
               <br />
               terior says he does not blame the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">drafting;</span> it. Who drafted it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1</span> 
               <br />
               Who is responsible for it '3 No member of

               the government ? Why, they say, it was the 
               <br />
               draughtsman. They will not assume re- 
               <br />
               sponsibility for it, because the country has 
               <br />
               condemned it, parliament has condemned 
               <br />
               it because their own followers would not 
               <br />
               agree to it.
