               now represented in parliament 1w four

               members. I felt, for my part, speaking

               of the matter personally. that I had

               living in a locality which was in close 
               <br />
               communication with that district, it was 
               <br />
               necessary for me to spend a considerable 
               <br />
               part of my time and energy in represent- 
               <br />
               ing the interests of the people of that dis- 
               <br />
               trict as far as I could. I certainly was 
               <br />
               under a very great disadvantage by rea- 
               <br />
               son of the fact that I had no authority. 
               <br />
               and I think that the people of that dis- 
               <br />
               trict should be represented from this time 
               <br />
               forward. The fact that they have not
