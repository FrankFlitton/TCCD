               North Toronto (Mr. Foster) and myself. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman said that the Mani- 
               <br />
               toba Remedial Bill was one of the 
               <br />
               issues, if not the principal issue, in that 
               <br />
               campaign. Now, I cannot let that state- 
               <br />
               ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> entirely unchallenged. Neces- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sarily</span> I took considerable interest in 
               <br />
               that by-election, and therefore must be 
               <br />
               supposed to know what the issues in 
               <br />
               it were, and I have this to say that not 
               <br />
               only was the Manitoba Remedial Bill and 
               <br />
               the action of the late Conservative govern- 
               <br />
               ment in reference thereto and the action 
               <br />
               of the ex—Finance Minister (Mr. Foster), 
               <br />
               then a candidate, in the some connection— 
               <br />
               not only were all these matters not prin- 
               <br />
               cipal issues but they .were not issues at all. 
               <br />
               Furthermore I do not think that the Maui- 
               <br />
               toba Remedial Bill or the Manitoba school 
               <br />
               question has been at all an issue in the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario since the general elec- 
               <br />
               tion of 1896. I am much afraid, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               that the memory of my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Leeds (Mr. Taylor) is not at all dependable: 
               <br />
               I am afraid his memory plays pranks with 
               <br />
               him. And in this fear I am rather con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed by what fell from the lips of his 
               <br />
               late leader, Sir Mackenzie Bowell. who 
               <br />
               spoke in another place on the 1st of March 
               <br />
               last. Speaking of the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Taylor) in relation to another matter then 
               <br />
               under discussion, Sir Mackenzie Bowell 
               <br />
               said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I am utterly at a loss to know or understand 
               <br />
               how Mr. Taylor could have given utterance to 
               <br />
               such a statement, unless it be that he talked 
               <br />
               it over so often with others that he ﬁnally be- 
               <br />
               lieved it himself. That is an idiosyncrasy of 
               <br />
               some people, as we know. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Well, in the best of good nature, I rather 
               <br />
               think that in his recollection of What took 
               <br />
               place in the election in North Ontario that 
               <br />
               idiosyncrasy of my hon. friend from Leeds 
               <br />
               has shown itself.

               <br />
               debate on Thursday last, made, in my judg—

               ously, how very well indeed, the Protestant '

               minority of Quebec were treated by the 
               <br />

               rather think, in fact I am strongly of

               opinion, that the hon. gentleman marred a
