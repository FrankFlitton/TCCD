               But a strange thing happened in the legis- 
               <br />
               lature of Canada. It was at the time when 
               <br />
               we had a representation from Lower Canada 
               <br />
               and a representation from Upper Canada. 
               <br />
               A similar Bill was introduced immediately 
               <br />
               for the province of Upper Canada. This was 
               <br />
               strongly resisted and so strongly was it re- 
               <br />
               sisted that the two Bills were withdrawn. 
               <br />
               Thereupon Mr. Gait resigned his position 
               <br />
               as a member of the government of the day 
               <br />
               because he had not been able to improve 
               <br />
               the situation of the minority to which he 
               <br />
               belonged by legislation before the Act of 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Protestant' minority of Quebec felt 
               <br />
               disinclined to enter confederation unless 
               <br />
               their rights were secured as they thought 
               <br />
               they ought to be secured. Mr. Galt was

               Few questions have excited a more lively in- 
               <br />
               terest in this country than the education of 
               <br />

               <br />
               be more accurate to say, the appropriation of 
               <br />
               taxation for that purpose. We need not repeat 
               <br />
               the particulars of the agitation on the subject, 
               <br />
               which commenced with the promulgation of the

               <br />
               cabinet. The short of the story is, all this led 
               <br />
               to an agreement on the part of the Canadian 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               which the public are, undoubtedly, already

               aware. That was the agreement to which we

               Well Sir, Mr. Gait was too great a man 
               <br />
               not to stipulate for other minorities that 
               <br />
               which he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stipulating</span> for the minority 
               <br />
               to which he belonged. Mr. Gait was not 
               <br />
               satisﬁed to have these guarantees under the 
               <br />
               constitution simply for the minority of 
               <br />
               Quebec, but he put them in the terms which 
               <br />
               I read a monment ago so that they could 
               <br />
               apply to any minority in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> province under 
               <br />
               any condition under which a system of 
               <br />
               separate schools exist. It is in obedience to 
               <br />
               that order of the constitution that we have 
               <br />
               inserted the clause which I read a moment 
               <br />
               ago. 
               <br />

               Now, Sir, a word as to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Changes</span> we have 
               <br />
               made in that clause. I stated the other day 
               <br />
               that we proposed to make a change and we 
               <br />
               have given notice of an amendment which 
               <br />
               we intend to move to clause 16. What is 
               <br />
               the reason of this change ? It is a fair ques- 
               <br />
               tionto ask and a question to be answered.
