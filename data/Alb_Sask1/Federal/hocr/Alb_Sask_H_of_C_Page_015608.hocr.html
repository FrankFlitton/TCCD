               <br />
               not say there is equality of population in 
               <br />
               one section and another. Here is one sec- 
               <br />
               tion which is less than 1,000 and another 
               <br />
               which is more than 1,500. When we come 
               <br />
               to discuss each case separately, we can see 
               <br />
               whether or not it is possible to make 
               <br />
               changes. Take the case of Stony Plain as 
               <br />
               an example. It is at the foot of the Rocky 
               <br />
               Mountains. The division extends to the 
               <br />
               west from the summit of the Rockies, the 
               <br />
               height of land, up to the Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               river, and it follows the Saskatchewan river. 
               <br />
               Does my hon. friend say that in order to 
               <br />
               have a larger body of population in Stony 
               <br />
               Plain, it would be advisable to cross the 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan river? Is it not preferable 
               <br />
               this river should be made the boundary? 
               <br />
               It forms a natural boundary, and my hon. 
               <br />
               friend will agree that it is better. in a large 
               <br />
               constituency of that kind, to follow the 
               <br />
               river. We must take every case by itself. 
               <br />
               Suppose this were referred to a commission 
               <br />
               of judges, could they have proceeded any 
               <br />
               differently? They would have to observe 
               <br />
               the conditions and ascertain the best way 
               <br />
               to accommodate the population to the na- 
               <br />
               tural divisions. Sometimes that is easy be- 
               <br />
               cause there are no rivers or mountains ; but 
               <br />
               when we come to section by section and di-

               vision by division. we can take each by it-

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Take again

               the county of Ottawa. It matters not 
               <br />
               whether it was divided north and south or 
               <br />
               east. and west ; it was divided because popu- 
               <br />
               lation had ﬂowed into that county which was 
               <br />
               not there when the county was organized. 
               <br />
               That is why in a new country like ours you 
               <br />
               have to vary the constituencies from time to 
               <br />
               time, because population comes in and re- 
               <br />
               presentation must be adjusted accordingly.
