               <br />
               tional matters in that part of the country. 
               <br />
               Naturally we watched events with a very 
               <br />
               great deal of interest indeed, and I have 
               <br />
               been almost amused at the reasons ad- 
               <br />
               vanced by many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative</span> speakers for 
               <br />
               that resignation; reasons which showed a 
               <br />
               very great versatility of imagination. We 
               <br />
               were even told by these gentlemen that the 
               <br />
               whole matter of the resignation and of his 
               <br />
               ultimate support of the Bill was prear- 
               <br />
               ranged for eﬁ’ect. I cannot conceive that 
               <br />
               this could possibly have been the case, but 
               <br />
               it did strike me that if these gentlemen had 
               <br />
               said that the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton), who very naturally was interested 
               <br />
               in that country and who had done much to 
               <br />
               encourage large immigration into it, had 
               <br />
               taken the course he did with the object of 
               <br />
               advertising that country, these gentlemen 
               <br />
               might have been using their imagination 
               <br />
               very freely, but they would have recognized 
               <br />
               at all events the result that has actually 
               <br />
               occurred. One thing at least has come out 
               <br />
               of this unfortunate trouble and that is, that 
               <br />
               these new provinces have had a more mag— 
               <br />
               niﬁcent series of advertisements than any 
               <br />
               part of Canada has ever had before. Every 
               <br />
               hon. member who has spoken has dwelt on 
               <br />
               the magniﬁcent resources of that territory, 
               <br />
               its scope for development and progress, and 
               <br />
               out of our tribulation has resulted this good. 
               <br />
               'that the minds and thoughts of all people 
               <br />
               will be directed towards the development 
               <br />
               of this rich portion of our heritage. But, 
               <br />
               Sir. while the resignation of the minister 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) caused us anxiety We still were 
               <br />
               in hopes that some means would be found 
               <br />
               by which the apparent divergent interests 
               <br />
               would come together. I do not say that we 
               <br />
               felt that the decision on this question must 
               <br />
               stand between the ex-minister and the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and that we must not think for 
               <br />
               ourselves. but it was very natural that we 
               <br />
               should consider that the minister (Mr. Sif- 
               <br />
               toni represented very largely one view, and 
               <br />
               that the government represented the other. 
               <br />
               And so. Sir, we waited for the outcome. 
               <br />
               At that time I presume the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not-stand</span> alone. but that 
               <br />
               there were many other Liberals who felt 
               <br />
               more or less doubtful about the Bill, or 
               <br />
               possibly who were not sure as to the ex- 
               <br />
               tent to which it went in giving privileges 
               <br />
               to the minority. I may say that at that 
               <br />
               time in whatever opposition I myself felt 
               <br />
               towards the Bill I did not feel so much 
               <br />
               alone among the Liberal members as I do 
               <br />
               to-night. My misfortune is that in the 
               <br />
               changes that have been made the govern- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">err-Minister</span> of the Interior and has over- 
               <br />

               various speeches of members from the

               Northwest with regard to the character 
               <br />
               of the schools. I will not take up the time 
               <br />
               of the House in reading extracts from their 
               <br />
               speeches, although I had thought of doing 
               <br />
               so, but you will all agree with me that 
               <br />
               their speeches as a rule pointed out how 
               <br />
               almost completely national these schools 
               <br />
               were and how exceedingly limited was the 
               <br />
               time devoted to religious training, or, if I 
               <br />
               may put it in another way, how exceedingly ' 
               <br />
               small were the privileges granted to the 
               <br />
               minority. I am not exaggerating when I 
               <br />
               say that this was the gen‘eral colouring of 
               <br />
               the speeches delivered along that line, and 
               <br />
               indeed I may say that from the evidence 
               <br />
               presented it does appear to me that they 
               <br />
               are very largely national schools, and that 
               <br />
               the amount of religious teaching that is 
               <br />
               available in the last half hour is not very 
               <br />
               great. As I listened to very many of these 
               <br />
               speeches I could not but think again of my 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic friend, of whom I have 
               <br />
               already spoken, and Whether after all it 
               <br />
               was not the shadow rather than the sub- 
               <br />
               stance which the Roman Catholics were get- 
               <br />
               ting. I Would rather think that the claim 
               <br />
               in support of this Bill should be based, as 
               <br />
               it is based of course in part, on the actual 
               <br />
               justice of the case rather <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Chan</span> on the 
               <br />
               small amount of the privilege given. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01</span> 
               <br />
               course I realize that one must take some 
               <br />
               of these speeches with a proper degree of 
               <br />
               care. We know that in all bargains, if you 
               <br />
               listen to the conversation, you will think 
               <br />
               that the man who is buying is not getting 
               <br />
               very much, and yet he eventually buys. So 
               <br />
               it is like that in this case. as in the case 
               <br />
               spoken of in the good book in which we 
               <br />
               read of the bargainer: it is naught; it is 
               <br />
               naught saith the buyer and when he goeth 
               <br />
               his way he boasteth. And so I am afraid 
               <br />
               that in this case the parties on the one side 
               <br />
               speak to a certain audience and the parties 
               <br />
               on the other side speak to another audience. 
               <br />
               But if the settlement itself is good that 
               <br />
               would be satisfactory. and if the people 
               <br />
               who make the settlement have the right to 
               <br />
               do so that would be also satisfactory. The 
               <br />
               more the hon. gentlemen minimize the privi- 
               <br />
               leges that are given to the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               minority in these schools. the loss interest 
               <br />
               would there appear to he to take any risk 
               <br />
               with regard to the constitutionality of the 
               <br />
               proceeding. Personally I have no desire to 
               <br />
               accept the present Bill just because it gives 
               <br />
               little to the Roman Catholic minority. If 
               <br />
               the present arrangement is a compromise 
               <br />
               which giVes justice that would be well. for 
               <br />
               a compromise is not necessarily wrong so 
               <br />
               long as it is not an actual compromise of 
               <br />
               principle. However. it is necessary that the 
               <br />
               proper people should enter into a com-

               <br />
               necessary. In this case we do not positive- 
               <br />
               ly know that this Bill is acceptable to all.
