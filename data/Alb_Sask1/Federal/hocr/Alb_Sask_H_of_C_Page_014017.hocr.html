               There is another consideration. For my 
               <br />
               part, I am prepared to give a full hear- 
               <br />
               ing to the province of Manitoba. When 
               <br />
               that province asks to have her limits ex- 
               <br />
               tended westward, I am bound to say that 
               <br />
               We cannot entertain that prayer, for this 
               <br />
               simple reason, that the Territories, through 
               <br />
               their legislature, have passed upon it and 
               <br />
               have pronounced against it. But I under- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               stand that as to a certain portion of terri- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span>

               tory north of Lake Winnipegosis and Lake

               Manitoba, the Northwest legislature has de- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">",</span> 
               <br />
               clared that it has no pronounced views, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i</span> 
               <br />
               that that might be given to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. But even this I am not prepared 
               <br />
               for my part to grant at this moment; be- 
               <br />
               cause members representing that section 
               <br />
               to-day sit on the ﬂoor of this House, and 
               <br />
               they and their people have the right to be 
               <br />
               heard on that question;land if they do not 
               <br />
               agree to it, I do not think the parliament 
               <br />
               of Canada should make the grant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span>
