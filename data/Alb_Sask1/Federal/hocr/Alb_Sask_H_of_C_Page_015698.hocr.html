               <br />

               <br />
               his calculation, he no doubt included the 
               <br />
               vote cast in the province of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> is now. The same remark applies to 
               <br />
               the constituency of Calgary. It also runs 
               <br />
               east of the 4th meridian; but in that por- 
               <br />
               tion of the constituency east of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4th</span> 
               <br />
               meridian there was no poll held at the 
               <br />
               polling subdivision there, whilst at the poll 
               <br />
               held at Lloydminister a very considerable 
               <br />
               vote was cast, as there also was in that 
               <br />
               portion of the constituency of Edmonton 
               <br />
               which now is to the east of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4th</span> meridian. 
               <br />
               While I have not taken this into considera- 
               <br />
               tion, it will be seen from it that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta.</span>

               Medicine Hat and Calgary contain 14,687, 
               <br />
               and Strathcona and Edmonton 15,263. If 
               <br />
               you would take these other matters into 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. I would ask what greater 
               <br />
               right the hon. member has to ﬁx the 38th 
               <br />
               line of townships than I have to ﬁx the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3-1th</span> 
               <br />
               line of townships? Why ﬁx an arbitrary 
               <br />
               dividing line between the south and the 
               <br />
               north of this province ‘2 Or if that is to be 
               <br />
               done, why not trace a line through the centre 
               <br />
               of the province '2 If we would do that, we 
               <br />
               would ﬁnd that practically the whole of 
               <br />

               Mr. HERRON. One good reason why 
               <br />
               the capital should not be placed at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Edinoxr</span> 
               <br />
               ton is that at present the population does 
               <br />
               not extend a great distance north of that 
               <br />
               place. It extends south to the boundary. 
               <br />
               about 350 miles by the most direct way of 
               <br />
               travel. One travelling from the Crow’s 
               <br />
               Nest Pass, for instance, would have to make 
               <br />
               a three-day's journey by rail. The journey 
               <br />
               from Cardston by rail would be about as 
               <br />
               long. If the capital were ﬁxed at Calgary 
               <br />
               it would be the most convenient point for all 
               <br />
               parts of the province. The people of the 
               <br />
               southern country certainly protest against 
               <br />
               having the capital placed at Edmonton.
