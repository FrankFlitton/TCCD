               tical arguments delivered in the course of 
               <br />
               political speeches and not possibly evi-

               dencing as much care as had been recently 
               <br />
               given this question. We have likewise opi-

               nions from very able men indeed at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time. The Prime Minister of this coun- 
               <br />
               try no doubt thinks that the Dominion par- 
               <br />
               liament has the power, under this section of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1871. and 
               <br />
               should exercise it, or he would not have sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to us the measure we are now con-‘ 
               <br />
               sidering. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) thinks also the Dominion has 
               <br />
               the power, but he prefers that we should 
               <br />
               not use it. He thinks it should be left to 
               <br />
               the new provinces; and he suggests that. 
               <br />
               in the event of our using it. it would be well 
               <br />
               to get a con-ﬁrming Act. The hon. member 
               <br />
               for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) thinks this 
               <br />
               parliament has only the power to create a 
               <br />
               province or call it into existence and to 
               <br />
               enact all the necessary details in that con- 
               <br />
               nection, and that after our powers in that 
               <br />
               respect are fully exercised, the province 
               <br />
               comes automatically under the control, of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1867. We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd further that that very able lawyer, Mr. 
               <br />
               Christopher Robinson, is doubtful whether 
               <br />
               the Dominion has the power. We ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition saying that we have 
               <br />
               no constitutional authority to pass the edu- 
               <br />
               cational clauses. All these conclusions are 
               <br />
               arrived at from consideration of the same 
               <br />
               clause, and no doubt all these men have 
               <br />
               conscientiously come to these different con- 
               <br />
               clusions through a desire to arrive at what 
               <br />
               is true and correct in the case. If that be 
               <br />
               so, it necessarily causes some anxiety to 
               <br />
               one who approaches the question for him- 
               <br />
               self. I have watched with some interest
