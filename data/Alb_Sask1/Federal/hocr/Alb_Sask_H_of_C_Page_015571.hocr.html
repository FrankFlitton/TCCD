               own mind on this matter, I have taken this

               line of township 38 not because I know the

               <br />
               out from the population—that is the votes

               <br />

               <br />
               that would be 56 per cent of the whole 
               <br />
               and the percentage of the north would be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4-1.</span> The hon. minister stated yesterday 
               <br />
               that the number of votes cast taken as the 
               <br />
               basis for each constituency would ﬁgure 
               <br />
               about 800. To clear up the discussion 
               <br />
               somewhat, I may say that, after look- 
               <br />
               ing into the details, I am quite sat- 
               <br />
               isﬁed that the ﬁgures as provided by 
               <br />
               the government and as submitted by 
               <br />
               the hon. mehiber for Calgary are practi- 
               <br />
               cally the same—in working out, the percen- 
               <br />
               tage of difference is so small as to be of no 
               <br />
               importance. In my calculations, I have 
               <br />
               adopted the ﬁgures of the government. 
               <br />
               It makes no difference In the number of 
               <br />
               members north and south which ﬁgures are 
               <br />
               used. Yesterday, the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior stated there would be 11,406 votes cast 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twelve.proposed</span> southern constit- 
               <br />
               uencies—I think that they should be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11.410.</span> and that ‘Hansard’ is mistaken 
               <br />
               ——and 9,553 in the eleven northern 
               <br />
               constituencies. The trouble with the ﬁg- 
               <br />
               ures. and the reason why there seems 
               <br />
               to be a difference in the argument on either 
               <br />
               side. is that the two proposed constituencies 
               <br />
               in Athabaska are left out of the calculation. 
               <br />
               The minister says there are 12 constituencies 
               <br />
               in the south with 11.410 votes and 11in the 
               <br />
               north with 9,553 votes. As a matter of fact, 
               <br />
               there are 13 in the north with 9,553 votes 
               <br />
               cast in the last election. There are a few 
               <br />
               other people in Athabaska, but they are so 
               <br />
               few as I shall show before I get through— 
               <br />
               as to make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">practically</span> no difference. That 
               <br />
               makes a total of “20.963. out of which the

               <br />
               township the number was 12 863. This made 
               <br />

               the number south 57 per cent, and my idea

               is that the number of seats north should be 
               <br />

               the subject. I wish to refer to a few ﬁgures 
               <br />
               given to-day by the right hon. the First Min- 
               <br />
               ister. In his calculation to-day he left out 
               <br />
               the constituency of Red Deer. He said 
               <br />
               there was north of Red Deer eleven consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies with 9,533 votes cast at the last

               election. and that south of Red Deer there 
               <br />
               were eleven with 10,566 votes cast. The

               ﬁgures are quite accurate as far as I am
