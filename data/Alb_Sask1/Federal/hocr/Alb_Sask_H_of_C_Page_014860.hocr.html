               I think I have given ample proof of the 
               <br />
               great prosperity of that western country; 
               <br />
               and that prosperity has come because of the 
               <br />
               sound national policy and railway policy of 
               <br />
               the late Conservative government. There is 
               <br />
               nothing that I believe more strongly. i 
               <br />
               believe that, as the saying is, right down to 
               <br />
               the hilt, while at the same time I am willing 
               <br />
               to give hon. gentlemen opposite credit for 
               <br />
               all they have done. I give them credit for 
               <br />
               what they have done to promote immigra- 
               <br />

               <br />
               language which they formerly used. It was 
               <br />
               after the Conservative government had 
               <br />
               opened up the country and had secured low

               freight rates, that this government were able 
               <br />
               to bring in immigrants, because low freight 
               <br />

               I have heard here a great deal about

               Speaker, I have heard more about Protes- 
               <br />
               tants, Orangemen, Roman Catholics and the 
               <br />
               hierarchy during the short time that I have 
               <br />
               been in this parliament than I ever heard in 
               <br />
               my life before. This is not to me a matter 
               <br />
               of Roman Catholics. I am glad and proud 
               <br />
               to say that my best friends and some of my 
               <br />
               warmest supporters, in the town in which I 
               <br />
               live. are Roman Catholics. And I want to 
               <br />
               say further that in the town in which I live, 
               <br />
               the town of Boissevain, we have six schools 
               <br />
               and a number of Catholics. My best and 
               <br />
               warmest political, and I may say business 
               <br />
               friend is a Roman Catholic. Perhaps 'in 
               <br />
               mentioning this; I am indulging in senti- 
               <br />
               ment. but the right hon. First Minister 
               <br />
               spoke. of sentiment in introducing this 
               <br />
               measure. and there is no doubt sentiment is 
               <br />
               a great force. Well, his little girl and mine 
               <br />
               played together, they went to school to— 
               <br />
               gether, they had their parties together, 
               <br />
               and I do not believe that they knew which 
               <br />
               one is Protestant and which one is Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic. Yet for all that each one was true 
               <br />
               to her church. Now, I believe that that is 
               <br />
               the kind of thing a national school builds 
               <br />
               11p. I am prepared to go a good deal further 
               <br />
               perhaps than many in this House. I go a 
               <br />
               long way in favour of separation between 
               <br />
               church and state. I say there should be 
               <br />
               absolutely no connection between the two. I

               of existing conditions of the east and the

               the warmest and best feelings towards them

               thing about the matter myself, but will give

               you their words. Coming back to the school

               question, the word ‘constitution’ has been 
               <br />
               a familiar word to this House the past week 
               <br />
               or two. I suppose to be loyal we must res- 
               <br />
               pect the constitution; and if the constitution 
               <br />
               says we must have two systems of schools 
               <br />
               in the Northwest we must abide by it. But 
               <br />
               lawyers disagree as well as doctors, and

               know yet what the constitution says on 
               <br />
               this question. I do not know yet what
