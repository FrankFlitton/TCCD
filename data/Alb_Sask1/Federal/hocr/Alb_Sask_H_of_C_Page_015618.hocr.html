               <br />

               much fault to ﬁnd, although I am satisﬁed

               that if the ﬁve were made into two ridings

               as there being an imaginary line north and 
               <br />
               south from Red Deer I care nothing about

               that. What have we to do with where the

               capital should be, let them ﬁx that as they 
               <br />
               like. So far as I am personally concerned I 
               <br />
               think Edmonton is central and is the proper 
               <br />

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Where did you 
               <br />
               get them ?

               Mr. SAM. HUGHES. From the returns of 
               <br />
               your own land inspectors throughout that 
               <br />
               country and from my own personal observa- 
               <br />
               tion as well. I can tell the First Minister 
               <br />
               further that these northern constituencies 
               <br />
               are not divided properly. Why is Strathcona 
               <br />
               cut short of Beaver Hills Lake ; why are the 
               <br />
               settlers to the west side of Beaver Hills Lake 
               <br />
               not thrown in with Strathcona where they 
               <br />
               naturally belong ? However, that is a detail. 
               <br />
               I have given the latest ﬁgures obtainable 
               <br />
               and they tally fairly well with the First 
               <br />
               Minister’s own ﬁgures in that respect. As to 
               <br />
               the census ﬁgures I can get them from the 
               <br />
               Minister of Agriculture, and even they are 
               <br />
               not correct. Why, down here in the county 
               <br />
