               be as well versed as they are in the regu- 
               <br />
               lations governing these schools, but during 
               <br />
               this debate we have learned a great deal 
               <br />
               and we have had circulated amongst us 
               <br />
               a synopsis of the school ordinances of the 
               <br />
               Northwest, so that we are more or less famil- 
               <br />
               iar with the subject. I believe myself that 
               <br />
               these schools are well adapted for the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories and I think that if 
               <br />
               the new provinces re-enact these they would 
               <br />
               be. doing a wise thing, but I do not believe, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir,</span> that this parliament has the constitution- 
               <br />
               al right to force a school system on the new 
               <br />
               provinces. While we may not have a full 
               <br />
               knowledge of the educational laws of the 
               <br />
               Territories, we perhaps have a better idea 
               <br />
               of what separate schools are than these 
               <br />
               members from the Northwest on the other 
               <br />
               side of the House have, and in this con- 
               <br />
               nection, I direct their attention to the his- 
               <br />
               tory of separate schools in Ontario, particu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larly</span> for the last sixty years. We have 
               <br />
               been told by the Minister of Finance and 
               <br />
               by some of his colleagues, that the edu- 
               <br />
               action-a] clauses in this Bill will be a ﬁnal 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settlement</span> of the question for all time to 
               <br />
               come. Upon what authority do these gentle- 
               <br />
               men make the statement that this will be 
               <br />
               a ﬁnal settlement ? Who is there in this 
               <br />
               House or out of it Who can say that 
               <br />
               henceforth and for ever there will be no C0111-

               plaint with regard to educational matters 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories if these two 
               <br />
               small clauses are incorporated in the Bill ‘!
