               Mr. INGRAM. This is a very important 
               <br />
               matter, and a very simple one, if we are to 
               <br />
               believe the hon. Minister of Agriculture 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fisher), who told us that the explana- 
               <br />
               tionI was so easy and plain that the way- 
               <br />
               faring man rthough a fool might understand 
               <br />
               it. I am sorry that the Minister of Agri- 
               <br />
               culture is not in his place to-day, so that 
               <br />
               we could get that very simple explanation. 
               <br />
               And yet we have the speech of the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior circulated broadcast 
               <br />
               among the clergymen of this country who 
               <br />
               do not believe in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">class</span> of legislation, 
               <br />
               telling them that there is nothing in this 
               <br />
               Bill except provision for half an hour’s reli- 
               <br />
               gious teaching in the schools. I say there 
               <br />
               is something more than that in this Bill, or 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice and the government 
               <br />
               would have given the explanation long be- 
               <br />
               fore this. It is quite evident that the mem- 
               <br />
               bers from the west have received an expla- 
               <br />
               nation of this legislation, while this side of 
               <br />
               the House and the country generally are 
               <br />
               being treated in the most contemptible man— 
               <br />
               ner in respect to section 16 and the amend- 
               <br />
               ed section. as well as section 2. I think it 
               <br />
               is triﬂing with the House to have this mat- 
               <br />
               ter delayed from day to day. A number of 
               <br />
               the members supporting the government are 
               <br />
               circulating the opinion that there is nothing 
               <br />
               in this Bill of any importance with respect 
               <br />
               to a change in educational and religious 
               <br />
               matters. They are trying to allay public 
               <br />
               feeling, and in order to do this, supporters 
               <br />
               of the government are going back to their 
               <br />
               constituents and telling them that there 
               <br />
               is nothing in the Bill. I say there is some- 
               <br />
               thing in this Bill and a great deal more than 
               <br />
