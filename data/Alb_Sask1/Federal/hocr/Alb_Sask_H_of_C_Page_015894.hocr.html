               adhered to, and this distribution does not 
               <br />
               adhere to it. In the old legislative assembly, 
               <br />
               in so far as concerns the present proposed 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan, there were two 
               <br />
               distinct legal divisions, there was the pro- 
               <br />
               visional district of Saskatchewan in the 
               <br />
               north and that of Assinibola in the south. 
               <br />
               Those two divisions have been recognized 
               <br />
               in all distributions of representation from 
               <br />
               the beginning up to the present time and 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that to a certain extent they have 
               <br />
               been recognized in the schedules which have 
               <br />
               been placed before us. All the seats with 
               <br />
               the exception of three are completely in 
               <br />
               either the northern district or the southern 
               <br />
               district. In three cases the seats, while 
               <br />
               properly belonging to the north, have been 
               <br />
               run into the south and take in a consid- 
               <br />
               erable slice of the southern districts. I 
               <br />
               intend to show that it is proposed to give 
               <br />
               a far larger representation to the northern 
               <br />
               parts of the province than it is entitled to, 
               <br />
               and a far smaller share of representation 
               <br />
               to the southern part of the province than 
               <br />
               it is entitled to. For that purpose I will 
               <br />
               take the old division as between the provis- 
               <br />
               ional district of Saskatchewan, which I 
               <br />
               shall call the northern portion, and of Assin- 
               <br />
               iboia, which I shall call the southern portion. 
               <br />
               This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Bill,</span> roughly speaking, gives nine seats 
               <br />
               to the north and sixteen seats to the south.

               I stated yesterday at the opening of the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion that we took as the basis of the distri- 
               <br />
               bution which we made, the condition of things 
               <br />
               existing at the present time, the number of 
               <br />
               seats assigned to the province of Alberta in 
               <br />
               the present legislature of the Territory, which 
               <br />
               amounts to 16. First of all we had to increase 
               <br />
               that by 10, we had to give to Alberta 10 more 
               <br />
               seats than there are to-day in the legis- 
               <br />
               lature of the Northwest Territories within 
               <br />
               the limits of Alberta. How are we to come 
               <br />
               to that conclusion? We come to that con- 
               <br />
               clusion upon information derived from three 
               <br />
               sources which we submit to the House to be 
               <br />
               challenged. We take ﬁrst the number of votes 
               <br />
               recorded. We do not say to the House that 
               <br />
               this is the only thing we should take into 
               <br />
               consideration ; we say that is one thing which 
               <br />
               ought to be taken into consideration but not 
               <br />
               alone. We take next the number of votes re- 
               <br />
               gistered ; we do not say that is the only thing 
               <br />
               to be taken, that is only one of many things 
               <br />
               on which we should form our judgment. Then 
               <br />
               we take the census of 1901. That is the best 
               <br />
               thing of all. If we had a census for 1905 we 
               <br />
               would not have to consider the number of re- 
               <br />
               corded votes nor the number <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.0:</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">registered'</span> 
               <br />
               votes, nor the number of post ofﬁces, school 
               <br />
               districts or improvement districts ; we would 
               <br />
               take only the census for 1905. But we have no 
               <br />
               census of 1905 and therefore we have to make 
               <br />
               up our minds as to what is the actual popula- 
               <br />
               tion at the present time. We know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the 
               <br />
               population at the present time is double what 
               <br />
               it was in 1901, and we have to make our calcu- 
               <br />
               lation accordingly. But though the population
