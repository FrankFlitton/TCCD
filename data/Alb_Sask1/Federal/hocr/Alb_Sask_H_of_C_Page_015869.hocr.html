               <br />
               world to-day. The history of every country 
               <br />
               in the world is a history of change, to 
               <br />
               suit changed conditions. France is an 
               <br />
               illustration of it. Spain is an illustration 
               <br />
               of it. The hon. gentleman referred to Al- 
               <br />
               sace <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> Lorraine. A gentleman who tra- 
               <br />
               velled in those provinces told me last year 
               <br />
               that when they were taken over by Ger~ 
               <br />
               many, nearly everybody there spoke French. 
               <br />
               but that you would be surprised to-day to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd nearly everybody <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Germany,</span> and 
               <br />
               the strange thing is that there is no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com»</span> 
               <br />
               plaint about it. although the change was 
               <br />
               compulsory. I do not go so far as that, 
               <br />
               because I think we ought to be more gen- 
               <br />
               erous; but in that case, though the change 
               <br />
               was made by law, no great hardship has re- 
               <br />
               sulted. Nor will it be so in the Northwest

               My hon. friend from Jacques Cartier said,

               why shall we not be allowed to speak our 
               <br />

               <br />
               that the hon. gentleman was half Scotch 
               <br />

               half English and half French; what would

               I am told that in Glengarry there were a

               lot of Scotchmen who married into the 
               <br />
               French Canadian race; which language 
               <br />
               would be the mother tongue of their child—

               <br />

               We need not trouble ourselves with it at

               deprive people of the right to speak their

               like. I was interested in one statement 
               <br />
               that was made by the Solicitor General. He 
               <br />
               said. why are you demanding this privi-

               <br />
