               in regard to the important features of the

               Bill. This memorandum was placed in the

               possession of my colleagues so that they had 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of my suggestions, as also had 
               <br />

               <br />
               arose during the discussions which took 
               <br />
               place from time to time while I was absent. 
               <br />
               I gave my advice to the best of my ability. 
               <br />
               And I may say, so far as that is concerned, 
               <br />
               that in the main, other than as refers to the 
               <br />
               question of education, and although there 
               <br />
               are some variations of detail—in the main. 
               <br />
               1 say, and substantially, the Bill I recom— 
               <br />
               mended to my late colleagues ,is the Bill 
               <br />
               which has been introduced. There are some 
               <br />
               matters of detail respecting which difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties arose, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> decisions were 
               <br />
               arrived at in the course of the discussions 
               <br />
               which took place with the representatives 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories. These were 
               <br />
               inevitable. But, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">substantially</span> the provisions 
               <br />
               of the Bill are in accordance with the views 
               <br />
               I had formed in the course of my admini-

               stration of that country.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               So far as the question of the number of 
               <br />
               provinces is concerned, I formed the opinion 
               <br />
               which, I think, will be shared by almost 
               <br />
               every person on careful investigation of the 
               <br />
               case, that it was not desirable that this vast 
               <br />
               territory should be formed into one province. 
               <br />
               Certainly it was not desirable to carry out 
               <br />
               the old idea which prevailed that there were 
               <br />
               to be four provinces. I think the best opin- 
               <br />
               ion of the House will be met by the decision 
               <br />
               which the government has reached, that the 
               <br />
               medium course should be taken, and, that in- 
               <br />
               stead of one or tour, we should have two 
               <br />
               provinces. Not only is the question of area 
               <br />
               to be considered as was shown by the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister in his remarks in introducing the 
               <br />
               Bill, but you must consider also the even 
               <br />
               more important question of population. The 
               <br />
               population of this one province, if this terri— 
               <br />
               tory were made into one province, would 
               <br />
               eventually have such a preponderance 
               <br />
               as compared with the other provinces 
               <br />
               that it could not be said to be wise 
               <br />
               to make such an arrangement. These 
               <br />
               provinces are composed of territories 
               <br />
               which, almost acre for acre, is arable land 
               <br />
               and capable of sustaining population. No 
               <br />
               other provinces in the Dominion can be 
               <br />
               similarly described. And to make one pro- 
               <br />
               vince of that particular territory whose cap- 
               <br />
               acity for sustaining population is, on the 
               <br />
               average, so much greater than that of any 
               <br />

               the other provinces, would certainly and 
               <br />
               obviously be unwise. Other considerations 
               <br />
               supported the same conclusion. The western 
               <br />
               and eastern portions of this territory <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lend</span> 
               <br />
               themselves to different industrial conditions.

               <br />

               <br />
               north, towards Edmonton, we have what is 
               <br />
               known as a mixed-farming district. Diifer- 
               <br />
               ent classes of local legislation will be needed, 
               <br />
               and different conditions must be recognized 
               <br />
               in the two portions of the territory. Every- 
               <br />
               body who knows the conditions of that ter- 
               <br />
               ritory will be satisﬁed that the best results 
               <br />
               will result from having two local govern- 
               <br />
               ments and two legislatures. Each of these 
               <br />
               legislatures and each of these adminis- 
               <br />

               ritory which is committed to its charge. And 
               <br />
               this parliament may be satisﬁed, I think, 
               <br />
               that that arrangement which is suggested

               While on the question of boundaries, I

               may say, having reference, for a moment, to 
               <br />
               a statement made by Mr. Haultain in an 
               <br />
               open letter addressed to the Prime Minister, 
               <br />
               that I also suggested, and it was my idea, 
               <br />
               that the dividing line between the two new 
               <br />
               provinces should be about sixty miles fur- 
               <br />
               ther east than that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> is provided for by 
               <br />
               the Bill. It was in the discussions which

               took place with the government that the 
               <br />
               present arrangement was arrived at. I have

               not heard the reasons which have led to this

               conclusion but I have no doubt that the 
               <br />
               conclusion thus arrived at after careful con- 
               <br />
               sideration, will be found upon the whole to

               <br />
               gest, perhaps more for the future consider- 
               <br />
               ation of the House than for present con- 
               <br />
               sideration, that there should be some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">differ-</span> 
               <br />
               ent principle adopted. I see no reason why 
               <br />
               these provinces should not extend to the 
               <br />
               northern boundary of the mainland of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. The experience which I have had in 
               <br />
               the Department of the Interior has led me 
               <br />
               irresistibly to the conclusion that just so 
               <br />
               soon as it is possible to do so, the federal 
               <br />
               government should divest itself of the local 
               <br />
               administration of distant territory: and 
               <br />
               therefore I see no reason why, in so far as the 
               <br />
               administration of these Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories come within the scope of provincial 
               <br />
               legislation, that their administration should 
               <br />
               not be carried on by the local legislatures 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we are to establish. That however is 
               <br />
               not an insuperable objection. The Terri- 
               <br />
               tories of course still remain the property of 
               <br />
