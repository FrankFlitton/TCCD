               <br />
               look up the history of these people who are 
               <br />
               charged with religious zealotism, you will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the crime in the United States does 
               <br />
               not rest at their door, but at the door of the 
               <br />
               foreign element coming to the United States 
               <br />
               and from countries where there were no 
               <br />
               public schools either. Not only is that 
               <br />
               the case, but the crime is due largely to the 
               <br />
               civil conditions and the race complications 
               <br />
               that exist in the southern states. When 
               <br />
               the northern ﬂag was unfolded over the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south,</span> the puplic school was instituted. Pre— 
               <br />
               vious to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.civil</span> war the south had the 
               <br />
               advantage in higher schools and colleges 
               <br />
               because the planters were wealthy and they 
               <br />
               wanted to educate their sons and daughters, 
               <br />
               but the common school was neglected and 
               <br />
               not until the northern army was victorious 
               <br />
               was the public school system established in 
               <br />
               the southern states. I think that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman made a mistake in charg- 
               <br />
               ing against the public school system of 
               <br />
               the United States. the crime which exists 
               <br />
               in that country to a greater extent than 
               <br />
               in Canada. But the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               forgot another fact. To hear him speak 
               <br />
               you would think that there was not a reli- 
               <br />
               gious school in the United States. That 
               <br />
               is not so. So far back as 1846 the brothers 
               <br />
               of the Christian schools—a branch of the 
               <br />
               order in Ireland, I believe, which controls 
               <br />
               most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eifective</span> schools—the brothers of the 
               <br />
               Christian schools were sent to the United 
               <br />
               states and established themselves in the 
               <br />
               city- of Baltimore. In 1848 they came to 
               <br />
               New York. in 1852 they went to St. Louis 
               <br />
               and to-day there are 35,000 pupils _attend-

               friends. In 1896 the bishops felt they
