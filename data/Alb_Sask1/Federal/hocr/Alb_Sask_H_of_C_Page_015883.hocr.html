               be considerably inﬂuenced by his argument. 
               <br />
               But when a member speaks in French,

               part to seek to use any language by which

               would appeal to every worthy sentiment of 
               <br />
               the French people that their language should 
               <br />
               be recognized as an ofﬁcial one. So it would

               appeal in like manner to the Germans that

               their language should be similarly recog-

               <br />
               to do that, and I say that the English 
               <br />
               language is a peculiar one. The English 
               <br />

               and construction—I might almost say of

               recent manufacture. It bears scarcely any

               resemblance to the old English of a few 
               <br />
               centuries ago. It is a composite language. 
               <br />
               drawn from many sources, contributed to 
               <br />
               largely by the French. and made richer. 
               <br />
               fuller and more expressive by that which is 
               <br />
               contributed to it from the beautiful langu- 
               <br />
               age of the land across the channel. I say 
               <br />
               that the English language of to-day is a 
               <br />
               composite and a commercial language. and 
               <br />
               we do not appeal to the sentiment of the 
               <br />
               English people when we use it. There neVer 
               <br />
               was a day in the history of Canada when 
               <br />
               the French language was being studied by 
               <br />
               so large a number of the children of the 
               <br />
               British Canadian people as the present. and 
               <br />
               the use, the study. the knowledge of the 
               <br />
               French language will not be increased to any

               <br />
               couraged by the refusal to so recognize it. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from Labelle has said that 
               <br />
               some people may make some unpleasant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re‘</span> 
               <br />
               ference to the fact that the British conquered 
               <br />
               Canada in recent years. I have never 
               <br />
               heard any one make any such reference; 
               <br />
               but should any such reference be made, it 
               <br />
               could be easily replied that away back in 
               <br />
               the eleventh century French soldiers crossed 
               <br />
               the channel and conquered Britain; and I 
               <br />
               believe that the conquest in 1066 the in- 
               <br />
               fusion of French blood into British veins, 
               <br />
               consequent upon that French invasion, has 
               <br />
               made the people of the British islands a 
               <br />
               better people than they would be without 
               <br />
               it. And I believe that the time will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">come,</span> 
               <br />
               in a more or less distant future. when we
