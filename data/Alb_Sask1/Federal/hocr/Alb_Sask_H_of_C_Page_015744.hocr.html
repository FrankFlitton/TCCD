               Respect also federal autonomy which was 
               <br />
               enacted by section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act which provides for the imposi-

               <br />
               understood and clearly laid down. It is 
               <br />
               said that if we adopt the amendment there 
               <br />
               will be so little to claim for Catholics that

               lots of litigation we must go back on our

               principle laid down by the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               as the only basis of legislation, it is to take 
               <br />
               a position which I do not think will ever 
               <br />
               result in the creation of a broad spirit in 
               <br />

               Now, I may say that the opinion I have 
               <br />
               of this amendment is that it was framed in 
               <br />
               a moment of panic and scare and that the 
               <br />
               very wording of it is proof of that fact. 
               <br />
               Here is a sovereign parliament that has re- 
               <br />
               ceived, in the very words of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, under the Imperial Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               full power to deal with this question. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Justice did not admit 
               <br />
               any restriction on the powers of this 
               <br />
               parliament. Here is a sovereign par- 
               <br />
               liament which has the jurisdiction to 
               <br />
               pass legislation. We borrow on the 
               <br />
               one hand an imperial document, we take on 
               <br />
               the other hand a territorial document which 
               <br />
               is ultra vires, we join them together and 
               <br />
               say : We have nothing to do with this law. 
               <br />
               We renounce our sovereignty and because of 
               <br />
               our respect for provincial rights we adopt 
               <br />
               as the basic law of the new provinces the 
               <br />
               Northwest ordinance which we acknowledge 
               <br />
               to be against our own legislation. It is ultra 
               <br />
               vires. We make it intra vires; it is against 
               <br />
               all the moral pledges which are binding on 
               <br />
               us. and in the execution of these pledges we 
               <br />
               enact this legislation which breaks these 
               <br />
               pledges. I confess that the position taken 
               <br />
               by the government is completely incompre- 
               <br />
               hensible to me from a constitutional point 
               <br />
               of view and from a political point of view. 
               <br />
               I do not see what can be gained either for 
               <br />
               the future of this country or for the advant- 
               <br />
               age of the Liberal party, or for the advant- 
               <br />
               age of the country at large. Sir, to my 
               <br />
               mind, we had only one thing to do. we had 
               <br />
               only to stand, as the Prime Minister said 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time, upon the basis that had been 
               <br />
               made for us in the ﬁrst place, on the consti- 
               <br />
               tution as it was laid down by those who 
               <br />
               opened up the Northwest Territories to 
               <br />
               civilization. The law of 1875 was the only 
               <br />
               safe basis of legislation. Now, it has 
               <br />
               been said that the law of 1875 did not pro- 
               <br />
               vide for the granting of state aid to separ— 
               <br />
               ate schools, but, as I stated this after- 
               <br />
               noon, this parliament accepted that principle 
               <br />
               when it passed the law of 1879 forming a 
               <br />
               school fund for the support of schools in 
               <br />
               the Northwest. Therefore, the clause, as it 
               <br />
               was ﬁrst prepared by the Minister of Jus 
               <br />
               tice, contained all those essential principles ; 
               <br />
               it contained the reference to the British

               <br />
               guaranteed separate schools. That was the 
               <br />
               only thing that we were bound to do. The 
               <br />
               government said when they framed that 
               <br />
               legislation : We stand upon the rock of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               are putting that aside that they are still

               I prefer to think that the interpretation 
               <br />
               which was given by the Prime Minister and 
               <br />

               one. If the government had remained upon

               the solid ground which they took when this

               when it was upon a common sense basis 
               <br />
