               —-so I am informed and believe to be the 
               <br />
               case——that is to be found in any of the 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada. The Territories have 
               <br />
               a system which I think may well be per- 
               <br />
               petuated. We on this side of the House 
               <br />
               are not opposing this Bill with a view to 
               <br />
               that system not being perpetuated; but 
               <br />
               we point out that hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               are making a mistake if they think that 
               <br />
               national schools are what are provided for 
               <br />
               in the Bill, when they only have half an 
               <br />
               hour for religious instruction at the close 
               <br />
               of the day. Hon. gentlemen treat the dis— 
               <br />
               tinction between the two classes of schools 
               <br />
               at present existing in the Northwest as so 
               <br />
               small as to be no distinction at all. I think 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance spoke of them in 
               <br />
               that sense, so that soon the separate schools 
               <br />
               would disappear. I think the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Centre York (Mr. A. Campbell) has ex— 
               <br />
               pressed the same view, for this is what 
               <br />

               Archie Campbell, M.P., has written to 
               <br />
               L.0.L. No. 900, Toronto Junction, to reassure 
               <br />
               that lodge on the subject of the school clauses 
               <br />
               of the Autonomy Bill. Mr. Campbell says 
               <br />
               he would oppose the Bill if separate schools, 
               <br />
               such as we have in Ontario. were to be es-

               <br />
               that such schools can never be instituted. 
               <br />
               In fact, if the law be passed in its present 
               <br />

               Now, is that the view of hon. gentlemen

               Mr. COCKSHUTT. These resolutions are 
               <br />
               in accord with the argument that I have 
               <br />
               already advanced. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               London, I think, has not been in the House 
               <br />
               while I have been speaking, or he would 
               <br />
               understand pretty well where I stand on 
               <br />
               this question. So far as I have spoken. I 
               <br />
               have endeavoured to express my own con- 
               <br />
               victions, and I only hope that when the hon. 
               <br />
               member for London rises to address the 
               <br />
               House, he will express his convictions as 
               <br />
               honestly and candidly as I have expressed 
               <br />
               mine.

               The hon. gentleman has not told us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whev</span> 
               <br />
               ther those were in accord with his views. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> 
               <br />
               that I have no opportunity of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knowing</span> 
               <br />
               what his views are, and consequently no 
               <br />
               opportunity of combating them. I do not 
               <br />
               Wish to take up the time of the House to 
               <br />
               any greater extent. as I have already spoken 
               <br />
               longer than I intended. Before closing 
               <br />
               however I wish to say that I consider that 
               <br />
               the consultation which was held between 
               <br />
               the right hon. the First Minister and the 
               <br />
               representative of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               church at present in the city of Ottawa was 
               <br />
               not in good judgment or sound policy, and 
               <br />
               will not receive the approbation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ma</span> 
               <br />
               jority of the people of this country. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that it is competent for every gentle- 
               <br />
               man in this House to consult his own church 
               <br />
               authorities and to listen, to what extent he 
               <br />
               pleases. to those who are his spiritual ad- 
               <br />
               visers. especially in a matter of such great 
               <br />
               importance as the present; but I do believe 
               <br />
               that in all cases the gentlemen who are con- 
               <br />
               sulted. whoever they may he. should be 
               <br />
               citizens of the Dominion.
