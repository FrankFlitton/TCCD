               I am giving this recapitulation to show 
               <br />
               that the designers of confederation had in 
               <br />
               view not only representation by population, 
               <br />
               but representation of locality as well, and 
               <br />
               that this principle applied not only to the 
               <br />
               popular chamber, which was to be elected, 
               <br />
               but to the Senate, which was not to be elect- 
               <br />
               ed, and to the cabinet ministers. With re- 
               <br />
               gard to ministerial representation, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that a certain number of ministers were as- 
               <br />
               signed to Quebec. Originally it was three. 
               <br />
               Now it is four, with an extra one, which 
               <br />
               makes the number five. The same number 
               <br />
               was assigned to Ontario and the same num- 
               <br />
               ber to the maritime provinces; and these 
               <br />
               were so arranged that each locality would 
               <br />
               be represented. That principle was follow— 
               <br />
               ed for years as strongly as any other prin- 
               <br />
               ciple to be found within the four corners 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution.</span> It was a part of our 
               <br />
               unwritten constitution, and we lived up to 
               <br />
               it carefully and closely, because it was be— 
               <br />
               lieved that- by doing so we did justice to all 
               <br />
               parts of the country and to all interests in- 
               <br />
               volved, and no injustice to any. A certain 
               <br />
               number of cabinet ministers was assigned to 
               <br />
               each province in proportion to its popula- 
               <br />
               tion, its importance and its area. As time 
               <br />
               went on and settlement went westWard, 
               <br />
               we were obliged to change that a little. We 
               <br />
               dropped some of our representation in the 
               <br />
               smaller provinces in the east, and endeavour-

               <br />
               a section that had no voice in the cabinet,

               the fathers of confederation. What was all 
               <br />
               this intended for? That every locality 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               parts of the country. That was the aim 
               <br />
               and the reason why this unwritten consti- 
               <br />
               tution was followed as closely as any por-

               There are two objects in view in organ- 
               <br />
               izing a cabinet. What are these two ob- 
               <br />
               jects? The ﬁrst is to select men who are 
               <br />
               fitted for the position. The second is to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make</span> the selection so that each member of 
               <br />
               the cabinet may represent a certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Iocal«</span> 
               <br />
               ity and the special interests in that locality. 
               <br />
               These interests may be commercial or ma- 
               <br />
               ritime or something else. And the selec- 
               <br />
               tion should be such as will receive the en- 
               <br />
               dorsation of the people. These are the two 
               <br />
               objects in view in ﬁlling a cabinet. In a 
               <br />
               well balanced cabinet. every district has its 
               <br />
               voice at the council board, every district 
               <br />
               has its representative in council. But ap- 
               <br />
               plying this principle to the present condi— 
               <br />
               tion of things, what is the situation to- 
               <br />
               day. We have in this confederation about 
               <br />
               2,100,000 square miles of territory. How 
               <br />
               much of that territory is represented in 
               <br />
               this cabinet ? Take the combined provinces 
               <br />
               of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick and Prince Edward Island, and they 
               <br />
               only represent 564,000 square miles. Take 
               <br />
               the balance of the territory which is not 
               <br />
               represented, which has no voice in the ca- 
               <br />
               binet, which has no say at the council 
               <br />
