               looking at the section with this particular

               point in view, but my recollection is that 
               <br />
               the statute only provides for the case of 
               <br />

               Manitoba in so many words, but by neces- 
               <br />
               sary inference it covered the case of the 
               <br />
               Territories as well. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               must remember that when this Act was 
               <br />
               passed the Territories had been admitted 
               <br />
               into conederation as territories; Maui- 
               <br />
               toba had been admitted as a province, and 
               <br />
               the Act of .1871 was passed, as I have said, 
               <br />
               for the purpose of allowing us a power 
               <br />
               which it was thought we had already exer- 
               <br />
               cised under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">146</span> by admitting them as ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. a power to admit them later on as 
               <br />
               provinces. I say that by inference the Act 
               <br />
               of 1871 enables us to do that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               There was another reason to which the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman also referred, that is, the 
               <br />
               provision for the control of lands under the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act. It was thought at the time 
               <br />
               that that was possibly ultra vircs. and that 
               <br />
               was another reason why the Act of 1871 was 
               <br />
               passed: but one has only to look at the 
               <br />
               preamble of the Act of 1871 to see clearly 
               <br />
               and plainly that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> were the reasons

               The preamble of the Act is plain, and 
               <br />
               seems to leave no question that the object 
               <br />
               of the Act was to remove the doubts to 
               <br />
               which I have made reference. Under the 
               <br />
               provisions'of the Act of 1871 we have had 
               <br />
               the power ever since it was passed to apply 
               <br />
               to these Territories such provisions of the 
               <br />
               British Columbia Act as we saw ﬁt. We 
               <br />
               have had the power to apply the original 
               <br />
               provisions of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               in whole or in part, in any modiﬁed manner 
               <br />
               that we chose, and we have had the power, 
               <br />
               as was pointed out by my hon. friend, to 
               <br />
               repeal these provisions and, from time to 
               <br />
               time, to substitute for them other provi- 
               <br />
               sions of a similar or of a different nature. 
               <br />
               As far as the Territories are concerned, it 
               <br />
               must be remembered that they came into 
               <br />
               the confederation without any special <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.pro-</span> 
               <br />
               visions applicable to them, that it was left 
               <br />
               to this parliament to determine, from time 
               <br />
               to time, what powers we should confer upon 
               <br />
               them. That seems to me to be absolutely 
               <br />
               justiﬁed. As I have pointed out, as every 
               <br />
               one knows, the Territories were then in 
               <br />
               their early infancy. They had a very sparse 
               <br />
               population, the whole matter was tentative ; 
               <br />
               the jurisdiction which the Act conferred on 
               <br />
               them must necessarily for manifestly 0b- 
               <br />
               vious reasons be a tentative one; and, 
               <br />
               therefore, it was provided, under sec- 
               <br />
               tion 2, that we might, from time to time, 
               <br />
               apply to them such provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act as we should deem pro— 
               <br />
               per. I say that that discretionary power 
               <br />
               vested in this parliament with reference to 
               <br />
               the Territories was with reference to terri- 
               <br />
               tories only, and not with reference to 
               <br />
               provinces. I say that under the Act of 1871 
               <br />
               this parliament has not to—day the right to 
               <br />
               apply to any province coming into the union 
               <br />
               any but the original provisions, from section 
               <br />
               1 to section 146, of the Act of 1867. I say 
               <br />
               that the Act of 1871 was made for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose only of the Territories, and cannot 
               <br />
               to-day have any application, and should not 
               <br />
               have any application whatever, when we are 
               <br />
               taking a province into confederation.-
