               The question now before the House, sim- 
               <br />
               mered down to a nut shell is as to the au-

               <br />
               ment to enforce separate schools on the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. The right hon. the 
               <br />
               leader of the government told us that this 
               <br />
               was a question of the constitution, but his 
               <br />
               colleagues have told us that it is not a ques-

               tion of the constitution in any sense wliat-_ 
               <br />
               ever. One of the ministers ventured to think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               that vested rights should he considered but 
               <br />
               that plea was abandoned when it was found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               that although the Roman Catholics have had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               every facility for years to establish separate l 
               <br />

               <br />
               schools as compared with over 1,000 public 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest Territories. There- 
               <br />
               fore, the question simmers itself down to 
               <br />
               one of policy. Now, let us suppose for a 
               <br />
               moment that it was our clear duty under the

               there is the great question of dogma which 
               <br />
               enters into the notion of those that hold that 
               <br />
               faith. With the question of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">religion,</span> with 
               <br />
               the relationship existing between a man’s 
               <br />
               conscience and his God I have nothing to 
               <br />
               do. I never allowed any other man to in- 
               <br />
               terfere in the relationship existing between 
               <br />
               my conscience and my God, and I never i11- 
               <br />
               suited any man by interfering with him in 
               <br />
               that respect. But in relation of the question 
               <br />
               of dogma, that is the business end of the 
               <br />
               proposition, and when any church corpor- 
               <br />
               ation—be it Methodist, Roman Catholic. 
               <br />
               Presbyterian or any other—just the same 
               <br />
               as any railway corporation comes before the 
               <br />
               people of this country for legislation, it is 
               <br />
               the boundeu duty of every man who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span> 
               <br />
               mnnds his own self respect to deal with it, 
               <br />
               not on the sentimental issue, not to bow 
               <br />
               down before the cry that the church is be- 
               <br />
               hind the organization ; but to deal with it on 
               <br />
               the basis of what is right and what is 
               <br />
               wrong, and considering what is in the best 
               <br />
               interests of the Dominion Of Canada and of 
               <br />
               her entire people. On these lines I purpose 
               <br />
               dealing with this question. Taking it as a
