               characteristics of the schools existing in

               the Northwest when he seeks to impress 
               <br />
               upon this committee that there were un- 
               <br />
               der the Act of 1875 four conditions of 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest Territories, that is 
               <br />
               a Catholic public school and a Catholic 
               <br />
               separate school, a Protestant public school 
               <br />
               and a Protestant separate school. I 
               <br />
               do not ﬁnd that in the law. It is 
               <br />
               true that the majority can organize a 
               <br />
               section or can organize a school. If the 
               <br />
               majority of the ratepayers doing that were 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics that would not make it a 
               <br />
               public Roman Catholic school, or if the ma- 
               <br />
               jority were Protestants that would not 
               <br />
               make it a Protestant public school, any.

               the majority of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> ratepayers happen to

               belong 'to that denomination. There is just 
               <br />
               one diﬁiculty that I myself ﬁnd in respect 
               <br />
               to the statement of the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               and I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">listened</span> with some degree of 
               <br />
               interest that is that the rights have been 
               <br />
               cut down by subsequent legislation or by 
               <br />

               <br />
               I am not quite sure about that. I would 
               <br />
               certainly defer very largely to the legal op-

               Mr. STOCKTON. I understood that my 
               <br />
               hon. friend said that the ordinances of 
               <br />
               1881 or 1884 cut down <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">certain</span> rights that 
               <br />
               were given under the Act of 1875. That is 
               <br />
               what I understood the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               to say and that section 11 of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 had been cut in two and the part re- 
               <br />
               lating to pu'blic schools had been omitted 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there-fore to that extent there had

               <br />
               upon that. If you read section 11 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875, with all due deference I do 
               <br />
               not think that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> bear the construction 
               <br />
               that has been put upon it by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice. As- I said it means that the 
               <br />
               majority of lthe ratepayers of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">district</span> 
               <br />
               or portion of the Northwest or any lesser 
               <br />
               portion or subdivisi‘on thereof, by whatever 
               <br />
               name the same may be called, may estab- 
               <br />
               lish such schools therein as they may think 
               <br />
               ﬁt, and make the necessary assessment and 
               <br />
               collection of rates therefor. Thalt is a pow- 
               <br />
               er given under the law to establish the 
               <br />
               schools and that power continues to-day. 
               <br />
               There has been no cutting down of that 
               <br />
               power on the part of this legislature or any 
               <br />
               attempt on the part of the Northwest legis- 
               <br />
               lature in the enactment of any ordinances; 
               <br />
               it was only granting a power to the author- 
               <br />
               ity of the Northwest Territories under cer- 
               <br />
               tain conditions to legislate and make pro- 
               <br />
               vision for the establishment of the schools ; 
               <br />
               but with this limitation, that if there was 
               <br />
               a minority in that district who wanted a 
               <br />
               separate school they could have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sepa-</span> 
               <br />
               rate school provided they complied with 
               <br />
               the law. and that when they did that their 
               <br />
               assessments shoulld go towards the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of that separate school and that 
               <br />
               therefore it would not be necessary to put 
               <br />
               that portion of section 11 of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 in the ordinances that were subse- 
               <br />
               quently adopted. Therefore upon that point 
               <br />
               it would seem to me that there is no cut- 
               <br />
               ting down, no limitation, but only an au- 
               <br />
