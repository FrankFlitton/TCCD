               Speaker, it is obviously impossible for the 
               <br />
               House to discuss in an effective manner at 
               <br />
               the present stage the Bill which has been 
               <br />
               introduced by the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Sir Wilfrid Laurier). I had hoped that 
               <br />
               I might have been put in possession of the 
               <br />
               Bill which has just been introduced, at a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufficiently</span> early date to have enabled me 
               <br />
               to have made some remarks on it this after- 
               <br />
               noon. and I realize that one of the colleagues 
               <br />
               of the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) the Minister of Justice (Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) had the intention to give me a 
               <br />
               c'opy of that Bill last evening. Owing 
               <br />
               doubtless. to circumstances over which he 
               <br />
               had no control, I did not receive it until 
               <br />
               a few minutes before the opening of the 
               <br />
               House this afternoon, and therefore I 
               <br />
               will not attempt any discussion of it to- 
               <br />
               day. Let me say, however, in the very 
               <br />
               few remarks that I propose to address to 
               <br />
               the House. that I congratulate the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) upon 
               <br />
               the change of heart which he has experi- 
               <br />
               enced during the past twelve months. Do I 
               <br />
               understand my right hon. friend to deny 
               <br />
               that there has been such a change. Let me 
               <br />
               say that I hold under my hand the ‘Han- 
               <br />
               sard’ of September 24, 1903. a little more 
               <br />
               than a year ago. when the right hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gen:</span>

               tlcman (Sir \Vilfrid Laurier) in debate on 
               <br />
               this House, pressed upon the attention of 
               <br />
               the House many reasons. in his opinion 
               <br />
               very conclusive, why the granting of a 
               <br />
               provincial status to the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories should be delayed for many years, 
               <br />
               and I am bound to say that every one of 
               <br />
               those reasons which at that time presented 
               <br />
               themselves to the right hon. gentleman as 
               <br />
               insuperable diﬂiculties in the way of innue- 
               <br />
               diately granting provincial autonomy, exist 
               <br />
               to-day just as strongly as they did then. 
               <br />
               The View which I am presenting to the 
               <br />
               House at this moment was suggested by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Marquette (Mr. Roche) in 
               <br />
               these words :

               But the Prime Minister adduced arguments 
               <br />
               that were strong no doubt from this point of 
               <br />
               view that; the Northwest Territories should not 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               his opinion at that time? No, he responded 
               <br />

               <br />
               It has unfortunately happened very often

               that he has been absent from sessions of this
