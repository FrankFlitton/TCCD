               <br />
               liament to introduce church schools, either 
               <br />
               public or separate, in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. I never made such a statement 
               <br />
               either in. the House or outside of it. .All 
               <br />
               ‘ asked, and all I still ask, is that what is 
               <br />
               given to Catholics where they are a min- 
               <br />
               ority in a district should be given to them 
               <br />
               in a district where they are a majority. 
               <br />
               Of course I know they are entitled to more; 
               <br />
               I know that we give more to the Protes- 
               <br />
               tants in Quebec, and that if we were to 
               <br />
               reduce the Protestant schools in Quebec 
               <br />
               to the condition of the Catholic schools 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories there would 
               <br />
               be such an agitation for disallowance as no 
               <br />
               government here could resist. As I have 
               <br />
               stated, to my mind, the least that could 
               <br />
               be given for the protection of the minority 
               <br />
               in the Northwest would be the right to 
               <br />
               form separate schools of the character de— 
               <br />
               ﬁned in the ordinance of 1901 in every dis- 
               <br />
               trict, Whether they be a majority or a 
               <br />
               minority. That is the position I have taken. 
               <br />
               While‘I am sure the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan (Mr. Lamont), spoke in all 
               <br />
               good faith, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at'the</span> same time I do not want 
               <br />
               to have him misrepresent me. In Quebec 
               <br />
               We have no such thing as church schools; 
               <br />
               but we have given and do give to the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant minority the full ‘right to have 
               <br />
               schools conducted according to their wishes 
               <br />
               at which their children can receive such 
               <br />
               religious instructions as they see ﬁt with- 
               <br />
               out interference from the government, and 
               <br />
               I think we should have the same thing 
               <br />
               in the west. I am glad to have it from the 
               <br />
               words of the member for Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               and from the Prime Minister, as well as 
               <br />
               from the leader of the opposition, that the 
               <br />
               objection which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.‘I.</span> have raised some two 
               <br />
               months ago, and which has been contra- 
               <br />
               dicted ﬂatly by the Liberal press in Que— 
               <br />
               bec, has been acknowledged, namely, that 
               <br />
               if we adopted clause 16. No. 2, we would 
               <br />
               have deprived the Catholics of all rights 
               <br />
               in respect of schools wherever they are a 
               <br />
               majority. I thank the member for Saskat— 
               <br />
               chewan for introducing his amendment 
               <br />
               with a view to covering that point. How- 
               <br />
               ever, I wish to. say it seems to me it would 
               <br />
               be much more in conformity with the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of our country, as well as with 
               <br />
               the pledges taken by this parliament to 
               <br />
               give the right to the Catholic minority to 
               <br />
               their separate schools under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordinance”</span> 
               <br />
               of 1901 where they are a majority, than 
               <br />
               by giving them the right contemplated by 
               <br />
               this amendment. 
               <br />
