               has spoken the amendment which I have 
               <br />
               moved. Let us consider that amend- 
               <br />
               ment for a moment in one or two aspects ; 
               <br />
               but before doing so let me remark that the 
               <br />
               Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interior</span> yesterday was very 
               <br />
               free with a challenge to have the territorial 
               <br />
               legislature called and to accept their verdict 
               <br />
               as to what the delimitations should be. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior need not have 
               <br />
               asked for the calling of the legislature nor 
               <br />
               need he have professed his willingness to 
               <br />
               accept what they should say on the subject 
               <br />
               because this legislature only two years ago 
               <br />
               made a certain delimitation both of this pro- 
               <br />
               vince and of the adjoining province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan. and the only answer to the argu- 
               <br />
               ment based upon that delimitation is the 
               <br />
               suggestion that the delimitation then made 
               <br />
               was absolutely unfair. As far as I have 
               <br />
               heard of any proceedings with regard 
               <br />
               thereto, claims of unfairness came par- 
               <br />
               ticularly from a portion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Territo— 
               <br />
               ries which is not included in these un- 
               <br />
               organized districts, and could not be so 
               <br />
               included. They came from a portion of the 
               <br />
               riding which I think is to the south rather 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">than</span> to the north. If we are to go by the 
               <br />
               opinion and views of the legislature of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> latest 
               <br />
               prommncement in a delimitation of those 
               <br />
               constituencies which is absolutely out of 
               <br />
               agreement with that proposed by the admini- 
               <br />
               stration to-day. When we come down to 
               <br />
               the action of our own parliament in 1903, 
               <br />
               'four constituencies were established which 
               <br />
               are practically in the new province of Al— 
               <br />
               berta. I shall point out in a moment to 
               <br />
               what extent that is not correct. They are the 
               <br />
               electoral districts of Alberta, Calgary, Strain- 
               <br />
               cona and Edmonton. The division then made 
               <br />
               was made with the assent of the members 
               <br />
               _ of the Northwest Territories representing the 
               <br />
               administration. It was one which they them- 
               <br />
               selves proposed. It was submitted to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">senators</span> for the Territories, as I think 
               <br />
               'there were no members from the Territories 
               <br />
               on the Conservative side. The senators from 
               <br />
               the Territories had some knowledge of local 
               <br />
               conditions and they regarded the division 
               <br />
               as fairly satisfactory on both sides. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">At</span> all 
               <br />
               events the delimitation was proposed by the 
               <br />
               administration and its supporters. and we 
               <br />
               must assume they were fair divisions. 
               <br />

               according to the statement of the Minister

               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twentynﬁve</span> seats which are proposed.

               You have then twenty-three seats re-

               maining. You have four federal electoral 
               <br />
               districts. which were established in 1903 
               <br />
               by the consent and to the satisfaction of 
               <br />
               every person. Looking at those four ridings

               of voters on the list and a smaller number of

               Alberta in the south, which as I have said

               before has a smaller electoral list and polls

               :1 smaller number of votes. It seems to me 
               <br />
               you would then be doing substantial justice 
               <br />
               even upon the statements of the Minister of 
               <br />

               himself to the unorganized territory in the 
               <br />
               north. and I believe upon the whole you 
               <br />
               would be doing probably substantial justice 
               <br />

               <br />
               thus remove the sense of injustice which 
               <br />
               otherwise will prevail; I have no part in any

               controversy about the capitals. That. it

               the people themselves. I do not take into
