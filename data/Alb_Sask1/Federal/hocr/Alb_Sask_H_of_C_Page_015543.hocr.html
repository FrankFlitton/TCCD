               Now, the people of Alberta, (if we can 
               <br />
               judge at all from what we read in the news- 
               <br />
               papers from the west, and particularly from 
               <br />
               these proposed provinces), the people of 
               <br />
               Alberta had somewhat got the idea that 
               <br />
               they were going to have a commission 
               <br />
               Which would delimit these constituencies, 
               <br />
               and it is not difﬁcult to show by 
               <br />
               quotations from some of the papers that 
               <br />
               this is what the local desire calls for. 
               <br />
               Also we can readily prove, from the some 
               <br />
               sources, that the people of Alberta are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grievously</span> disappointed with the action of 
               <br />
               the government in this respect. I wish to 
               <br />
               submit a few of the ﬁgures which show 
               <br />
               why the people of Alberta are disappointed. 
               <br />
               l have not made my calculations in quite 
               <br />
               the same way as my hon. friend from Ual- 
               <br />
               gary (Mr. !M. S. McCarthy) has made his, 
               <br />
               but they are made, I think, with equal care 
               <br />
               and effort. and I may say that they are the 
               <br />
               work of many weeks on the part of the 
               <br />
               members upon this side of the House. We 
               <br />
               have not relied on any ofﬁcials. We have 
               <br />
               made our own calculations we have checked 
               <br />
               and rechecked, and I think our schedule will 
               <br />
               stand the test. We have made independent 
               <br />
               talculations, which I do not think can be 
               <br />
               in any way broken down. In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> place, 
               <br />
               i want to reiterate what I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">already</span> said, 
               <br />
               that we are not discounting the future. 
               <br />
               We are dealing with things as they are; 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequently,</span> the ﬁgures which we should

               fair play ? This calculation gives the total

               lopulation including Innisfail at 172.853. I 
               <br />
               want to ask, as one searching for informa- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the south to have a representative, when 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5,+OO</span> people in the north are thought good 
               <br />
               enough to have a member. I do not know 
               <br />
               the country very well, but is there such a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the calibre of the people 
               <br />

               that it takes 9,000 people in the south to
