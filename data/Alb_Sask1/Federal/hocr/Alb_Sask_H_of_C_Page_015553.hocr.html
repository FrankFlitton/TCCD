               <br />
               it is not by way of reproach ; he had a task

               to perform on behalf of his constituents, and

               every line, every word and every syllable of 
               <br />
               that speech is that this objection is taken 
               <br />
               to the distribution which we have placed 
               <br />
               upon the table of the House from one point 
               <br />
               of view only ; not because the constituencies 
               <br />
               are unfair towards each other, not because 
               <br />
               there is an unfair advantage given to one 
               <br />
               over the other, but simply because there is 
               <br />
               not in the south the number of seats which 
               <br />
               ought to go to the south. That is my hon.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I see I have 
               <br />
               properly interpreted it. My hon. friend has 
               <br />
               taken the division of Red Deer, township 
               <br />
               38, as the point of division between the 
               <br />
               north and south. There are 23 divisions in 
               <br />
               old Alberta according to our new plan of 
               <br />
               distribution. Eleven are north of Red Deer. 
               <br />
               and 11 are south of Red Deer, and the point 
               <br />
               my hon. friend has made was that there 
               <br />
               should be 15 south of Red Deer and 10 north 
               <br />
               of Red Deer, that is including Red Deer. 
               <br />
               Let us see whether there is anything to just- 
               <br />
               ify that or not. First of all I am very, very 
               <br />
               sorry that in a matter of this kind it should 
               <br />
               be reduced simply to a point of argument 
               <br />
               whether or not the seats should be put in 
               <br />
               the north or the south. For my own part 
               <br />
               I discard all that; I do not consider whe— 
               <br />
               ther they are to be in the north or the 
               <br />
               south; they are to be placed wherever the 
               <br />
               population warrants it. That is the only 
               <br />
               argument, I think.

               M. S. McCarthy) who ﬁrst suggested that

               division. It was suggested, if I may say so, 
               <br />
               from other quarters. Some time ago, when 
               <br />
               the question of the selection of the capital 
               <br />
               was brought to my attention, I was asked to 
               <br />
               take Red Deer, as a point midway between 
               <br />
               north and south. This is an idea that is run- 
               <br />
               ning in the minds of my hon. friend and 
               <br />
               others. He is but re-echoing that which is 
               <br />
               in other minds. But, for my part, I am sorry 
               <br />
               that any matter of so great moment should 
               <br />
               be looked at in so narrow a way. Again I 
               <br />
               repeat, the divisions should be as warranted 
               <br />
