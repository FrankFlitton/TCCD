               A great deal has been said about our 
               <br />
               school system in the province of Quebec.

               My hon. friend from Dundas (Mr. Broder) 
               <br />
               quoted a speech made by the 11011. the Min—

               Quebec legislature. away back in 1893, 
               <br />
               in which the minister criticised the 
               <br />
               separate schools then in existence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inlthat</span> 
               <br />
               province. But my hon. friend did not take 
               <br />
               the trouble—perhaps he did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know~to</span> 
               <br />
               explain the circumstances surrounding the 
               <br />
               delivery of that speech. Why. down in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec we are animated by a 
               <br />
               spirit of educational reform, and at that 
               <br />
               time the Minister of Justice was pleading 
               <br />
               for an increase in the educational grant and 
               <br />
               endeavouring to arouse a sentiment among 
               <br />
               the people in favour of a greater expenditure 
               <br />
               on education, in favour of paying the teach- 
               <br />
               ers higher salaries and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span> better school- 
               <br />
               houses. That was the object my hon. friend 
               <br />
               had in delivering that speech, and it is quite 
               <br />
               possible that his zeal in the cause of reform 
               <br />
               induced him to make the most of his case 
               <br />
               and perhaps even exaggerate the conditions. 
               <br />
               But what he was endeavouring to do was to 
               <br />
               get the Quebec government to spend more 
               <br />
               money and take every means possible to 
               <br />
               put our educational system there on the 
               <br />

               as efﬁcient schools as can be found in other

               good work there in the cause of education

               I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to refrain from making a

               contrast between the treatment accorded

               Protestant minority have not only been 
               <br />
               treated fairly but most generously. We are

               given more than our share of public money,

               both stood up a few days ago and explained
