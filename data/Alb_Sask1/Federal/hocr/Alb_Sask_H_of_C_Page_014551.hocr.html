               to give them extra terms by the legislation 
               <br />
               of this House. The thing that is important 
               <br />
               in this matter is that whatever Act we pass 
               <br />
               now, so far as I have understood the debate 
               <br />
               will be permanent so far as this parliament 
               <br />
               is concerned, and any change that is made 
               <br />
               will have to be made by the imperial parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. It is important, therefore, that we 
               <br />
               should go slowly; and it is very important 
               <br />
               that this should be debated from every 
               <br />
               standpoint, because if we make a mistake 
               <br />
               now it will be a lasting mistake. The Prime

               Minister when he brought this Bill down 
               <br />
               said that there were four subjects which

               That I think is where the premier made a 
               <br />
               mistake; that is where he talks of these 
               <br />
               Territories as though they were provinces 
               <br />
               and as though we were bound to retain these

               <br />
               the Territories just as if they had been pro-

               vinces. If I understood the legal arguments 
               <br />
               which have been advanced in this House at 
               <br />
               all, I think that does not apply. Then, Sir, 
               <br />
               we had a speech from the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) on the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional side of the question, and I think 
               <br />
               that every one who heard that speech and 
               <br />
               every one who has read it will concede that 
               <br />
               he really put the Prime Minister out of 
               <br />
               business so far as the constitutional aspect 
               <br />
               of the case is concerned. I fully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eXpected</span> 
               <br />
               that when our leader had ﬁnished speaking 
               <br />
               they would have put up the Minister of J us- 
               <br />
               tice to answer him and certainly they would 
               <br />
               have done so if the contention of the First 
               <br />
               Minister had been right because then the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice would have been able to 
               <br />
               down our leader, but he is not easily downed. 
               <br />
               To my great surprise they put up the Min-

               I think that is exactly opposed to what

               <br />

               <br />

               hon. member for Carleton who leads the 
               <br />
               opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) he certainly 
               <br />
               would have answered him in like manner, 
               <br />
               that is, he would have appointed a legal gen- 
               <br />
               tleman to answer the opposition leader. I 
               <br />
               find also that the Minister of Finance is not 
               <br />
               in favour of separate schools. He said that if 
               <br />
               he had his way personally, speaking for him- 
               <br />
               self he would not go in for separate schools, 
               <br />
               he would leave that word ‘ separate ’ out of 
               <br />
               all schools. Then he went on to tell us that 
               <br />
               they had no separate schools by law in Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, and he said that this was owing to 
               <br />
               the good fellowship that existed between 
               <br />
               the people there, because they divided up. 
               <br />
               Where there was a strong minority they had 
               <br />
               their schools, they had their teachers, I be- 
               <br />
               lieve with the same examination as those 
               <br />
               for public schools, but although they had 
               <br />
               not a separate school by-law they had by the 
               <br />
               consent of the majority in that province. 
               <br />
               1 am strongly of opinion that this Bill which 
               <br />
               has been introduced will not tend to make it 
               <br />
               easier to have separate schools in the west- 
               <br />
               ern provinces than it would have been to 
               <br />
               have them without it. My own impression is 
               <br />
               that when you try to force a man to do 
               <br />
               something he does not want to do you will 
               <br />
               have a good deal of difﬁculty in making him 
               <br />
               do it. I understood the hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               have spoken to tell us that they have had 
               <br />
               no difﬁculty in the ast few years with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to separate schools. If that is the case 
               <br />
               I do not see why they want this enactment. 
               <br />
               The separate schools do not appear to have 
               <br />
               been a great success in that country any- 
               <br />
               way. I believe there are only about a dozen 
               <br />
               of them all told, nine Roman Catholic and 
               <br />
               two or three Protestant. These Protestant 
               <br />
               schools are as much separate schools, I pre— 
               <br />
               sume, as the others.
