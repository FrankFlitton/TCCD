               <br />
               Now, if we take the votes on the list, 2,222 
               <br />
               more in the 11 southern ridings than in the 
               <br />
               11 northern ridings, and multiply them by 
               <br />
               whatever ﬁgure you please—the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[ﬁgure</span> usual- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vly</span> taken is 5—you will observe that there is 
               <br />
               an additional population in the south of 
               <br />
               ﬁve times 2,222, which would be 11,110 
               <br />
               more population in the south, which gets the 
               <br />
               smaller share of the representation. I want 
               <br />
               to point out another thing. The Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior has stated that the surest 
               <br />
               guide is the vote that was polled, not the 
               <br />
               vote on the list. No doubt he considers that 
               <br />
               the surest guide, because it would result a 
               <br />
               little in his favour, and because, as I think 
               <br />
               I can point out, in the northern country in 
               <br />
               some polls a larger number of votes were 
               <br />
               cast than the number of names on the list, 
               <br />
               corroborating very strongly the suggestion 
               <br />
               that was made, that half-breeds came down 
               <br />
               from Athabaska and Saskatchewan to vote 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the Edmonton riding. If any person ex- 
               <br />
               amines the ﬁgures, he will ﬁnd that in most 
               <br />
               of the northern ridings, where the foreign 
               <br />
               population predominates, a larger percent- 
               <br />
               age of the vote was polled, showing the in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence of the government ofﬁcial. If he 
               <br />
               looks at the ranching district, he will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that in some cases there was no vote polled 
               <br />
               at all, which is explained by the fact that 
               <br />
               an order issued by the Department of Agri- 
               <br />
               culture last fall compelled all the ranchers 
               <br />
               south of township 34 to dip their cattle for 
               <br />
               the mange about the time of the election. 
               <br />
               The order expired on the 1st of November, 
               <br />
               but was extended for a week or ten days, 
               <br />
               and if they did not comply with the condi- 
               <br />
               tions their cattle would be sold or clipped 
               <br />
               and the cost charged to them. The result 
               <br />
               was that a very small vote was polled in 
               <br />
               the ranching country. The ranchers had to 
               <br />
               choose between saving their country and 
               <br />
               saving their cattle, and they preferred appar— 
               <br />
               ently to take the latter course. The argu- 
               <br />
               ment that the inﬂux of population has been 
               <br />
               to the north can, I think. be met by an ex— 
               <br />
               amination of the homestead entries. The 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior has intimated that 
               <br />
               township 38 is a fair line. Well, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that north of township 38 there is the land 
               <br />
               district of Edmonton and half of the land 
               <br />
               district of Red Deer, while south of town- 
               <br />
               ship 38 there is the other half of the Red 
               <br />
               Deer land district. the agency of Calgary, 
               <br />
               the agency at Lethbridge and a very small 
               <br />
               portion of the land agency of Battleford; 
               <br />
               but from the map issued on the 1st of

               than. I have the voters’ list, which will de- 
               <br />
               monstrate that. I ﬁnd that in 1902-3 there 
               <br />
               were 6,614 homestead entries north of town- 
               <br />
               Ship 3S, equalling 48 per cent; while south 
               <br />
               or township 38 there were 7,744 homestead 
               <br />
               entries, equalling 52 per cent. In 1904 there 
               <br />
               were 3,327 entries north of township 38, 
               <br />
               equalling 40 per cent, and 5,284 south of 
               <br />
               township 38, equalling 60 per cent. The 
               <br />
               total for the three years was 9,941, or 43 
               <br />
               per cent north of township 38, and 13,028, 
               <br />
               or 56 per cent or 57 per cent. south of town- 
               <br />
               ship 38. If you take an increase of four 
               <br />
               persons, or three, or two—it does not matter, 
               <br />
               it is no discrimination against the north to 
               <br />
               do so—and multiply that by the dilference 
               <br />
               in the homestead entries, you will ﬁnd a dif- 
               <br />
               ference in favour of the south of 12,348 
               <br />
               people in the last three years; and this is 
               <br />
               only so far as the rural population is con- 
               <br />
               cerned. Yet south of that township only 
               <br />
               two and a fraction seats are added, while 
               <br />
               north of it seven and a fraction are added, 
               <br />
               turning the local divisions upside down in 
               <br />
               the very teeth of the homestead entries; 
               <br />
               and this is called fair. Now, there are just 
               <br />
               two things that I want to point out while 
               <br />
               dealing with the homestead entries. The 
               <br />
               ﬁrst is the point that was mentioned by the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior, that is, that the 
               <br />
               great majority of those people had no votes 
               <br />
               in the last election; so that when you are 
               <br />
               carving up the country on the basis of the 
               <br />
               voters' list, you are discriminating against 
               <br />
               the south. The south is suffering more 
               <br />
               thereby on his own argument. Another 
               <br />
               point I wish to emphasize is that we have a 
               <br />
               condition of affairs in the south which they 
               <br />
               have not in the north. We have two large 
               <br />
               irrigation schemes there. The Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway irrigation block near Calgary 
               <br />
               contains 3,000,000 acres, of which there have 
               <br />
               been sold, although it has only recently been 
               <br />
               put on the market, over 400,000 acres. There 
               <br />
               is half a million acres now on the market. 
               <br />
               Down in the riding of Lethbridge you have 
               <br />
               the Great Northwestern Irrigation Com- 
               <br />
               pany, with about a million and a half acres, 
               <br />
               cut up into 40-acre holdings. None of the 
               <br />
               results from these two large irrigation blocks 
               <br />
               appear in these ﬁgures giving the homestead 
               <br />
               entries, which would make a contrast in 
               <br />
               favour of the south in the matter of popula- 
               <br />
               tion which would be startling. They talk 
               <br />
               about the northern country, about cutting 
               <br />
               up this constituency to satisfy the northern 
               <br />
               country ; they will tell you that a population 
               <br />
               the grand prairie and Peace river districts 
               <br />
               will sustain. But that is only about 700,000 
               <br />
               acres, hardly one—quarter of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway irrigation block at Calgary. 
               <br />
