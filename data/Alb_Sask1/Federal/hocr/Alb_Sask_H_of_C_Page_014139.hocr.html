               material and never could arise after the

               passing of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               1871. Under these circumstances it seems

               to me that no constitutional obligation, and,

               in my humble opinion, with all deference to 
               <br />
               the views of those who think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerently,</span> 
               <br />
               no constitutional authority is found for the 
               <br />
               educational clauses. I am of that opinion 
               <br />
               because these educational <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clauses</span> depart in 
               <br />
               terms from the provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act which they purport to 
               <br />

               frid Laurier} is correct in his contention that

               he is observing not only the letter but the 
               <br />
               spirit of the constitution, why is it that he 
               <br />
               has inserted in section 10 both as originally 
               <br />
               drafted and as amended provisions which 
               <br />
               purport to incorporate but which do more 
               <br />
               than that, which amend and change the 
               <br />
               terms of the British North America Act?

               day declared that these Territories became

               <br />
               not seeking to-day to preserve any rights 
               <br />
               which existed at the time of the union in 
               <br />
               1870. He attempts by this measure to per- 
               <br />
               petuate privileges which did not then exist, 
               <br />
               but which were created by this par- 
               <br />
               liament in 1775. Is my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend willing to base his case upon 
               <br />
               the rights which existed in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories at the time of the union? 
               <br />
               What does my right hon. friend regard as the 
               <br />
               time of the union? I gathered from him 
               <br />
               to-day that the time of the union, is the 
               <br />
