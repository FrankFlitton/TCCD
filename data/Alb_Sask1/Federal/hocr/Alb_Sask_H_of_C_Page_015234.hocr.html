               for which it pays. But to repeat, it I 
               <br />
               can make myself clear, it would not matter 
               <br />
               if to-day we handed over to the provinces 
               <br />
               the amount of money that we are proposing 
               <br />
               to hand over and then handed over to 
               <br />
               them the land and then handed over an ad- 
               <br />
               ditional amount to repay them for possible 
               <br />
               loss on the administration of those lands, 
               <br />
               the principle would still remain that the 
               <br />
               Dominion government could afford to give 
               <br />
               the lands away and still make money, and 
               <br />
               that the provincial government could not af- 
               <br />
               ford to give the lands away and make 
               <br />
               money; and that therefore those of us who 
               <br />
               believe in the propriety and the good 
               <br />
               policy of administering these lands for the 
               <br />
               sake of settlement rather than of revenue, 
               <br />
               other things being equal, certainly want to 
               <br />
               see that administration remain in the hands 
               <br />
               of the Dominion government. Now in re- 
               <br />
               gard to a suggestion made by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Alberta (Mr. Herron) as to the 
               <br />
               revenue that is being derived from the 
               <br />
               sale of mineral lands—and by inference he 
               <br />
               suggested that a suﬂicient revenue might be 
               <br />
               derived from the sale of mineral lands 
               <br />
               without trespassing on agricultural lands— 
               <br />
               I do not know what money could be de- 
               <br />
               rived from the sale of mineral lands, in 
               <br />
               the Territories ; I do not know what money 
               <br />
               has been derived in the past or can bede— 
               <br />
               rived in the future. I hope that u very 
               <br />
               large revenue can be derived from that 
               <br />
               source, but even supposing that there can 
               <br />
               be a considerable revenue derived from 
               <br />
               that source, it does not alter the principle 
               <br />
               I have stated, but we may judge possibly 
               <br />
               of this by comparison. The district of 
               <br />
               Alberta, as every one knows, is not what 
               <br />
               would be called a highly mineralized ter— 
               <br />
               ritory. There are important and valuable 
               <br />
               mineral coal deposits throughout the prairie 
               <br />
               country and in the Rocky mountains and 
               <br />
               these of course are of very great value, 
               <br />
               but certainly Alberta is not mineralized to 
               <br />
               anything like the extent that the adjoining 
               <br />
               province of British Columbia is. There is 
               <br />
