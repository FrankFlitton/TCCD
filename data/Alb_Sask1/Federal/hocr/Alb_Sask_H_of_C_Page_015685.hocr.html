               be down in the Connecticut valley the other 
               <br />

               elections they sent out ﬁve train—loads of 
               <br />
               men to the province of Quebec to vote in 
               <br />
               that election. I asked how that was, and 
               <br />
               he said that when the census was taken 
               <br />
               three years ago every family in the Con-

               necticut valley was counted as belonging 
               <br />
               to Quebec. So I presume the same game

               has been played in the new provinces.
