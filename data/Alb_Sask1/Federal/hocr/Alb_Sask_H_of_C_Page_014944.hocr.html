               <br />
               having framed that particular clause. I 
               <br />
               have listened with great interest to another 
               <br />
               gentleman who poses as a great peace- 
               <br />
               maker, particularly in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               he went through the debate of 1896 and 
               <br />
               knows the Whole question thoroughly. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend who has just spoken said that 
               <br />
               When the Prime Minister set himself on the 
               <br />
               rock of the constitution, he thought it was a 
               <br />
               Siftonian rock. I think when my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition shelters 
               <br />
               himself behind the rock of the con-

               <br />
               Fosterite rock, because I do not believe the

               hon. gentleman of his own impulse would 
               <br />
               take the stand he has taken. Nevertheless, 
               <br />
               he has stated that he takes the stand of his 
               <br />
               own free-will and has left his ﬂock to act

               Mr. BUREAU. I think if you were to 
               <br />
               give the administration of the lands to the 
               <br />
               provinces and to place restrictions on them 
               <br />
               in that administration, it would be an en- 
               <br />
               croachment on provincial rights. You would 
               <br />
               be establishing a condition of things which 
               <br />
               they themselves would not enforce, that 
               <br />
               is, you would be encroaching on provincial

               rights, and consequently I come to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that in the opinion of hon. gentle-

               men opposite the principle of provincial

               <br />
               behind when it suits you, but when it does 
               <br />
               not suit you, to the winds with provincial 
               <br />
               rights. I read with great interest a speech 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for North Toron- 
               <br />
               to (Mr. Foster). His experience. his wide

               this country, have greatly interested me in 
               <br />
               this speech. In reading that speech I tried 
               <br />
               to decide whether I was not biased, whether 
               <br />
               I could not change my views. After reading 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> very carefully, I found that the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman had not treated the question at all. 
               <br />
               The speech starts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out</span> by ﬁnding fault with

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BVBI'ybOdy</span> on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">516.8</span> of the House—and

               not ﬁnd fault with everybody in the country.

               Then he is astonished at the change of front 
               <br />
               of the Prime Minister. Well, Sir, after 
               <br />
               reading and comparing the speeches of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Toronto in 1896 and 
               <br />
               1905, I have come to the conclusion that all 
               <br />
               the hauling around and changing of front 
               <br />

               <br />
               North Toronto (Mr. Foster). In those days 
               <br />
               when he discussed the question of remedial 
               <br />
               legislation, he dismissed with a snap of his 
               <br />
               ﬁngers the question of provincial rights. He 
               <br />
               said that: 
               <br />

               Where is the injection. and who are the

               injectors ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I,</span> understand that the word ‘in— 
               <br />
               ject’ means to force a foreign body through

               We do not inject anything; the injection 
               <br />
               was in 1896. The Manitoba legislature of 
               <br />
               that day had passed a law which had been 
               <br />
               declared within their powers of legislation 
               <br />
               by the highest tribunal in the land, and the 
               <br />
               Conservative government at Ottawa were 
               <br />
               endeavouring to impose on the Manitoba 
               <br />
               legislature the very contrary of that legis- 
               <br />
               lation. But this time the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest, through their representatives, 
               <br />
               through their government, through their 
               <br />
               legislature, have passed a law, and of this 
               <br />
               law we have said to them : <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gentlemen.</span> this 
               <br />
               law suits you. you want the law, you made 
               <br />
               it yourselves, you can have it; there is a 
               <br />
               minority in the two new provinces, and you
