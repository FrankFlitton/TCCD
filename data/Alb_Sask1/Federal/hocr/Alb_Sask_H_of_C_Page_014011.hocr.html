               <br />
               think I have given the true solution, namely, 
               <br />
               that he was engaged in business and had 
               <br />
               a partner in the store. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               you know that in small places like that 
               <br />
               postmasters often have other business, the 
               <br />
               post ofﬁce business is so small that it does 
               <br />
               not occupy much of their time, and it fre- 
               <br />
               quently happens that they employ com- 
               <br />
               petent men to assist them. I say again, I 
               <br />
               regret that the hon. gentleman, ﬁnding him- 
               <br />
               self unable to give the information, did not 
               <br />
               allow the motion to stand, because I would 
               <br />
               have been able to enlighten him on many 
               <br />
               points. His friends probably misled him. 
               <br />
               I think possibly he would not have made 
               <br />
               the change had he been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cogniiant</span> of all
