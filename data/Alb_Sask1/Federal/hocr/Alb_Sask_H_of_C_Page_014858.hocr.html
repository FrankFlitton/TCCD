               we have in the west the sons and daughters

               of Quebec and Ontario and of every other 
               <br />
               province in this Dominion and that there are 
               <br />
               no better settlers in the world than the 
               <br />
               people from this eastern country. But, Sir, 
               <br />
               what are the conditions to-day and what 
               <br />
               were they 25 years ago? As I have said 
               <br />
               Manitoba was the experimental farm. The 
               <br />
               farmers who went into that country knew 
               <br />
               that the country was fertile, but they did 
               <br />
               not know that the season was long enough 
               <br />
               to enable them to ripen Wheat. They were 
               <br />
               afraid their labours would not receive very 
               <br />
               much return. By experiment it has been 
               <br />
               found that by cultivating and tilling the soil 
               <br />
               the prairie is changed from a non-conductor 
               <br />
               or reﬂector 0f heat, that the prairie will 
               <br />
               absorb and retain heat and that we are able 
               <br />
               to grow wheat and never think anything of 
               <br />
               frost. That is an experiment that the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Manitoba have had to work out for 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of the whole western country. 
               <br />
               These are some obstacles which the farmers 
               <br />
               had to contend With. I speak from experi- 
               <br />
               ence. After raising their crop they had to 
               <br />
               take it sometimes 50 miles with a yoke of 
               <br />
               .exen and sell it for 40 cents a bushel. That 
               <br />
               was done for a good many years and that 
               <br />
               will illustrate some of the hardships that 
               <br />
               the people had to go through. As to our 
               <br />
               schools, people were afraid to go into that 
               <br />
               western country because the country was 
               <br />
               so sparsely settled that it was almost impos- 
               <br />
               sible to have schools. 
               <br />

               I may digress to refer to a trivial matter

               now, but if there is any one here who was

               of this government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1</span> I say here honestly. 
               <br />
               that this government did not consider the 
               <br />
               whole question before they decided that 
               <br />
               Manitoba could not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extendedclvestward.</span> 
               <br />
               ()ne reason they have given for not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">err-</span> 
               <br />
               tending Manitoba to the west is, that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba has incurred a debt and that the man 
               <br />
               on one section of land is liable for a certain 
               <br />
               debt from which the man on the other side 
               <br />
               or the line is free. Let us look at that from 
               <br />
               a business standpint. I admit that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Manitoba</span> 
               <br />
               has a heavier debt than the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, but Manitoba has assets to show 
               <br />
               for it. When a business man is consider- 
               <br />
               ing his ﬁnancial position he considers his 
               <br />
               assets as well as his liabilities, and if he 
               <br />
               has assets that more than balance his liabil- 
               <br />
               ities he thinks himself pretty well off. That 
               <br />
               is a sound business principle and it applies 
               <br />
               to the province of Manitoba. I Wish my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Lisgar (Mr. Greenway) 
               <br />
               were here because he would understand 
               <br />
               something of what I am speaking about. 
               <br />
               When Mr. Greenway was premier of Maui— 
               <br />
               toba, he offered a very great sum of money 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> he could get a 10 cent rate on wheat 
               <br />
               from Winnipeg to Port Arthur. We were 
               <br />
               paying 14, 15 and'16 cents per hundred, on 
               <br />
               wheat from Winnipeg to Port Arthur, and 
               <br />
               a difference of even one cent per bushel 
               <br />
               means a great deal to the farmer. When 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">R‘oblin</span> government came into power 
               <br />
               they got a ten cent rate and they got it 
               <br />
               without costing that country a cent. I 
               <br />
               want to compare the freight rates on the 
               <br />
               Canadian side, which have been secured by 
               <br />
               this business transaction of the Roblin gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, with the Wheat rates on the other 
               <br />
               side of the line, and then I will ask if there 
               <br />
               is not some reason why Manitoba should 
               <br />
               have a debt. If this government had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               vestigated the matter and explained as 
               <br />
               they should have done to the people why 
               <br />
               Manitoba should be extended west, before 
               <br />
               live years had elapsed these people would 
               <br />
               have been entirely satisﬁed and we would 
               <br />
               have had two great provinces. Here are 
               <br />
               the freight rates on wheat. From Winnipeg 
               <br />
               to Port Arthur, 421 miles, the rates on 
               <br />
               wheat is 10 cents per 100 pounds or 6 cents 
               <br />
               per bushel. From Brainerd, Minnesota to 
               <br />
               Duluth, 119 miles, note the difference, the
