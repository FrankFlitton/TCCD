               The Privy Council for Canada was not 
               <br />
               an expert in the art of governing and 
               <br />
               organizing a colony. It would not be saying 
               <br />
               too much that many of the members of that 
               <br />
               Privy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council</span> believed that Canada was 
               <br />
               still a colony at that time. The Privy Coun- 
               <br />
               cil made many mistakes which necessitated 
               <br />
               the interference of the English cabinet. 
               <br />
               These mistakes and this interference brought 
               <br />
               the recognition of the rights and privileges 
               <br />

               <br />
               the solemn promise that these rights and 
               <br />
               privileges <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would!</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> be protected; 
               <br />
               Right shall be done in all cases, but let us 
               <br />
               not anticipate. This drama of the transfer 
               <br />
               of the territory to Canada lasted for more 
               <br />
               than a year. There were some comical in- 
               <br />
               cidents, when the governor of the new pro- 
               <br />
               Vince would not be accepted by his subjects ; 
               <br />
               tragical incidents, such as the execution of 
               <br />
               Scott, and last the opera bouffe ﬁnale. when 
               <br />
               Fort Garry was taken by Colonel Wolseiey. 
               <br />
               These incidents of so different nature were 
               <br />
               merely incidents. The main part was the 
               <br />
               resistance of twelve or thirteen inhabitants 
               <br />
               of the territory who did not want to come 
               <br />

               with such direction the Canadian government

               I was then at Rome, enjoying the happiness 
               <br />
               that the grand and imposing ceremonies and 
               <br />
               deliberations of the Ecumenical Council of the 
               <br />

               his church, when a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">telleg-rahpic</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despavtch</span> called 
               <br />
               me to Ottawa. Owing to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the.</span> importance of the 
               <br />
               summons, the sovereign pontiif dispensed me 
               <br />
               from the ordinary rules of the council for ob- 
               <br />
               taining leave of absence. His <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Holiness</span> granted 
               <br />
               me a private audience, blessed my mission and 
               <br />
               myselrf and added with emotion: ‘I bless the 
               <br />
               people of the Red river, on condition that they 
               <br />
               wild listen to your advice and live in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peace</span> and

               tier in Montreal, he said to me, with his usual

               frankness: ‘ I am happy to see you. We have 
               <br />
               blundered, and you must help us to undo the 
               <br />
               mischief.’ I proceeded with him to Ottawa, and 
               <br />
               remained in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capital</span> some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ten</span> days. I often 
               <br />
               met the Governor General and his ministers.

               <br />
