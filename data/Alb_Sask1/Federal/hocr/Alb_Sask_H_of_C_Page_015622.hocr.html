               protest against this distribution as made 
               <br />
               here. I understand that the voting white 
               <br />
               population of the .Athabaska district is only 
               <br />
               about 200. I am not sure that this is the 
               <br />
               correct ﬁgure but it is about that. They 
               <br />
               have only one post ofﬁce with a revenue of 
               <br />
               less than $100 per annum, and still they are 
               <br />
               going to outweigh some of those districts 
               <br />
               with a large population, many of them from 
               <br />
               the older provinces, taking an intelligent 
               <br />
               view and knowing all about our political 
               <br />
               institutions, having the same aspirations as 
               <br />
               the people of the older provinces. I under- 
               <br />
               stand that the settlers from the older pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are largely in the southern districts, 
               <br />
               whereas the Europeon elements are largely 
               <br />
               in the north. Without drawing any ‘Red 
               <br />
               Deer’ line I wish to point out that in all 
               <br />
               fairness this should be decided upon the 
               <br />
               principle of representation by population, 
               <br />
               and that if there is to be one man one vote 
               <br />
               that vote should have one value, and having 
               <br />
               decided on that I think we could very easily 
               <br />
               draw a plan that would be suitable and 
               <br />
               agreeable to both sides of the House. I 
               <br />
               trust that hon. gentlemen will not persist in 
               <br />
               pushing this matter through in its present 
               <br />
               form. Let them get both sides together 
               <br />
               and draw up a schedule that would be fair- 
               <br />
               ly satisfactory to all the people concerned.

               The Minister of the Interior ﬁnally stated 
               <br />
               that he was ready to listen to the views of 
               <br />
               the west if Mr. Haultain would dohis duty, 
               <br />
               but he was not ready to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">listen</span> to Mr. Haul- 
               <br />

               Mr. Haultain would call it together. _’1‘hat

               seems to me a very vain boast. We have 
               <br />
               these Bills before the House disbanding 
               <br />

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Probably they 
               <br />
               are around the missions. Since the com— 
               <br />
               mencement of the session the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Strathcona (Mr. Peter Talbot) has exer- 
               <br />
               cised special diligence in order to collect 
               <br />
               information and he has given information as- 
               <br />
               to the character of the development of that 
               <br />
               country since 1901. The member for Strath- 
               <br />
               cona stated yesterday evening that in Atha- 
               <br />
               baska there were found to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">21</span> stores, 13 
               <br />
               churches, 7 steamboats, 4 sawmills, 2 or 3 
               <br />
               planing mills, 1 ﬂour mill. On the Peace 
               <br />
               River he stated there was 18 stores, I think, 
               <br />
               20 churches, 2 ﬂour mills, 3 or 4 saw-mills, . 
               <br />
               and I think 2 planing mills; I forget the 
               <br />
               number of steamboats plying on the river. 
               <br />
               This goes to show that there is now a 
               <br />
               nucleus of population. You have there all 
               <br />
               the primary elements of civilization, 
               <br />
               churches, schools, stores, mills, and when 
               <br />
