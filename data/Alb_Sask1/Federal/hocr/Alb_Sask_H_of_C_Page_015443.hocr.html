               Crown, there is only one Crown in this 
               <br />
               country. Then let us for one moment 
               <br />
               see what would be the position if this 
               <br />
               power were handed over to the legis— 
               <br />
               lature of the new province in so far 
               <br />
               as section 16, of the contract deals with 
               <br />
               taxation by the province or taxation 
               <br />
               within the province. The position would 
               <br />
               be no worse from the standpoint of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway Company than it 
               <br />
               is to-day, assuming that we handed over 
               <br />
               to the new pr0vince that power. There- 
               <br />
               after. as I would understand it, this par- 
               <br />
               liament would still retain the legislative 
               <br />
               power of dealing with the contract so far 
               <br />
               as the Dominion is concerned, and the le- 
               <br />
               gislature of the province would receive, by 
               <br />
               virtue of this statute, the power to deal 
               <br />
               with that particular provision of the con- 
               <br />
               tract in so far as provincial and municipal 
               <br />
               taxation is concerned. The Dominion would 
               <br />
               be bound by every canon and standard of 
               <br />
               good faith to observe the contract, and the 
               <br />
               province would be equally bound by every 
               <br />
               canon and standard of good faith to ob- 
               <br />
               serve the same contract. That is the posi-

               tion as it occurs to me.

               have no power to deal with the matter at

               <br />
               he of absolutely observing contracts. If 
               <br />
               we handed over the subject matter of 
               <br />
               clause 16, so far as provincial and munici-

               pal taxation is concerned, to the new pro-

               vince, I would regard it as absolutely es— 
               <br />
               sential that the province. in attempting to 
               <br />
               deal with that matter, should deal with it 
               <br />
               upon the just. and fair terms which would be 
               <br />
               incumbent upon this parliament if we were 
               <br />
               dealing with it. For example, if the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister should adopt the suggestion of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from West Assiniboia and Should 
               <br />
               attempt to relieve the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west. and indeed relieve the Dominion as 
               <br />
               a whole from this exemption, parliament 
               <br />
               could only do it upon perfectly fair terms. 
               <br />
               In that connection let me say that possi- 
               <br />
               bly some of us in this country are not fully 
               <br />
               alive to what may be done in the way of 
               <br />
               taxation by the new provinces. In consi-

               dering that question a little as it presents 
               <br />
               itself to-day in Manitoba, I ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba has passed a statute, 
               <br />
               which is to be found in the consolidated sta- 
               <br />
               tutes of Manitoba, 1902, volume 2, chapter 
               <br />
               166, and which in effect provides that every 
               <br />
               railway company shall pay to the province 
               <br />
               such part of its gross earnings, not exceed- 
               <br />
               ing three per cent, as the lieutenant gov— 
               <br />
               ernor in Council shall determine. Under 
               <br />
               that statute the province of Manitoba has 
               <br />
               levied taxation upon the gross earnings of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, and during 
               <br />
               the year 1904 they collected from the Can- 
               <br />
               adian Paciﬁc Railway, under the terms of 
               <br />
               that statute, no less a sum than $56,450. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">So</span> that although the lands and buildings 
               <br />
               and other properties of the railway are 
               <br />
               exempt from taxation, it would appear—— 
               <br />
               I do not know that the question has been 
               <br />
               tested in the courts—but it would appear 
               <br />
               that notwithstanding this provision in the 
               <br />
               contract of 1881, the new provinces may, 
               <br />
               in the exercise of the same rights as those 
               <br />
               exercised by Manitoba, tax the gross earn- 
               <br />
               ings of the company, although they cannot 
               <br />
               tax its lands and property. Therefore the 
               <br />
               grievance in the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               might not be found so great as has been 
               <br />
               suggested. I myself, two years ago. in the 
               <br />
               session of 1903. when the members from 
               <br />
