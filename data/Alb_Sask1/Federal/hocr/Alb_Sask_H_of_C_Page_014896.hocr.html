               That is my view, Mr. Speaker, of the 
               <br />
               amendment proposed by my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               member for Carleton. I am indeed not sur- 
               <br />
               prised that there should be disagreement 
               <br />

               <br />
               takes one view of it, another another. I am 
               <br />
               not surprised that they cannot agree upon it.
