               found in the published report of that

               provincial election as Liberal candidate for 
               <br />
               North Toronto. He came to the meeting 
               <br />
               which selected Mr. Blain, and explained 
               <br />
               that it was only because his doctor said 
               <br />
               he was in too poor health that he did not

               reason he was thus described is the high 
               <br />
               regard which the people of Toronto have 
               <br />
               for the late Dalton McCarthy and his great

               attainments. I need not read What his

               nephew said, because his views are well

               the soundness of his opinions, he would not

               Three other gentlemen addressed that

               pose to judge of what type of politics these

               <br />
               should have no politics, or at least he should 
               <br />
