               tested against the separate school system

               Nothing was more clear, he said, than that

               each province should have absolute control

               dian parliament undertook to equip the Ter-

               <br />
               therefore, these Territories are in the same

               <br />
               came into the union in 1867. The govern-

               that separate schools existed there when 
               <br />
               the facts are that not one of the pamphlets 
               <br />
               advertising the advantages of the Northwest

               <br />

               <br />
               ﬁnd no reference of the kind; in fact, the

               last mentioned pamphlets state distinctly

               that the schools are non—sectarian and na— 
               <br />
               tional in character. If some inhabitants 
               <br />
               went into the west because separate schools 
               <br />
               existed there, not having learned from the 
               <br />
               literature that the schools did exist there. 
               <br />
               then also many people went into that coun-

               <br />
               that we cannot too strongly emphasize that 
               <br />
               part of the question. If clause 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act gives separate 
               <br />
               schools to the Northwest then what was 
               <br />
               the need in 1875 of passing the legislation of 
               <br />
               that date or what is the need of the clauses 
               <br />
               inserted in this Bill? Why not leave it to 
               <br />
               the constitution to decide? The British 
               <br />
               North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> Act either does or does not 
               <br />
               impose separate schools on the ‘new prov- 
               <br />
               inces as they are created. If there is any 
               <br />
               great doubt about the meaning of this clause 
               <br />
               is it not for the courts to determine whether 
               <br />
               we have a right to force separate schools 
               <br />
               on these provinces? The very conference 
               <br />
               which adopted clause 93 provided for the 
               <br />
               future admission of the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories and Rupert's Land, but there was not 
               <br />
               the slightest suggestion that when these 
               <br />
               should be admitted they would be subjected 
               <br />
               to the educational clauses which Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec had accepted by mutual agreement. 
               <br />
               It was not even suggested that the separate 
               <br />
               school system should be imposed on Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and New Brunswick, and by that fact 
               <br />
               have not the arguments presented by the 
               <br />
               government fallen to the ground? Many 
               <br />
               members of this House, I believe, have a 
               <br />
               wrpng conception of the French Canadians 
               <br />
               of Canada when they insinuate that not one 
               <br />
               of them can be found to support provincial 
               <br />
               rights and the constitution in this matter. 
               <br />
               Surely such arguments are not ﬂattering 
               <br />
               to the intelligence of the Roman Catholics of 
               <br />
               Quebec. I think they are wrong. During 
               <br />
               the past two years I have had the pleasure 
               <br />
               and the privilege of meeting and becoming 
               <br />
               acquainted with a number of our French 
               <br />
               Canadian fellow—citizens, and I have learned 
               <br />
               to admire and respect them. I recognize 
               <br />
               their ability in debate and their broad- 
               <br />
               minded grasp of public affairs and I believe 
               <br />
               that our thinking French Canadian Catholic 
               <br />
               fellow-citizens will realize the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">signiﬁc‘</span>

               auce of the old adage that it is a poor rule 
               <br />
               that will not work both ways, and they will 
               <br />
               readin see that if the British North America 
               <br />
               Act can be amended in this particular in- 
               <br />
               stance to suit the views of this government 
               <br />
               it may also again be amended and con-
