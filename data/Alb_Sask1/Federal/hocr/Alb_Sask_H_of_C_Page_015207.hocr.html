               for the cause in his own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituency;</span> and 
               <br />
               we all know that the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has a minister on tap in the city of Toronto, 
               <br />
               in the person of Mr. A. B. Aylesworth, who, 
               <br />
               it was some time ago reported, had joined, 
               <br />
               or was ready to join, the government, and 
               <br />
               he is ready, I believe, to replace either the 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Works or the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice when the Prime Minister asks 
               <br />
               him to join the cabinet. In view of all these 
               <br />
               things, then, I say, and I say it after full 
               <br />
               consideration, after visiting the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario, where I have tried to ascertain the 
               <br />
               opinion prevalent among the people, and 
               <br />
               after all that has been said in this House 
               <br />
               about opening seats, that it is the duty of 
               <br />

               <br />
               principles which they have enunciated in 
               <br />
               connection with this Bill, to hold these 
               <br />
               elections in the immediate future, to con- 
               <br />
               sult public opinion, and in some way to 
               <br />
               obtain the views of the people of Ontario 
               <br />
               in regard to this great constitutional ques-

               tion; and if they do not do so, it will be 
               <br />
               taken as an evidence of cowardice on their 
               <br />
               part. Now, let us have it out, let us have 
               <br />
               it out in Ontario, and let us have it out now ; 
               <br />
               and I make the challenge on behalf of my

               province—I am only speaking for myself—

               practice of consulting the people on a ques- 
               <br />
               tion of this kind. Let the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man ascertain what view the people of On- 
               <br />
               tario take on this question, the people of 
               <br />
               Ontario, who, as I pointed out the other 
               <br />
               day in this House, have as much interest as 
               <br />
               those of any other section of the country in 
               <br />
               the great west. As I pointed out here the 
               <br />
               other night, the great west has been largely 
               <br />
               settled by people from Ontario, who have 
               <br />
               taken Ontario institutions up there. while 
               <br />
               Ontario capital has been poured lavishly 
               <br />
               into that western country; and, there- 
               <br />
               fore, it is that the people of this 
               <br />
               benighted province of Ontario, this in- 
               <br />
               tolerant province, have at heart the 
               <br />
               welfare of the west, and they claim that 
               <br />
               the people of the west should be given the 
               <br />
               same opportunity of deciding this school

               people of the older provinces prior to con- 
               <br />
               federation. All the provinces that entered 
               <br />
               the confederation had an opportunity of 
               <br />
               passing on the school question and of saying 
               <br />
               in what way they were to restrict them-

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Mr. Speaker, before 
               <br />
               the House proceeds to the Orders of the 
               <br />
               Day, I would like the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), in connection 
               <br />
               with the draft of the schedules which he 
               <br />
               was good enough to send me last Friday. 
               <br />
               whether or not the schedules for Saskatche— 
               <br />
               wan have yet been completed and if not 
               <br />
               when we may expect to receive them. There 
               <br />
               was a map sent of the constituencies in 
               <br />
               both provinces with the delimitations of one 
               <br />
               only. We only received the one. Do I 
               <br />
               understand that we may rely on that map ?
