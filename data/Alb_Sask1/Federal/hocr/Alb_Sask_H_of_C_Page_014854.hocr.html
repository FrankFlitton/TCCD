               Then we had another disturbing question, 
               <br />
               the question of monopoly. Hon. gentlemen 
               <br />

               <br />
               province for some 20 years. That caused 
               <br />
               an agitation which far exceeds the school 
               <br />
               agitation and almost resulted in open re-

               We then had this settlement called the

               <br />

               Later on we had the school question, but 
               <br />
               all those agitations were not due to the Lib-

               <br />
               be charged to the Conservative party which

               In connection with the land situation, I 
               <br />
               would just say that I believe the govern- 
               <br />
               ment are making the best possible arrange- 
               <br />
               ment. The lands possibly belong to the 
               <br />
               provinces and so do the timbers and the 
               <br />
               minerals. The provinces are not getting 
               <br />
               their timber or mines and there has not 
               <br />
               been a word said about that, although one 
               <br />
               would fancy those came within provincial 
               <br />
               rights, but the only questions that seem to 
               <br />
               be causing any agitation are the control of 
               <br />
               the lands and the school question. I think 
               <br />
               it would be a great mistake for this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment to leave the control of the lands en- 
               <br />
               tirely in the hands of the provinces. As I 
               <br />
               have said, so far as Manitoba is concerned, 
               <br />
               there would never have been any question 
               <br />
               of provincial rights if the same liberal 
               <br />
               terms had been given Manitoba which are 
               <br />
               now being extended to the Territories. And 
               <br />
               the reason I claim that it would not be wise 
               <br />
               to leave the control of the lands to the new 
               <br />
               provinces is this, namely, that a different 
               <br />
               system of management would no doubt 
               <br />
               likely take place very soon. What would 
               <br />
               this mean. not only to the provinces them- 
               <br />
               selves, but the whole Dominion ? In the 
               <br />
               consideration Of this question we must 
               <br />
               bring business ideas into operation. W’e 
               <br />

               <br />

               continue our present policy. We must let

               <br />
               for some time to come. If we were to 
               <br />
               change that policy we would very seriously 
               <br />
               retard the ﬂow of immigration, and those

               new provinces would not go on and prosper 
               <br />
               as they ought to do. I think that the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition went so far as to say that 
               <br />
               some kind of a deal might be made with these 
               <br />
               provinces. under which homestead condi- 
               <br />
               tions might still exist, but I say that if we 
               <br />
               are to hand over those lands rtd the provinces. 
               <br />
               we must give them out and out. Either we 
               <br />
               should part with the sole control or keep 
               <br />
               it. But if we keep control and carry on the 
               <br />
               system now in operation, it is hard to realize 
               <br />
               what that will mean to Canada and what 
               <br />
               it means at present. The opposition claim 
               <br />
               that possibly the management would be as 
               <br />
               good under provincial control as under Dom— 
               <br />
               inion control. That might be, but what has 
               <br />
               been our experience in Manitoba ? We had 
               <br />
               no free lands in Manitoba but we had a lot 
               <br />
               of cheap lands, and what happened there ? 
               <br />
               instead of keeping these cheap lands for the 
               <br />
               settlers which would be some inducement 
               <br />
               for settlers to come into the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, very shortly after the change of 
               <br />
               government took place the policy of the Lib- 
               <br />
               eral government of Manitoba of holding 
               <br />
               the lands and giving them to the settlers 
               <br />
               was departed from and these lands, of which 
               <br />
               there were nearly one million acres, were 
               <br />
               turned over to companies, to speculators, at 
               <br />
               a low price and now, instead of these lands 
               <br />
               being sold to settlers at $1.50 to $3 an acre, 
               <br />
               as they were under the Manitoba Liberal 
               <br />
               government’s scheme of immigration. they 
               <br />
               are held by speculators and companies at 
               <br />
               from $5 to $10 an acre. This raising of the 
               <br />
               price of lands has practically Itopped immi- 
               <br />
               gration into Manitoba and there is that 
               <br />
               same danger in the west. Only last fall 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government turned over 256.- 
               <br />
               000 acres of land to a company at $1.56 an 
               <br />
               acre and within a few days, almost before 
               <br />
               the lands were'transferred, they were resold 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4</span> an acre and possibly these lands, 
               <br />
               which are fairly ﬁt for settlement, are held
