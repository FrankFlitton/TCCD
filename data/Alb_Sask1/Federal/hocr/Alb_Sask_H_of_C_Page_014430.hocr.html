               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">young</span> woman coiling her hair. The great

               ought to be. We know that the people of the 
               <br />
               Dominion were not consulted; neither were 
               <br />
               the people of the west. We know that Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain and his colleagues were not consulted. 
               <br />
               we know that neither the Minister of Interior 
               <br />
               nor the Minister of Finance were consulted. 
               <br />
               Do you know whether anybody else at Ottawa 
               <br />
               was consulted ? Have you heard whether the 
               <br />
               Papal Legato was consulted? . Are you 
               <br />
               people of the west to be trampled upon by him? 
               <br />
               it is as a western man that I appeal to you 
               <br />
               to—uight, and especially to the Liberal party, 
               <br />
               to let its voice be heard in no uncertain sound.

               <br />

               stated that he was consulted in regard to 
               <br />
