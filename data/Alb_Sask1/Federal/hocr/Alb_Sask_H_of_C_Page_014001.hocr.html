               in good to both nations. No one will gainsay

               The policy announced in the speech of 
               <br />
               granting provincial autonomy for the North-

               west Territories marks an important epoch 
               <br />
               in our history. It is thirty-four years ago 
               <br />
               since the province of Manitoba was admit- 
               <br />
               ted into confederation and given all those 
               <br />
               rights, and that status in the federation 
               <br />
               which is enjoyed by every province in the 
               <br />
               Dominion, and at this moment it may be op- 
               <br />
               portune to indulge in a retrospective glance 
               <br />
               and recall some of the advances and de- 
               <br />
               velopments that have occurred since con- 
               <br />
               federation. Thirty—eight years ago when 
               <br />
               confederation was established it embraced 
               <br />
               but four provinces and covered a territory 
               <br />
               stretching between Lake Superior and the 
               <br />
               sea. Each one of these provinces was then 
               <br />
               imbued mainly by local prejudices and limit— 
               <br />

               common tie save that of the constitution

               which bound them together. Our total trade

               <br />
               to bear tribute to the foresight of that great 
               <br />
               statesman who presided at the inception of 
               <br />
               Canada’s birth and who watched over this 
               <br />
               country when in her swaddling clothes. We 
               <br />
               can all, irrespective of party, regard him as 
               <br />
               one Who did great things for Canada and 
               <br />
               whose name will always be embalmed in the 
               <br />
               history of this Dominion. In 1870, when the 
               <br />
               Northwest was a seething mass of rebellion 
               <br />
               and discontent, the Territories were brought 
               <br />
               into confederation. In 1871, British Columbia 
               <br />
               entered the union. In 1873 the little island 
               <br />
               of Prince Edward followed her example and 
               <br />
               in 1875 the Northwest was placed under the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Jurisdiction</span> of a lieutenant governor. Then 
               <br />
               in 1880 all the British possessions in North 
               <br />
               America were placed under the Dominion of 
               <br />
               our federal parliament with the exception 
               <br />
               of Newfoundland. Then followed the con- 
               <br />
               struction of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, 
               <br />
               which bound all the provinces together and 
               <br />
               gave to the eastern provinces a common 
               <br />
               interest in the western heritage, and gave 
               <br />
               birth to that newer patriotism which has 
               <br />
               shown such rapid development in the last 
               <br />
               few years. Following the building of this 
               <br />
               railway, came new settlements. From all 
               <br />
               portions of the habitable globe came settlers 
               <br />
               into this new country, so that no less than 
               <br />
               three hundred and twenty-four thousand 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eight</span> hundred and ninety-eight people during 
               <br />
               the past four years have gone into this new 
               <br />
               land—a number exceeding the population of 
               <br />
               some of our provinces and equalling that of 
               <br />
               others. When we stop to consider the fact 
               <br />
               also, that during the past four years 94.79] 
               <br />
               homesteads have been taken up in that coun- 
               <br />
               try, we can form some conception of the 
               <br />
               rapidity of its growth. In those western 
               <br />
               territories, which are to be given provincial 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">autonomy,</span> there exists a country which ex-

               ceeds in extent the countries of France, 
               <br />
               Germany and Italy taken together. This 
               <br />
               is indeed a precious heritage, this great 
               <br />
               Northwest land, which to-day forms part of 
               <br />
               our territory and in which we are about to in- 
               <br />
               augurate a system of government which will 
               <br />
               place that country on an equal footing with 
               <br />
               the other provinces in confederation. Realiz-
