               cupy, on this question, a much different

               paign of some ten years ago in the county 
               <br />
               of Haldimand. The fact was referred to 
               <br />
               that, on that occasion, the ex-Minister of the 
               <br />

               the actions which have taken place and have 
               <br />
               caused that hon. gentleman‘s (Mr. Sifton’s)

               retirement. Therefore, for the last ten

               years, my position on the school question

               has been deﬁned. I also fought on the 
               <br />
               school question in 1895 in Cardwell, and 
               <br />
               again in June 1896 was the school question 
               <br />
               fought out in my riding. From that day 
               <br />
               to this, I have remained ﬁrm and free, so 
               <br />
               far as my constituency was concerned, upon 
               <br />
               this question, and I have been thrice en- 
               <br />
               dorsed upon it. Therefore, I simply rise to 
               <br />
               announce to this House as I announced the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst time I spoke in the House and as I 
               <br />
               have previously announced to individual 
               <br />
               members, that I am, like the ex-Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior, absolutely opposed to the 
               <br />
               education clauses as submitted in the Auto- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nomy</span> Bills; that I will oppose them and 
               <br />
               oppose them unalterably. 
               <br />

               Mr. T. S. SPROULE (East Grey). I do 
               <br />
               not rise to anticipate the discussion on the 
               <br />
               Bill that will shortly be before us or to 
               <br />
               explain to the House where I stand on 
               <br />
               the question—I think my position is pretty 
               <br />
               well known. But I rise merely to say that, 
               <br />
               so far as the Prime Minister has given this 
               <br />
               House his conﬁdence, and so far as he has 
               <br />
               explained the position, all is well. But 
               <br />
               some of us thought he might well have 
               <br />
               gone a little further. Perhaps to expect 
               <br />
               that would be to ask him to anticipate 
               <br />
               events. He did not indicate in any way 
               <br />
               who is to be the incumbent of the oﬂ‘ice
