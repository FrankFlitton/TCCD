               of the present government were avowing‘

               <br />
               was telling the people of the county of 
               <br />
               Lambton that I also believed these principles 
               <br />

               for Manitoba as conscientiously and as 
               <br />
               honestly then as I am now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying</span> to the 
               <br />
               present government: You should stand to 
               <br />
               your principle of provincial rights, you 
               <br />
               should stand by your own doctrine of no 
               <br />
               coercion in matters of education for the 
               <br />

               ciples you avowed in 1896 and the people 
               <br />
               will love, honour and respect you. But, if 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> do not hat-ken to the people to-day, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your</span> government will go down to deserved 
               <br />
               ignominy and defeat. If public men or 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments</span> can avow certain principles, 
               <br />
               agitate those principles to the extent of 
               <br />
               defeating a government so as to establish 
               <br />
               those principles, and, when they attain 
               <br />
               power laugh at the professions they made 
               <br />
               and cast the principles they advocated to the 
               <br />
               winds, they are aiming a blow at public 
               <br />
               morality, they are lowering the position of 
               <br />
               public men, and we need not wonder at 
               <br />
               people scoﬂing at the idea that public men 
               <br />
               can be honest. I believe that disgrace and 
               <br />
               defeat should await any public man or any 
               <br />
               government in Canada that will not fulﬁl 
               <br />
               promises made to the people. And, when 
               <br />
               you come to realize that the present govern- 
               <br />
               ment have not been carrying out their pro- 
               <br />
               mises ever since they came into power, 
               <br />

               <br />
               professed in 1896 that if they were given the

               ly doubled them. They told the people

               that they would reduce the taxes. They 
               <br />

               the only plank in their platform that was 
               <br />

               The people of Ontario, last J anu— 
               <br />
               ary, declared that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">didenot</span> believe in 
               <br />
               double—dealing, that they had had enough 
               <br />
               of corrupt government in that province, and 
               <br />
               the old government went down and out. 
               <br />
               Honesty among public men is regarded as 
               <br />
               necessary by our people. and they will not 
               <br />
               condone wrong-doing. This government has 
               <br />
               had an opportunity to create a unity of 
               <br />
               feeling between the races in Canada as 
               <br />
               no government has ever had before. Had 
               <br />

               <br />
               same as the principles they avowed in 1896, 
               <br />
               they would have given to these new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prev</span> 
               <br />
               vinces absolute control of education and 
               <br />
               would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thereby</span> have cemented the bonds be- 
               <br />
               tween the races. Look back at the situation 
               <br />
               created in 1896, when race and religious 
               <br />
               feeling ran rampant in this land, when 
               <br />

               <br />
               cannot you see that feeling is more intensi- 
               <br />
               fied than it was in 1896? Have not the

               <br />
               petitions to this House, have they not had

               will not quench? And, if this government 
               <br />
               forces separate schools upon the new pro- 
               <br />
               rinces, they throw into the political soil 
               <br />
               of Canada a seed that cannot be uprooted 
               <br />
               for all time to come. We can never make 
               <br />
               Canada a great nation, we can never make 
               <br />
               Canada a united nation, we can never make 
               <br />
               our people a united people until we blot out 
               <br />
               the strife and ill-feeling that is abroad in 
               <br />
               the land to-day. This feeling is the great-

               est detriment to our national growth; it 
               <br />
