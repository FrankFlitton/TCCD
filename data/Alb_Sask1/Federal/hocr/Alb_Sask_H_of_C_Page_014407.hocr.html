               chooses him. But the judgment of the

               of the people on their policy? They have 
               <br />
               not. This policy was not before the peo-

               ple in the last election, and so there has 
               <br />
               not been the opportunity for the people to 
               <br />
               express themselves upon it. The only con- 
               <br />
               clusion that we can come to is that the 
               <br />
               government are afraid of the people and 
               <br />

               ister to ﬁll the present vacancy because the 
               <br />
               effect of that would be to give the people 
               <br />
               an opportunity to express their opinions upon 
               <br />
               this important measure. The ﬁnancial in-

               west are involved; their whole future is 
               <br />
               involved. Yet, they have no one in the cab-

               inet to speak for them or determine their 
               <br />
               rights,—the people of the Northwest must

               member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) referred 
               <br />
               last year. Yet, the Prime Minister declares 
               <br />
               over and over again that he admires the 
               <br />

               His conduct, in my opinion, is the very re- 
               <br />
               verse of all that; he violates every prin-

               ciple of constitutional government by the 
               <br />
               course he pursues. He acts like the Czar 
               <br />
               of Russia, deliberately against the people’s 
               <br />
               rights and wishes. The people are given 
               <br />
               no opportunity to determine what their leg-

               dited representative, their Prime Minister, 
               <br />
