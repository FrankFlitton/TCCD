               west government ever since Mr. Haultain has 
               <br />
               held the helm. The premier once said that if

               persons wanted to know his policy they would 
               <br />

               it also manifests itself elsewhere. Mr. Haul-

               tain may well tell any one seeking his policy 
               <br />
               to look around. The schools that dot our prai- 
               <br />
               ries are the pride of our towns; the public 
               <br />
               works that are everywhere visible for the use. 
               <br />

               <br />
               to-date agricultural department ; and the vigi- 
               <br />
               lant watch over the Northwest at Ottawa, all 
               <br />
               speak of a policy which the people of this 
               <br />
               country ought to be proud of and to this policy 
               <br />
               has to be added the statesmanlike proposals 
               <br />
               by which Mr. Haultain has continually urged 
               <br />
               we should reach the provincial status. Eye

               <br />

               Mr. Scott was so strongly in favour of Mr.

               <br />
               of party feelings has sunk his personal con-

               victions and his past record, and who to-day 
               <br />
               supports a Bill that gives two provinces in- 
               <br />

               <br />
               them to be ﬁxed ; that refuses the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces the ownership of their public domain, 
               <br />
               and that takes away from these new pro-

               It will be noticed that the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(311'.</span> Scott) speaks out for the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. What rights ? The rights they 
               <br />
               secured under the Act of 1875. But these 
               <br />
               are not the rights the hon. gentleman (Mr. 
               <br />
               Scott) is contending for, because he says 
               <br />
               the rights given the minority under the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 have been whittled away by the Ter— 
               <br />
               ritorial government so that with one breath 
               <br />
               he contradicts what he say with another. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman takes the position that 
               <br />
               George Brown was in favour of ﬂJese rights 
               <br />
               that were to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maintained</span> for all time 
               <br />
               once they were crystallized into law, and he 
               <br />
               says that he takes the same ground as 
               <br />
               George Brown. but as a matter of fact the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman (Mr. Scott) is only contend— 
               <br />
               ing to-day for minority rights which he says 
               <br />
               are far less than were given to the minority 
               <br />
               under the Act of 1875. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">xhon.</span> gentleman
