               I presume that Mr. Tarte was correctly

               reported in this. I have said that while

               I respect my Catholic friends I cannot

               sympathize with them when they say that 
               <br />
               they must have religion taught in the 
               <br />
               schools. In the province of Manitoba in 
               <br />
               my own town. we have six schools, but we 
               <br />
               have no religion, there is no dogma <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taught</span> 
               <br />
               in them, we do not even read the bible 
               <br />
               but I believe we have moral teachers. As 
               <br />
               a trustee I think that is one of the things

               is a Catholic or Protestant. The Minister

               of Finance (Mr. Fielding) laid stress on the 
               <br />
               fact of the teachers of Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               being allowed to wear a certain garb. We 
               <br />
               do not ask what kind of garb they wear, 
               <br />
               we do not ask whether they are Catholic 
               <br />
               or Protestant, we simply ask that they pass 
               <br />

               is the case with the Roman Catholics of

               are two systems of schools—there is not one. 
               <br />
               in my constituency. In the large towns 
               <br />
               most of the Catholics go to the naticnal 
               <br />
               schools. Since I came to Ottawa I have 
               <br />
               made it a point to inquire, I have spoken 
               <br />
               to a great many Catholics, and I have not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span> one man or one woman to'tell me 
               <br />
               that they did not prefer the national <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools.</span> 
               <br />
               because they believed that their children 
               <br />
               got a better education to ﬁt them for the 
               <br />
               work of life. Of course, in Quebec the cir~ 
               <br />
               cumstances are different; there they are 
               <br />
               practically of one religion and one people. 
               <br />
               although there seems to be no disposition 
               <br />
               to disturb the Protestants in their separate 
               <br />
               schools. But take the Dominion as a whole. 
               <br />
               the conditions are better adapted for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nation</span> 
               <br />
               al schools. I say positively that the people- 
               <br />
               in the Northwest, the people in my consti-

               <br />
               there are men in my constituency closely
