               opposite pronounce the most aggravated of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the largest share of public attention. 1 may 
               <br />
               tell you. Mr. Speaker, that I gave the pledge 
               <br />
               which was read in the House, that I signed it, 
               <br />
               that I gave it voluntarily. 1 went of my own 
               <br />
               accord to my bishop and gave the pledge to 
               <br />
               him, as a Roman Catholic, dealing with the 
               <br />
               head of his church in the diocese to which he 
               <br />
               belonged. I gave it to him, and I mean to 
               <br />
               stand by it, let the consequences be What they 
               <br />
               may. I am speaking for myself alone, I am 
               <br />
               dealing with the pledge I gave, and I say that 
               <br />
               having given, having handed it over voluntarily 
               <br />
               to the bishop of the diocese to which I belong. 
               <br />
               from that day to this I have never been asked 
               <br />
               to account for that pledge which I gave, nor 
               <br />
               has my attention been ever drawn to the fact, 
               <br />
               up to the present time, that I have not fulﬁlled 
               <br />
               it. but the pledge was delivered over to the

               position I occupy in this House, not because of 
               <br />
               my personal merit, but because of the favour 
               <br />
               and friendship of my honoured leader (Mr, 
               <br />

               the good opinion of hon. members on both sides
