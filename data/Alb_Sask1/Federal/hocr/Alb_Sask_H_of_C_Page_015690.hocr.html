               <br />
               upon the understanding that the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition might make any observa- 
               <br />
               tions he chase in connection therewith. I 
               <br />
               thought myself I might suggest some ver- 
               <br />
               bal changes. Section 16, with regard to edu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ment of the Act. Then I wanted to have 
               <br />
               section 22 reconsidered, that is the Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay clause, which was carried. If agree-

               able to the leader of the opposition, I will 
               <br />
               take that up now. Section 22 as it now 
               <br />
               reads contains some words at the end to 
               <br />

               My hon. friend will remember that this 
               <br />
               provision is intended to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁect</span> to an 
               <br />
               agreement made between the imperial au- 
               <br />
               thorities and the Canadian government at 
               <br />
               the time the lands of the Hudson Bay Com- 
               <br />
               pany were acquired. The provision then 
               <br />
               made was that no law would be passed 
               <br />
               which would in any way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁect</span> the condi- 
               <br />
               tions of that agreement. The representatives 
               <br />
               of the Hudson Bay Company say that the 
               <br />
               words to which I have just referred would 
               <br />
               be a change in the agreement, and they ask 
               <br />
               that these words he struck out. I do not 
               <br />
               think that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they~</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company’s position at all, but as they ob- 
               <br />
               ject to them. and as it is made a conditlon 
               <br />
               of the transfer by the imperial authorities, 
               <br />
               perhaps we had better adhere strictly to

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I intend to move 
               <br />
               an amendment to section 24, or to redraft 
               <br />
               it in this way : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               The Nonthwest Territories Act, being chapter 
               <br />
               50 ot' the Revised Statutes in all Acts amended 
               <br />
               thereof, are hereby repealed as respects said 
               <br />
               clauses, provided notwithstanding such repeal 
               <br />
               so much of the said Acts and of any order or 
               <br />
               regulation made thereunder as was in force im- 
               <br />
               mediately before the coming into force of this 
               <br />
               Act, and is not inconsistent with anything con- 
               <br />
               tained in this Act, or as to which this Act con- 
               <br />
               tains no provision intended as a substitute 
               <br />
               therefor, shall continue in force in the said 
               <br />
               clauses in pursuance of and for the purpose of 
               <br />
               section 15 of this Act.

               That, I think. might make unnecessary 
               <br />
               the concluding three lines of the hon. gen— 
               <br />
               tleman's amendment. But I will com- 
               <br />
               municate this section to him. and he may 
               <br />
               see how far it will be necessary to make 
               <br />
               the change. The ﬁrst part of his amend- 
               <br />
               ment meets my view, but the three last lines 
               <br />
               might be unnecessary in view of this new 
               <br />
               clause I have suggested. I intended to add 
               <br />
               another section -to clause 15 in respect to 
               <br />
               criminal procedure in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. As my hon. friend is aware, in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories the criminal proced- 
               <br />
               ure differs somewhat from the proeedure in 
               <br />
               other parts of the Dominion and in order 
               <br />
               to cover the point I think this proviso may 
               <br />
               be useful. I will consider that also.
