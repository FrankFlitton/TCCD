               the statement made by the Papal ablegate

               substance of what was stated in Mr. Rogers

               ter and it was not denied; grant. for the

               moment, that the Papal ablegate had the

               coupled the school question up with the

               boundary question where he had no juris-

               There is the crux; that is a thing that

               denied by the government. The kernel of 
               <br />
               the whole matter lies in this that the able-

               about this school question and discussing 
               <br />
               the matter in all its shapes and forms. while

               the people of the west and the minister from

               Is there any wonder why the country has
