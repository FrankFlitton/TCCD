               and I hope to give some ﬁgures presently to 
               <br />
               prove it. The hon. member for Calgary (Mr.

               M. S. McCarthy) has been working on this

               has got out many facts and ﬁgures about it. 
               <br />
               I think he deserves the thanks of both sales 
               <br />
               for the labour he has undertaken. I do not

               know how long the government have had 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures, but I think they might have

               are entitled to have the ﬁgures from the

               What does the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               reply to the facts and arguments of. my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Calgary ? He begins by talking 
               <br />
               about partisans. He accuses the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Calgary of being a partisan merely 
               <br />
               because he has taken a lot of care—which 
               <br />
               as far as I know, nobody can ﬁnd fault 
               <br />
               with—and tried to show his side of the case. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that if the minister had any 
               <br />
               real answer to these ﬁgures. he would not 
               <br />
               have spoken about partisans. This is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion that ought not to be argued on such a 
               <br />
               basis. My hon. friend from Calgary offered 
               <br />
               an amendment. that this matter should be 
               <br />
               left to the judges. I submit that, while the 
               <br />
               question of referring to the judges is one for 
               <br />
               parliament to decide. it is clear that the 
               <br />
               arrangement of the constituencies is a mat- 
               <br />
               ter that could be readily determined by the 
               <br />
               board of judges proposed by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Calgary. The Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               yesterday made a most extraordinary remark 
               <br />
               with regard to this proposition. He said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The contention that an injustice has been 
               <br />
               done I submit has not been made out before 
               <br />
               the House. I submit it cannot be made out, 
               <br />
               and as I said in the beginning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> would certainly 
               <br />
               be a very fortunate body of judges who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> 
               <br />
               give a decision favourable to a proposal now 
               <br />
               before the House and escape criticism as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">active</span> 
               <br />
               partisans by hon. gentlemen when their posi— 
               <br />
               tion had been ignored. 
               <br />

               If the hon. minister is so satisﬁed with this 
               <br />
               case. why does he object to leaving it to the 
               <br />
               judges ? Hon. members on this side have 
               <br />
               stated that it‘ it were left to the judges we 
               <br />
               w3uld be satisﬁed. do not think it was a 
               <br />
               wise criticism on the part of the Minister of 
               <br />
