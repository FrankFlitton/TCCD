               ing these new provinces to handle the lands 
               <br />
               themselves. They are more interested in 
               <br />
               getting good settlers than we can possibly 
               <br />
               be, because it is they who will suffer if 
               <br />
               settlement is retarded. Looking at it from 
               <br />
               every standpoint, I do not see what we have 
               <br />
               to gain by administering the lands from here. 
               <br />
               After all the money is gone, which we will 
               <br />
               get from the sales of lands in the future, we 
               <br />
               will have to dip into the Dominion treasury 
               <br />
               to pay the running expenses in connection 
               <br />
               with the management of lands in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> 
               <br />
               west, so that to continue the present policy 
               <br />
               would be suicidal, if only from a ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               standpoint. There are many other consider- 
               <br />
               ations I might dwell upon, such as the 
               <br />
               giving away of vast coal lands. Last 
               <br />
               fall a large area <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was,</span> given away at 
               <br />
               $1.25 an acre and other large areas 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">handed</span> over to companies at insigniﬁcant 
               <br />
               sums. That is a policy which ought to be 
               <br />
               stopped. If these coal lands are not of any 
               <br />
               value we might as well hand them over to 
               <br />
               the Territories. We might as well do that in 
               <br />
               any event for all that we are getting for 
               <br />
               them. To say that the new provinces would 
               <br />
               squander and mismanage the lands is an in- 
               <br />
               sult to the people. The only good reason ad- 
               <br />
               vanced so far is that advanced by the First 
               <br />
               Minister, thatthe provinces might be in dis- 
               <br />
               tress for money; but I do not think that 
               <br />
               these local goverments, which will have the 
               <br />
               same ability to borrow as other local gov- 
               <br />
               ernments, need be in any want of money, 
               <br />
               and we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can:</span> as well afford to give them a 
               <br />
               reasonable monetary annual payment as we 
               <br />
               can to the other provinces. The other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces have their lands and yet get an 
               <br />
               annual subsidy of so much per head. Why 
               <br />
               not treat the Territories im- like manner ‘1 
               <br />
               They should be given the same rights as the 
               <br />
               older provinces and be treated with as much 
               <br />
               fairness and consideration, and I have not 
               <br />
               yet heard any good reason why this should 
               <br />
               not be done.

               for once he gets a ward in Chancery, he 
               <br />
               wants to keep it there all his life. Evidently 
               <br />
               that is his intention in the case of these new 
               <br />
               provinces. He wishes to keep them as wards 
               <br />
               in Chancery and to manage their affairs for 
               <br />
               all time. He did tell us, when he introduced 
               <br />
               these Bills, that he was putting on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               emancipation of that country, but evidently 
               <br />
               his intention is to keep the west in the condi- 
               <br />
               tion of wards for all time. The new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are not to be free to administer their 
               <br />
               own public lands but are to be treated as 
               <br />
               wards and the Dominion is to be their per— 
               <br />
               petual trustee. Perhaps the right hon. gen-

               tleman is more anxious about the patronage

               than anything else and thinks that his sunny

               measures will be promoted by having this

               If the lands of Keewatiu are to be divided 
               <br />

               <br />
               will the lands, which are to be included in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario, be placed absolutely 
               <br />
               in the possesion of that province '2 If that 
               <br />

               meted out to Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 
               <br />
               and will they enter into full possession of 
               <br />
               those lands ? It seems to me that unless

               that the precedent they are now setting

               also claimed by the province of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               And I have no doubt, from the representa-
