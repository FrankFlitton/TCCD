               Mr. FIT‘ZPATRICK. My hon. friend says 
               <br />
               it has no connection. Then, I will go a step 
               <br />
               further. I am sorry to say it has con- 
               <br />
               siderable connection in the way of criticism. 
               <br />
               I think it has been the most violent oppon- 
               <br />
               ent that the government has had. I would 
               <br />
               refer my hon. friend to the articles published 
               <br />
               in 1896 by the ‘ Northwest Review ’ in which 
               <br />
               they criticised my right hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the government more severely than 
               <br />
               any other paper in the country. They even 
               <br />
               went to the length of comparing him in effect 
               <br />
               with Judas Iscariot among the other vagar- 
               <br />
               ies which they indulged in. This is an organ 
               <br />
               for which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this.</span> government cannot be held 
               <br />
               responsible. I do not think it is necessary 
               <br />
               for me to go very much further. But, I 
               <br />
               would like to draw the attention of the 
               <br />
               House-to the fact that the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto (Mr. Foster) this afternoon 
               <br />
               said, in speaking of this interview that took 
               <br />
               place down at the delegate’s house, that 
               <br />
               both parties to the interview agreed to take 
               <br />
               the public into their conﬁdence. Nothing 
               <br />
               could be further from what I conceive to be 
               <br />
               the fact. The parties to the confer- 
               <br />
               ence, as far as I can judge of what 
               <br />
               occurred, both respected the obligation that 
               <br />
               is binding upon gentlemen. The delegate is 
               <br />
               a gentleman and I presume <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> this applies 
               <br />
               with equal truth to Mr. Campbell. I am 
               <br />
               sure that he is a gentleman but the man 
               <br />
               who violated the conﬁdence of these gentle- 
               <br />
               men is Mr. Rogers. This is the man 
               <br />
               who takes it upon himself to tell us what 
               <br />
               took place out of his presence and without 
               <br />
               his personal knowledge. How is it that Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell has not corroborated this inter- 
               <br />
               view ? The delegate has made the state- 
               <br />
               ment only because this document has been 
               <br />
               published, only because his conﬁdence has 
               <br />
               been violated. That is the only reason. 
               <br />
               The delegate has not taken anybody into 
               <br />
               his conﬁdence. I appeal to the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition to tell me 
               <br />
               whether or not he thinks that this confer— 
               <br />
               ence having taken place under these cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances. Mr. Rogers was justiﬁed in 
               <br />
               violating it. That is what strikes me at the 
               <br />
               outset. How is it Mr. Rogers makes this 
               <br />
               declaration ? Why did Mr. Campbell not 
               <br />
               make it if he had any declaration to make ? 
               <br />
               If it were necessary for somebody outside 
               <br />
               of Mr. Campbell to make this statement 
               <br />
               why did Mr. Roblin not make it ? 
               <br />
               Mr. Roblin, the head of the government, 
               <br />
               not issue this manifesto ? Does his silence

               tention of the House to the interview with 
               <br />

               as I am concerned, and I am speaking en- 
               <br />

               the delegate leave this country. He never

               <br />
               I can prevent it. There shall be, there can be 
               <br />
               no misunderstanding about my position. He 
               <br />
               has brought about peace in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, that peace has been- maintained 
               <br />
               since 1896 and I trust that he shall con-

               Campbell got down there what occurred 
               <br />
