               effective remedy than the one he has men- 
               <br />
               tioned. Assuming that we were to make a 
               <br />
               franchise Act for the new province, that 
               <br />
               would be absolutely at variance with the 
               <br />
               principles which obtains in the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. The principle that ought to apply 
               <br />
               to these Territories is that which we apply 
               <br />
               to the other provinces, namely, to allow the 
               <br />
               matter to be dealt with by the province after 
               <br />
               it is formed. If my hon. friend prefers to 
               <br />
               allow the matter to remain in abeyance, so 
               <br />
               as to consider the difﬁculty, I shall be glad

               hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. M. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘8.</span> Mc— 
               <br />
               Carthy) has referred to two possible evils in 
               <br />
               the present system ; and we should not con- 
               <br />
               tinue evils until a future date, if we 
               <br />
               can prevent them now. There were two 
               <br />
               matters referred to by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Montmorency (Mr. Casgrain) when he 
               <br />
               introduced his Bill in 1904, which were not 
               <br />
               dealt with by parliament at that time, be- 
               <br />
               cause the then Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) asked that the matter should 
               <br />
               be adjourned. That was equivalent to an 
               <br />
               admission that the subject required atten- 
               <br />
               tion. Nothing however has been done 
               <br />
               since, and we are' now practically de- 
               <br />
               claring that these evils shall continue 
               <br />
               until another body shall provide some- 
               <br />
               thing to the contrary. I am quite sure that 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) will 
               <br />

               <br />
               can get a certiﬁcate from the enumerator 
               <br />

               which everybody who knows anything

               <br />

               description of an individual we can possibly

               <br />
               unlerator who signs the certiﬁcate, and he 
               <br />
               can give these certiﬁcates without limitation. 
               <br />
               He can recognize any number of agents for a

               particular polling place. In our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0W1!</span> law 
               <br />
               that evil has been guarded against because 
               <br />
               it is expressly provided that the corres- 
               <br />
               ponding oﬂicial—the deputy returning ofﬁcer 
               <br />
               —-cun only give two certiﬁcates for each 
               <br />
               party. He can give two certiﬁcates to 
               <br />
               agents for the Liberal candidate and two 
               <br />
               for the Conservative. That is the express 
               <br />
               limitation, but in the Territories there is 
               <br />
               no limitation whatever. Instead of two, 
               <br />
               he can give 200. It must be apparent to 
               <br />
               anybody that such a power in the Territories 
               <br />
               is bractically putting into the hands of an 
               <br />
               unscrupulous enumerator the power to elect 
               <br />
               any person he chooses. There does not seem 
               <br />
               to be any question about the danger from 
               <br />
               this if we are to judge the ofﬁcials con-

               <br />
               were to give to certain ofﬁcials in Ontario, 
               <br />
               as we know them, the power given in the- 
               <br />
               Territories, those ofﬁcials could elect any 
               <br />
               man they chose. 1 would ask the Minister 
               <br />

               Mr. BARKER. I am sorry to say that 
               <br />
               there are almost a majority of the people 
               <br />
               who support that sort of thing. Not quite 
               <br />
               a majority at the present time in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ontario,</span> 
               <br />
               but a large minority who condoned that kind 
               <br />
               of thing for years. Not enumerators ap- 
               <br />
               pointed for the moment, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂicials</span> holding 
               <br />
               responsible positions under the government 
               <br />
               of the province have been notoriously guilty 
               <br />
               in that respect.
