               been unnecessarily aroused and the time of 
               <br />
               parliament unnecessarily wasted. I wish 
               <br />
               for :1 few moments to direct the attention 
               <br />
               of this House to the important question as 
               <br />
               to whether the parliament of ‘anada has 
               <br />
               the power to pass this legislation. When 
               <br />
               the British North America Act was passed 
               <br />
               in 1867, there was I venture to think, no 
               <br />
               power given to the parliament of Canada to 
               <br />
               carve out new provinces. The only section 
               <br />
               which deals with the admission of new 
               <br />
               provinces and with the admission of these 
               <br />
               new Territories—which by the way were 
               <br />
               then not part of Canada and are not pos- 
               <br />
               sibly covered by the Act—the only section 
               <br />
               that deals with this at all is section 146, 
               <br />
               and I think the Minister of Justice will not 
               <br />
               endeavour to contend that under section 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MU</span> the parliament of Canada has the pow- 
               <br />
               er to pass this legislation. I must confess 
               <br />
               that I would have considered it only fair 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the members on this side of the House, 
               <br />
               if the Minister of Justice had been 
               <br />
               thoughtful enough at'an early stage of 
               <br />
               this debate to have answered, if answer 
               <br />
               were possible the able argument of the hon. 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition. His silence 
               <br />
               has placed as in the position that we are 
               <br />
               compelled in advance to criticise a pro- 
               <br />
               position which should have been established 
               <br />
               beyond all doubt by the government. The 
               <br />
               onus does not lie on us to show that this 
               <br />
               parliament has not the power to pass this
