               age in this respect. A good while ago an. 
               <br />
               order was sent to the Bureau to publish a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speech</span> of mine on the Autonomy Bil], ac-

               companied by a request to state What it 
               <br />
               would cost. The reply came stating the cost 
               <br />
               and shortly after I understood the order was 
               <br />
               given. After waiting for a considerable 
               <br />
               time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the speech I had inquiry made 
               <br />
               again, but could not ﬁnd out whether 
               <br />
               the order had been received or not. How- 
               <br />
               ever, it was arranged that the speech should 
               <br />
               be published according to the prices ﬁxed 
               <br />
               by the Bureau. After waiting some weeks 
               <br />
               they sent a speech which was not at all the 
               <br />
               one ordered. but a mere side speech, not di- 
               <br />
               rectly on the question at all, and the publi- 
               <br />
               cation of which would not cost one—quarter 
               <br />
               that of the other. At the time the order was 
               <br />
               sent the type was not distributed, but it 
               <br />
               has since been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distributed,</span> and to publish 
               <br />
               this speech now would require the whole 
               <br />
               thing to be set up again, and it probably 
               <br />
               could not be got out before the session is 
               <br />
               over. I think it is high time that the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of parliament was drawn to these things. 
               <br />
               Somebody must be in fault; somebody 
               <br />
