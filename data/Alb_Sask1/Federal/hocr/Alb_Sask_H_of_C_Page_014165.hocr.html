               this parliament. I make that statement after 
               <br />
               due deliberation. But, somebody will say: 
               <br />
               What of that ; if you Liberals cannot form 
               <br />
               a government we Conservatives will take 
               <br />
               charge. Will you? I doubt it. I have 
               <br />
               no right to speak for my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, but if I know him 
               <br />
               at all I venture to remark that he would 
               <br />
               shrink from the formation of a govern-

               ment in which he would be obliged to draw 
               <br />
               religious lines. As a high-minded man, with 
               <br />
               due regard for the future of his country, 
               <br />
               he would shrink from the formation of a 
               <br />
               government under which he would be oblig- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed</span> to exclude from ofﬁce and vote and pow- 
               <br />
               er forty-one per cent of the people of this 
               <br />
               Dominion. The leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               has acknowledged to-day that there is no 
               <br />
               union among his party on that question. 
               <br />
               He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chatted</span> the Prime Minister for a mo- 
               <br />
               ment; he said this question was not mak- 
               <br />
               ing for the unity of the gov-erment. May I 
               <br />
               venture to suggest that it is not making for 
               <br />
               the unity of the opposition ? The leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition acknowledged to-day—it was 
               <br />
               right that he should acknowledge it—that 
               <br />
               he and some of the men with whom he 
               <br />
               sits were not able to see eye to eye. He 
               <br />
               warned us that he spoke to—day for him- 
               <br />
               self only and that he did not presume to 
               <br />
               speak in the name of his party. What does 
               <br />
               that show us ? Does it not prove that if 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend shall be obliged to 
               <br />
               retire from ofﬁce on this question, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the leader of the opposition would 
               <br />
               shrink from the formation of a government 
               <br />
               under such conditions? The matter is too 
               <br />
               grave to permit of its being treated lightly 
               <br />
               for a single moment, but I venture to say 
               <br />
               that it will be impossible to repress a smile

               want to state the situation as it actually
