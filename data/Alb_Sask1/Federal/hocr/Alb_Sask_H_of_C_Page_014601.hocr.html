               <br />
               deavoured to build an argument upon a

               certain construction which he put upon the 
               <br />
               words ‘politically expedient.’ Let me sub- 
               <br />
               mit to the reasonable attention of the House 
               <br />
               what the inference to be drawn from these 
               <br />
               words is. For whom was this to be ‘politi- 
               <br />
               cally expedient’ ? Was it for the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of the country that, for the third time 
               <br />
               had received a mandate from the people, 
               <br />
               and by an overwhelming vote, by a major- 
               <br />
               ity greater than ever known in the history 
               <br />
               of the country ? What would be the neces- 
               <br />
               sity for this government to descend to ‘ poli~ 
               <br />
               tical expediency ’ ? 111 whose interest would 
               <br />
               the course suggested be ‘politically expedi- 
               <br />
               ent’ then? Unquestionably in that of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba government, the government that 
               <br />
               had been interviewing Archbishop Lange- 
               <br />
               vin, the government whose Attorney <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gen.</span> 
               <br />
               eral had been interviewing the ablegate 
               <br />
               endeavouring to arrange to obtain poli- 
               <br />
               tical support—as I would say, if I were to 
               <br />
               use the style of argument of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite—in return for making these con- 
               <br />
               cessions. For whom else could it be ‘poli- 
               <br />
               tically expedient’ than for the government 
               <br />
               that was talking of having a dissolution 
               <br />
               some of these days, and was looking for 
               <br />
               political support ? I submit that the argu- 
               <br />
               ment of my hon. friend and the inference 
               <br />
               he attempted to draw were wholly unwar- 
               <br />
               ranted. \Vho were the people who were 
               <br />
               chasing this ablegate in relation to the 
               <br />
               schools ? Were they the members of this 
               <br />
               government? On the contrary, the indis— 
               <br />
               putable evidence of the facts before us, 
               <br />
               shows conclusively who were engaging in 
               <br />
               these ‘political expedients.’ For, what does 
               <br />
               the ablegate say ? He says it will be poli— 
               <br />
               tically expedient, 
               <br />
               inasmuch as the Catholics in any territory 
               <br />
               which might be annexed to Manitoba would 
               <br />

               man (Mr. R. L. Borden) who leads the op- 
               <br />
               position. Well, that hon. gentleman knows 
               <br />
               very well that his entrance into political 
               <br />
               life was signalized by the advocacy of the 
               <br />
               coercion of the province of Manitoba. He 
               <br />
               knows that the then leader of the Conser- 
               <br />
               vative party, recognizing his legal abilities, 
               <br />
               was anxious that the hon. gentleman should 
               <br />
               lend those abilities to the advocacy of the 
               <br />
               cause of the coercion of Manitoba, to which 
               <br />
               that leader was then committed. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) did not en- 
               <br />
               ter political life under auspices of so clear 
               <br />
               and unequivocal a character as to be able 
               <br />
               to hold out very alluring hopes even to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from South York (Mr. W. F. 
               <br />
               Maclean), who might be looking for a 
               <br />
               leader on this question. Or, are we to look

               to our hon. friend (Mr. Foster) who ad- 
               <br />
               dressed us this afternoon and who reads us 
               <br />
               a moral lecture every time he gets on his 
               <br />
               feet. This hon. gentleman assumes a high 
               <br />
               moral attitude. As he soars above ordinary 
               <br />
               mortals, and as ‘his tongue drops manna. 
               <br />
               and makes the worst appear the better 
               <br />
               reason,’ he fancies that the people of this 
               <br />
               country are deluded by the sermonettes he 
               <br />
               gives us. Why, Sir, what is the political 
               <br />
               history of that hon. gentleman? Born in 
               <br />

               he was driven thence after four or ﬁve
