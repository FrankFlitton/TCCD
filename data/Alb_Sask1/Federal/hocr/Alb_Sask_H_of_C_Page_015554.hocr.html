               will leave it to the Minister of the Interior. 
               <br />
               The object we had in mind was this. Since 
               <br />
               we must have a division north and south, 
               <br />
               is there a greater population in the former 
               <br />
               than in the latter ? I say that all the facts 
               <br />
               that I have given go to show that there is 
               <br />
               more in the north, except the recorded and 
               <br />
               the registered votes. As to these, I admit 
               <br />
               the advantage is with the other side. but 
               <br />
               every other source of information goes to 
               <br />
               show that there are more people in the 
               <br />
               north. Let me give further information 
               <br />
               upon that point. I shall take the statistics 
               <br />
               which have been given here on another sub- 
               <br />
               ject. My hon. friend yesterday took the 
               <br />
               trade of certain sections and compared the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade</span> of the north with that of the south. 
               <br />
               Let me compare the agricultural products 
               <br />
               of the two. In 1903 the wheat produced in 
               <br />
               the north was 075,576 bushels and in the 
               <br />
               south 533,000 bushels; oats, 3.200.000 
               <br />
               bushels in the north and in the south 1.- 
               <br />
               921.000 bushels; barley, 746,000 bushels in 
               <br />
               the north and in the south 325.000 bushels. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ths</span> shows a decided preponderance of

               that his own friends <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">virould</span> be sorry. The

               <br />
               gether in favour of the'south, because the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south</span> is better adapted to the production of 
               <br />
               cattle and not so well adapted for the pro-

               duction of cereals and other agricultural pro- 
               <br />
               ducts. If my hon. friend wants to give 
               <br />
               votes to cattle, let him do so; but if he 
               <br />

               give the preponderance to the north. Where-

               <br />
               not ﬁnd many men. The south is peculiarly

               than the north. I do not take the cattle 
               <br />
               into account, because they are not a fair in-

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. If there is an 
               <br />
               argument in the yield per acre, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend will have all the beneﬁt he can- find 
               <br />
               in it. I now come to another point put by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Elgin (Mr. In- 
               <br />
               gram), the point with regard to the two 
               <br />
               constituencies in the north. There is a 
               <br />
               small population in the north, I admit : but 
               <br />
               are they to be represented or not ‘2 We were- 
               <br />
               told yesterday to annex it to some existing 
               <br />
               constituency. But are you to annex to con- 
               <br />
               stituencies, which are as large as a man can 
               <br />
               serve, a territory three or four times the size 
               <br />
               of any constituency in the Northwest '3 
               <br />
               You must give these people representation. 
               <br />
               They are British citizens, and have a right 
               <br />
               to be represented. In fact, the whole thing 
               <br />
               hedges upon the selection of the capital. If 
               <br />
               it were not for that, we would not have this 
               <br />
               discussion at all. If there were in the south 
               <br />
               a preponderance of numbers so as to dis- 
               <br />
               credit the comparison we make between the 
               <br />
               north and the south, not a word would be 
               <br />
               said against these men having representa- 
               <br />
               tion. It has always been the policy in this 
               <br />
               House to give representation to large dis- 
               <br />
               tricts, even though their population be small 
               <br />
               and sparse. Take the county of Gaspé, 
               <br />
               which has been given representation since 
               <br />
               confederation, even when it had but a small 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> of ﬁshermen. Take Chicoutimi 
               <br />
               and Saguenay. which has been given repre- 
               <br />
               sentation since sixty years ago. when it 
               <br />
               had not a population worth speaking of. 
               <br />
               Take the very Northwest Territories, which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> given representation in 1887 that they
