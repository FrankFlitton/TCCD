               permit me, Mr. Speaker, to make a com-

               parison between the separate school system, 
               <br />

               <br />

               west Territories which it is proposed to 
               <br />
               perpetuate. There is a very wide difference 
               <br />
               between the two ; and if men of good intent 
               <br />
               only realized what a wide difference there 
               <br />
               is, I do not think there would be so much 
               <br />
               heat over this discussion. It will be neces- 
               <br />
               sary for me, even at the risk of repeating 
               <br />

               province of Quebec we have a dual edu- 
               <br />
               cational system. We have a Council of Pub— 
               <br />
               lic Instruction composed of thirty-six mem-

               twelve Protestants. This council has juris-

               <br />
               ters in the province. We have a superinten-

               <br />
               executive ofﬁcer. This council «is divided

               <br />
               Therefore we ﬁnd a dual system of schools. 
               <br />
               There are Roman Catholic and Protestant 
               <br />
               universities, Roman Catholic and Protestant 
               <br />
               normal schools and Roman Catholic and 
               <br />
               Protestant superior and primary schools. 
               <br />
               The two systems are entirely separate. We 
               <br />
               have a dual system of examinations and 
               <br />
               certiﬁcates and inspectors. Each is prac- 
               <br />
               tically as distinct and separate from the 
               <br />
               other as though the other did not exist. We 
               <br />
               have another feature in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec and that is the large number of re- 
               <br />
               ligious teachers engaged in the work of edu- 
               <br />

               tion is made with regard to them in our

               school laws. For while all other teachers 
               <br />
               are required to be certiﬁcated. there is a

               <br />
               teaching in the province of Quebec. The to- 
               <br />
               tal number of teachers is 12,072, of whom 
               <br />
               4,659 are religious. Of this number, 577

               012 nuns. - In the elementary schools 10 
               <br />
               per cent of the teachers are in religious or- 
               <br />
               ders. In the superior schools, 83 per cent 
               <br />
               of the teachers are members of religious 
               <br />
               bodies, and in the colleges 94 per cent are 
               <br />
               clerical and 6 per cent lay professors. I 
               <br />
               should be the last one in this House or out 
               <br />
               of it to utter anything but words of credit 
               <br />
               and praise for those devoted persons who 
               <br />
               consecrate their lives to education in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec among the members of 
               <br />
               religious orders. They certainly give back 
               <br />
               to the state, in the teaching service they 
               <br />
               render for little or no remuneration, far 
               <br />
               more than they take from it, and I doubt 
               <br />
               Whether, without their assistance, we would 
               <br />
               be able in the province of Quebec—at least 
               <br />
               our Roman Catholic fellow citizens would 
               <br />
               not be able—to secure for their children the 
               <br />
               educational facilities which they now en- 
               <br />
               joy. My only reason for bringing this to 
               <br />
               the attention of the House is because I 
               <br />
               want to show that 39 per cent of the teach- 
               <br />
               ers in the province of Quebec are members 
               <br />
               of religious corporations and that none of 
               <br />
               these are required to be certiﬁcated. Then 
               <br />
               again in the matter of school books and text 
               <br />
               books, we ﬁnd that religious teaching per- 
               <br />
               meates the whole system in our province. 
               <br />
