               it, and must ultimately be settled by judicial 
               <br />
               decision. I am asked, however, whether par- 
               <br />
               liament is constitutionally bound to impose any 
               <br />
               such restriction, or whether it exists otherwise, 
               <br />
               and I am of opinion in the negative. It must 
               <br />
               be borne in mind that I am concerned only 
               <br />
               with the question of legal obligation. What 
               <br />
               the parliament ought to do or should do in the 
               <br />
               exercise of any power which they may pos- 
               <br />
               sess, is not within the province of counsel. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Such a restriction, I apprehend, must exist 
               <br />
               or may be imposed, if at all, under the provi— 
               <br />
               sions of section 93 of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, 1867. and on the ground of their applica- 
               <br />
               tion to the provinces now to be formed. If that 
               <br />
               section applies, it would seem to require no 
               <br />
               enactment of our parliament to give it effect, 
               <br />
               and if not, no such enactment, so far as I am 
               <br />
               aware, is otherwise made necessary. Upon the 
               <br />
               whole I am of opinion that section 93 does not 
               <br />
               apply to the provinces now about to be estab- 
               <br />
               lished. -Its provisions would appear to me to 
               <br />
               be intended for, and conﬁned to, the then pro- 
               <br />
               vince, and to the union formed in 1867. There 
               <br />
               is not in any part of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               as a province any right or privilege with res- 
               <br />
               pect to denominational schools possessed by 
               <br />
               any class of persons, created by the province, 
               <br />
               or existing at such union ; and a right subse-

               part now about to be made a province, does 
               <br />
