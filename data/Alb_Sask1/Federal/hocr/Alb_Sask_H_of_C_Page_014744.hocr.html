               such is not the intention of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment. That section, in effect, says that the 
               <br />
               provisions of the British North America 
               <br />

               tion of amending that imperial statute. If 
               <br />
               we then turn to section 16, we ﬁnd the pro- 
               <br />
               posed amendment to that section, to say, 
               <br />
               that section 93 of the British North America 
               <br />

               <br />
               with the substitution for subsection 1 of

               said section 93, of the following subsections 
               <br />
               —and then follow certain subclauses to 
               <br />
               which I will presently advert. This, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, is clearly arrogating to this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment the right to amend the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, an imperial statute: and, as 
               <br />
               the facts show, it is assuming so to amend 
               <br />
               it without the assent of any minister 
               <br />
               of this government representing the 
               <br />
               particular people whose status is being 
               <br />
               irrevocably dealt with : without the 
               <br />
               assent of the Prime Minister of that 
               <br />
               people. and without the assent of the 
               <br />
               people themselves. It will be observed 
               <br />
               that an integral part of the Prime Min— 
               <br />
               ister’s complete and absolute autonomy, is, 
               <br />
               that under section 6 of these Bills, the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman retains in his own hands 
               <br />

               <br />
               of members to this House. This is clearly 
               <br />
               a discrimination against Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan as compared with every 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               011 the occasion of the introduction of Sir 
               <br />

               this House in session for a period, I be- 
               <br />
               lieve, of about six weeks in an endeavour to 
               <br />
               force their views with regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rights</span> upon parliament, and to show that 
               <br />
               the taking into their own hands by the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament of the ﬁxing of the 
               <br />
               franchise was the gravest possible departure 
               <br />
               from the principle of provincial rights. Yet, 
               <br />
               this same so-called Reform or Liberal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has seized upon this very ﬁrst op- 
               <br />
               portunity which has presented itself under 
               <br />
               their regime to swallow their principles in 
               <br />
               that respect and, in this instance they 
               <br />

               <br />
               their own hands the ﬁxing of the franchise, 
               <br />

               <br />
               to, they in the strongest terms reprobated. 
               <br />
               But Mr. Speaker, the crowning effort of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister to deprive the new pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               COleete and absolute autonomy is found 
               <br />
               in section 16 of these Bills. To my mind, 
               <br />
               the most striking difference between the

               <br />
               beyond the Act of 1875. That Act provided

               for the introduction of the principle of
