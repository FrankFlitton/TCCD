               Mr. LANCASTER. The Minister of Just-

               ice has seen ﬁt to invoke the rules of this

               House as a reason for not giving this long 
               <br />
               deferred and much expected explanation. 
               <br />
               I wonder he did not ask the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Prime</span> Minister 
               <br />
               and discuss it with him before the Bill was 
               <br />
               given a second reading. We know that 
               <br />
               every gentleman on that side supported the 
               <br />
               second reading because he was satisﬁed 
               <br />
               owing to the introduction of the substituted 
               <br />
               clauses. The Prime Minister did not at- 
               <br />
               tempt to read this Bill the second time until 
               <br />
               he placed the amendment before the House 
               <br />
               so that they would know what the amended 
               <br />
               clause 16 would be. Now what are the 
               <br />
               merits of the matter ? The second reading 
               <br />
               was carried because of different construc- 
               <br />
               tions to suit each particular case which 
               <br />
               were put upon clause 16, not as originally 
               <br />
               drawn and as before the committee to-day, 
               <br />
               but because it had been said that the clause 
               <br />
               was going to be amended and a notice of 
               <br />
               the amendment was given. Every hon. gen-

               House, his getting into line upon this Bill, 
               <br />

               this parl’iament, tried to make out that with

               the amended clause it was not nearly so bad

               as it would have been if the original clause 
               <br />
               had gone through. Now what are the rules

               of the House ? Are the rules of the House 
               <br />

               far as he could all his former views on this

               was satisﬁed that this amended clause would 
               <br />
               not do very much harm, and he distinctly

               gave us to understand as plainly as any

               <br />
               discuss section 1 at all would have said, not 
               <br />
               because this is an educational clause, not be- 
               <br />
               cause it involves a religious question or a 
               <br />
               question of provincial rights, but because he 
               <br />
