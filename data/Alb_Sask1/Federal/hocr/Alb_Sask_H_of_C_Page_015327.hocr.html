               North America Act ? I think you are mak- 
               <br />
               ing confusion by this section. The language 
               <br />
               here is not good draftsmanship, because it 
               <br />
               does not say that he shall have all the powers 
               <br />
               which a lieutenant governor of a province 
               <br />
               has under the British North America ACt. 
               <br />
               I think it would be better to say so.

               Mr. F‘ITZPATRICK. I would be glad

               the very question to the gentleman who

               <br />
               me now. He used the word ‘individually,’ 
               <br />

               ority. His power became reduced from

               the representative institutions which they 
               <br />

               sible diﬂiculty that might arrive, this
