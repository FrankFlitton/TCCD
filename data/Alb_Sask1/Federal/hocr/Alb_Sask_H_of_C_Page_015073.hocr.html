               I am glad tb inform the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               that we have one, and he will be here to- 
               <br />
               morrow. The hon. member for South York 
               <br />
               also wanted the Minister of Public Works 
               <br />
               in his place. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We'all</span> regret the cause of 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Public Works’ absence, 
               <br />
               and trust that he will soon be restored to 
               <br />
               his usual good health and resume his usual 
               <br />
               place, which he has ﬁlled with so much ac- 
               <br />
               ceptance. But in the meantime no loss is 
               <br />
               sustained to this House or the country 
               <br />
               when we have such an able acting minister 
               <br />
               doing the work; and if anything should 
               <br />
               happen that the city of London is opened, 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd the intelligent electors re- 
               <br />
               turning Mr. Hyman by a larger majority 
               <br />
               than he ever had before. In fact, I am 
               <br />
               prepared to bet that he would be. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">South</span> York wound up by im- 
               <br />
               ploring the hon. the Postmaster General to 
               <br />
               resign his place, and run him a race in 
               <br />
               North York or challenging the acting Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Public Works to resign, or the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to open any constituency in- the 
               <br />
               west in order that the renowned editor of 
               <br />
               the ‘World’ might bare his scalping knife 
               <br />
               and wound the government by politically 
               <br />
               killing any opponent that might rashly stand 
               <br />
               before him. We ﬁnd, however, that this 
               <br />
               John Alexander Dowie, of the House of 
               <br />
               Commons, is brave only in words, and that 
               <br />
               his most brilliant efforts are for ﬂaming 
               <br />
               headlines in his little paper, which after all 
               <br />
               exerts no greater inﬂuence in the moulding 
               <br />
