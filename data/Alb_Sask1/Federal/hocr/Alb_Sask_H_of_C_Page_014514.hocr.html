               knew that such exactions were practised

               storm which he neither knew how to allay nor 
               <br />
               direct. Nor had Paplneau the excuse of youth 
               <br />
               to plead in extenuation of his folly. In 1837 
               <br />
               he was 38 years of age, a period of life when 
               <br />
               the intellect stands at its meridian. In height 
               <br />
               he was of the middle size; a man of good 
               <br />
               presence; with features of a Hebrew caste; 
               <br />
               while his heavy dark eyebrows shaded, in a 
               <br />
               higher arch than usual, a keen lustrous eye 
               <br />
               of quick and penetrating glance. He appeared 
               <br />
               to be formed by nature for the eloquent agita- 
               <br />
               tor, but not for the wise or prudent legislator ; 
               <br />
               to act upon the passions and prejudices of his 
               <br />
               ignorant or unreﬂecting countrymen, not to 
               <br />
               make them happier, wiser or better. Familiar 
               <br />
               with French literature and all the old lore of 
               <br />
               La Nouvelle France, he appealed to the feelings 
               <br />
               and prejudices of his countrymen with ir- 
               <br />
               resistible effect, and completely carried them 
               <br />
               captive by the force of his-oratorical and con- 
               <br />
               versational powers. But while Papineau

               <br />
               of Upper Canada; and appeared to be wholly 
               <br />
               ignorant of the feeling of loyalty to the Queen 
               <br />

               Labellc; he really believed the statements

               <br />
               know what the facts were under a Liberal

               <br />
               in the province of Quebec in the old days.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show</span> that the people of Ontario are tolerant. 
               <br />
               I have shown that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> practi-
