               <br />
               from Mr. Haultain invited me to meet 
               <br />
               other members of parliament and senators 
               <br />
               from the Northwest; in conference during 
               <br />
               the progress of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Autonomy</span> Bill discus-

               <br />
               from Mr. Haultain on the subject. He did 
               <br />
               not mention the subject of constituencies— 
               <br />
               in fact, speaking from memory, he did not 
               <br />
               go into any details, but merely suggested 
               <br />
               that we Should meet and discuss mat- 
               <br />
               ters in general. I have always understood 
               <br />
               that, so far as the distribution of consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies is concerned, it was only the Min~ 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) who held 
               <br />
               out against this matter being submitted to 
               <br />
               the judges. That is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂect</span> of rumours 
               <br />
               that I have heard from Conservatives, 
               <br />
               not from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">)Liberals.</span> The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> mem— 
               <br />
               hers, I understood, were in favour of this 
               <br />
               course, and there was simply the member 
               <br />
               for Edmonton who was opposed to it. An- 
               <br />
               other matter discussed at the conference 
               <br />
               was the matter of one or two provinces. 
               <br />
               But, after all, these questions are apart 
               <br />
               from the question we ought to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis‘</span> 
               <br />
               cussing at the present moment. As the

               mitted that they were responsible for the

               <br />
               other Northwest Liberal members will take 
               <br />
               the responsibility for distribution in the

               would like to say that that redistribution 
               <br />
               was decided on by a conference of all the 
               <br />
               members of the House. I doubt whether 
               <br />
               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Haultain</span> was present e'ven on that oc-

               regard to population, and a certain consid- 
               <br />
               eration of area. The population in the 
               <br />
               three districts at that time, each of which 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entitled</span> to a certain share' of repre-

               sentation, was taken into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration,</span> 
               <br />
               and the population which was to be allow- 
               <br />
               ed to each was ﬁgured out'. It was .ﬁgured 
               <br />
               out that, working on these lines, the consti- 
               <br />
               tuency of Alberta would get one' member 
               <br />
               to every 4,700 population; the district of

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assinirboia</span> one member to 4,492: the dis-

               <br />
               be. noticed that the distribution. looked at 
               <br />
               from that point of view, was a fair one. 
               <br />
               There was only a margin of less than 5 .per 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent</span> as between the amounts allowed to 
               <br />
               these three districts from the average of the 
               <br />
               whole. It was decided to interfere as 
               <br />
               little as possible with existing local 
               <br />
               constituencies, and that may account for 
               <br />
               a certain discrepancy in the total votes 
               <br />
               cast, but I do not think it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span> to 
               <br />
               go into these ﬁgures, and the ﬁgures given 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. P. 
               <br />
               Talbot) are different in many respects from 
               <br />
               those I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have),</span> which were made out by the 
               <br />
               Northwest 'government. At the time of 
               <br />
               the redistribution. we had a very lively op- 
               <br />
               position in the legislative assembly, who 
               <br />
               were ready to ﬁnd fault on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eveiry</span> pretext. 
               <br />
               It was just on the eve| of an election; and 
               <br />
               surely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> there had been any attempt at a 
               <br />
               gerrymander that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would.</span> have been brought 
               <br />
               up in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the!</span> House. But what do we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'ﬁnd?</span> 
               <br />
               Looking over the reports, I lﬁlld for instance 
               <br />
               two objections were made by Mr. Patrick, of 
               <br />
               the district of Yorkton. The ﬁrst was that 
               <br />
               there should be another representative up 
               <br />
               there, because he had an additional popula- 
               <br />
               tion of 5,000 Doukhobors, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hel</span> did not 
               <br />
               press that very hard. And it was shown 
               <br />
               him that his total population was a very 
               <br />
               fair one under the circumstances. He also 
               <br />
               thought there should be one more mem- 
               <br />
               ber in the House. It was found necessary 
               <br />
               to reduce the representation in the district 
               <br />
               of Saskatchewan by one. Mr. Mackay, of 
               <br />
               Prince Albert, also objected to losing one 
               <br />
               member from one of the constituencies of 
               <br />
               Prince Albert, which was cutoff. Mr. Ben- 
               <br />
               nett simply objected to thel Liberal execu- 
               <br />
               tive having any ﬁnger in this redistribu- 
               <br />
