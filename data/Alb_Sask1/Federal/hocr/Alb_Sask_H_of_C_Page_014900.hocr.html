               Mr. Speaker, I cannot help thinking that 
               <br />
               many of the supporters of the present gov- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ernment</span> are shrinking to—day from the 
               <br />
               truths they needs must think. It is said 
               <br />
               that we are ﬁghting against the Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic church. But I want to say that is not 
               <br />
               a ﬁght against the Roman Catholic church, 
               <br />
               or against our fellow Roman Catholic citi- 
               <br />
               zens. Our Roman Catholic fellow citizens 
               <br />
               have as good a right to live in this country 
               <br />
               as we have, they are welcome to the best 
               <br />
               our country can produce, and to the enjoy- 
               <br />
               )nent of their civil and religious liberty in 
               <br />
               the broadest sense of the term. Hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers opposite are mistaken when they talk 
               <br />
               to us as though we were here representing 
               <br />
               wholly Protestant communities, charging us 
               <br />
               with being prejudiced against our Catholic 
               <br />
               fellow citizens. That is not the case. Some 
               <br />
               of the best friends I have in private and 
               <br />
               political life are Roman Catholic citizens of 
               <br />
               Canada. I want to say to you that I have 
               <br />
               interviewed a number of these men, and I 
               <br />
               have failed to ﬁnd a man yet that will jus— 
               <br />
               tify the present government in forcing upon 
               <br />
               these new provinces, as they are attempting 
               <br />
               to do, the educational clauses of this Bill. 
               <br />
               We need fearless criticism of this measure, 
               <br />
               we need fearless criticism of all acts, honest

               and dishonest, no matter from what source 
               <br />

               <br />
               need criticism that will be truthful. Taking

               <br />
               the people throughout our land said that 
               <br />
               the ex—minister was going to stand by pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. They expected of course 
               <br />
               that the western men would follow him, al- 
               <br />
               though they did pound their desks when this 
               <br />
               Bill was presented to the House in its ori- 
               <br />

               <br />
               stands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> as a self condemned man in 
               <br />
               the eyes of the people of Canada.
