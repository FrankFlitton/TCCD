               yesterday that the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               a wonderful swimmer. but that he had to 
               <br />
               be thrown into the water. I realize. with 
               <br />
               some degree of fear. that this debate may 
               <br />
               be protracted to a considerable length. and 
               <br />
               I wish to indicate as brieﬂy as possible to 
               <br />
               the House through what mental process I 
               <br />
               have passed, if I may use that expression. 
               <br />
               in order to arrive at the conclusion at which 
               <br />
               I have arrived in respect to this measure. 
               <br />
               The question has been treated from a con- 
               <br />
               stitutional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standpoint,</span> and certainly it ought 
               <br />
               to be treated from that standpoint. since 
               <br />
               the very grounds on which we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legisla~</span> 
               <br />
               ting in this affair are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> 
               <br />
               grounds. I submit, in addition. that it must 
               <br />
               be looked at from a political standpoint— 
               <br />
               I say political in altogether the highest 
               <br />
               sense of the word. But, taking the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional standpoint, the House will per- 
               <br />
               mit me to say in what sense I understand 
               <br />
               that we are called upon to act, and how I 
               <br />
               interpret the three constitutional Acts 
               <br />
               which serve as the foundation for our le-
