               There is one other thing which he will re- 
               <br />
               cognize. In the constitutions which we are

               giving to Alberta and Saskatchewan, we 
               <br />
               have deliberately restricted the rights of 
               <br />
               the provinces to legislate on educational 
               <br />
               matters. We have done so under the 
               <br />
               authority granted by section 93 ot‘ the con- 
               <br />
               stitution. For, in matters of education, the 
               <br />
               rights of the provinces are not absolute: 
               <br />
               they are restricted by the powers of inter- 
               <br />
               ference of the Dominion parliament. We 
               <br />
               have done so with a view to. remaining faith- 
               <br />

               <br />
               matters of education the fundamental right 
               <br />
               of the provinces is limited, in order to safe- 
               <br />

               <br />

               which the discussion on separate schools 
               <br />
