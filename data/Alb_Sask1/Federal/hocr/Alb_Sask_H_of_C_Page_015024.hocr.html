               patriotism of the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid

               fore I shall be very brief, but at the same

               Being as I am, a native born Canadian. 
               <br />
               there is no portion of the face of the earth in

               <br />
               There are no people who live and move and

               have their being upon the face of the globe, 
               <br />
               in whom I feel so much interest as in those 
               <br />
               persons who are Canadians and who at 
               <br />
               least live on Canadian soil. We have in our 
               <br />
               country a very great variety of most valu- 
               <br />

               t'ul Giver; and upon these resources and 
               <br />
               with these resources, it is altogether likely 
               <br />
               a great nation will be built up in the Do-
