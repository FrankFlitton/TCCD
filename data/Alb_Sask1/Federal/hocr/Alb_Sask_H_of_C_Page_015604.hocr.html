               what had been done in Great Britain. There 
               <br />

               played me false if that is not what the

               <br />
               was entirely irrelevant if he did not mean

               that, because what has been stated just now

               place in Great Britain. My right hon.

               interview took place, but he excuses himself 
               <br />
               now by saying that is not What he intended 
               <br />
               at all. The illustration he drew from Brit—
