               <br />
               always hear in mind that these ordinances

               <br />

               minion parliament, and not of any legis— 
               <br />
               lature of the Northwest, and that Act im-

               posed and forced separate schools upon that

               not independent voluntary territorial leg-

               thereby, it seems to me, making it impossi-

               ble to contend, as has been done during this

               When we come to review the utterances 
               <br />
               of ‘members of the cabinet who have given 
               <br />

               bate, we ﬁnd these gentlemen singularly at 
               <br />
               variance. The right hon. the First Minister, 
               <br />
               who introduced this measure, told us that he 
               <br />
               stood 011 the rock of the constitution. He 
               <br />
               contended, though he made no serious at- 
               <br />
               tempt to prove it as a matter of law, that 
               <br />
               Canada was under a legal obligation to re— 
               <br />
               strict the legislative rights of the proposed 
               <br />
               new provinces to legislate as to schools. It 
               <br />
               appears to me, Mr. Speaker, that he very 
               <br />
               properly stated what, anti what alone, can 
               <br />
               be the real question which this parliament 
               <br />
               ought to decide, and that that question must 
               <br />
               be decided and decided favourably to the 
               <br />
               contention of the government before they 
               <br />
               .can hope for one hour to enforce these Acts, 
               <br />
               even if they become law. The hon. Minis-
