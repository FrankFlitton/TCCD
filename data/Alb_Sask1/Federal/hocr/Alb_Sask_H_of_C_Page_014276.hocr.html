               <br />
               made it a point to interrupt me repeatedly 
               <br />
               when I was up before. I simply made the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">request</span> to be allowed to explain. Then it 
               <br />
               was said that the farm was purchased— 
               <br />
               Why ? For this reason, that as soon as the 
               <br />
               farm got into the hands of a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               it was subject to the tithes which the church 
               <br />
               could collect, and thus became a supporter 
               <br />
               of the church ; but that so long as it was 
               <br />
               owned by a Protestant, it was not a sup- 
               <br />
               porter of the church. Therefore there was 
               <br />
               a strong inducement for the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               to purchase it. It was said that a fund 
               <br />
               was raised by the church for this purpose—— 
               <br />
               not improperly at all—and that one farm 
               <br />
               after another was taken over in that way 
               <br />
               until the English—speaking population got to 
               <br />
               be so few that they were unable to keep up 
               <br />
               their schools and churches, and these were 
               <br />
               closed; the people had no community of in— 
               <br />
               terest amongst themselves because they 
               <br />
               could not keep up their schools, their child- 
               <br />
               ren were raised in ignorance; and this ap- 
               <br />
               plication was made to the government for 
               <br />
               assistance or for a loan to enable a number 
               <br />
               of these people to go to the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. That is the explanation.

               <br />

               <br />
               Peel (Mr. Blain) quoted some of the authori- 
               <br />
               ties against this measure, and did not fail 
               <br />
               to mention the name of Mr. Haultain. I 
               <br />
               have very much respect for the First Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Northwest Territories. Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain is a talented young statesman 
               <br />
               from the west. He has been in Ottawa a 
               <br />
               few weeks, and no doubt feels compelled 
               <br />
               to speak in accord with the Tory press, 
               <br />
               because he is also a Tory statesman. During 
               <br />
               the last elections he took a very prominent 
               <br />
               and active part against this government 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               is therefore bound to be against the govern- 
               <br />
               ment. But there is another gentleman who 
               <br />
               accompanied Mr. Haultain on his mission 
               <br />
               to the Ottawa government. We saw him 
               <br />
               on the ﬂoor of this House when this Bill 
               <br />
               was introduced. I refer to Mr. Bulyea. I

               understand that Mr. Bulyea. gave an ex-

               pression of his opinion to the Toronto

               press not long ago, and when I compare the 
               <br />
               statements of Mr. Haultain with those of 
               <br />
               Mr. Bulyea, I ﬁnd that they differ toto 
               <br />
               coelo. Mr. Haultain has taken this govern- 
               <br />
               ment to task on the educational clauses, the 
               <br />
               land clauses and on the division of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, But Mr. Bulyea declares, speaking 
               <br />
               for his province and himself, that he is per- 
               <br />
               fectly satisﬁed with the measure as present- 
               <br />
               ed by the government.

               Sir, the question now before the House 
               <br />
               and the country marks an epoch in the 
               <br />
               history of Canada. It deserves our best 
               <br />
               attention and all our solicitude, as it is 
               <br />

               <br />
               word, not one sentence, Will fall from my 
               <br />
               lips that will in the least offend even the 
               <br />
               most sturdy opponent of the measure.
