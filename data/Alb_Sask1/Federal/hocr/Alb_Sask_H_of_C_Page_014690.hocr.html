               Mr. R. L. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BO'RDEN.</span> I am very much

               gratiﬁed that my per-severing efforts have at 
               <br />
               last been rewarded with success; I doubt

               very much if my right hon. friend would

               have screwed up enough courage if we had 
               <br />
               not stirred him up from day to day. How- 
               <br />
               ever, I do not know that we can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">congratulate</span> 
               <br />
               him very much on his courage after all, for 
               <br />
               it has taken six or seven weeks to bring it 
               <br />
               to the sticking point. It would seem to 
               <br />
               have been equally \possible to have made this

               ago, and to have had the advantage of a

               Minister of the Interior during the discus— 
               <br />
               sion on this Bill. I do not know whether 
               <br />
               I am called upon to congratulate my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott). 
               <br />
               He was pointed out to us by the Liberal 
               <br />
               press of the country as the gentleman who, 
               <br />
               above all others, was ﬁtted to ﬁll this posi- 
               <br />
               tion,-and we were told in pretty plain and 
               <br />
               distinct terms that he would be selected. 
               <br />
               The ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               told us, just about as distinctly as such 
               <br />
               things are ever told in this House, that the 
               <br />
               late member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver) 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[was</span> to ﬁll the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> of Prime Minis— 
               <br />
               ter of one of the western provinces. The 
               <br />
               programme was very pretty—my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from West Assini-boia (Mr. Scott) was 
               <br />
               to be Minister of the Interior and Mr. Oliver 
               <br />
               was to be Prime Minister of one of the 
               <br />
               western provinces. That was the pro- 
               <br />
               gramme laid down by the government press, 
               <br />
               and it would be interesting to know why 
               <br />
               that programme has been so abruptly and 
               <br />
               suddenly changed. However, we are glad 
               <br />
               that the government have at last taken 
               <br />
               some action. I do not know whether my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from West Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) 
               <br />
               has in his pocket a letter of the description 
               <br />
               which was given some years ago to Mr. 
               <br />
               Francois Langelier, of Quebec, telling him 
               <br />
               what would be done at the end of the ses- 
               <br />
               sion. I sincerely trust that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott) has some oral or written assur- 
               <br />
               ance of that kind. Be that as it may, on 
               <br />
               this side of the House we can only wait and 
               <br />
               see what the developments will be.

               am sure there is not ; but in the discussions 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the government with regard to railway 
               <br />
