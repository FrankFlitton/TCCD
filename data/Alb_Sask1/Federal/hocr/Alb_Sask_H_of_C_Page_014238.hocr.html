               Mr. NORTHRUP. I suppose that when 
               <br />
               the public moneys are to be distributed un- 
               <br />
               der this Bill, they must be distributed 
               <br />
               equitably among the public and separate 
               <br />
               schools. If a certain amount of money is 
               <br />
               to go to one section, and there is only one 
               <br />
               school, that school will get more than it 
               <br />
               would if another school were established in 
               <br />
               the same section. That, I think, is self 
               <br />
               evident. l expressly said that I gave this 
               <br />
               as an illustration of how it would work out. 
               <br />
               I suppose it will be admitted that, as that 
               <br />
               country is sparsely settled. it must be rather 
               <br />
               hard, in many sections, to maintain the 
               <br />
               schools. If another school is started in the 
               <br />
               neighbourhood, a heavy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«burden</span> is placed 
               <br />
               upon both classes of the community and 
               <br />
               the schools are less eilicicnt than they other- 
               <br />
               wise would be. I have another reason. I 
               <br />
               was in the l'orthwest about two years ago. 
               <br />
               I found regions which foreigners, as for in- 
               <br />
               stance the Galicians, have come in and set- 
               <br />
               tled. Now, if the Galicians get control of 
               <br />
               the school in one section, is it more likely 
               <br />
               or is it less likely that Americans, let us 
               <br />
               say, will settle there under the proposed 
               <br />
               legislation than they would if the public 
               <br />
               school only could be established there '2 As 
               <br />
               a practical question is it not clear that the 
               <br />
               moment a number of foreigners settle in 
               <br />
               one section, they will effectively exclude 
               <br />

               for instance the Galicians, and speaking of 
               <br />
               them with all respect. Is it unfair to say 
               <br />
               that the children of Galicians not knowing 
               <br />
               a word of English, would not be re-

               the time of the House for a little while to- 
               <br />
               night. That gentleman has several times 
               <br />
               referred to an occasion of two years ago 
               <br />
               when he saw ﬁt to bring before this 
               <br />
               House a motion in regard to provincial au- 
               <br />
               tonomy, and it has seemed a grievance to 
               <br />
               him that on that occasion he was replied to 
               <br />
               by a humble member representing part of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories instead of by a 
               <br />
               member of the government. I do not know 
               <br />
               what qualiﬁcation the hon. leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position demands from members who ad- 
               <br />
               dress this House, but I would think, with all 
               <br />
               humility, that a member who has spent 
               <br />
               the greater part of his life in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, Who had some part in 
               <br />
               the local government of the Territories 
               <br />
               for many years, might possibly be able to 
               <br />
               contribute something to the information of 
               <br />
               the House on a question so closely connected 
               <br />
