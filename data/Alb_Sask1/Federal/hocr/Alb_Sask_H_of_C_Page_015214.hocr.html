               know from the Finance Minister what that 
               <br />
               method was. Take, for instance one pro-

               vince. Would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Minister of Finance tell 
               <br />
               us by what method he and the government 
               <br />
               arrived at the quantity of lands that would 
               <br />
               be fair to allow in comparison with the total 
               <br />
               area of the province. And then I would like 
               <br />
               to know by what method he and they arrived 
               <br />
               at the conclusion that a fair valuation of the 
               <br />
               land would be $1.50 per acre. I do not 
               <br />
               imagine for a moment that the government 
               <br />
               assembled around the Council Board would 
               <br />
               arrive at a conclusion as to the quantity 
               <br />
               without ﬁrst going into the quantity of lands 
               <br />
               in the province. Nor would they reach a con- 
               <br />
               clusion as to the value to be allowed with— 
               <br />
               out taking the different grades of lands and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ralues</span> of those different grades. Having 
               <br />
               done this, I should think they would come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that, if they did not give 
               <br />
               the lands in toto to the province, they ought 
               <br />
               to make a compensation of a certain number 
               <br />
               of acres. Then they would make an esti- 
               <br />
               mate, based upon the best data possible, of 
               <br />
               the average value of these lands. Now, if 
               <br />
               we had the method by which the govern- 
               <br />
               ment arrived at these ﬁgures, we should 
               <br />
               be in a position to reach our own con- 
               <br />
               clusions as to the justness of the grant and 
               <br />
               the fairness of the valuation. If something 
               <br />
               like that was not done, if the government 
               <br />
               made no investigation and took no trouble 
               <br />
               in regard to the matter ; if they simply came 
               <br />
               to the conclusion, as the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior hinted, that a certain amount was 
               <br />
               necessary for a revenue for these provinces

               complish such an object, and therefore there- 
               <br />
               is nothing in it but the idea of giving so 
               <br />
               much money and making an arbitrary basis 
               <br />
               upon which it was to be given. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[I</span> do 
               <br />
               not like to think that the government has 
               <br />
               come down to this parliament, under sh0w 
               <br />

               without a valuation which is fair and just

               <br />
               the Minister of Finance as to whether he 
               <br />
               is right in this respect, or as to whether 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior is right, as to 
               <br />
               whether my ﬁrst supposition is right, or as
