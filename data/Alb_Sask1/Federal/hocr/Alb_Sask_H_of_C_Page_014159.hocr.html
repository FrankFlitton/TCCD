               <br />
               question. Sir Alexander Campbell was a

               lawyer, and for a time was Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice. He refers to an amendment which 
               <br />
               had been removed by Mr. Atkins, to strike 
               <br />
               out the separate school clause, and this is 
               <br />
               what he said :

               It would be much to be regretted if the 
               <br />
               amendment passed. The object of the Bill was 
               <br />
               to establish and perpetuate in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories the same system as prevailed in 
               <br />
               Ontario and Quebec, and which had worked so

               well in the interest of peace and harmony with 
               <br />
               the different populations of these provinces.

               <br />
               one, for all races and creeds, was to adopt the 
               <br />
               suggestion of the government and enable the 
               <br />
               people to establish separate schools in the ter- 
               <br />
               ritory, and thus prevent the introduction of 
               <br />
               evils from which Ontario and Quebec had suf— 
               <br />
               fered, but had judiciously rid themselves.

               Is it possible to attach to that language 
               <br />
               any other meaning than that Sir Alexander 
               <br />
               Campbell desired to settle this troublesome 
               <br />
               question by adopting the separate school 
               <br />
               clause then and for all future time? Is it 
               <br />
               conceivable that he meant: We will settle 
               <br />
               this question up to a certain day and then 
               <br />
               we will throw the door open to discord and 
               <br />
               strife? His language cannot be subject to 
               <br />
               such interpretation. What could be strong- 
               <br />

               perpetuate in the Northwest Territories the 
               <br />
               same system as prevailed in Ontario and

               rangement? Surely, if the English language 
               <br />
               means anything, Sir Alexander Campbell 
               <br />
               meant when he spoke that day that the Bill

               I have no doubt, from information that 
               <br />
               has reached me, that many immigrants have 
               <br />
               come into the Northwest Territories upon 
               <br />
               representations that the schools there would

               he conducted in accordance with their re- 
               <br />
               ligious views. I believe this to be cor- 
               <br />
               rect. I may mention a little incident hear- 
               <br />
               ing 011 that point. I had occasion recently 
               <br />
               to come into oﬂicial contact with the re- 
               <br />
               presentative of one of the continental na- 
               <br />
               tions. I was discussing with him the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of immigration—we wished to have im- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">migrantscome</span> to Canada from his country. 
               <br />
               In the course of our conversation he said: 
               <br />
               It" you are to get immigrants from our coun- 
               <br />
               try, this school question that is coming up 
               <br />
               becomes one of very great importance to 
               <br />
               us. I have no doubt therefore that it can 
               <br />
               be shown that some of the immigrants who 
               <br />
               have come to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               have come—for we have many Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic settlers in that country—on the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               at the time this Act was passed, but later on 
               <br />
               there were further discussions which may

               be cited in the same direction. I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               some years afterwards, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1894.</span> there was 
               <br />
               a discussion in this House with regard to 
               <br />
               some amendments of the Northwest Act 
               <br />
               that were proposed. I ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               late Mr. Dalton McCarthy, who de- 
               <br />
               sired that the separate school clause 
               <br />
               should be repealed, who was an oppo- 
               <br />
               nent of separate schools as hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               well remember, in a speech at that time laid 
               <br />
               down the principle that it” you should con- 
               <br />
               tinue to allow that separate school clause 
               <br />
               to remain on the statutebook, if you should 
               <br />
               go on year after year allowing the North- 
               <br />
               west people to possess this system of sep- 
               <br />
               ate schools up to the moment at which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> 
               <br />
               would be brought in as a province, then they 
               <br />
               would be in a position to come to us and 
               <br />
               say: It is too late for you to change that
