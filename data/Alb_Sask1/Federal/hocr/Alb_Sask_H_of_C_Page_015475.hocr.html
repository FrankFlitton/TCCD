               every possible regard for the opinion of my

               hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz-

               <br />
               myself differing from him I always have a

               great deal of doubt as to the correctness of

               my own opinion—yet I must add that, after

               <br />
               said to-day. For he took particular pains, 
               <br />
               it seems to me, not to state that there was 
               <br />
               any real difference between section 16, No.1, 
               <br />
               and section 16, No. 2. He only said, so far 
               <br />
               as section 16, No. 1, is concerned, that the 
               <br />
               meaning of it was expressed in the earlier 
               <br />
               school ordinances. That is all he says about 
               <br />
               it; but then he goes on to tell us what is 
               <br />
               his View as to section 16. No. 2. I do not 
               <br />
               ﬁnd in his opinion, after all, anything that is 
               <br />
               diametrically—or, indeed, at ail—opposed to 
               <br />
               the View which ‘1 have expressed to-day. 
               <br />
               And it gives me .a great deal of satisfaction 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd that, in expressing the view I have 
               <br />
               just ventured to place before this House, I 
               <br />
               do not ﬁnd myself, as it seems to me, in

               <br />

               we should differ ; because I had hoped that
