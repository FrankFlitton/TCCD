               the other members of the government ? 
               <br />
               Doubtless we have constitutional principle 
               <br />
               that a Bill presented to the House by a

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> the course of this debate, by the hon.

               I think, by the hon. Minister of Customs

               (Mr. Paterson), to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">etfect</span> that they had

               some acquaintance with the provisions of 
               <br />
               this measure at or about the time it was 
               <br />
               introduced, the evidence appears to point 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that the other members of 
               <br />
               the government were not consulted; at all 
               <br />
               events, in regard to clause 16, commonly 
               <br />
               known as the educational clause. On this 
               <br />
               educational clause Mr. Haultain was denied 
               <br />
               consultation. He, beyond question, was the 
               <br />
               legally and properly constituted-representa- 
               <br />
               tive of the people of the west, whose status 
               <br />
               for all time was being ﬁxed and disposed of. 
               <br />
               There is no evidence that the members from 
               <br />
               the Northwest supporting the government 
               <br />
               were consulted. As regards the educational 
               <br />
               provisions of this Bill as originally intro- 
               <br />
               duced, the evidence appears to be the other 
               <br />
               way, because we know that the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment occupied a period of about a month 
               <br />
               continuously in consultation ostensibly with 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen upon the one hand as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> now know. with the Papal ablegate 
               <br />
               upon the other. with this singular result 
               <br />
               that the right hon. leader or the govern- 
               <br />
               ment did not recede one inch in principle, 
               <br />
               but in matters of detail he went even 
               <br />
               farther than did the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«Bill</span> as originally in- 
               <br />
               troduced. I say he went farther, because 
               <br />
               the body of the amended clause 16 makes 
               <br />
               no pretense of concealing a direct am— 
               <br />
               endment of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. It will not be denied that this is a 
               <br />
               most important step in the political life of 
               <br />
               the Northwest. It is an occasion when no 
               <br />
               shadow of a pretense should be left for the 
               <br />
               suggestion that the people whose interests 
               <br />
               more directly were being dealt with were not 
               <br />
               most exhaustively consulted. Mr. Haultain 
               <br />
               should be left no peg upon which to hang 
               <br />
               an assertion of want of the fullest conﬁ-

               He was, indeed, specially in attendance 
               <br />
               for the purpose of consultation. Instead of 
               <br />

               wise. In fact, Sir, it would seem

               that the right hon. Prime Minister has, 
               <br />
               throughout this transaction, acted the part 
               <br />
               of an autocrat and a czar. Instead of

               crowning the political status of the North- 
               <br />

               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman, it seems to me, 
               <br />
               proceeds by his Bill, as I propose, in part 
               <br />
               to show, to dim the lustre of that crown 
               <br />

               stars with which it should be adorned. It 
               <br />
               will not be denied, that on this occasion, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> would have been eminently proper, in

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Its</span> just claims should undoubtedly have

               left cribbed, cabined and conﬁned as it is

               stamp upon the map of the Dominion. It 
               <br />
               appears to me from the frame of the Bills 
               <br />
               and the amendment proposed by the govern- 
               <br />

               and also from the tenor of this debate, 
               <br />
               that the primary object of the government 
               <br />
               in imbedding these Bills, was to fasten 
               <br />
               about the necks of the new provinces a sys- 
               <br />
               tem of separate schools for all time. And 
               <br />
               I think it has always been a just inference 
               <br />
               from the facts within our knowledge that 
               <br />
               the reason, or at least, a reason, for the

               refusal of the government to extend the 
               <br />
               boundaries of Manitoba westerly, was that 
               <br />
               to the extent of such extension, the object 
               <br />
               of the government would be defeated. It
