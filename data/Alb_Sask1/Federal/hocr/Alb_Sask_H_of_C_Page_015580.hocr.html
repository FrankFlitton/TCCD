               tirely differen‘t from the system in the other

               provinces. We are never particular in pre- 
               <br />
               paring our lists because we know that a 
               <br />
               man can vote whether his name was put 
               <br />
               on the list before polling day or not. Some 
               <br />
               carelessness was exhibited no doubt by the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enu'meraltors,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> they omitted se‘veral

               polling day and got their votes as they

               <br />
               ments is to leave the impression that Edmonton 
               <br />
               is able to exert some mysterious inﬂuence over 
               <br />

               <br />
               constituencies will resent this reﬂection on their 
               <br />
               independence. And the adjoining constituencies 
               <br />
               are as completely separated from this city’s in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence as if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchewan</span> river marked the

               <br />
               the Calgary press hope to affect a change in 
               <br />

               question, I would like to make a remark 
               <br />
               with reference to the question of more votes 
               <br />
               being polled than there were voters on the 
               <br />
               list. It struck me as a peculiar circum-

               stance that that should have happened in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cer’</span>

               of it in a return which was brought down to

               <br />
               in one of the districts, the electoral district 
               <br />
               of Mackenzie, there were two lists for poll- 
               <br />
               ing division No. 20. One of them is not 
               <br />
               signed at all. The other is signed by a man 
               <br />
               named Bisli J. Bildel. The former is evi- 
               <br />
               dently the correct list. and it contaians 
               <br />
               sixty-one names. I was startled by this

               fact and began to look through the list,
