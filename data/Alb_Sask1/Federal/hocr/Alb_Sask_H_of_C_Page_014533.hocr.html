               I do not know anything about the letter 
               <br />
               of the 23rd of February which has been re- 
               <br />
               ferred to to—day except that I received a 
               <br />
               telegram only this morning from the at— 
               <br />
               torney general of Manitoba, who evidently 
               <br />
               had observed that this letter had not been 
               <br />
               included in the documents brought down, 
               <br />
               and he asked me to mention the matter to 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister and to see that it was 
               <br />
               brought down with the other documents. 
               <br />
               That is the only knowledge I have with 
               <br />
               regard to it and it is quite evident that Mr. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rogers</span> and Mr. Campbell were thoroughly 
               <br />
               under the impression that that letter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hard</span> 
               <br />
               not only been sent, but had been received 
               <br />
               by the Prime Minister. Assuming that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               letter was written and should have been

               received it seems to bear out very strongly 
               <br />
               the view which Mr. Rogers had expressed 
               <br />
               in the interview alluded to by the Prime

               Sir, as we ﬁnd it necessary to leave Ottawa 
               <br />
               to-morrow, we desire to refer to our interview 
               <br />
               of Friday, the 17th, respecting Manitoba’s 
               <br />
               claim for extension of her boundaries westward 
               <br />

               <br />
               to suggest that if we would come here for two 
               <br />
               or three days you would be in a position to 
               <br />
               give us an answer respecting same.

               They remained here not only two or three 
               <br />
               days, but as the letter shows until the 23rd 
               <br />
               of February, and they departed without re 
               <br />
               ceiving any answer or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ansr</span> intimation 
               <br />
               beyond that. But they received an intima- 
               <br />
               tion from His Excellency Monseigneur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SharA</span>

               Prime Minister and by Mr. Rogers in his 
               <br />
               interview. As to that I have nothing to 
               <br />
               say to-day nor have I anything to say 
               <br />
               with regard to the Whole situation, although 
               <br />
               it may afford an opportunity for a little 
               <br />
               more debate later on. It seems to me that 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explanation</span> of the Prime Minister which 
               <br />
               has been made in consequence of the inter- 
               <br />
               view with Mr. Rogers might well have been 
               <br />
               made at some earlier date. My right hon. 
               <br />

               this connection. I have observed his words

               <br />

               language, and it is right to observe also 
               <br />
               that this journal claims to be the special
