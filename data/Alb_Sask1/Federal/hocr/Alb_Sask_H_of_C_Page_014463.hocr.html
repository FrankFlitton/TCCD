               the education clause or no compromise in its

               <br />
               right of the province, according to the British

               anything less than this they are traitors to the

               new provinces and traitors to the cause of 
               <br />
               full provincial autonomy. Anything less than 
               <br />
               complete control over education and schools is

               now engaging the attention of parliament. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman quoted from an inter- 
               <br />
               view with the Rev. Dr. Chown, in which it 
               <br />
               was stated that the doctor at a public meet- 
               <br />
               ing at Toronto had stated that he was pre- 
               <br />
               sent in Regina at the time word was re- 
               <br />
               ceived of the provisions of the Autonomy 
               <br />
               Bill and that there was not a word of dis- 
               <br />
               cussion raised about the educational clauses. 
               <br />
               I shall read what Dr. Chown says in a letter 
               <br />
               to the editor of the ‘Globe’ in to-night’s 
               <br />
               paper :

               To the editor of the ‘Globe': I notice in 
               <br />
               the ‘Globe's’ report of the address of Mr. 
               <br />
               Walter Scott, M.P., of Regina, made in the 
               <br />
               House of Common: yesterday, a statement is 
               <br />
               attributed to me, to the effect that the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest were satisﬁed with the 
               <br />
               Laurier government’s solution of the school 
               <br />
               diﬁiculty. He may have been misled by a news— 
               <br />
               paper report, but I certainly did not make 
               <br />
               such a statement, as I have no means of know- 
               <br />
               ing the present facts.

               The only public utterance I have made about 
               <br />
               the school question was at a meeting of the 
               <br />
               Provincial Rights Committee in Toronto, at 
               <br />
               which time, speaking to a motion made by Dr. 
               <br />
               Bruce. to petition the House of Commons, the 
               <br />
               Senate and the Governor General, praying that 
               <br />
               no further steps be taken until the people in- 
               <br />
               terested have an opportunity of expressing 
               <br />
               themselves upon the issue, I said that I had 
               <br />
               been in the Northwest for some time during 
               <br />
               the election contest, and I could bear testi— 
               <br />
               mony to the fact that the school question was 
               <br />
               not discussed at all, and that the vote of Nov- 
               <br />
               ember last could not be taken as expressing any 
               <br />
               opinion upon the matter. 
               <br />

               I quite agree with Mr. Scott, as reported in 
               <br />
               the ‘ Globe’ of Saturday, that the school ques- 
               <br />
               tion was ‘not an issue at all in the last elec-
