               heard discussions in this House as to whe-

               Mr. Haultain, the premier of the Northwest

               Territories, has declared that If he were 
               <br />
               dictator to-morrow, he would not change 
               <br />
               the school law, and he is certainly right 
               <br />
               in so expressing himself. That law is a 
               <br />

               I notice that the Conservative press of 
               <br />
               to—day claims that a great victory on the 
               <br />
               school question has been won by the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party in Manitoba, in the division 
               <br />
               of Mountain, where a supporter of the 
               <br />
               Roblin government has been elected. 'I 
               <br />
               would like, however, to draw the attention 
               <br />
               of the House to the fact that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of Manitoba distinctly stated in 
               <br />
               opening the campaign, that the school ques- 
               <br />
               tion was not an issue in that election. He 
               <br />
               made that very clear and distinct, and his 
               <br />
               utterance on that point is quoted in to- 
               <br />
               day’s press. He has made a stand on what 
               <br />
               he calls the rights of Manitoba in the matter 
               <br />
               of the enlargement of its boundaries. If 
               <br />
               our friends of the opposition wish to put to 
               <br />
               the test how the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               stand on this question, there isavery good 
               <br />
               opportunity for them. There happen to be 
               <br />
               at present seven vacancies in the North- 
               <br />
               west legislature, and I believe it would be 
               <br />
               the consistent and the proper course for 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain to submit this question to 
               <br />
               the electors in those vacant constitutncies. 
               <br />
               He would then get his answer with no 
               <br />
               uncertain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sound';</span> and then, by calling the 
               <br />
               legislature together, he would be in a posi- 
               <br />
               tion to obtain a declaration from that body 
               <br />
               on the subject. I venture to prophesy that 
               <br />
               he would ﬁnd himself in the very unpleasant 
               <br />
               position of being voted down by the North- 
               <br />
               west legislature. The school Act of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories makes it very clear 
               <br />
               what the powers of the provinces are. The 
               <br />
               school system is under the control of a sup- 
               <br />
               erintendent ; that superintendent is respons- 
               <br />
               ible to the government : he has his advisory 
               <br />
               board, he licenses the teachers, provides 
               <br />
               their curriculum, selects the text-books of 
               <br />
               the schools, provides for their inspection,
