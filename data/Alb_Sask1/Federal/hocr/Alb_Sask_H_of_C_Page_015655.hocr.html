               much better illustrations of inequality

               and I must confess that I expected to hear 
               <br />
               from my right hon. friend something differ— 
               <br />

               <br />
               because they do not really exist—two mem- 
               <br />
               bers I have not heard, except something 
               <br />
               about community of interest. The answer 
               <br />
               to that is that we are not disturbing that 
               <br />
               principle, because the proposal is that they 
               <br />
               shall all be represented by one member. 
               <br />
               The other suggestion is the feeble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one.</span> 
               <br />
               that they must have two members in 
               <br />
               order that they may be able to see 
               <br />
               their representatives. That seems to me 
               <br />
               extraordinary enough to provoke a smile. 
               <br />
               There are say 800 or 1,000 electors there 
               <br />
               according to the argument of hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               by any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufficient</span> basis, and we must give 
               <br />
               one member to each 500 of these in order 
               <br />
               that he may have the privilege of seeing 
               <br />
               his constituents and they him. What guar-

               <br />
               oftener than they would see one? Is there 
               <br />
               not a mail service there? How many of 
               <br />
               our constituents do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we.</span> see in the course of. 
               <br />
               a year or four years? Is not ninety-nine— 
               <br />
               one-hundredths of the business which each 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. Perhaps I nniy be allowed 
               <br />
               to say that, as I understand the difference of 
               <br />
               policy, it is this: Our hon. friends on the 
               <br />
               other side claim that the only test in regard 
               <br />
               to distribution of seats should be population.
