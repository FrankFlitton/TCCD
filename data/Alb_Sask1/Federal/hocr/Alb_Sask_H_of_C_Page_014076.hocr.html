               question before the House, the hon. member

               ity does he make that statement? Is it 
               <br />
               upon the authority of the petition that I

               ment to be the highest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> of a British 
               <br />
               subject. I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">availing</span> myself of that 
               <br />
               right, and I was quite within my right. I 
               <br />
               shall read the letter so that there may be 
               <br />
               no mistake as to what it contains, and if 
               <br />
               the careful examiner ﬁnds that I have done 
               <br />
               a very improper thing I shall be greatly 
               <br />
               surprised. In view of this important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques</span> 
               <br />
               tion that was coming up and was likely to 
               <br />
               create discord—and let me remind the hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> that it was his leader who 
               <br />
               brought it into the arena and not mine, and 
               <br />
               that upon this question one of the most im- 
               <br />
               portant ministers resigned, and in doing so 
               <br />
               he was quite within his rights—it was in 
               <br />
               the endeavour to prevent the calamity and 
               <br />
               the political trouble that I foresaw that I 
               <br />
               adopted the measures that I did. What (lid 
               <br />
               I do? I addressed to a society to which I 
               <br />
               belonged, which is a law-abiding society, no
