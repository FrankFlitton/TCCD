               to have said so, but he wanted more. It may 
               <br />
               be said that the Act of 1870 was modiﬁed in 
               <br />
               its passage through the imperial parliament, 
               <br />
               and that Sir John Macdonald’s idea was not 
               <br />
               crystallized into legislation, but I have taken 
               <br />
               the trouble to follow the career of this Act 
               <br />
               in its different stages through the imperial 
               <br />
               parliament, and I ﬁnd that it was introduced 
               <br />
               one day, read a second time another day, a 
               <br />
               third time another day, and not a single 
               <br />
               syllable was said about it in the House or 
               <br />
               in Committee of the Whole. This clearly 
               <br />
               shows that the imperial parliament simply 
               <br />
               took the Bill as it was sent to them from 
               <br />
               the Canadian government, and put it through 
               <br />
               without any change. We are quite familiar 
               <br />
               with the Act itself, and I think that any 
               <br />
               ordinary man can have no difﬁculty in 
               <br />

               <br />
               new powers which up to that time we had 
               <br />
               not. It says :

               Reading that, with the explanation con- 
               <br />
               tained in Sir John’s letter to Lord Kimber- 
               <br />

               <br />
               culty in concluding what power we have. 
               <br />
               It may be said: if the power of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion parliament to form the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of Manitoba was good and absolute, 
               <br />
               and if there was no question about its con- 
               <br />
               stitutionality, why did the Canadian govern- 
               <br />
               ment go to England for conﬁrmation of the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act. Without setting oneself up 
               <br />
               as any great constitutional authority, I think 
               <br />
               It is perfectly plain why that happened. 
               <br />
               The parliament of Canada believed that it 
               <br />
               had no power to deal with the Northwest 
               <br />
               except as to the power which was delegated 
               <br />
               by the Orders in Council which I have read, 
               <br />
               and by acts which were passed subsequent to 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1867. The 
               <br />
               Order in Council giving them power to deal 
               <br />
               with this question was passed on the 21st 
               <br />
               day of June, but it will be seen that the 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act received the assent of the 
               <br />
               Governor General here in Canada on the 
               <br />

               <br />
               passed in this House before the passage of 
               <br />
               the Order in Council, it might well have 
               <br />
               suggested itself to the law oﬂicers in Can-

               it was an important constitutional matter,

               It may be said that there is an amend-

               <br />
               there is only an amendment in this Act. 
               <br />
               The power of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment:</span> was recognized 
               <br />
               in the Manitoba Act, and section 2 of that

               nearly as I can read it, the same as the 
               <br />
               second section of the Manitoba Act of 1870. 
               <br />
               The Act of 1870 reads that such changes 
               <br />
               shall be made as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> necessary to make the 
               <br />
               British North America Act applicable to 
               <br />
               the conditions existing in Manitoba. That 
               <br />
               is not the exact wording. but that is the 
               <br />
               meaning of it; it is changed to suit the 
               <br />
               circumstances. Now, what do we ﬁnd to- 
               <br />
               day ? All that we ﬁnd in the second sec- 
               <br />
               tion of the Bill which is now before the 
               <br />
               House is that changes will be made to suit 
               <br />
               the circumstances existing at the time at 
               <br />
               which we create another province. A great 
               <br />
               deal of fear seems to be expressed by some 
               <br />
               parties in this House that we are destroying 
               <br />
               the constitution, that it is an awful thing to 
               <br />
               make any amendment in this Act. and the 
               <br />
               slightest change would destroy the whole 
               <br />
               fabric of the constitution. Sir John Mac- 
               <br />
               donald was, I presume, as loyal to the con- 
               <br />
               stitution as any man in this country. Our 
               <br />
               hon. friends, at any rate, were willing to 
               <br />
               follow him and to endorse his views on con- 
               <br />
               stiturtional matters. He proposed this 
               <br />
               amendment to the constitution in 1870, he 
               <br />
               put it through this House, he went several 
               <br />
               times to the country, and the electors en- 
               <br />
               dorsed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">himself,</span> his constitution and his 
               <br />
               amendments, and nobody ever suggested
