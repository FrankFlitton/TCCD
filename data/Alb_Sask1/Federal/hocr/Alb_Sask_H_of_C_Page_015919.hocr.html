               <br />

               improvement on their schedules. I do not

               propose to follow this matter very much 
               <br />
               further. I do not think that the argument 
               <br />
               made by the hon. members for Western As- 
               <br />
               siniboia and Saskatchewan have added any- 
               <br />
               thing to the information of members of this 
               <br />
               committee. I think they have not proved 
               <br />
               the case they started out to prove in any 
               <br />
               particular. They depend on vague calcu- 
               <br />
               lations as to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prospective</span> populations and 
               <br />
               so on. In reference to the accusation made 
               <br />
               against me that I wish to deprive the new- 
               <br />
               comers ot their right to representation, that 
               <br />
               is absolutely incorrect. Incoming American 
               <br />
               citizens were especially mentioned in this 
               <br />
               connection by the hon. member for Sas~ 
               <br />
               katchewan (Mr. Lamont). These American 
               <br />
               citizens have not settled in one corner of the 
               <br />
               country, but have spread everywhere. They 
               <br />
               have come in very largely into my own 
               <br />
               neighbourhood. Within a very few miles of 
               <br />
               me there are a considerable number of 
               <br />
               American citizens who were not entitled to 
               <br />
               vote at the last election. A great many of 
               <br />
               these American citizens. men of means, 
               <br />
               have determined to settle in the districts 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> have proved their capacity for grow-

               districts, where they know they can make 
               <br />
               a success of farming. I propose that all 
               <br />
               should be treated alike, both those who go 
               <br />
               into the north and those Who go into the 
               <br />

               <br />
               of representation.

               on the suggestion I have offered, which, to 
               <br />
               a great extent, would remove the disparities 
               <br />
               and discrepancies in Assinibola which exist 
               <br />

               ple <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on‘</span> the 800 line contend, with a great

               deal of justice, that a different distribution 
               <br />
               ought to be made of Assiniboia to serve 
               <br />
               their purposes. They feel themselves at the 
               <br />
               extremes in South Regina and South Qn’Ap- 
               <br />
               pelle. They feel that the weight is against 
               <br />
               them, and they have sent down a great 
               <br />
               many strong representations asking that

               line. I have made a proposition that I 
               <br />
               think is fair. These four districts on the

               <br />

               take the homestead entries as being any 
               <br />

               Mr. LAKE. But they are over the aver- 
               <br />
               age for the whole province of Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               The only difference between my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott) and myself is that I suggest 
               <br />
               that he should get this extra seat from the 
               <br />
               three constituencies which now group around 
               <br />
               Regina—Lumsden, Regina and South Re- 
               <br />
               gina—and that he should redistribute these 
               <br />
               seats. The average for these seats is 1,344 
               <br />
               as against an average in the constituencies 
               <br />
               he proposes to cut up of 1,554. I contend 
               <br />
               that it would be very much easier and a 
               <br />
               much more suitable and fairer distribution 
               <br />
               to do as I suggested—to make the new 800 
               <br />
               district out of a portion of the. present dis— 
               <br />
               trict of South Regina, adding to it a por- 
               <br />
