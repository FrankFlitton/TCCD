               <br />
               and entered into an agreement with the late 
               <br />
               Sir Oliver Mowat to this eﬁfect, that if the 
               <br />
               Reform party were returned to power—and 
               <br />
               the signs of the times pointed that way— 
               <br />
               nir. Mowat would resign his seat in the local

               <br />

               <br />
               canny Scotchman, was not going to take 
               <br />
               any chances and would not resign his pre- 
               <br />
               miership of Ontario until it was certain 
               <br />
               that the Liberals were returned to power in 
               <br />
               the Dominion. Contrary to his protestations 
               <br />
               in the past, that the provincial government 
               <br />
               should not interfere in Dominion elections, 
               <br />
               Sir Oliver Mowat took a very active part 
               <br />
               in those elections, and I had the pleasure of 
               <br />
               meeting him on several platforms. The po-

               <br />
               upon Manitoba to deprive that province of 
               <br />
               its rights, and I ask the electors of Ontario 
               <br />
               to look back at my past history and say 
               <br />
               whether I have not on all occasions stood for 
               <br />
               equal rights. Have I not, he exclaimed, 
               <br />
               fought the battle of equal rights in years 
               <br />
               gone by, have I not fought it in connection 
               <br />
               with the boundary award and the license 
               <br />
               question and fought it successfully. And 
               <br />
               just as I fought it in the past in the local 
               <br />
               legislature, so I shall, when I enter Domi-

               <br />
               of Manitoba but of all that great western 
               <br />
               country; and he went on to declare that 
               <br />
               when in the near future the territories would 
               <br />
               be created provinces, he would see that equal 
               <br />
               rights were extended to them. He would 
               <br />
               never agree to separate schools or to reme- 
               <br />
               dial legislation for the purpose of forcing 
               <br />
               those schools upon Manitoba or any pro- 
               <br />
               vince in the great lone land. And if the 
               <br />
               time should ever come when he would not 
               <br />
               have that power, he would resign his place 
               <br />
               in the House. The Postmaster General took 
               <br />
               the same ground. He declared on many a 
               <br />
               platform that he would never support sep~ 
               <br />
               arate schools in the Dominion and would 
               <br />
               never allow remedial degislation to be forced 
               <br />
               on Manitoba. The First Minister was also 
               <br />
               loud in his denunciation of the late govern- 
               <br />
               ment. He declared that he had stood in 
               <br />
               this House, and was prepared to stand in 
               <br />
               any part of the Dominion, for provincial 
               <br />
               rights, and that he would never allow this 
               <br />
               remedial legislation to be placed on Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. He would never shackle any pro- 
               <br />
               vince with legislation along that line. He 
               <br />
               would never put the fetters upon any of 
               <br />
               those provinces, he was opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools, he was pleased to know that they 
               <br />
               could attend school together, that they could 
               <br />
               go to the polls and vote together, and the 
               <br />
               result was that all these statements had

               Reformers were surprised at the large vote 
               <br />
               which they received in Ontario. They ob-

               <br />

               <br />
               all these principles, to swallow themselves 
               <br />
               and to come here to-day after making these 
               <br />
               pledges in Ontario and endeavour to force

               separate schools upon this province, although

               they are the very men who denounced them

               <br />
               succeed in swallowing all these promises. 
               <br />
               I cannot understand it unless in the words 
               <br />
               of the poet:

               We had them on one occasion but they have 
               <br />
               all disappeared. After a trial the Roman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> found that the public schools were

               much better and cheaper than the separate 
               <br />
               schools. it has been pointed out to us in 
               <br />
               the past that our public schools are Godless

               testant religion is concerned there is no God 
               <br />

               <br />
               concerned they must remember that we had 
               <br />
               enacted the Ross Bible from which portions

               charged that these schools are Godless

               <br />
               is concerned they do not want separate 
               <br />
               schools. and I venture to say that that is 
               <br />
               the case in many parts of the province as 
               <br />
               well. I have here a resolution which was 
               <br />
               passed in my county regretting that a pro- 
               <br />
               vision for separate schools was placed in 
               <br />
               this Bill. I have here also the statement 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Public Works for Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and I must say that it shows a most 
               <br />
               extraordinary state of affairs indeed. We 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               expect, they were met by the Papal dele- 
               <br />

               the work of the church, but just as soon 
               <br />
               as he interferes in our educational questions, 
               <br />
               then I say the line must be drawn and we 
               <br />
               have a right to take exception to his action. 
               <br />
               It has been going the rounds for many 
               <br />
               days that the Papal delegate met Mr.

               Rogers and Mr. Campbell by appointment 
               <br />
               and made a proposition to them. The pro- 
               <br />
               position was that they should place a clause 
               <br />
