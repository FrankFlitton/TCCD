               <br />
               I think every member from the Northwest 
               <br />
               knows that as well as I do. There are many 
               <br />
               letters coming all the time from our con- 
               <br />
               stituents asking us to see the land depart- 
               <br />
               ment at Ottawa and to arrange matters for 
               <br />
               them. A very large proportion of the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the Northwest have business to do 
               <br />
               with the land department, and it would be 
               <br />
               very much more convenient for them it 
               <br />
               they were enabled to do their business on 
               <br />
               the spot. Besides, I do not consider that the 
               <br />
               administration of lands from Ottawa is at 
               <br />
               all what it should be, and is far less satis- 
               <br />
               factory than it would be on the spot. There 
               <br />
               are many points I might specify in which I 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> the administration at Ottawa is de- 
               <br />
               cidedly not in the interest of the country. At 
               <br />
               this moment I will not say any more about 
               <br />
               that, there will be other opportunities later 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> But I make the assertion that I do not 
               <br />
               think the administration of the lands in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories is what it should be, 
               <br />
               or is what it would be if the administration 
               <br />
               was carried on from a central point in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. It stands .to reason 
               <br />
               that it is very much more easy to interest 
               <br />
               the members of a House sitting right on the 
               <br />
               spot and composed of gentlemen who are 
               <br />
               all acquainted with the circumstances of the 
               <br />
               country, than it is to interest a large House 
               <br />
               such as is assembled at Ottawa. For in- 
               <br />
               stance, we have ten members for the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories, and if anything is going 
               <br />
               wrong in the Northwest Territories it is 
               <br />
               necessary for some of those ten- members, 
               <br />
               possibly a very small number of them to 
               <br />
               acquaint the whole of this large House with 
               <br />
               the circumstances, and to get this House of 
               <br />
               214 members interested in the matter. That 
               <br />
               is especially difﬁcult in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               so many other matters of vast importance 
               <br />
               have to be dealt with here.

               I think it might be taken for granted as 
               <br />
               a general principle that the administration 
               <br />
               will be better on the spot than it can pos- 
               <br />
               sibly be if the administration takes place 
               <br />
               from a centre, 1,500 miles or more away.

               rently thought it would be unwise to trust

               the local assembly with the administration

               <br />
               are administered from Ottawa. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Assiniboia, also, I think, ask- 
               <br />
               ed the question as to how it would be 
               <br />
               possible to carry on the local government 
               <br />
               at the present moment without the reve-

               minion government as compensation for the 
               <br />
               loss of the lands. I looked at the Audit- 
               <br />
               or General’s Report a few minutes ago just 
               <br />
               to see what the revenue derived from Dom-

               from lands and timber agencies, less certain 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$890,152</span> last year, and that for the previous 
               <br />
               year it had been $113,287 greater than that.

               <br />
               me that the difference between these two- 
               <br />

               <br />
               sum which amounts to something over 
               <br />
               $600,000. Of course, in addition to that 
               <br />
               there is a large expenditure 011 capital ac- 
               <br />
               count for surveys and so on, but, I think, 
               <br />
               the government of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories would equally be able to raise a sum 
               <br />
               on capital account to meet such capital ex- 
               <br />
               rpenses as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenses</span> of surveys and so 
               <br />
               on. So, I gather from the Auditor Gen- 
               <br />
               eral’s Report that there is a very consider- 
               <br />
               able revenue coming in at the present time 
               <br />
               from these lands, an income which was 
               <br />
               very nearly as large as the compensation 
               <br />
               which is to be granted for the ﬁrst few 
               <br />
               years for the loss of the public lands. I 
               <br />
               have no doubt in my mind whatever that it 
               <br />
               would be quite easy for the local govern- 
               <br />
               ment to very considerably add to that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span>

               <br />
               local conditions. A new point was intro- 
               <br />
               duced into the discussion also by the hon. 
               <br />
               member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> West Assiniboia when he 
               <br />
               stated that the retention of the Royal North- 
               <br />
               west Mounted Police was a consideration 
               <br />
               which had to be looked at in connection 
               <br />
               with this question of public lands. For my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               part I cannot see that the question of the 
               <br />
               retention of the Mounted Police is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attested</span> 
               <br />
               one iota one way or the other by the ques-

               tion as to whether the Dominion or the 
               <br />
               new provinces have the possession of the 
               <br />
               public lands. If the amount of compensa-
