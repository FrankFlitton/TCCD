               friend from Brandon (Mr. Sifton) explained

               <br />
               1 found this Dominion government unani- 
               <br />
               mously. together with the Northwest govern- 
               <br />
               ment and a majority of the Northwest mem- 
               <br />
               bers all determined to proceed now, I had to 
               <br />
               come to a decision which would either pre- 
               <br />
               vent me from exercising any inﬂuence in 
               <br />
               the details of autonomy or agree to forego 
               <br />
               my own opinion on the point, agree to ac- 
               <br />
               tion now, and take my part in obtaining a 
               <br />
               settlement of terms and conditions accord- 
               <br />
               ing to the wishes of the electors whom I 
               <br />
               represent. Even now, were I not satis- 
               <br />
               ﬁed that the ﬁnancial terms as a whole are 
               <br />
               so ample and generous as to offset in a 
               <br />
               great measure the ﬁnancial handicap meant 
               <br />
               by the exemption feature, I should deem 
               <br />
               it my duty to myself and the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories to oppose the Bills. I may say 
               <br />
               further that the overturning by the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court of the decision given by the Maui- 
               <br />
               toba Court in 1903, does seriously lessen the 
               <br />
               force of the position I held against creating 
               <br />
               these provinces at present, and my reluct- 
               <br />
               ance is also relieved in seine degree by the 
               <br />
               intimation given by the premier of probable 
               <br />
