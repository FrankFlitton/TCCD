               party to take part in discussing the issue. 
               <br />
               or what I conceived to be the only issue be— 
               <br />
               fore the electorate in that contest, and that 
               <br />
               was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁect</span> of this section 16 in regard 
               <br />
               to the education or educational rights in 
               <br />
               the new provinces about to be created. I 
               <br />
               do not intend now to enter into any lengthy 
               <br />
               discussion as to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> on this question. 
               <br />
               I have already expressed those views in 
               <br />
               this House, and having listened attentively 
               <br />
               to the debate since then, as well as to that 
               <br />
               which took place before I spoke, I have not 
               <br />
               heard any arguments which have led me to 
               <br />
               change my opinion. All I desire to do is 
               <br />
               to prove the position I took in North Oxford 
               <br />
               which was disputed by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Cape Breton (Mr. McKenzie). The 
               <br />
               meeting at which the difference of opinion 
               <br />
               between us arose took place at a place called 
               <br />
               Braemar in North Oxford. The only report 
               <br />
               of that meeting that I have seen was pub- 
               <br />
               lished in the ‘Globe’ on June 12. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span>

               port it would seem must have been pre- 
               <br />
               pared. or at least inspired, by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lion.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">menr</span>

               her for Cape Breton. I say that for this
