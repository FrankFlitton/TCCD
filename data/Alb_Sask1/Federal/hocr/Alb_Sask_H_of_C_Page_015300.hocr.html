               <br />

               bers of the opposition representing these

               two provinces set up the claim that they

               were entitled to a greater representation in

               We refuse to give it to you. The govern-

               ment might undertake to punish these two 
               <br />
               provinces because they sent a larger number

               not to the same extent, that they be given 
               <br />
               representation now for a certain number, 
               <br />
               and that when the population increases by

               a certain number they will be entitled to a

               <br />
               sentation might not be just. The Bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro.</span> 
               <br />
               vides for ﬁnancial assistance on the basis of 
               <br />
               an eventual population of 1,200,000 for each 
               <br />
               province, and the result would be that a 
               <br />
               population of 2,500,000 in these two provinces 
               <br />
               would only have twelve senators, when less 
               <br />
               populous provinces would have a larger 
               <br />
               representation. I do not say you must base 
               <br />
               it altogether on population, but apparently 
               <br />
               the original scheme of confederation took 
               <br />
               more account of population than did the 
               <br />
               constitution of the United States.
