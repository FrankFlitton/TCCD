               north of the Tweed, where he would have

               try, perhaps more than any other country 
               <br />
               which has valued education. The peasant 
               <br />
               of Scotland is a philosopher. The artisan 
               <br />
               in the mills at Paisley and elsewhere 
               <br />
               throughout Scotland is a scholar. This is 
               <br />
               mainly due to the splendid educational sys- 
               <br />
               tem that has obtained in Scotland for the 
               <br />
               past 300 or 400 years, a system which has 
               <br />
               produced men in all walks of life second 
               <br />
               to none the world over. Now, how do they 
               <br />
               manage this matter of education in Scot- 
               <br />
               land? I ﬁnd that in the year 1903 there 
               <br />
               were £722,000 spent on public schools; for 
               <br />
               Church of Scotland schools, the Presbyter- 
               <br />
               ian church, the Established Church nearly 
               <br />
               £27,000 from the public chest; for United 
               <br />
               Free Church schools, £25,000 from the 
               <br />
               public moneys; for Episcopal schools. 
               <br />
               £15,000; for Roman Catholics schools, 
               <br />

               <br />
               of that with my hon. friends opposite, and 
               <br />
               I say that Scotland, in that as in many

               other matters shows an example that should 
               <br />
