               )Ir. INGRAM. I know we will come to it 
               <br />
               later on and we will have a good deal to say 
               <br />
               about it. The expression which was used 
               <br />
               on a former occasion will again apply, we 
               <br />
               will see the snow -ﬂy before we get away 
               <br />
               from here and it will he a foot deep. I will 
               <br />
               guarantee. because we will stay here rather 
               <br />
               than allow any such high handed legislation 
               <br />
               to pass as this which is now proposed. This 
               <br />
               is high handed legislation of the worst kind. 
               <br />
               Talk about the old days! We used to hear 
               <br />
               a great deal from our hon. friends in the 
               <br />
               country about star chamber business. The 
               <br />
               Liberal party have forgotten the principles 
               <br />
               of days gone by. They now adopt star 
               <br />
               chamber principles—principles that the peo— 
               <br />
               ple will condemn when they read over the 
               <br />
               legislation which is now before this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com‘</span>
