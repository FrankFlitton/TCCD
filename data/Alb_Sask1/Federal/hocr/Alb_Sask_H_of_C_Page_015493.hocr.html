               made such a sacriﬁce. but in their own in-

               Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“TLFRID</span> LAURIER. The position 
               <br />
               of the government is this: that the min- 
               <br />
               ority claim that under the Act of 1875 they 
               <br />
               had the right to select their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">textbooks.</span> 
               <br />
               They claim also, as the correspondence of 
               <br />
               record will show. that they have a right 
               <br />
               to separate school boards. They have that 
               <br />
               or they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> not. and in order to make it 
               <br />
               absolutely sure. we have abandoned that 
               <br />
               clause and taken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> other.

               Mr. R. L. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BORDE’N.</span> I asked my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend one question and he slipped 
               <br />
               away very conveniently to another. The 
               <br />
               words ‘as they may think ﬁt’ do not occur 
               <br />
               in respect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> minority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> schools. 
               <br />
               Does not the right hon. gentleman remember 
               <br />
               the section ? I asked him a very distinct 
               <br />
               question as to the meaning of the words 
               <br />
               ‘such schools therein as they may think 
               <br />
               ﬁt.’ These words do not occur in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the provision for minority schools, 
               <br />
               but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> do occur in connection with the 
               <br />
               provision for majority schools, about which 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman was speaking. 
               <br />
               When I ask him about that, he leaves that 
               <br />
               part of the section and goes to the next part 
               <br />
               of the section, which does not contain these 
               <br />
               I words at all.
