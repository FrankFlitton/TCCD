               the Northwest Territories Act was passed

               <br />
               and of the Hon. Edward Blake, to prove 
               <br />
               what those gentlemen had in their minds 
               <br />
               when they incorporated that provision in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories Ac’t, stating that 
               <br />
               they wished intending immigrants to know

               what kind of schools they were going to

               have in that country. when I venture to 
               <br />
               say that not one man in 5,000 who have 
               <br />
               gone into that country to make homes for 
               <br />
               themselves ever asked the question whether 
               <br />
               there were separate schools there. The only 
               <br />
               question agitating them was: What educa—

               <br />
               proof of this is found in the fact that, not- 
               <br />
               withstanding that the Act permitting separ-

               <br />
               years, there is a diminishing number of

               single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expression</span> in that literature where

               there was any reference to a separate school

               the hon. member for Qu’Appelle (Mr. Lake) 
               <br />

               <br />
               McCarthy), it is distinctly stated in a pam- 
               <br />
               phlet that has been distributed that the 
               <br />
               schools are non-sectarian, and national

               in their character—not a word about 
               <br />
               separate schools. The Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               stated that on his European tour he was 
               <br />

               much agitated about the outcome of this 
               <br />
               separate school agitation in Canada, and 
               <br />
               the impresion he conveyed to the members

               Now, Mr. Speaker, in view of the speech 
               <br />
               made by the Minister of Finance the other 
               <br />
               evening, I think we would all be delighted 
               <br />
               to hear the character of the reply he made 
               <br />
               to that representative of a foreign country. 
               <br />
               I think if the hon. gentleman sends a copy 
               <br />
               of his speech over to that representative it 
               <br />
               will convey to that gentleman a vastly dif- 
               <br />
               ferent impression from the impression he 
               <br />
               gave him in the reply which he gave, be- 
               <br />
               cause I am sure he did not try to convince 
               <br />
               that representative that they had no separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools in that country, where as his 
               <br />
               whole argument here was to convince us 
               <br />
               that there were practically no separate 
               <br />
               schools, that they were national schools, 
               <br />
               and that any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁerence</span> there is would 
               <br />
               soon disappear. This policy, in my opinion. 
               <br />
               cannot be defended on legal grounds. The 
               <br />
               constitution of our country does not force 
               <br />
               us to perpetuate this system of schools con- 
               <br />
               trary to the Wishes of the people inhabiting 
               <br />
               that part of the Dominion. It is true that 
               <br />
               the right hon. leader of the government, 
               <br />
               when he introduced this Bill, based his sole 
               <br />
               argument upon the ground that he stood 
               <br />
               by and on the rock of the constitution, but 
               <br />
               by the time my hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition had got through with his 
               <br />
