               men enough in ofﬁce willing to do it, but. 
               <br />
               neither the government nor the Liberal 
               <br />
               party are prepared to do anything. Neither 
               <br />
               will take the requisite steps to secure to the 
               <br />

               Toronto the two-cent rate to which they are 
               <br />
               entitled. These monopolies are the curse 
               <br />
               of parliament and the country. From time 
               <br />
               to time we have the doctrine laid down that 
               <br />
               parliament ought not to interfere. But I 
               <br />
               contend that it is the duty of parliament to 
               <br />
               regulate every one of these corporations, 
               <br />
               and give a warning to any corporation which 
               <br />
               is not treating the public fairly, that it must 
               <br />
               mend its ways or we will wipe it out of 
               <br />
               existence. Instead, however, of giving these 
               <br />
               corporations a warning, we give them addi- 
               <br />
               tional concessions every time they ask for 
               <br />
               them, and the public are told to go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into,</span> the 
               <br />
               courts and recover their rights if they can, 
               <br />
               but that they need expect no assistance 
               <br />
               from the Minister of Justice or the Minister 
               <br />
               of Railways.

               There is another point to which attention 
               <br />
               has been called of late, and which is well 
               <br />
               worthy of attention, and that is that in the 
               <br />
               United States, whose institutions we some- 
               <br />
               times think but little of, they have what is 
               <br />
               known as the grand jury, which is pos- 
               <br />
               sessed of powers of inquiry at important 
               <br />
               stages. In this country it was left to a 
               <br />
               private citizen to investigate the shameful 
               <br />
               ballot-box frauds that were attempted in 
               <br />
               the recent election. \Ve‘ were told that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice was active in the matter 
               <br />
               but still it was left to a private citizen to 
               <br />
               expose the crime that had been attempted. 
               <br />
               Had we had a grand jury system as in the 
               <br />
               United States, the Crown Attorney could 
               <br />
               have issued a warrant and an investigation 
               <br />
               could have been held. And the same with 
               <br />
               other scandals in the recent election. But, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> things are. there is no promise of an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in«</span>

               <br />
               one identiﬁed with the government.

               Returning for a moment to the position 
               <br />
               of railway corporations and their inﬂuence, 
               <br />
               we find that the greatest evil prevailing in 
               <br />
               the United States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> in connection with 
               <br />
               railroading is the granting of discriminating 
               <br />
               rates in favour of certain corporations. 
               <br />
               There are great trusts in the United States, 
               <br />
               and these have been built up by railroad 
               <br />
               discriminations. The people of the United 
               <br />
               States are trying in some way to stop these 
               <br />
               discrimin-ations. The plan that they have 
               <br />
               adopted is that of establishing a court such 
               <br />
               as our Railway Commission. But this plan 
               <br />
               has not succeeded. The president has been 
               <br />
               forced to take up the question. iBut the pub- 
               <br />
               lic there see more and more clearly that the 
               <br />
               only substantial cure is in government own- 
               <br />
               ership of the railways. And that, I believe, 
               <br />
               is equally true of this country. It is true 
               <br />
               that hon. gentlemen opposite say they do 
               <br />
               not believe in government ownership. But

               government ownership is the new principle 
               <br />
               of this century of which the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister professes to be the exponent. 
               <br />
               He has not read aright the sentiment of the 
               <br />
               country if he thinks that government owner- 
               <br />
               ship is not the only cure of the grievances 
               <br />
               arising from the operation of railways in 
               <br />
               this country and in the United States. But, 
               <br />
               instead of proposing government ownership, 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman leaves us in doubt. 
               <br />
               As the hon, member for North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) has pointed out, we are entitled to 
               <br />
               an explanation in regard to our state—owned 
               <br />
               railway, the Intercolonial. Is the rumour 
               <br />
               true that that railway is to be given over 
               <br />
               to the Grand Trunk ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> know that it is 
               <br />
               true that when the opportunity presented 
               <br />
               itself recently to couple up the Canada 
               <br />
               Atlantic with our state—owned road, the gov- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ernment</span> failed to improve that opportunity, 
               <br />
               thereby injuring the interests of the people 
               <br />
               and of the people’s railway. The govern- 
               <br />
               ment had the opportunity of strengthening 
               <br />
               the Intercolonial, but apparently their policy 
               <br />
               is to let that road run down and turn it 
               <br />
               over to the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc. Such a 
               <br />
               policy is not in line, I believe, with the 
               <br />
               demand of the times. The people see that 
               <br />
               there is no cure for the transportation pro- 
               <br />
               blems of this country except in government 
               <br />
               ownership. And if gentlemen opposite think 
               <br />
               they have a mandate from the people to 
               <br />
               destroy government ownership, I venture to 
               <br />
               tell them that they are mistaken. There 
               <br />
               is a party in this country, a national, a 
               <br />
               growing party, a party favoured by the 
               <br />
               young men of Canada, which holds that the 
               <br />
               best thing that could happen to this country 
               <br />
               would be the nationalization of the Grand 
               <br />
               Trunk Paciﬁc. And the agitation to nation- 
               <br />
               alize that railway at an early stage of its 
               <br />
               career will go on. The carrying out of that 
               <br />
               policy will give hope of relief to the people, 
               <br />
               and especially to the people of Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec. The grievances of these people 
               <br />
               against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Grand Trunk <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> are worse 
               <br />
               than ever they were. The grie 'ances of 
               <br />
               Toronto and Montreal. the grievances of the 
               <br />
               manufacturers and the shippers and o’ther 
               <br />
               people who live along that line are constant— 
               <br />
               ly increasing, and the feeling of these people 
               <br />
               is that state-ownership of that great railway 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> the only cure for those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grievances.</span> 
               <br />
               Reference has been made to the promise 
               <br />
               of increased autonomy to the Northwest. 
               <br />
               It is high time that this idea should be car— 
               <br />
               ried out. I hope that the measure will be 
               <br />
               a wide one, and one that will allow for the 
               <br />
               growth and development of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> 
               <br />
               But when we speak of increased autonomy 
               <br />
               for the Northwest, I think there is something 
               <br />
               to be said of the need of greater autonomy 
               <br />
               for the Dominion. The time has come 
               <br />
               when the bounds of our powers asa country 
               <br />
               should be widened. I am not afraid of the 
               <br />
               future and of the problems it will present 
               <br />
               for solution. I am not afraid to say that 
               <br />
