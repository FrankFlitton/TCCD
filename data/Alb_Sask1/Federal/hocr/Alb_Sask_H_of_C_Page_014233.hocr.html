               ii‘ some persons in the country are inclined 
               <br />
               to think that there must have been a rea- 
               <br />
               son for such treatment of the duly accre- 
               <br />
               dited representatives of the Northwest in 
               <br />
               connection with this important matter. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance is the gentleman who 
               <br />
               on the part of the government would be 
               <br />
               held responsible for the ﬁnancial terms 
               <br />
               which however lightly they may be spoken 
               <br />
               of in this House and however slightly they 
               <br />
               may be discussed by members who may not 
               <br />
               feel competent to discuss such an involved 
               <br />
               and intricate question, are of immense im— 
               <br />
               portance to this country in view of the fact 
               <br />
               that some millions of dollars a year are 
               <br />
               to be paid out to each of these provinces. 
               <br />
               Yet, it cannot be denied that the one min- 
               <br />
               ister in the government who should have 
               <br />
               been consulted on the ﬁnancial terms was 
               <br />
               not even in the city of Ottawa when the 
               <br />
               Bill was brought down, for it was brought 
               <br />
               down two days I think before the date on 
               <br />
               which it was known the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               would arrive here. The Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice was the member of the government 
               <br />
               who above all others was most intimately 
               <br />
               acquainted with all the questions involved 
               <br />
               in this measure, and yet it cannot be denied, 
               <br />
               for he himself has admitted it, that al- 
               <br />
               though he discussed diﬂ’erent other ques— 
               <br />
               tions with the government, although he had 
               <br />
               given long and anxious consideration to 
               <br />
               the education question. this. the most im- 
               <br />
               portant of all the questions had never been 
               <br />
               mentioned between him and his leader up 
               <br />
               to the time the Bill was laid before the 
               <br />
               House; and the Bill was hurriedly brought 
               <br />
               down within a couple of days before the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s expected return. Surely we 
               <br />
               cannot be surprised if some people should 
               <br />
               think that this is a suspicious circumstance. 
               <br />
               We ﬁnd. from the statements made to the 
               <br />
               House, that this important matter was de- 
               <br />
               ferred to a subcommittee of the government. 
               <br />
               I have not a word to say against the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of that sub-committee, but I would 
               <br />
               venture to suggest that perhaps those whom 
               <br />
               I may describe as the minority must not 
               <br />
               be surprised if those who happen to be in 
               <br />
               the majority think it rather strange, that 
               <br />
               when Mr. Haultain could not be consulted 
               <br />
               on the education clause, and when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex</span> 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior and the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance could not be consulted, that a 
               <br />
               commitee composed of the Premier, Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick, the Minister of Justice; Mr. 
               <br />
               Scott, the Secretary of State, and Sir Wil—

               liam Mulock were the four to whom was 
               <br />
               referred this important question. Surely 
               <br />
               there is something in'that to cause the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of this country to wonder if everything 
               <br />

               <br />
               sented by hon. gentlemen opposite. We ﬁnd 
               <br />
               on the return of the Minister of the In-

               man is not here to—night. I was at a loss

               while he was speaking to know, whether 
               <br />

               the more. Just think of the position he 
               <br />
               was in. The Minister of Finance says the

               <br />

               Minister of Justice says he did not intend 
               <br />
               to go one inch beyond the present condi-

               tions, but the clauses are drawn in such a 
               <br />
               tangled net that a man of the intelligence 
               <br />
               of the Minister of the Interior did not know 
               <br />
               what they meant, and he believed they were 
               <br />
               something so terrible that he had to resign 
               <br />
               from the government. There is an end to 
               <br />
               everything in this world, and you would 
               <br />
               have thought that about that time there 
               <br />
               was an end to the want of conﬁdence the 
               <br />
               ministers exhibited towards one another. 
               <br />

               Finance when they met together and found 
               <br />
               they were in absolute accord as to what 
               <br />
               they wanted; you would have thought it 
               <br />
               would not have been very diﬂicult for them 
               <br />

               words; and then and there the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior would have been contented with 
               <br />
               the clauses and would not have resigned. 
               <br />
               Evidently there was no such discussion. or 
               <br />
               the discussion that was held was not what 
               <br />
               we have been told. Evidently we have

               not been told all the truth, or else there 
               <br />
               was more all round stupidity displayed
