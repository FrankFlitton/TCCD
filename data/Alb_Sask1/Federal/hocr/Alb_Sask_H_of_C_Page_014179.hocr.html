               Now the next question I shall consider 
               <br />
               is, Who are asking for educational rights 
               <br />
               for minorities in those provinces ‘2 Are the 
               <br />
               people in those provinces complaining, even 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics, who, according to the 
               <br />
               census. number 30,000 ? So far as I know 
               <br />
               we have not had a single petition presented 
               <br />
               to this House from any of them asking that 
               <br />
               the provisions of this Bill be put through. 
               <br />
               Then why are we to be blamed if we say 
               <br />
               that these provisions are not needed there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1</span> 
               <br />
               The people there do not think they are 
               <br />
               needed, as otherwise I presume they would 
               <br />
               ask for them. So far as I know we have 
               <br />
               not yet received a single petition from that 
               <br />
               country asking that the new provinces be 
               <br />
               compelled to adopt that system ; so far as I 
               <br />
               know not a single memorial of any del- 
               <br />
               criptlon has come from that vast country 
               <br />
               asking us to adopt that system, though there 
               <br />
               are supposed to be 500,000 people in that 
               <br />
               country. Who is asking for it? Not the 
               <br />
               legislature of those Territories, because the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister of the Northwest legislature 
               <br />
               has declared that these school provisions are 
               <br />
               an improper interference with their rights, 
               <br />
               and he is opposed to them. He is speaking 
               <br />
               on behalf of that country, on behalf of all 
               <br />
               the people. Neither the majority nor the 
               <br />
               minority seems to be desirous of having this 
               <br />
               provision in the Bill. They have not 
               <br />
               asked their legislature for any change. 
               <br />
               Then I say, why should we force it upon 
               <br />
               them ? Are we not coercing them ? Then 
               <br />
               who are asking for it ? It is not the 
               <br />
               other provinces of the confederation who 
               <br />
               have no separate schools. Five out of 
               <br />
               the seven provinces of the confederation 
               <br />
               have no separate schools ; British Columbia 
               <br />
               has none, Manitoba has none, New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick and Nova Scotia have none, nor 
               <br />
               has Prince Edward Island. They are 
               <br />
               not asking for this measure, because they 
               <br />
               won’t have it at home. Then we may as- 
               <br />
               sume they do not want it. Is Ontario ask- 
               <br />
               ing for it ? Up to the. present time I think 
               <br />
               but one petition has come from Ontario re- 
               <br />
               commending that the provisions in the Bill 
               <br />
               be put through. Then who is asking for it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> 
               <br />
