               <br />
               area of 8.016 square miles. I proposed to 
               <br />
               divide Moosejaw, and instead of giving a 
               <br />
               city constituency and a country constituency 
               <br />
               I proposed two constituencies which would 
               <br />
               probably meet in the near vicinity of the 
               <br />
               city of Moosejaw. North Moosejaw would 
               <br />
               have 1.313 voters on the list and an area of 
               <br />
               8,820 square miles; South Moosejaw, 1.550 
               <br />
               voters on the list, area, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5,181</span> square miles; 
               <br />
               Maple Creek, 1,303 voters on the list, area, 
               <br />
               28,152 square miles. This will give an 
               <br />
               average of 550 voters on the list of each one 
               <br />
               of these eighteen constituencies in the south. 
               <br />
               Then I proposed to divide the northern con- 
               <br />
               stituencies as follows: Kinistino, 1,385 vot- 
               <br />

               or I should say northern constituencies. 
               <br />
               I have avoided as much as possible using 
               <br />
               the word <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatchevan</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">applied</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               old district of that name, for fear it should 
               <br />
               get confounded with the name of the new 
               <br />
               province. As I said before, the distribution 
               <br />
               which I propose does give an advantage of 
               <br />
               about eight per cent in fav_our of the north- 
               <br />
               ern constituencies. This is practically <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               avoidable, because the number which would 
               <br />
               be given under a fair distribution based 
               <br />
               on the number of voters on the list would 
               <br />
               give a fraction of a constituency both north 
               <br />
               and south. As I have said. I do not con~ 
               <br />
               sider that the proposal which I made was in 
               <br />
               any way perfect. I thought, however, that 
               <br />
               I should not go to this committee prepared 
               <br />
               only to criticise the existing schedules, but 
               <br />
               prepared to. make an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁer</span> of something 
               <br />
               which I considered to be a fair distribution, 
               <br />
               and I hoped the committee might take this 
               <br />
               as a basis for working out something that 
               <br />
               would be satisfactory to all the members 
               <br />
               of the committee. However, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appareut‘</span> 
               <br />
               1y was not to be, and I have heard nothing 
               <br />
               more about that proposal. It seems to me 
               <br />
               that the result of the conference is one 
               <br />
               which was to be expected under the cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances, when certain members took an 
               <br />
               absolutely uncompromising attitude which 
               <br />
               made it impossible to arrive at anything 
               <br />
               useful in the way of readjustment. It seem- 
               <br />
               ed to me that the only possible way to get 
               <br />
               a fair distribution of seats was by an in- 
               <br />
               dependent commission, and I am very sorry 
               <br />
               that the government did not take this op- 
               <br />
               portunity. which I consider was a very good 
               <br />
               one. to initiate this principle of distribu- 
               <br />
               tion by commission. I think it would have 
               <br />
               been much to the credit of the great party 
               <br />
               now in power if they had been the ﬁrst
