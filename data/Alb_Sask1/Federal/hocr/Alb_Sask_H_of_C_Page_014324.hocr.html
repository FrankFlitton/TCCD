               different from those that the Confederation

               <br />

               the doctrine of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               has been adopted, where any province has 
               <br />
               been given a constitution exactly in har- 
               <br />
               mony with the general scheme of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. There are no two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces whose constitutions are the same, 
               <br />
               though all derive their constitutions from 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. It is 
               <br />
               the spirit that suggests how the constitu~ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.tion</span> shall be framed. So, where is the 
               <br />
               model? And how can it be argued that 
               <br />
               when a province acquires the provincial 
               <br />
               status it acquires immediately certain rights 
               <br />
               and powers without any intervention or 
               <br />

               minion parliament or any other legislative 
               <br />

               <br />
               others by the provincial parliament. Take,

               divorce court unless it was so authorized 
               <br />
               by this parliament. This parliament has 
               <br />
               never established a divorce court in any 
               <br />
               province. And yet to—day there are divorce 
               <br />
               courts in several provinces—in Nova Scotia, 
               <br />
               in New Brunswick and, I think, in British 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Columbia.</span> How comes it that the subject 
               <br />
               of divorce, which, under the British North

               America <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.</span> is assigned to the exclusive

               jurisdiction of the Dominion parliament, is 
               <br />
               dealt with by several provinces? Simply 
               <br />
               because, when it came to the creation of 
               <br />
               confederation, certain provinces had at that 
               <br />
               time this institution. Nova Scotia had a 
               <br />
               divorce court and desired to retain it. The 
               <br />
               British North America Act allowed it to be 
               <br />
               retained in that province. In that respect 
               <br />
               it allowed a departure from the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. The province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Que</span> 
               <br />
               bec had no divorce court, and no divorce 
               <br />
               court was given it under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act—the Act recognized the status 
               <br />
               quo as respects that subject in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. New Brunswick had a divorce 
               <br />
               court and wished to retain it, and the British 
               <br />
               North America Act recognized the wish of 
               <br />
               that province and allowed it to retain the 
               <br />
               divorce court, thus making an exception 
               <br />
               from the letter of the Act. Ontario had no 
               <br />
               divorce court and was given no divorce court 
               <br />
               by the Act. Later on British Columbia 
               <br />
               came into confederation. As I understand 
               <br />
               it. British Columbia had a divorce court 
               <br />
               then, and it was left in the employment of 
               <br />
               that institution—the letter of the law was 
               <br />
               departed from, but the spirit was observed ; 
               <br />
               the general scheme of confederation was 
               <br />
               made applicable, but, with exceptions, re- 
               <br />
               cognizing local peculiarities and local insti- 
               <br />
               tutions. Then—going rapidly over the sub- 
               <br />
               jects of special importance to the provinces 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«take</span> the subject of languages. This is 
               <br />
               an English—speaking country; and it was 
               <br />
               assumed, doubtless, that English would be 
               <br />
               the prevailing language throughout the 
               <br />
               country. The use of language in the courts 
               <br />
               and legislatures of the provinces is a civil 
               <br />
               right, and, as such, is under the exclusive 
               <br />
               jurisdiction of the province. Yet, turning 
               <br />
               to the constitution as affecting the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, you will ﬁnd that, unlike the 
               <br />
               other provinces, Quebec was not left to 
               <br />
               determine what languages shall or shall 
               <br />
               not be used in its courts and legislature, 
               <br />
               but the British North America Act declares 
               <br />
               that the English language, along with the 
               <br />
               French. shall be lawful in the courts and 
               <br />
               legislature of that province.
