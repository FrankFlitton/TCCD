               opposite why these lands should not be

               Why are these lands detained to-day ? The

               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) says that 
               <br />
               there would likely be a conﬂict, but I have 
               <br />
               pointed out before in this House that when 
               <br />
               he was in opposition, when the Conservative 
               <br />
               administration was in power, there was no 
               <br />
               man in Manitoba who advocated more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ef‘</span> 
               <br />
               fectually or more often, that the lands of 
               <br />
               Manitoba should be handed over to that 
               <br />

               don <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Sitton). Thus, I say, that I think

               the people in that country are entitled to

               Mr. TURRIFF. The hon. member is mis- 
               <br />
               taken in saying that I advocated handing 
               <br />
               over the lands to the provincial government. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vtht</span> I stated on every occasion was that in

               the deal that we should make on provincial

               Bill and this clause—and supporting it 
               <br />
               heartily—is because I consider that we are 
               <br />
               getting a compensation in lieu of lands that 
               <br />
               is better for the province than handing over 
               <br />
               the lands to the province; what we are 
               <br />
               getting is a net revenue paid semi—annually 
               <br />
               in advance, so that we know exactly what 
               <br />
               we get and we get it for all time, and the 
               <br />
               Dominion government will, as has been 
               <br />
               pointed out if they choose to handle these 
               <br />
               lands from a revenue point of view, be able
