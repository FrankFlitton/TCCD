               $40 to $45 per month, while in the province

               Again, taking all the schools throughout the 
               <br />
               Canadian Northwest we ﬁnd that the period 
               <br />
               of the school year gives an everage of six 
               <br />
               months of teaching, a very high average, in- 
               <br />
               deed, and an average «which reﬂects great 
               <br />
               credit upon those who have control of that 
               <br />
               system. Therefore, having applied the tests 
               <br />
               which educationalists are accustomed to 
               <br />
               apply to an educational system, we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               there is no province in the Dominion which 
               <br />
               has a higher standard than the Canadian 
               <br />
               Northwest. What is the secret of this? I 
               <br />
               think the secret may be found in the very 
               <br />
               generous treatment which the provincial leg- 
               <br />
               islature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂords</span> to the schools in the matter 
               <br />
               of grants. In the province of Quebec, I re 
               <br />
               gret to say, out of the entire sum which is 
               <br />
               annually expended for education, only 12 
               <br />
               per cent comes from the government and 88 
               <br />
               per cent is raised by local taxation, whereas 
               <br />
               in the Northwest one—third of the total 
               <br />
               amount expended for education comes from 
               <br />
               the government. We in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appropriate</span> annually for a 
               <br />
               population of 1,600,000 about two and a half 
               <br />
               times as much as the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               legislature has been accustomed to grant for 
               <br />
               a population only one-ﬁfth as large as 
               <br />
               ours. I cannot help digressing to con- 
               <br />
               demn here the niggardly treatment ac- 
               <br />
               corded by the several administrations 
               <br />
               in Quebec in the matter of education. 
               <br />
               There are many other things they could far 
               <br />
               better afford to cut out of their budget and 
               <br />
               they certainly should increase the amount 
               <br />
               given for education in that province.

               But, Sir, what is the immediate effect of 
               <br />
               this generous treatment of the schools on 
               <br />
               the part of the Northwest assembly We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd there is given to every school through~ 
               <br />
               out the Northwest an average of $217 per 
               <br />
               year or about $6 per capita of school 
               <br />
               attendance. Compare that With my native 
               <br />
               province, where I regret <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rto</span> ﬁnd, we 
               <br />
               give only $72 per year per school, or 
               <br />
               an average of $1.42 per capita of 
               <br />
               school attendance. And what is the ad- 
               <br />
               vantage that the government of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories has obtained by means of 
               <br />
               this generosity towards its schools ? It is 
               <br />
               the enormous inﬂuence which the govern- 
               <br />
               ment can exert in forcing every school to 
               <br />
               come up to its regulations. I have been a 
               <br />
               member of the Council of Public Instruction 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec for the past ten 
               <br />
               years; I have again and again, with the 
               <br />
               other members, weighed the question of 
               <br />
               elementary education and wondered how it 
               <br />
               might be possible to improve the standard. 
               <br />
               We have inevitably come up against the 
               <br />
               same difﬁculty, and that is the smallness 
               <br />
               of the amount of money at the dis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Again and again have we endeavoured 
               <br />
               to make schools come up to the regulations 
               <br />
               which we have prescribed, and again and 
               <br />
               again have these schools replied : we do not 
               <br />
               want your paltry grant; we would rather 
               <br />
               forfeit your .grant and be permitted to go 
               <br />
               on as we are, breaking the regulations. That 
               <br />
               cannot exist in the Canadian Northwest 
               <br />
               because no school there can afford to forfeit 
               <br />
               a grant which is equal to 50 per cent of the 
               <br />
               amount which they raise themselves. The 
               <br />
               result is that in the Northwest, every school 
               <br />
               makes a herculean struggle to fulﬁl the

               <br />
               missioner of education in the Northwest, 
               <br />
               if he so desires, can be an absolute dictator 
               <br />
               with reference to every school board in the 
               <br />
               province. If there is a school board which 
               <br />

               <br />

               trustee will collect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxes,</span> pay the teachers,
