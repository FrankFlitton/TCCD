               tain inﬂuences were at work in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec in the last election; there was 
               <br />
               the pledge that there should be separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest, and I have no 
               <br />
               doubt that was worked to the bitter end; 
               <br />
               quietly no doubt ; much quieter than in the 
               <br />
               case of the Remedial Bill in 1896. Be that 
               <br />
               as it may, here is a cabinet disjointed and 
               <br />
               disrupted, paralyzed before the people of 
               <br />
               Canada for the last three weeks, ﬁghting 
               <br />
               within and fears without, and its supporters 
               <br />
               all muzzled except the hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Simcoe (Mr. Leighton McCarthy), 
               <br />
               whom I congratulate on his bravery in 
               <br />
               standing up in deﬁance of the government, 
               <br />
               and the hon. member for South Wellington 
               <br />
               (Mr. Guthrie), who has not been seen since. 
               <br />
               My fear is that if any other gentleman on 
               <br />
               that side were to make a similar statement, 
               <br />
               the same fate might attend him. And what 
               <br />
               is the position of the hon. member (Mr. 
               <br />
               Guthrie) to—day ? Here is the Bill which 
               <br />
               he was to support going to be emasculated, 
               <br />
               nothing to be left of it, and if the hon. gen— 
               <br />
               tleman comes back to the House he will have 
               <br />
               to denounce the government for taking the 
               <br />
               very Vitals out of his pet measure. And 
               <br />
               where is the hon. member for West Assini-

               brought the Prime Minister to the front in

               <br />
               has been depending ever since, and on which 
               <br />
               he must always depend in order to have a

               that is wanting, and that verdict we have
