               Territories for which we are now legislating

               much commented upon—I mean the school

               <br />
               that I thoroughly agree with the position 
               <br />
               that was taken by the government on the 
               <br />
               land question. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Starting</span> from the same 
               <br />
               point of view I have just stated, namely, 
               <br />
               that we must put the stamp of Canadian 
               <br />
               nationality on these Territories. I think it 
               <br />
               was the duty of the federal government 
               <br />
               to retain within their powers the right to 
               <br />
               legislate over the granting of the lands upon 
               <br />
               which one half of the population of Canada 
               <br />
               will be called upon at no distant period to 
               <br />
               live and to prosper. Although I have the 
               <br />
               greatest conﬁdence in the public spirit and 
               <br />
               patriotism of the men who are now at the 
               <br />
               head of public affairs in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories, I say that before long the time 
               <br />
               may come when they will not be powerful 
               <br />
               enough to resist the pressure of the new- 
               <br />
               comers into that country, men that have 
               <br />
               perhaps no interest in the unity of Canada. 
               <br />
               who are not attached to the soil of Canada, 
               <br />
               who have had no part in the past history 
               <br />
               of Canada, and who, therefore, by numeri- 
               <br />
               cal strength, may try to force some ob- 
               <br />
               noxious legislation on the government of 
               <br />
               these Territories. I say, therefore, that for 
               <br />
               the protection of the Northwest, for the pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               head of affairs there, it was good policy on 
               <br />
               the part of the government to retain the 
               <br />
               control and administration of the public 
               <br />
               lands in the Northwest.

               Now, coming to the question that has 
               <br />
               occupied the ﬁeld of discussion for the last 
               <br />
               month, I may say that I intend to discuss it 
               <br />
               from a threefold point of view: from the 
               <br />
               constitutional point of View, from the reli-

               <br />
               point of view. In doing so I shall, as it is 
               <br />
               my custom, express frankly and clearly

               what I believe to be true, and in doing so I

               hope that I shall not offend any man in this

               there is a regrettable feature in all this

               raised. 1 entirely agree with the Prime

               <br />
               come from an exaggeration, or from a per-

               version, of that which constitutes the most 
               <br />

               ment to religious creed and attachment to 
               <br />
               national feeling. The men who are com-

               mitting a crime against this nation are 
               <br />
               those who, having opinions of their own,

               are trying to shelter themselves under a.

               leth of provincial rights. Now, Sir, there 
               <br />
               is no man in this parliament who is more 
               <br />
               attached to provincial rights than I am. I 
               <br />
               am the descendant of a race that has claim-

               <br />
               just because I am a sincere adherent of 
               <br />
