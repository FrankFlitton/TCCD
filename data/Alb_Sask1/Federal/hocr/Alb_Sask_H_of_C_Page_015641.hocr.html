               My hon. friend from St. Antoine made the

               suggestion that if a part of the district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska as large as the district of St. 
               <br />
               Albert was set apart. that would cover 
               <br />
               practically all the population of the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska. In the ﬁrst place, that idea 
               <br />
               has no bearing on the question. The popu- 
               <br />
               lation of the electoral division of St. Albert 
               <br />
               is largely contained in one part of that 
               <br />
               electoral division ; but the population of the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska is not Contained in 
               <br />
               one particular part of it, but is scattered 
               <br />
               along the two great rivers. There are no 
               <br />
               conditions in the district of St. Albert par- 
               <br />
               allel in any degree to those in the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska. Therefore when my "hon.

               friend asks us to make a similar district in 
               <br />
