               <br />
               the 9th of June, 1905. I could follow up 
               <br />
               the ﬁles of that journal and ﬁnd many more 
               <br />

               —' Le Canada ’ for one month had heard its

               leaders admitting that this amendment de- 
               <br />
               prived the Catholics of their rights so far as

               150 out of their 160 schools in the Northwest 
               <br />
               is concerned, but ‘ Le Canada’ still tried to 
               <br />
               create the impression on the people of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec that the English mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House of Commons would not

               <br />
               to the other nine schools. This is what I
