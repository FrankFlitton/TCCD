               )Ir. PERLEY. My right hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister has suggested that we ought 
               <br />
               to try to go into this question with what. he 
               <br />
               calls an open mind. Now, I have endeavour- 
               <br />
               cd, with the ﬁgures given to us by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, to make up my mind as to whether 
               <br />
               the division proposed by the government is 
               <br />
               a fair one or not. This is a very grave and 
               <br />
               important question. We are forming two 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> provinces in the Northwest, which are 
               <br />
               practically the wards of this Dominion, 
               <br />
               and I am sure that my hon. friend the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, if he had two wards of his own, 
               <br />
               would try to clear up everything before he 
               <br />
               launched them on life on their own account. 
               <br />
               He would not leave them in such a position 
               <br />
               that when they came of age they would be 
               <br />
               sure immediately to have trouble before they 
               <br />
               learned to take care of themselves. Our 
               <br />
               object should be to avoid friction—to avoid 
               <br />
               causing to any portion of the people of these 
               <br />
               provinces a feeling of injustice, which they 
               <br />
               may spend their first session, and perhaps 
               <br />
               their ﬁrst years, in trying to rectify. They 
               <br />
               will have their hands full taking care of 
               <br />
               their own family <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁairs,</span> trying to set their 
               <br />
               house in order and get started on the busi— 
               <br />
               ness of life; and they should not have thrust 
               <br />
               upon them any trouble of this kind. I do 
               <br />
               not see that this is a question of Dominion 
               <br />
               politics at all. It seems to me that all we 
               <br />
               ought‘to try to do is to have this ﬁrst elec- 
               <br />
               tion in the province of Alberta conducted in 
               <br />
               as fair and equitable a way as possible, so 
               <br />
               that every man entitled to vote shall have 
               <br />
               just as much to say about forming the new 
               <br />
               government as any other man in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pr0&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               Vince. Surely a quesﬂon of this kind is 
               <br />
               above party politics. Surely we can lay 
               <br />
               aside all feelings of partisanship, and try 
               <br />
               to ensure to every man in the new province 
               <br />
               fair-play. I for one do not think the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of this country would lénd himself 
               <br />
               and the strength of the great Liberal party 
               <br />
               behind him in helping any section of people 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> the new province of Alberta to control 
               <br />
               that province. The question of the location 
               <br />
               of the capital of the province will probably 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> settled by the ﬁrst election: and I do 
               <br />
               not think this government should fond their 
               <br />
               inﬂuence either to help the people of the 
               <br />
               north to establish the capital permanently 
               <br />
