               <br />
               the instance of confederation itself. Every 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadian</span> is well aware that from the time 
               <br />
               the project of uniting together the scattered 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada came within the scope 
               <br />
               ‘of politics there ensued a long period of the 
               <br />
               most anxious consultation and the fullest 
               <br />
               exchange of conﬁdences, not only among the 
               <br />
               provinces as between themselves and their 
               <br />
               public men, but also between the provinces

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ties</span> on the other. I think that no whisper 
               <br />
               of suspicion has ever been heard that any 
               <br />

               ‘ have claimed. 1 think the same may be said 
               <br />
               in regard to the subsequent admission of the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> of Australia. We all know that the various

               their voices were heard in that instance, 
               <br />
               and that no statesman in those states whose 
               <br />
               position entitled him to a voice in the form- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> of that union, was denied a hearing. 
               <br />
               But. Sir, it has remained for this so—called

               the present instance. and to deny consulta-

               <br />
               has been practically no consultation with 
               <br />
               the Territories. Beyond question, neither 
               <br />
               the people of these Territories, nor the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Canada at large, have had the slightest 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity</span> of making their voices heard 
               <br />
               at the polls, where they should have been 
               <br />
