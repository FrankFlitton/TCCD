               Mr. BARR, Suppose the case of a man 
               <br />
               living in one province who had been practi- 
               <br />
               sing over the border before and suppose that 
               <br />
               the other province should make laws compel- 
               <br />
               ling him to pass an examination, &amp;c.. which 
               <br />
               they might do Without recognizing the old 
               <br />
               standing. then it does seem to me there 
               <br />
               might be great hardship.

               rights if it passed such legislation. The same 
               <br />
               thing exists in ‘Ontario and Quebec. There 
               <br />
               are medical men on the border who might

               <br />
               fession at any rate, they are not allowed to 
               <br />
