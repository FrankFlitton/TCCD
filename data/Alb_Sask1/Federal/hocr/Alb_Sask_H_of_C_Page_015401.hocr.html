               Mr. HAGGART. I must have been mis- 
               <br />
               understood, I was arguing entirely on the 
               <br />
               question of the powers to which the pro— 
               <br />
               vinces had a right under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. I stated that this clause was 
               <br />
               an interference with the powers which are 
               <br />
               by intendment given to the provinces, and 
               <br />
               that when you constitute a province it has 
               <br />
               a right to full powers over civil rights and 
               <br />
               property. I said this was a‘limitation of 
               <br />
               that power. I never expected that either 
               <br />
               the Dominion or a province would annul a 
               <br />
               contract without full compensation. These 
               <br />
               provinces know the bargain we made with 
               <br />
               the Hudson Bay Company and we should 
               <br />
               give them the full power to legislate which 
               <br />
               they are entitled to. I do not suppose they 
               <br />
               will do any injustice to the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company any more than to any other indi- 
               <br />
               vidual. If they thought it necessary to 
               <br />
               annul or alter the contract between the 
               <br />
               Dominion government and the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company, I have no doubt they would com— 
               <br />
               pensate the company to the fullest extent. 
               <br />
               That is not the question I was discussing. 
               <br />
               The question is : what right have we to put 
               <br />
               in an Act of parliament granting autonomy 
               <br />
               to provinces limitations of the powers which 
               <br />
               the British North America Act provides 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">”these</span> provinces shall have. I say that 
               <br />
               this clause is a limitation of their power 
               <br />
               over civil rights and property. It may after 
               <br />
               all be no more than a notice, but I believe 
               <br />
               that it is ultra vires of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DominriOn</span> to 
               <br />
               make such a provision, although the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Justice took a different View. He 
               <br />
               said that under the Imperial Act of 1871 
               <br />
               the fullest possible powers were given this 
               <br />
               parliament, in granting autonomy to the 
               <br />
               provinces, to give them any form of con— 
               <br />
               sitution we liked. My argument is that 
               <br />
               your powers to grant autonomy to pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are prescribed by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act and that anything else you 
               <br />
               embody in this Bill is ultra vires. The 
               <br />
               strongest argument advanced by the Minis 
               <br />
               ter of Justice in support of his theory was 
               <br />
               that in the Manitoba Act of 1870 we took 
               <br />
               power to legislate in matters of education, 
               <br />
               and that the law ofﬁcers of the Crown in 
               <br />
               England as quoted by Lord Kimberley held 
               <br />
               that in their opinion the British North Amer- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> ica Act gave the federal authorities suﬁicient 
               <br />
               power to pass the Manitoba Act without

               going to the Imperial parliament for an 
               <br />
               enabling Act. It was the only argument I 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that legislative jurisdiction to the province. 
               <br />
               Is it conceivable that we would be justiﬁed, 
               <br />
               when passing over the jurisdiction in these 
               <br />
               lands in eliminating that condition under 
               <br />
               which we received the power to legislate 
               <br />
               ourselves. That is my point.

               Mr. HAGGART. I say the Dominion
