               Mr. GEORGE H. PERLEY. Before the

               Orders of the Day are called I desire to 
               <br />
               direct the attention of the government to an 
               <br />
               unfortunate incident that occurred in con— 
               <br />

               <br />
               ported in the newspapers of Friday and 
               <br />
               Saturday last. Some 40 Austrian immi- 
               <br />
               grants arrived here fro-m Montreal on Thurs— 
               <br />
               day evening last by train, without money 
               <br />
               and without food. According to the news- 
               <br />
               paper reports, there were no fewer than 40 
               <br />
               poorly clad and weary looking immigrants 
               <br />
               ﬁnding themselves homeless and without 
               <br />
               shelter. There were a few women among 
               <br />
               them, though they were mostly men. They 
               <br />
               found their way to the police station in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">0t«</span> 
               <br />
               tawa, as there was no place for them at 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway station Where 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> could remain, because the railway au— 
               <br />
               thorities do not allow people to loaf about 
               <br />
               their station, and they were directed to the 
               <br />
               police station. They came there on Thurs— 
               <br />
               day evening and asked to be kept over night. 
               <br />
               They reported to the police sergeant that 
               <br />
               they were penniless, they had no place to 
               <br />
               go and they wanted to remain over night. 
               <br />
               Consequently room was made for them at 
               <br />
               the police station. I am given to understand 
               <br />
               that food was procured for them by one of 
               <br />
               the citizens of Ottawa, almost wholly at his 
               <br />
               own expense, who provided meals for them. 
               <br />
               These poor people are reported as saying:

               Ottawa to work on some railway construc- 
               <br />
               tion. Now, I want to call the attention of 
               <br />
               the government to the fact that when these 
               <br />
               people arrived here without any means or 
               <br />
               food, if they had not been able to secure 
               <br />
               work at once they would have been a charge 
               <br />
               on this city for an indeﬁnite period. These 
               <br />
               people were Austrians and they are said to 
               <br />
               have come here of their own volition. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that something ought to be 
               <br />
               done by the immigration ofﬁce to prevent 
               <br />
               this sort of thing occurring, to see 
               <br />
               that people do not come here with- 
               <br />
               out money and with no means of pro- 
               <br />
               curing a- livelihood. If the government are 
               <br />
               going to allow people of that class to come 
               <br />
               here they should provide for them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'at</span> some

               the debate on my behalf at the last sitting 
               <br />
               of the House. I need not repeat what has 
               <br />
               been so frequently stated that the measure 
               <br />
               before the House is a very important one. 
               <br />
               Some features of the Bill have elicited much 
               <br />
               wider discussion than others. The main 
               <br />
               object of the Bill, as I understand, is to give 
               <br />
               autonomy to two new provinces of this Do- 
               <br />
               minion. That is a very important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> 
               <br />
               to the people dwelling in the new province‘s, 
               <br />
               Connected with that Bill as a part of the 
               <br />
               autonomy proposed to be given them, there 
               <br />
               are certain clauses which have elicited more 
               <br />
               than usual criticism and which will no doubt 
               <br />
               cause a great deal more discussion in the 
               <br />
               future. I refer to the clause relating to 
               <br />
               separate schools. I need not say that I for 
               <br />
               one regret that it was found necessary by 
               <br />
               the leader of the government to interject 
               <br />
               that question into the political arena. The 
               <br />
               discussion on these Bills has largely cen- 
               <br />
               tered around the school clauses of this Bill. 
               <br />
               Sir, that opens up a very wide ﬁeld for dis—
