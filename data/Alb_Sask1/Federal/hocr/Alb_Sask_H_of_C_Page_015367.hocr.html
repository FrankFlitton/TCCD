               In my judgment, section 93 would bring in all

               That is what he aimed at. He tried

               and privileges. Then We are told that the

               separate schools given by clause 11 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 have been whittled down by the 
               <br />
               ordinances to such an extent that they are 
               <br />
               not the same thing at all as was provided in 
               <br />
               that Act. But the Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> Justice says 
               <br />
               his intention was to give the rights and 
               <br />
               privileges contained in clause 11 of that 
               <br />
               Act. It is because the people are misled 
               <br />
               by this and because something is being 
               <br />
               foisted on them that they do not know, that 
               <br />
               we asked the Minister of Justice to explain 
               <br />
               io-night that educational clause. He has

               told us that he intends to deal with it on

               Mr. SPROULE—in view of that fact, I 
               <br />
               want the Minister of Justice to explain 
               <br />

               mean with this clause in it. And after that 
               <br />
               explanation, let time be given so that, 
               <br />
               through the press, it may be communicated 
               <br />
               to the country and let the country speak 
               <br />
               with regard to that explanation. Then, I

               <br />
               do that ? But it will not do for the hon.

               gentleman to explain this clause on Monday

               afternoon and attempt to force it through 
               <br />
               at that sitting. It would almost seem that 
               <br />
               that is his desire, so reluctant is he to give 
               <br />
               this information to the country. Why did 
               <br />
               he not give it on the second reading of the 
               <br />
               Bill? Or, not having done that, why does 
               <br />
               he not give it at the earliest possible mo- 
               <br />
               ment ‘2 If the country was being mis- 
               <br />
               led should he not have afforded it light as

               soon as possible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘2</span> I say that was his duty,

               and, not having done it, he failed in his

               duty. Laymen cannot understand the Bill. 
               <br />
               Why, even the lawyers of‘ the House do not 
               <br />
               agree as to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interpretation</span> of it; is it 
               <br />
               strange, then, that laymen cannot under-
