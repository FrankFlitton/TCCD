               there was a portion of territory north of

               Mr. GUTHRIE. When this Bill was last 
               <br />
               in committee, the question was on an 
               <br />
               amendment proposed by the hon. member 
               <br />
               for St. John and Iberville (Mr. L. P. De- 
               <br />
               mers), to the eifect that the word ‘ incorpor- 
               <br />
               ated’ should be inserted in subsection A 
               <br />
               of subsection 1 of the Act. That motion 
               <br />
               was not disposed of at the time the com- 
               <br />
               mittee rose and asked leave to sit again. 
               <br />
               I would like to draw attention to that clause 
               <br />
               of the Bill before it is passed over, or 
               <br />
               before any other clause is taken up. Now 
               <br />
               objection was taken seriously by many 
               <br />
               members that a labour union or association 
               <br />
               acquiring rights under this Bill to register- 
               <br />
               trade marks or designs of their own, were 
               <br />
               not amenable to the common law, or to the 
               <br />
