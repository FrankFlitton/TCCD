               The right hon. leader of the government 
               <br />
               has seen ﬁt to doubt the ﬁgures that I have

               given in regard to where the population is 
               <br />
               in that country. No explanation has been 
               <br />
               given why the plan adopted by the legis- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of township 38 and 6 to the north has been 
               <br />
               practically turned upside down. Any per- 
               <br />
               son can observe that by simply looking at 
               <br />
               the map. That is beyond contradiction. The 
               <br />
               same equally applies to the representation 
               <br />
               which was given in this House three years 
               <br />

               <br />

               cism can be made of the argument. that, 
               <br />
               having regard to the contention which was 
               <br />
               made then, this proposed schedule discrim—

               <br />
               as to railway construction when I say that 
               <br />
               only 150 miles have been built north of 38 
               <br />
               and that 999 miles have been built south of 
               <br />
               38, which is some indication as to where the 
               <br />
               permanent settlement is and will be. I can

               Figures have been handed to me showing

               that the population, less Indians, might be 
               <br />
               assumed to be 165,000. -I do not pretend 
               <br />
               that the following ﬁgures are direct evidence 
               <br />
               of the location of settlement, but I do say 
               <br />
               that they corroborate the ﬁgures that I gave

               <br />
               165,000, and wonk it out on the homestead

               entries for the last three years it would

               <br />
               south. Based on the customs receipts 
               <br />
               from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18%</span> to 1904, the population would be 
               <br />
               52,000 north and 113,000 south. Based on 
               <br />

               <br />
               south. Based on the Inland Revenue re- 
               <br />
               ceipts from 1903 to 1904 the population 
               <br />
               would be 40,000 north and 125,000 south.

               Based on the land, timber, and registration 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
