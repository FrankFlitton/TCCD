               The effect is that so far as Ontario and Quebec

               The right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) took an entirely different view of 
               <br />
               the position in 1896 from that which he 
               <br />
               takes now. He was riding up and down 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario and Manitoba, in 
               <br />
               company with the late Dalton McCarthy 
               <br />
               and other distinguished gentlemen who were 
               <br />
               members of the Conservative party at that 
               <br />
               time, some of them very prominent Orange— 
               <br />
               men, though Orangemen are now so abused 
               <br />
               by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon-gentlemen</span> opposite. One was the late 
               <br />
               Mr. N. Clarke Wallace. I think we might 
               <br />
               safely say that the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               while in Manitoba and Ontario was riding 
               <br />
               the Protestant horse. I do not know whe— 
               <br />
               ther it was the proverbial White horse or 
               <br />
               not, but it was evidently the Protestant 
               <br />
               horse. And in Quebec he was saying to 
               <br />
               the people: Trust Laurier; he is one of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your</span> own race and religion. And the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) was sign- 
               <br />
               ing letters to the bishops telling what he 
               <br />
               would do in connection with the remedial 
               <br />
               legislation. So, it was one game in Quebec 
               <br />
               and another game in Ontario, and by this 
               <br />
               means the right hon. gentleman won power. 
               <br />
               We were told in Ontario that it was a ﬁght 
               <br />
               between the hon. gentleman and the clergy

               of Quebec. Yet, hon. gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               now say that we are intolerant and that 
               <br />
               we speak disrespectfully of the clergy. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> 
               <br />
               I say there has never been a word of that 
               <br />
               kind on this side of the House. These ex— 
               <br />
               pressions came from the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man’s party in 1896, when they said that 
               <br />
               the priests and bishops of Quebec were go- 
               <br />
               ing to excommunicate the members of the 
               <br />
               Church who did not support Tupper. In 
               <br />
               that way he appealed to the ultra Protest- 
               <br />
               ant electors and thereby had many mem-

               bers of his party elected. Though the cry 
               <br />
               of hon. gentlemen opposite in 1896 was:
