               Mr. h‘lIELDING. That is the motion 
               <br />
               which has been placed in your hands. The 
               <br />
               motion is that this Bill be read a second 
               <br />
               time. My hon. friend moves to strike out 
               <br />
               all the words after ‘that,’ and express a 
               <br />
               pious opinion on one portion of the Bill. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that after you have struck 
               <br />
               out all the words of the motion that the Bill 
               <br />
               be now read a second time, there is no Bill 
               <br />
               left. It is certainly not the usual method 
               <br />
               whereby anybody moves an amendment. 
               <br />
               If an hon. member regards the main pur— 
               <br />
               pose of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bub—whatever</span> he may be pleased 
               <br />
               to consider its main purpose—with favour 
               <br />
               and disapproves of some minor part of it, 
               <br />
               his obvious duty is to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supportthe</span> second 
               <br />
               reading of that Bill, and when in committee 
               <br />
               we reach the clause to which he objects. 
               <br />
               then is the proper moment to move that that 
               <br />
               clause be struck out and something else be 
               <br />
               substituted. 1 think'the method of my hon.

               friend is a mistaken one; however, I do 
               <br />
               not attach much importance to that, and 
               <br />
               I prefer to proceed with the discussion.

               I need hardly say. Sir, that I do not rise 
               <br />
               for the purpose of following my hon. friend 
               <br />
               in the very lengthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument,</span> he has ad- 
               <br />
               dressed to this House on what he is pleased 
               <br />
               to regard as the constitutional questions in- 
               <br />
               volved in the consideration of this measure. 
               <br />
               it I felt, as he appears to feel, that the con- 
               <br />
               stitutional questions involved are the over- 
               <br />
               shadowing questions, I need hardly say that 
               <br />
               I would not presume to address the House 
               <br />
               at this moment, but I would leave the ques- 
               <br />
               tion to be dealt with by hon. members of 
               <br />
               the legal profession, who are supposed to 
               <br />
               understand such matters better than those 
               <br />
               of us who are laymen. But it is because I 
               <br />
               do not agree with my hon. friend that the 
               <br />
               constitutional question is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overshadow</span> 
               <br />
               ing question that I venture to discuss the 
               <br />
               matter at the present stage. I do not be- 
               <br />
               lieve that the people of Canada will consent 
               <br />
               that any one of 11s shall shelter himself be-

               hind the fence of an alleged constitutional 
               <br />
               question. This school question is a vexed 
               <br />
               question. a troublesome question. We can 
               <br />
               all say with the fullest sincerity that it is 
               <br />
               n misfortune that we have to deal with it. 
               <br />
               But once we have it here. my belief is that 
               <br />
               our constituents, the people of Canada. will 
               <br />
               expect us not to evade it. but to meet it 
               <br />
               fairly. boldly. to discuss it openly, discuss 
               <br />
               it in a generous spirit. and endeavour to 
               <br />
               ﬁnd some solution of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> problem. 
               <br />
               I do not agree with my hon. friend that we 
               <br />
               are not called upon to discuss the question 
               <br />
               of separate schools or common schools. I 
               <br />
               believe that the people of the Dominion to-
