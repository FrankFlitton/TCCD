               rights are concerned, I have already ex-

               pressed the opinion that the sections which 
               <br />
               have been adopted probably do not go 
               <br />
               further than to give the provinces notice. of 
               <br />
               the agreements into which we have entered. 
               <br />
               and as to which they are bound just as much 
               <br />
               as we are. I repeat that there is nothing 
               <br />
               in these agreements which takes away the 
               <br />
               legislative jurisdiction of this parliament. 
               <br />
               It would be a monstrous thing for us to 
               <br />
               legislate them out of existence, but we 
               <br />
               would have the legislative power to do so, 
               <br />
               and when we impose what are supposed to

               spect. in my opinion we are doing nothing 
               <br />
               more than giving them notice that these 
               <br />
               bargains have been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made:</span> and that the

               <br />
               these matters except consistently with these

               contracts into which the Crown has so 
               <br />
               entered. Technically the bargain is between 
               <br />
               the Crown and these companies. but the 
               <br />
               Crown expects that the legislature will ob- 
               <br />
               serve the contract.

               my faith in that saying has been increased
