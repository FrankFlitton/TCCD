               Prince Albert can be cut out. There are a

               few facts to which I will call attention in

               the redistribution of 1902, which my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. Lake) says was fair and just, 
               <br />
               Prince Albert had two seats, East and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Vest</span> 
               <br />
               Prince Albert, and the Haultain administra- 
               <br />
               tion in 1902 cut out one of these seats, put- 
               <br />
               ting a large portion of it into Prince Albert 
               <br />
               West forming one seat, and putting the 
               <br />
               polling divisions down the Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               river into Kinistino. To my mind and 
               <br />
               to the mind of the Prince Albert 
               <br />
               people that was most unjust. It was 
               <br />
               stated in the district, it was stated in 
               <br />
               the legislature that it was an unjust gerry- 
               <br />
               mander, and the votes cast at the next elec- 
               <br />
               tion proved that to be the case. The Haul- 
               <br />
               tain government took away one seat from 
               <br />
               Prince Albert and formed a new seat of 
               <br />
               Saskatbon. Prince Albert at the next elec- 
               <br />
               tion had a vote of 771 while Saskatoon had 
               <br />
               a vote of only 376. Between Prince Albert 
               <br />
               and Kinistino was divided the extra terri- 
               <br />
               tory which up to that time had been in 
               <br />
               Prince Albert. Up to that time there had 
               <br />
               'been three seats, but by the 1902 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">redistri-</span> 
               <br />
               bution they only were given two. These 
               <br />
               two seats provided a vote of 1,453 at the 
               <br />
               next election whereas the three other seats 
               <br />
               in Saskatchewan in which elections were held 
               <br />
               gave only 1,065 votes, so that the Haultain 
               <br />
               administration divided 1,065 votes into three 
               <br />
               seats, whereas they only divided 1,453 votes 
               <br />
               into two seats, taking one seat away from 
               <br />
               Prince Albert. Yet my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lake) says that was a fair redistribution. 
               <br />
               It was stated over and over again on the 
               <br />
               platform and elsewhere that the reason for 
               <br />
               cutting off one seat from Prince Albert was 
               <br />
               because Prince Albert East and Prince A1- 
               <br />
               bert West returned two strong opponents of 
               <br />
               the Haultain government, while Saskatoon 
               <br />
               was supposed to be friendly, and at the 
               <br />
               next election Saskatoon returned a govern- 
               <br />
               ment supporter, while in the two seats that 
               <br />
               had been fused into one in Prince Albert the 
               <br />
               government nominee lost his deposit. Now, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to take up the 
               <br />
               time of the committee further. It seems to me 
               <br />
               that if we look at this question on fair and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vbroad</span> «principles, if we take the 10 south- 
               <br />
               ern and the 10 northern seats as laid out by 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain—an-d in which distribution my 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. Lake) had a part—and if 
               <br />
               we take the homestead entries in each of 
               <br />
               these 10 seats since 1901 We are forced to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that a fair distribution of the 
               <br />
               extra ﬁve seats we have to add to Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan, would be'3 to the north and 2 to the 
               <br />
               south. In my opinion if we were to con- 
               <br />
               sider the prospective increase, it should 
               <br />
               be 4 in the north and 1 in the south, but 
               <br />
               certainly not less than 3 in the north and 2 
               <br />
               in the south. I believe that before the next 
               <br />
               local election, if the term of the legislature 
               <br />
               runs four years, there will be a vastly

               to prove what a terrible gerrymander was

               <br />
               one who suggested the idea of gerrymander 
               <br />
               at all, and he did it, not in a very determined 
               <br />
               manner. He was a member of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion at the time and if the rest of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the opposition had any idea that 
               <br />
               there was a gerrymander, the Bill would not 
               <br />
               have gone through as it did in the course of 
               <br />
               a few minutes, accepted practically by the 
               <br />
               Whole House without discussion. In the 
               <br />
               distribution, as the Regina ‘Leader’ said, 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan is taken as a basis and one 
               <br />
               member was given for every 4,279 of the 
               <br />
               population according to the census of the 
               <br />
               previous year. In Assiniboia one member 
               <br />
               was given for every 4,492 of the population. 
               <br />
               and in Alberta one member for every 4,700 
               <br />
               of the population. It was as even a distri- 
               <br />
               bution as it was possible to make. If there 
               <br />
               had been only the same differences in the 
               <br />
               present Bill we should not have had much 
               <br />
               to say against it.
