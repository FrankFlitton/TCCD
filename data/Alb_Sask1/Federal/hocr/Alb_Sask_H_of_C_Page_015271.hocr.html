               <br />
               the last twenty years : and while no doubt.

               tleman pardon me ‘2 I did not mean to run

               the line due north. I meant to run it to the

               Saskatchewan river and westward along that 
               <br />

               I have pointed out. But as it is, it appears

               not legislating for the new provinces just 
               <br />
               as they are to-day. Wherever you drew the

               however, that they are serious.
