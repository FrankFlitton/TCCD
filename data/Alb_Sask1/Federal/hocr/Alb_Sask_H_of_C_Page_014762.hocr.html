               11 of the Act of 1875 which created separate

               schools, either Protestant or Roman Catho-

               upon the statute books of Canada for up- 
               <br />
               wards of thirty years. It has been unre-

               pealed, unaltered and unamended in any 
               <br />

               <br />
               in 1886 and in 1898, in those various years 
               <br />
               there never was a single objection made by 
               <br />
               any member of this House to clause 11 of 
               <br />
               that Act. Other changes were made 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories Act with 
               <br />
               the view of giving more 'extended pow-

               ers to the Territories, but at no time 
               <br />
               was there any attempt made by any

               member of this House to repeal or 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1894,</span> as I ﬁnd by the records, the late Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy introduced a resolution 
               <br />
               into this House to repeal section 11 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875. The reason he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> for that 
               <br />
               course—and he was supported, I believe, by 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) 
               <br />
               —was that with that law on the statute- 
               <br />
               book of Canada, when provinces came to be 
               <br />
               formed out of the Northwest Teritories, sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools would become a part of their 
               <br />
               constitution. The parliament of Canada 
               <br />
               did not see ﬁt, however, to accede to his 
               <br />
               views. In fact, the vast majority of the 
               <br />
               members of this House, Liberal and Conser- 
               <br />
               vative alike. voted against the late Dalton 
               <br />
               McCarthy‘s resolution, showing that at that 
               <br />
               time they respected the opinion of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of this House who had passed the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875, and that it was their intention that 
               <br />
               the system of separate schools, no matter 
               <br />
               what form it might ultimately take, should 
               <br />
               remain :1 part of the constitution of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories when they would be 
               <br />
               created into provinces. We ﬁnd that the 
               <br />
               legislative assembly of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories have passed certain laws in the 
               <br />
               form of ordinances in relation to education. 
               <br />
               Many persons thought at the time they 
               <br />
               passed those ordinances that they were 
               <br />
               going much beyond the constitutional 
               <br />
               powers which they had under the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories Act of 1875, because 
               <br />
               in that instance the Northwest assem- 
               <br />
               bly did impair the rights which the 
               <br />
               minority supposed they had. The Northwest 
               <br />
               assembly deﬁned. accurately and in no un-

               <br />
               minority were to be in respect to separate 
               <br />
               schools. So drastic were the changes in-

               troduced by the Northwest ordinances in 
               <br />

               Now, it becomes important for us to con-

               <br />
               different parts of Canada on this subject. I 
               <br />
               would not go to the trouble of reading the

               <br />
               to appreciate the changes made by them. I

               contend that no person can read those or-
