               of education. That is a fact that may well

               be pointed to. Why is it so '3 It is because 
               <br />
               education was not given exclusively either

               is wrong to say as many hon. members have

               said, that education is exclusively within

               <br />
               no Act but one based on the resolutions adop- 
               <br />
