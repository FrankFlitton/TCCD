               A great deal of time has been spent 
               <br />
               to-night in discussing the relative rapid- 
               <br />
               ity with which the north and the south 
               <br />
               are ﬁlling. and the homestead entries are 
               <br />
               taken as affording the best basis of compar- 
               <br />
               ison. It is not advisable to take the home- 
               <br />
               stead entries of the last 20 years. We have 
               <br />
               a better test of population in the various 
               <br />
               distributions, so it is only necessary to take 
               <br />
               the homestead entries for the last two years 
               <br />
               - or parts thereof. It is easy to make this 
               <br />
               calculation because the present district of 
               <br />
               Alberta is almost entirely covered by the 
               <br />
               Lethbridge, Calgary. Red Deer and Ed— 
               <br />
               monton agencies. A very small portion of 
               <br />
               Battleford is west of the fourth, but on the 
               <br />
               other hand a considerable portion of Medicine 
               <br />
               Hat as we know is also west of principal 
               <br />
               meridian 4. It is very easy therefore. for us 
               <br />
               to calculate the returns of the Calgary and 
               <br />
               Lethbridge ofﬁces which are found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south</span> of 
               <br />
               township 34, and compare them with the re- 
               <br />
               turns of the Red Deer office which are north 
               <br />
               of 34. We ﬁnd that in 1903—4 for the south- 
               <br />
               ern part, Lethbridge and Calgary, there were 
               <br />
               4.386 homestead entries; in the northern part 
               <br />
               3.815, a total of 8.201. of which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">53%</span> per cent 
               <br />
               lie in the south and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">46:}</span> per cent in the, 
               <br />
               north. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1903-4.</span> as judged by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">home»</span> 
               <br />
               stead entries, the south increased much more 
               <br />
               rapidly than the north. The minister spoke 
               <br />
               of the homestead entnies being brought 
               <br />
               down to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">31515</span> of March, 1905. We will 
               <br />
               bring them to this date. That adds nine 
               <br />
               months to the previous calculation. That gives 
               <br />

               There is another test I would like to 
               <br />
               apply. That is the test of the local North-

               <br />
               that time at least. We do not know that
