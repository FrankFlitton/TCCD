               When this redistribution was taking place 
               <br />
               a year ago, did the Minister of the Interior

               make any demand for representation for

               <br />

               if they were not then entitled to represent-

               to the House for giving them representation

               the best position to know where the divid- 
               <br />
               ing line should be, because it runs through 
               <br />
               his own constituency, and he says he is re- 
               <br />
               presenting the views of his constituents.

               after he got it the First Minister rose in
