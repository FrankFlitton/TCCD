               separate schools in the Northwest Territories.

               It is stated therein that we are indebted to 
               <br />
               Conservative senators for the clause which pro-

               <br />

               In the ﬁrst place, Mr. Christie, as Speaker 
               <br />
               of the Senate. has no right to express an opin- 
               <br />
               ion except by means of his casting vote in 
               <br />
               case of an equal division; then Mr. Letellier, 
               <br />
               being one of the ministers, could not reject in 
               <br />
               the Senate a principle endorsed by the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment and set forth in a Government Bill. 
               <br />
               Besides, Mr. Letellier took exactly the oppo~

               The ‘ Minerve' winds up by a. most laughable
