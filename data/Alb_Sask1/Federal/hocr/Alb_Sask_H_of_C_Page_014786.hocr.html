               <br />
               Provincial rights we give to the provinces, 
               <br />
               with a reserve—a reserve for the purpose of 
               <br />
               safeguarding the rights of minorities. In the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, at confederation, the 
               <br />
               Protestant minority was a pretty strong 
               <br />
               minority. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Ve</span> held a much stronger posi- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> numerically than we do to-day. It 
               <br />
               was important for us then to be given a cer- 
               <br />
               tain protection, certain safeguards, certain 
               <br />
               guarantees for the continuance of our rights. 
               <br />
               As we are becoming weaker numerically 
               <br />
               in that province, the guarantee and safe- 
               <br />
               guard thus accorded to us becomes more 
               <br />
               and more important; and if, to-day in 
               <br />
               these new provinces the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               is weak numerically, and weak perhaps in 
               <br />
               other ways, it is all the more important 
               <br />
               that they should be given a guarantee of 
               <br />
               those rights and privileges which they guard 
               <br />
               so jealously and value so highly. The 
               <br />
               weaker the minority is, the more import- 
               <br />
               ant it is that a guarantee should be given 
               <br />
               to it.

               tory of Toryism through generations and 
               <br />

               vancing the view of the stronger controlling

               cracy; it was the old principle of the

               divine right of kings, when the common

               round the king and held up his hands. A

               control over the rights of the many. We

               Since then we have gone a little further.

               say demands that in Canada there shall be

               consideration for their cherished principles

               at this. We Liberals believe that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">major“</span>

               ity should rule; but We believe that the

               majority should rule with full considera-

               tion for the rights, the feelings and the 
               <br />
               privileges of the minority. That is the 
               <br />
               essential <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerence</span> between the principles

               of Tories and the principles of Liberals. 
               <br />
               Their principle entails a caSte to rule by 
               <br />
               force over the weaker. Our principle is 
               <br />
               to so rule through the majority that the 
               <br />
               minority may be contented, happy, and in 
               <br />
               sympathy with the majority—not in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">antag‘</span>
