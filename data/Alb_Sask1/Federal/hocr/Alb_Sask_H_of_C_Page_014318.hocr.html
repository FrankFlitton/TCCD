               I desire merely to say a few words. The

               other day a statement was made by the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Beauharnois (Mr. Berger-on) to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">client</span> that the city of Ottawa had vio- 
               <br />
               lated its contract with the Ottawa Electric 
               <br />
               Company. In making this statement. I pre- 
               <br />
               sume the hon. gentleman had in his mind 
               <br />
               the resolution passed by the city council of 
               <br />
               Ottawa some years ago. A motion was 
               <br />
               then presented in the council asking that a 
               <br />
               monopoly be given the Ottawa Electric 
               <br />
               Company, and that motion was carried. 
               <br />
               But, of course, in orderto become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eifective,</span> 
               <br />
               it was necessary that it should be put in 
               <br />
               the form of an agreement and that a by- 
               <br />
               law should be adopted by the council rati- 
               <br />
               fying that agreement. This was never done. 
               <br />
               There was considerable feeling at the time, 
               <br />
               and no sooner was the motion carried than 
               <br />
               a notice of reconsideration was given. The 
               <br />
               following day it was pointed out by the 
               <br />
               city solicitor that it would be a violation of 
               <br />
               the common law to carry through any ar- 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               rangement of that kind. or course, the 
               <br />
               mere adopting of the motion by the council 
               <br />
               could have no more effect than the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               reading of a Bill by this House. There was 
               <br />
               simply a resolution passed by the council, 
               <br />
               but that resolution was never put into the 
               <br />
               form of an agreement, and it was pointed 
               <br />
               out by the city solicitor that no corpora- 
               <br />
               tion could have any power to enter into any 
               <br />
               such agreement. No contract having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been«</span> 
               <br />
               made, it is not correct to say that the city 
               <br />
               has violated any agreement it has with the 
               <br />
               company. I think it is only due to the 
               <br />
               city that I should make this correction of 
               <br />
               the statement of my hon. friend, who, I 
               <br />
               am sure, would not willingly do any in- 
               <br />
               justice to the Ottawa city council. Another 
               <br />
               statement to which I wish to draw attention 
               <br />
               is that made by the Minister of Justice to 
               <br />
               the effect that the city of Ottawa was en- 
               <br />
               deavouring to trespass on the rights of the 
               <br />
               Ottawa Electric Company. I wish to give 
               <br />
               that statement a positive contradiction. 
               <br />
               The city council of Ottawa are not en— 
               <br />
               deavouring to trespass on any vested rights. 
               <br />
               It is the Ottawa Electric Company which 
               <br />
               is asking for this legislation, and the city 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">council</span> are simply asking to be guarded 
               <br />
               against any injustice. The feeling in this 
               <br />
               city is very strong against the passage of 
               <br />
               this Bill. We consider it to be an invasion 
               <br />
               of our municipal rights. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron)‘ evidently 
               <br />
               misunderstood another statement which I 
               <br />
               made. I was pointing out that members of 
               <br />
               this House, who are not residents of the 
               <br />
               city of Ottawa. cannot have the same in- 
               <br />
               terest in this matter as the city representa- 
               <br />
               tives. We do not dispute the right of any 
               <br />
               member to make up his mind as to how 
               <br />
               he will vote on the Bill, but it is only fair 
               <br />
               that the members from outside the city 
               <br />
               should pause and consider the effect which 
               <br />
               this Bill will have on the rights of the muni— 
               <br />
               cipality. I have nothing more to say on this 
               <br />
               question. The arguments are before the 
               <br />
               House. The people of this city consider that 
               <br />
               it would be an injustice to them to pass 
               <br />
               this Bill, and I appeal to members on both 
               <br />
               sides to vote against it.

               Mr. W. F. MACLEAN (South York). I

               the more it becomes evident that it is a 
               <br />
               raid on the revenues of the people of Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa, and that this parliament ought to 
               <br />
               refuse to pass it. This parliament has no 
               <br />
               reason to occupy itself with the domestic 
               <br />
               affairs of the city of Ottawa, especially in 
               <br />
               a matter so extremely local. The question 
               <br />
               never should have come to this House. and 
               <br />
               the Bill is evidently an invasion of the 
               <br />
               municipal rights of the province of Ou- 
               <br />
               tario. The matter should really be dealt 
               <br />
               with in the Ontario legislature. In Toronto 
               <br />
               this Bill is regarded as an invasion of muni- 
               <br />
               cipal rights. We have had produced here 
               <br />
               the testimony of the two members represent-
