               Bills that had been introduced, I at once 
               <br />
               came to the conclusion that 1 could not de-

               <br />
               oﬂfice and the emoluments of oﬂice. I came 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that, whatever anybody 
               <br />
               else might do, my course was perfectly 
               <br />
               clear: I should, when this question came up, 
               <br />
               be in a position to speak with a freedom with 
               <br />
               which a member of the government could 
               <br />
               not speak, and I should be called upon to 
               <br />
               decide to what extent and how far I would 
               <br />
               be prepared to compromise opinions which 
               <br />
               I had publicly expressed, and opinions which 
               <br />
               I still hold in order not to destroy the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the country. That question 
               <br />
               which comes to every man in public life 
               <br />
               sooner or later, comes to-day to a good many 
               <br />
               men in this House of Commons. The ques- 
               <br />
               tion is how far a man is justiﬁed in com- 
               <br />
               promising his opinion for the purpose of 
               <br />
               preventing a political crisis. That is a 
               <br />
               question which nearly every man in this 
               <br />
               House has had to decide before; but per- 
               <br />
               haps no person has had to decide it under 
               <br />
               quite as remarkable circumstances as the 
               <br />
               present. For myself, as to the political 
               <br />
               effect upon myself, I care not for that. I 
               <br />

               Mr. W. B. NORTHRUP (East Hastings). 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that 
               <br />
               when the mountain would not go to Maho- 
               <br />
               met, Mahomet went to the mountain, and 
               <br />
               that saying has been illustrated, I will not

               say in a very pleasing way, this afternooon. 
               <br />
               I was very much puzzled, while my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. Sifton) was speaking, to know 
               <br />
               just what line I should be compelled to take 
               <br />
               in what appeared to be a triangular due]. 
               <br />
               I was afraid to appear even to assent to the 
               <br />
               opinions of my hon. friend, lest I too might 
               <br />
               be treated with the same contemptuous in— 
               <br />
               difference that the government according to 
               <br />
               his own account. had given to him; and 
               <br />
               i was afraid to appear to differ from him, 
               <br />
               for I did not know how long it would be 
               <br />
               before I would ﬁnd that he and I were in
