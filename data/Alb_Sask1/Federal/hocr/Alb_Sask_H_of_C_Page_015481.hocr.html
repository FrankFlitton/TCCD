               venture to submit that they cannot have 
               <br />

               have just quoted: ‘The Lieutenant Gov- 
               <br />

               if you take the view of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, you absolutely take out of the 
               <br />
               hands of the council the legislative power 
               <br />
               with regard to the character of the schools, 
               <br />
               and you would have absolute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfgovern-</span>

               ment, in respect of the character, the re-

               gulation. the superintendence and the con- 
               <br />

               <br />
               jority in each district. That, I submit, is 
               <br />
               not the meaning of the words ‘may estab- 
               <br />
               lish such schools therein as they see ﬁt.’ 
               <br />
               Those words are always subject to the con- 
               <br />
               trolling power of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               Legislature with regard to education. To 
               <br />
               give them any other meaning would ab- 
               <br />

               does not contend that that is absolutely the 
               <br />

               that Act in any way. I understand now

               what i did not understand before. I un- 
               <br />
               derstand what my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice meant by saying that the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 was interpreted by an earlier ordi- 
               <br />
               nance. Let us understand the situation. 
               <br />
               Under the Act of 1875, you might establish 
               <br />
               a dual system of schools, if you saw ﬁt. 
               <br />
               but you were not obliged to do so. That 
               <br />
               is the distinction. There was the power 
               <br />
               but no obligation. The Act of 1875 did not 
               <br />
               mean that the majority of ratepayers of the 
               <br />
               Northwest in any particular district could 
               <br />
               make those ordinances with regard to edu- 
               <br />
               cation, the power to make which had al- 
               <br />
               ready been conferred on the Lieutenant 
               <br />
               Governor. acting by and with the advice 
               <br />
               of the council or assembly. Yet the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> 
               <br />
               reverse is the construction to which we 
               <br />
               would be driven by the argument of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend this afternoon. ‘May establish 
               <br />
               such schools therein as they may think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁt}</span> 
               <br />
               But those schools must be established sub- 
               <br />
               ject to the controlling power of the council 
               <br />
               or assembly. Therefore it does not seem 
               <br />
               to me that-this new and very ingenious 
               <br />
               point, suggested for the first time to-day 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice, is consistent 
               <br />
               with a reasonable interpretation of the 
               <br />
               statute. The Lieutenant Governor in 
               <br />
               Council makes ordinances regarding <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">educav</span> 
               <br />
               tion, and he must give power to the ma- 
               <br />
               jority to establish such schools as they 
               <br />
               think ﬁt, but not schools of such character 
               <br />
               as they think ﬁt or subject to such regul- 
               <br />
               ations as they think ﬁt. or subject to such 
               <br />
               superintendence or control or inspection as 
               <br />
               they think ﬁt. because with regard to all 
               <br />
               these matters the power has been conferred, 
               <br />
               not upon the majority in each district, but 
               <br />
               upon the Lieutenant Governor, by and with

               <br />
               Thompson, the Act of 1875 declared that 
               <br />
               the majority of ratepayers in any district 
               <br />
               or portion of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               might establish separate schools; but by 
               <br />
               the ordinance. which he thought to be be-

               <br />
               power was restricted to those districts 
               <br />
               which had been organized as public school 
               <br />
               districts, and he thought that in that res— 
               <br />
               pect there had been an attempted abridg-

               <br />

               his language.
