               how his section would work in conjunction

               with section 17. I understood the minister

               on that point. It is a matter of some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im-i</span> 
               <br />

               the committee should carefully consider the 
               <br />
               effect of this legislation. As the minister

               <br />
               pledge themselves to the accuracy of it as

               <br />
               the secrecy of the statistics collected. And 
               <br />
               under section 31, it is provided that these

               <br />
               I call the minister’s attention again to the

               position we are taking in connection with 
               <br />

               <br />
               will conflict with the duties as deﬁned by

               fully makes any false declaration touching 
               <br />
               any such matter,’ is guilty of an indictable 
               <br />
               offence. Of course, if he makes a return 
               <br />
               saying that it is information he has collect~ 
               <br />
               ed in his capacity as an otiicer of the local 
               <br />
               authority, and wilfully falsiﬁes that return, 
               <br />
               I think he should be held guilty of an in- 
               <br />
               dictable ollTencc. But if he transmits the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span> he collects. he would carry out 
               <br />
               thr- i’ull spirit of the law.

               Mr. LENNOX. I do not wish to put

               more ditiiculties in the way of the Bill than 
               <br />
               necessarily meet it. Of course, if one makes 
               <br />
               a false declaration, he is not much to be 
               <br />

               <br />
               is another feature. Section 31 says "who
