               Mr. R. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.S.</span> LAKE (Qu’Appelle). I propose 
               <br />
               to move an amendment which. if adopted, 
               <br />
               would have the eifect of granting to the 
               <br />
               new provinces the lands. mines. minerals 
               <br />
               within their boundaries. To give to the 
               <br />
               new provinces those rights and powers in 
               <br />
               regard to the public domain as are declared 
               <br />
               by the British North America Act to come 
               <br />
               within the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
               <br />
               provinces of the Dominion. I have already 
               <br />
               spoken at considerable length in advocacy 
               <br />
               of this principle, ﬁrst on the second read- 
               <br />
               ing of the Bill and subsequently on more 
               <br />
               than one occasion when the Bill was in 
               <br />
               committee. 1 have nothing to add to the 
               <br />
               arguments which I then used. They are be— 
               <br />
               fore the House and it is not necessary that 
               <br />
               I should repeat them. I believe that if the 
               <br />
               House refuses to accept this amendment 
               <br />
               and passes the Bill in its present form it 
               <br />
               will be doing a great wrong not only to 
               <br />
               the new provinces, but to the whole Do- 
               <br />
               minion. The provincial ownership of the 
               <br />
               public domain is one of the basic principles 
               <br />
               of confederation; to disregard it and the 
               <br />
               other fundamental principles of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act is to undermine the 
               <br />
               whole structure of confederation and to lay' 
               <br />
               up a store of trouble in the days to come. 
               <br />
               The struggle for provincial rights will only 
               <br />
               begin when this Bill comes intO'eﬂ'ect on 
               <br />
               the lst September next, if it remains in its 
               <br />
               present form. The culmination of that 
               <br />
               struggle may not be reached this year or 
               <br />
               next year, but it must inevitably come some 
               <br />
               day in the future and it will be due to the 
               <br />
               action of this parliament if that struggle 
               <br />
               does injury to our common country. I said 
               <br />
