               <br />
               most eloquent champion 0f minority rights, 
               <br />
               not merely because they were guaranteed 
               <br />
               by the constitution, but because they were 
               <br />
               right and because majorities should be fair 
               <br />
               and just to minorities. He made one of 
               <br />
               the most moving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and'eloquent</span> speeches ever 
               <br />
               delivered in this House along those lines. 
               <br />
               it those principles were sound then they 
               <br />
               are right to-day. But the hon. gentleman

               (Mr. Foster) had the audacity to rise in his

               place in this House and'say : Well, the elec— 
               <br />
               tions of 1896 took place and the Liberals 
               <br />
               were returned to power. so, my arguments 
               <br />
               do not seem to have had the effect they 
               <br />
               ought to have had with the people ; and the 
               <br />
               same was repeated in 1900 and again in 
               <br />
               1904; and therefore I am going to swallow 
               <br />
               my principles. I am going over to the other 
               <br />
               side. Well, if that logic were sound, the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman ought to come clean over 
               <br />

               hon. gentleman kneW, perfectly well, when 
               <br />
               he spoke, that the elections of 1896 were 
               <br />
               not decided on the Manitoba school ques- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of Canada groaned under a bad policy and 
               <br />
               a worse <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:u‘lministration.</span> He knew that four 
               <br />
               or ﬁve years before 1896, the people of 
               <br />
               Canada had made up their minds that at

               in this country; had made up their minds

               that they would put men in oﬂice pledged

               <br />
               istration of affairs. He knew that the 
               <br />
               Manitoba school question had little to do 
               <br />
               with the verdict of the people. And he 
               <br />
               ought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:to</span> have known that again in 1900, 
               <br />

               gone ahead by leaps and bounds. and that

               the people were satisﬁed. Yet the hon.
