               Another argument in favour of entrusting

               The arguments of the government on this 
               <br />
               subject are threefold. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Sir</span> Wilfrid Laurier) bases his main con- 
               <br />
               tention on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the"</span> necessity of controlling the 
               <br />
               lands that they may be used as a means of 
               <br />
               promoting immigration. He says there 
               <br />
               must be free homestead entries, and there- 
               <br />
               fore there must be control of the lands at 
               <br />
               Ottawa. This consideration seems entitled 
               <br />
               to no great weight. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.I</span> dealt with it on a 
               <br />
               previous occasion. Another hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               seemed to be under the impression 
               <br />
               that there would be less corruption 
               <br />
               if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span> of the lands were 
               <br />
               in the hands of the central govern-

               ment than if they were administered 
               <br />
               by the provinces. The Prime Minister ad- 
               <br />
               duces on this subject the example of the 
               <br />
               United States, where the federal government 
               <br />
               has retained the control of the public lands 
               <br />

               the United States with respect to certain 
               <br />
               other features of the Bill to which public 
               <br />
               attention has been called. The example of

               the United States has not~been a happy one, 
               <br />
