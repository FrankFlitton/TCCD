               no doubt, has noticed, this Bill is to be fol-

               ada. This opinion has not been deemed ex- 
               <br />
               travagant. On this continent and across the

               during the space of scarcely more than one

               to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁorts</span> and our ambition. Yet to the

               emulation of such an example there may well

               that settlement of the western portion

               of the American union has been marked

               by almost phenomenal rapidity, it is

               also true that every other consider-

               ation seems to have been sacriﬁced to this 
               <br />
               one consideration of rapid growth. Little 
               <br />
               attention was given, up to the last few 
               <br />
               years, to the materials which were intro- 
               <br />
               duced into the republic; little regard was paid 
               <br />
               among the new settlers to the observance of 
               <br />
               the law; and it is not a slander upon our 
               <br />
               neighbours—for, indeed, the fact is ad- 
               <br />
               mitted in their current literature—that 
               <br />
               frontier civilization was with them a by- 
               <br />
               word for lawlessness. We have proceeded 
               <br />
               upon different methods. We have been 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with slower progress. Our institu-

               tions in our own Northwest have been 
               <br />
               developed by gradual stages, so as to ensure 
               <br />

               I may remind the House, though the fact 
               <br />
               is well known to every body, that when 
               <br />
               confederation was established in the year 
               <br />
               1867, the Canada of that day was not at all

               what is the Canada of the present day. The 
               <br />
               Canada of that day did not extend beyond 
               <br />
               the western limits of the province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Onta‘</span>

               the shores of the Paciﬁc ocean, there was a

               one side and Ontario on the other side there 
               <br />
               was a vast extent of territory, the fairest 
               <br />
               portion perhaps of the continent, which was 
               <br />
               under British sovereignty, but in which 
               <br />
               British sovereignty had always been dor-

               the Hudson Bay Company, under a charter

               which the company claimed, gave her almost
