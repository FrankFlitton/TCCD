               remembering all the difﬁculties .which had 
               <br />
               arisen from the New Brunswick Act abolishing 
               <br />
               separate schools, he announced that he was 
               <br />
               going to embody the principle of those schools 
               <br />
               in the new constitution granted to that vast 
               <br />
               Northwest Territory. That proposal, which 
               <br />
               nobody expected, and which was well received 
               <br />
               by the great majority of the House, was an 
               <br />
               act worthy of praise and gratitude while it 
               <br />
               was, at the same time an indication of the pro- 
               <br />
               gress of the spirit of toleration in the minds 
               <br />
               of Protestants throughout the Dominion. Pre- 
               <br />
               vious to him, no minister had thought of this 
               <br />
               measure of justice and conciliation; and how 
               <br />
               was it received .7 His opponents said : ‘That 
               <br />
               provision was not in the Bill when ﬁrst intro- 
               <br />
               duced and consequently the idea is not his own; 
               <br />
               he has acted under outside pressure.’ As if 
               <br />
               the idea should be scorned because it had not 
               <br />
               suggested itself to the Prime Minister’s mind 
               <br />
               at the outset. But did that generous suggestion 
               <br />
               originate with the opposition ? If so, when 
               <br />
               and by whom was it made and to whose pres- 
               <br />
               sure did Mr. Mackenzie submit '2 Even admit— 
               <br />

               <br />
               kenzie which is untrue, should he not have 
               <br />
               credit for having carried it out cheerfully and 
               <br />
               for ha'ving accomplished what nobody else had
