               mention that upon their arrival here two of 
               <br />
               the delegates were arrested. They were

               ceed with the execution of their mission. 
               <br />
               They held several conferences with the Do-

               there has been a controversy as to the nu-

               tioned. That controversy is important only 
               <br />
               in so far as the educational settlement is 
               <br />
               concerned, because in one of these Bills of

               Rights the school privilege is not mentioned, 
               <br />
