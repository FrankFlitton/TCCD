               ments of the minority of that province. Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, in the province of New Brunswick we 
               <br />
               have a law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">similar</span> to that of Nova Scotia.- I 
               <br />
               was here during part or the time in 1872-73-74 
               <br />
               when the question of the New Brunswick school 
               <br />
               was brought up by the present Minister of 
               <br />
               Marine and Fisheries, who invited us to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inter-</span> 
               <br />
               fore. Wisely, Sir, We abstained from interfer- 
               <br />
               ence, and what is the result to-day ? The re- 
               <br />
               sullt is that in New Brunswick the law is being 
               <br />
               administered in a way that is satisfactory to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> classes of the community. Suppose we had 
               <br />
               listened to the hon. gentleman who now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> position of Minister of Marine and Fisher- 
               <br />
               ies, who so eloquently urged upon us the neces- 
               <br />
               sity of interfering with the legislation of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick, and had undertaken to interfere 
               <br />
               with the laws of that province. Suppose we 
               <br />
               had interfered, what would have been the posi- 
               <br />
               tion in that province to-day ? Think you that 
               <br />
               you would have had the same amicable and 
               <br />
               friendly relations between <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> province and 
               <br />
               this Dominion that exists today ? No, Sir. If 
               <br />
               the hon. gentle-man had prevailed he would have 
               <br />

               If we substitute ‘the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories ’ for ‘Manitoba ’ we will have a pretty 
               <br />
               good description of the Bill which is now 
               <br />
               proposed in this House, and which no doubt 
               <br />
               this House will be asked to sanction. We 
               <br />
               have here just what the Minister of Militia 
               <br />
               thinks about this question, and if he thinks 
               <br />
               that, how is it possible that he could have 
               <br />
               approved of the present Bill which is con- 
               <br />
               trary to the views which he expressed be- 
               <br />
               fore. Now, let us sum up brieﬂy the opi- 
               <br />
               nions which he expressed. First he objects 
               <br />
               to coercion. None of us like that word. 
               <br />
               Then he takes the stand that what is past 
               <br />
               cannot be changed even down to the third 
               <br />
               or fourth generation. I am afraid that be- 
               <br />
               fore that time we will all be chloroformed. 
               <br />
               He also takes the stand for provincial 
               <br />
               rights- he thinks the minority should be 
               <br />
               considered, he thinks that before any great 
               <br />
               change in the policy of the country is made 
               <br />
               there should be an investigation. He thinks 
               <br />
               that if Manitoba is left to administer its 
               <br />
               own laws it will administer them in its own 
               <br />
               interest and in the interests of all parts of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. I have taken some pains 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> ﬁnd what the minister said on this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques.</span> 
               <br />
               tion, and I want the House to take it into 
               <br />
               consideration that it is diﬂlcult to under- 
               <br />
               stand how this gentleman ever supported 
               <br />
               the introduction of a Bill of this spirit. As 
               <br />
