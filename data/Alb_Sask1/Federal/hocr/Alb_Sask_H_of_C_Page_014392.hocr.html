               With regard to the value of these lands, 
               <br />
               in the latest report of the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior, we have the statement of the sales 
               <br />
               of land made by the railway and other com- 
               <br />
               panies from 1893 to 1904. The sales amount- 
               <br />
               ed to 10,512,349 acres, and the amount of 
               <br />
               money for which these lands were sold was 
               <br />
               $36,992,482, or about $3.50 per acre. That 
               <br />
               is to say, we ﬁnd that as the actual result 
               <br />
               of the 10 or 11 years’ sales of the great 
               <br />
               land companies, they obtain for a little 
               <br />
               over 10,000,000 acres a sum nearly 
               <br />
               equal to the whole compensation to 
               <br />
               be paid to the people of each of the 
               <br />
               new provinces for 138,000,000 acres. Then, 
               <br />
               again, we have the ﬁgures given by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of school lands sales. AsI have 
               <br />
               said, they average about $9.90 per acre. 
               <br />
               Also. the Prime Minister mentioned as 
               <br />
               ‘a very moderate rate’ $3 per acre. 
               <br />
               He was afraid that if the land were hand— 
               <br />
               ed over to the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories they might begin to sell 
               <br />
               them at something more than this very 
               <br />
               moderate rate of $3 per acre. When he 
               <br />
               was questioned whether the lands were 
               <br />
               generally open for sale at these ﬁgures, we 
               <br />
               discovered that they were only open 
               <br />
               to a few favoured individuals and that 
               <br />
               the general public were not able to buy 
               <br />
               lands even at $3 per acre. I will go a

               step further and take the ﬁgures given by 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior a couple of 
               <br />
               years ago in discussing the Grand Trunk 
               <br />

               <br />
               Sifton’s) statement made last Friday. when 
               <br />
               he referred to the school lands trust fund 
               <br />
               as being valued at $50,000,000. That state-

               <br />
               on the educational clauses of this Bill. 
               <br />
               Now, these school lands consist of two 
               <br />
               sections out of every 36 sections in the 
               <br />
               township. That is, the school lands are 
               <br />
               about one—eighteenth part of the whole ter-

               have been set aside for the Hudson Bay

               to one-seventeenth part of the area avail— 
               <br />
               able. And, if the seventeenth part of the 
               <br />
               whole area is estimated by the ex-Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior at $50,000,000, it is a simple 
               <br />
               calculation to arrive at what he estimates 
               <br />
               as the value of the whole public domain in 
               <br />
               the Northwest—all you have to do is to 
               <br />
               multiply $50,000,000 by 17. But I am not 
               <br />
               suggesting that that is a fair valuation of 
               <br />

               an exceedingly difﬁcult thing to ﬁnd at this

               at any ﬁnal conclusion on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, I submit that the calculations I 
               <br />
               have quoted go to prove conclusively that 
               <br />
               the compensation that is oﬁered for the loss 
               <br />
               of these lands is absolutely and utterly 
               <br />
               inadequate. The Prime Minister took the 
               <br />
               Manitoba lands as a precedent, as I have 
               <br />
               before mentioned. But, in the case of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba, the swamp lands were handed back 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> that province. The Prime Minister says 
               <br />
               there are no swamp lands in the new prov- 
               <br />
               inces. I would not like to make such a con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdent assertion as that myself. But, if there 
               <br />
               are none, I think the Northwest should have 
               <br />
               some lands given them in lieu of the swamp 
               <br />
               lands. How much better it would be to 
               <br />
               avoid all these difﬁculties which confront 
               <br />
               us in the calculation of their real value by 
               <br />
               handing the lands over to the new provinces 
               <br />
               just as their public lands have been placed 
               <br />
               in the possession of the other provinces of 
               <br />
               the Dominion. The people of the new prov- 
               <br />
               inces would then feel that, in this respect at 
               <br />
               any rate they had been fairly treated ; that 
               <br />
               in this respect, they had been granted full 
               <br />
               provincial rights. 01', I will make another 
               <br />
               proposition. If this parliament considers 
               <br />
               only 25,000,000 acres of land of that country 
               <br />
               to be of any value, I would invite them to 
               <br />
               select 25,000,000 acres in each province and 
               <br />
               pay us $1.50 per acre and hand over the 
               <br />
               remainder to the provincial authorities. The 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest will make some use 
               <br />
               of the land if you will give it to them. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               As a matter of fact I hold that no mone-

               ate us for the loss of our land. It is impos- 
               <br />
               sible to have a satisfactory administration 
               <br />
               of these lands from a centre upwards of two 
               <br />
               thousand miles distant. Nearly everything 
               <br />
               has to be referred to Ottawa. It takes 
               <br />
               nearly a week to get an answer to a letter 
               <br />
               from one of the nearest points, Regina. The 
               <br />
               people on the spot understand the conditions 
               <br />
               far better than the oﬂicials of the depart- 
               <br />
               ment down here in Ottawa. The land will 
               <br />
               be much better administered by ofﬁcers res- 
               <br />
               ponsible to the Legislative Assembly of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. The whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admi‘</span> 
               <br />
               nistration will be under the eyes of the 
               <br />
               people who are most deeply interested in 
               <br />
               the lands. It is quite a different matter 
               <br />
               when the administration is placed in the 
               <br />
               hands of one man at Ottawa. He becomes, 
               <br />
               in a sense a dictator, and he is responsible to 
               <br />
               a body of men very few of whom have any 
               <br />
               intimate knowledge of the local conditions 
               <br />
               which prevail in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               The representatives of the other provinces 
               <br />
               of the Dominion control and manage their 
               <br />
               own lands. And they are the people best 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed to control and manage those lands. 
               <br />
               But I contend that they are not so well 
               <br />
               qualiﬁed to control and manage the lands of 
               <br />
               the Northwest as are the people of the
