               No, Mr. Editor, the people of Ontario are true

               that it is they, and not the people of Ontario, 
               <br />

               federation ; What they then claimed for them-

               selves they are now unwilling to grant to the

               They certainly did demand to control their own 
               <br />
               educational system through the provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, but they did not claim to control the 
               <br />
               education of the minority. The minority was 
               <br />
               to control its own educational system and has 
               <br />
               always done so. The majority would probably 
               <br />
               have acted rightly by the minority, even if they 
               <br />
               had been free to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> otherwise, but at confed-
