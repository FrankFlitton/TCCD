               this board upon the 1st subsection reduced 
               <br />

               Dealing now with section 16, I would like 
               <br />
               to say that the second paragraph in that‘ 
               <br />
               section was added—although in my judg- 
               <br />
               ment absolutey unnecessary—because it was 
               <br />
               thought advisable to re-enact the provisions 
               <br />
               of section 11 of the Act of 1875. This was 
               <br />
               for the purpose of making it quite clear 
               <br />
               that this parliament was merely carrying 
               <br />
               out a solemn promise already made. That 
               <br />
               very paragraph was intended to give legis- 
               <br />
               lative sanction to the conditions now exist- 
               <br />
               ing with respect to grants in aid of educa- 
               <br />
               tion. At the present time these grants are 
               <br />
               dependent upon an annual vote of the legis- 
               <br />
               lature, and it was not clear to me that the 
               <br />
               annual grant made by the legislature gave 
               <br />
               to those who beneﬁt by it a right or pri- 
               <br />
               vilege within the meaning of section 93. 
               <br />
               And I thought that if separate schools are 
               <br />
               to exist, they should be made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eifective</span> for 
               <br />
               the purposes for which they were intended 
               <br />
               and should be placed, to use the‘ words of 
               <br />
               Mr. Balfour, in a position in which they 
               <br />
               can effectively play their necessary and 
               <br />
               inevitable part in the scheme of national 
               <br />
               education. I have given you now, Mr. 
               <br />

               <br />
               Where now are the shackles, the manacles, 
               <br />
               the invasion of provincial rights? What 
               <br />
               are we doing? I say that in the future

               it would be a serious reﬂection upon the

               <br />
               mises made in 1875, repeated in 1880, and 
               <br />
               oft repeated since were not carried out.
