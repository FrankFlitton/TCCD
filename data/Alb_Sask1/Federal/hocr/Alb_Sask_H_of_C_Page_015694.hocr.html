               whole argument went to show that we have 
               <br />
               not that and as a consequence there has 
               <br />
               been a large loss to the farmers. The Min-

               should have that and therefore I agree with 
               <br />
               and accept the resolution, it is a motion 
               <br />
               of want of conﬁdence in the government 
               <br />
               as it is an amendment to supply, but the 
               <br />
               minister has accepted it and what has he 
               <br />
               done by accepting it? He absolutely con- 
               <br />
               dems what he has been doing as Minister of 
               <br />
               Agriculture for years, because the member 
               <br />
               who made the motion showed by the thermo- 
               <br />
               graph records that there has not been a pro- 
               <br />
               per system of cold storage, that there has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> a serious loss to the farmers and that 
               <br />
               Canada is suffering immensely from this 
               <br />
               cause. The motion is a condemnation of 
               <br />
               the minister but he says he will accept it 
               <br />
               and thereby condemns himself and the 
               <br />
               administration of his department. The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Agriculture says it is true that we 
               <br />
               have made contracts with the steamship 
               <br />
               companies to provide cold storage. Yes, 
               <br />
               they did, but what did those contracts con- 
               <br />
               tain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'3</span> Only a portion of what they ought 
               <br />
               to contain. They pretend to provide that 
               <br />
               cold storage shall be supplied to the farm— 
               <br />
               ers at a reasonable rate as was done by his 
               <br />
               predecessors, when similar contracts were 
               <br />
               made which contained a stipulation specify- 
               <br />
               ing exactly how much in addition to the 
               <br />
               usual freight rates should be added for cold 
               <br />
               storage. The present contracts do not en- 
               <br />
               sure the maintenance of a uniform tempera- 
               <br />
               ture for the whole voyage and the perish- 
               <br />
               able products carried suifer in consequence 
               <br />
               of this omission. We assist steamship 
               <br />
               companies from two sources, one is by sub- 
               <br />
               sidies for carrying mails and the other by 
               <br />
               subsidies for the provision of cold storage, 
               <br />
               and in both of these cases I say the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have lamentably failed in the making 
               <br />
               of the contracts to provide adequate cold 
               <br />
               storage suﬁicient for the relief of the farmer 
               <br />
               and with a uniform temperature throughout 
               <br />
               the voyage. When the Minister Of Trade 
               <br />
               and Commerce had his contract before the 
               <br />
               House we asked for a copy and what did 
               <br />
               that tell us ? It contained a provision that 
               <br />
               the steamships securing a subsidy shall pro- 
               <br />
               vide adequate cold storage but there was no 
               <br />
               penalty attached if they do not provide 
               <br />
               that cold storage. It is like the old saying 
               <br />
               that a law without a penalty is valueless. 
               <br />
               You may say a thing is improper and should 
               <br />
               not be done, but if you do not provide some 
               <br />
               punishment your law is 0f no use, and so a 
               <br />
               contract of this kind without some penalty 
               <br />
               clause is valueless. You may say as the 
               <br />
               Minister of Trade and Commerce said, that 
               <br />
               these steamships shall provide adequate cold 
               <br />
               storage, but they get the subsidy whether 
               <br />
               they provide it or not, and the farmers suf- 
               <br />
               fer in consequence. The result is that we

               Northwest Territories at the present time 
               <br />
               with respect to laws, &amp;c., and at the same 
               <br />
               time to get rid of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               Act which shall cease to be operative in the 
               <br />
               territories after this comes into force. I 
               <br />
               have had the advantage of a conference 
               <br />
               with the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
               <br />
               Borden) and while we are at one with re- 
               <br />
               spect to the object we both have in view. it 
               <br />
               has been suggested by the leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position that possibly some other form of 
               <br />
               words might be found to carry out our ob- 
               <br />
               ject. In that view sections 15 and 24 might 
               <br />
               either be allowed to remain in abeyance or 
               <br />
               be carried <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> with the understanding 
               <br />
               that if hereafter any better form of words 
               <br />
               is found we might reconsider the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clauses.</span> 
               <br />
               or, in the alternative, hold the clauses in 
               <br />
               abeyance.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. As the Minister of

               Justice has said the object to be attained is 
               <br />
               very plain, but it is not easy to adopt the

               exact form of words necessary for that pur—

               pose. The criticism which has been made 
               <br />
               is that the section now under consideration, 
               <br />
               while repealing the statutes, continues them 
               <br />
