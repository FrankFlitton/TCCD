               Another idea. that is conveyed is that all for- 
               <br />
               eign peoples are the same, that because the 
               <br />
               German people are foreigners and because they 
               <br />
               are desirable settlers, therefore the Galicians 
               <br />
               being foreigners and the Doukhobors being for- 
               <br />
               eigners, are also desirable settlers. Do my 
               <br />
               hon. friends know that they could not insult a 
               <br />
               German and Scandinavian as much in any other 
               <br />
               way as to compare him with a Doukhobor or a 
               <br />
               Galician? The pride of race is as strong in 
               <br />
               these people as it is in us, and they object, and 
               <br />
               object very strongly, to being placed in the 
               <br />
               same category as a Slavic people, a. people who 
               <br />
               less than two generations ago were serfs of the 
               <br />
               soil, and who unfortunately have not had the 
               <br />
               opportunities, even if they had the capability, 
               <br />
               to rise very high above that position to-day. 
               <br />
               Make no mistake. there is no comparison be- 
               <br />
               tween the German who comes from Galicia and 
               <br />
               a Galician who comes from Galicia, and no man 
               <br />
               will resent such a comparison more than the 
               <br />
               German himself. But the Gallcian or the Douk~

               hobor who have been reared under circum-

               stances, which did not permit them to know 
               <br />
               what free government is, who know nothing 
               <br />
               of government except that government is a

               cannot be citizens as we would wish them to
