               <br />
               king the measure of reform which changed

               the face of England, which averted a revo-

               of Grey also recalls to the people of this 
               <br />
               country the illustrious names of Durham

               genius conceived and designed the policy 
               <br />
               which has revolutionized the colonial sys-
