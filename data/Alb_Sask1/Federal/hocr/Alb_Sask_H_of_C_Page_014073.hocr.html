               impassioned argument in its behalf. On the 
               <br />
               one hand he professed the greatest concern 
               <br />
               that no old cries should be renewed, that 
               <br />
               no old issues should be called up, that the 
               <br />
               demon of discord, which had been laid in 
               <br />
               1896, should not be roused again at this 
               <br />
               time, but I submit that the argument he 
               <br />
               used when he came to that clause was one 
               <br />
               he should not have made had he desired to 
               <br />
               live up to his profession. On what ground 
               <br />
               did the right hon. gentleman advocate his 
               <br />
               Bill ? It was not explanation but an 
               <br />
               argument which he gave ? He advocated it 
               <br />
               on the ground that separate schools were 
               <br />
               superior to public free schools or secular 
               <br />
               schools. He raised an issue which there 
               <br />
               was no need of raising at all, an issue which, 
               <br />
               in the earlier part of his speech, my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend declared he did not intend to 
               <br />
               raise. But he forgot that intention and he 
               <br />
               raised the question of the respective merits 
               <br />
               of public free schools and separate schools, 
               <br />
               and gave the horrible example of the United 
               <br />
               States as an argument against public 
               <br />
               schools. There you have his argument and 
               <br />
               his illustration. He tortured the British 
               <br />
               North American Act of 1867 and the British 
               <br />
               North America Act of 1871 in order to get 
               <br />

               tion of his Bill? No, but to make strong 
               <br />
               his argument for the passage of his Bill. 
               <br />
               He tortured the shades of George Browu of 
               <br />
               illustrious memory, until I could almost 
               <br />

               <br />
               statesman ﬁtting through the passages here, 
               <br />

               <br />
               instead of making a lucid explanation of the 
               <br />
               main feature of his Bill, he entered into an 
               <br />
               impassioned argument in order that his Bill 
               <br />
               might gain the assent of this House and 
               <br />
               the country. \Vell, the right hon. gentle-

               <br />
               speech, under his successful avoidance of 
               <br />
               certain points, under his equally successful 
               <br />
               exclusion of certain other points in that 
               <br />
               Bill, every man behind him applauded to the 
               <br />
               echo; and if a vote had been called for 
               <br />
               then, every man would have risen to his 
               <br />

               <br />
               voted for the Bill. He rushed the House 
               <br />
               for the time being, but he failed to rush it 
               <br />
               permanently; and the disorganization and 
               <br />

               phlet, a remarkable pamphlet in some ways. 
               <br />
               It purported to be a ‘brief history, from 
               <br />
               ofﬁcial sources, of the legislation respecting 
               <br />

               the united province of Canada. and in the 
               <br />
               Dominion since confederation.’ Now, as I 
               <br />
               said before, I have no fault to ﬁnd, nor has 
               <br />
               any one in this House with the publication 
               <br />

               that will shed light upon this question. 
               <br />
               But this pamphlet is a partisan pamphlet. 
               <br />
               It does give the facts taken from ‘Hansard,’ 
               <br />
               but it does also colour them, and it does
