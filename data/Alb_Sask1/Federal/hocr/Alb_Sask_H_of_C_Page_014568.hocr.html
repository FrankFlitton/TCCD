               separate schools in the Territorial Bill, they 
               <br />
               were establishing them for all time to come. 
               <br />
               He did not wish to imply that they would 
               <br />
               have to be placed there; but, being a far- 
               <br />
               seeing man, he knew that the fact of that 
               <br />
               provision being made would be used for the 
               <br />
               purpose of perpetuating separate schools in 
               <br />
               those provinces ; and it is well known that 
               <br />
               he was always opposed to separate schools. 
               <br />
               Now, what guarantee have we that the 
               <br />
               separate schools in these two provinces will 
               <br />
               continue as they are at the present time ? 
               <br />
               I submit that we have no guarantee. We 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the provisions of the Bill are very 
               <br />
               hazy, so much so that lawyers might place 
               <br />
               very different interpretations upon it; and 
               <br />
               the ordinances only guide the Territories. 
               <br />
               but do not ensure the schools as they now 
               <br />
               exist being continued for all time to come. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> While no great hardship may be experienced 
               <br />
               at the present time, it will certainly be a 
               <br />
               hardship to the majority in newly settled 
               <br />
               districts to maintain two weak and sickly 
               <br />
               schools where there might be one vigorous 
               <br />
               and healthy school. The Territories have 
               <br />
               no guarantee whatever that these schools 
               <br />
               will remain for all time to come as they are 
               <br />
               at the present time. I suppose they could 
               <br />
               change them for a system of schools similar 
               <br />
               to what exists in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               to—day. According to a judgment given by 
               <br />
               Mr. Justice McMahon some three months 
               <br />
               ago, there are one hundred and ﬁve teachers 
               <br />
               teaching in the separate schools of Ontario 
               <br />
               to-day who have never passed a legal ex- 
               <br />
               amination. This is a serious state of affairs; 
               <br />
               and yet these teachers are going on teach- 
               <br />
               ing month after month. It is true they have 
               <br />
               appealed the case to a higher court, and I 
               <br />
               suppose it will ultimately go to the Privy 
               <br />
               Council. These teachers are now teaching 
               <br />
               contrary to the law, except that the late 
               <br />
               government gave them permits to teach un- 
               <br />
               til a decision of the higher court could be 
               <br />
               obtained. Many of these teachers are not 
               <br />
               educated. It is said that many of them are 
               <br />
               priests, who are educated; but many are 
               <br />
               indies and others who have had no training 
               <br />
               whatever. The law with regard to separate 
               <br />
               schools in Ontario has been changed in 
               <br />
               many ways. For‘ instance. the law provides 
               <br />
               that all taxes paid by corporations must be 
               <br />
               used for the support of the public schools; 
               <br />
               but a private Bill was passed providing that 
               <br />
               the Sturgeon Falls Pulp Company should 
               <br />
               divide its taxes between the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools</span> 
               <br />
               and the separate schools. If that state of 
               <br />
               affairs can be brought about in the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario. why could it not in these new 
               <br />
               provinces ? The Minister of Customs en-

               school law which was handed down to 
               <br />
