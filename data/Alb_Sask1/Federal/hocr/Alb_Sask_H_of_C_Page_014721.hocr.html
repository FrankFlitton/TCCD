               <br />
               and have minds of their own just as well 
               <br />
               as had the people of Manitoba in 1896, and 
               <br />
               a coercive policy would meet with as much 
               <br />
               opposition from them as it did from the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba in 1896. It seems to me 
               <br />
               therefore that the extension westward of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               of the question. With regard to the

               northern extension, I should like to 
               <br />
               call the attention of the House to a 
               <br />
               few facts which seems to have been over- 
               <br />
               looked. It was pointed out the other night 
               <br />
               by the hon. member for Marquette (Mr. 
               <br />
               W. J. Roche) that in 1898 the legislature of 
               <br />
               the Territories passed a resolution consent- 
               <br />
               ing to a northern extension of the boundary 
               <br />
               of Manitoba so as to include that portion 
               <br />
               of the Saskatchewan which lies north of 
               <br />
               that boundary. But Mr. Speaker, let me 
               <br />
               call attention to two other resolutions deal— 
               <br />
               ing with the same subject. The ﬁrst was 
               <br />
               submitted in 1901 to the legislative assembly 
               <br />
               of the Territories. It was couched in the 
               <br />
               following terms : 
               <br />

               that these people living north of Manitoba

               right hon. the First Minister was right in 
               <br />

               <br />
               seems to me that he did all that was possible

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wan,</span> I think, Mr. Speaker, that it should have 
               <br />
               been included. It has always been part of 
               <br />
               the Territories since the district of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan was established. It has been 
               <br />
               always represented in the territorial assem- 
               <br />
               bly and has always been connected with 
               <br />
               the Territories, why then should it not 
               <br />
               continue to form part and parcel of 
               <br />
               the new province of Saskatchewan with 
               <br />
               which it has always been connected? 
               <br />
               The only reason why it has not been includ- 
               <br />
               ed so far as I can see was the desire of the 
               <br />
               First Minister to give the province of Maui- 
               <br />
               toba an opportunity to show that these peo- 
               <br />
               ple would not object to joining that province, 
               <br />
               but, Sir, to ask this government to force 
               <br />
               these people into Manitoba, when on every 
               <br />
               occasion they have protested against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> 
               <br />
               such course, would be, in my opinion noth— 
               <br />
               ing short of coercion. If the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba can show at the conference, which 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman says will be held. 
               <br />
               that these people will not object to joining 
               <br />
               Manitoba then, the conference will be in a 
               <br />
               position to hear the request of that province, 
               <br />
               but until Manitoba can show that consent. 
               <br />
               she is not in a position to urge any claim to 
               <br />
               have that portion of the district of Sas-

               <br />
               If Manitoba can show that these people do 
               <br />
               not object, then the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conference</span> will be in a

               position to hear the rival claims of Manitoba

               and Saskatchewan.

               General made the other day in reference to 
               <br />
               the interview he had with the delegates of 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government with regard to the 
               <br />
               extension of the Manitoba boundaries, I 
               <br />
               understood him to take the position that it 
               <br />
               would be a fair distribution of the district 
               <br />
               of Keewatin if Manitoba were given the har- 
               <br />
               bour at the mouth of the Churchill on the 
               <br />
               Hudson bay and Ontario the harbour at the 
               <br />
               mouth of the Nelson.

               Well, Mr. Speaker, all I have to say in 
               <br />
               reference to that is this: That if the 
               <br />
               principles of right and justice prevail at the 
               <br />
               conference, as I rthink they will prevail, 
               <br />
               neither the province of Ontario nor 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba will get the 
               <br />
               port at the mouth of the Churchill. 
               <br />
               but that port will go to the province 
               <br />
               to which it rightfully belongs. namely the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> province of Saskatchewan. There is
