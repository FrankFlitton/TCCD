               on this side and members of the government

               to support my proposed amendment was to 
               <br />
               me a matter both of surprise and regret. In 
               <br />
               any case I had the right to expect from the

               <br />
               their reasons for rejecting it, if any good 
               <br />
               reasons exist. The extremely casual way 
               <br />
               in which my amendment was rejected in 
               <br />
               committee may have been due to my own

               tion in the matter, the intrinsic importance 
               <br />
               of the subject, and why the amendment 
               <br />
               ought to be adopted. If I fail to make these 
               <br />
               points plain now, it will not be my fault. 
               <br />
               To make my meaning plain, I must refer 
               <br />
               to the autonomy question in a general way.

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1902,</span> I urged my opinions in that direc- 
               <br />
               tion strongly in this House. In March, 
               <br />
               1903, the Manitoba courts gave a judgment 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on.</span> certain test tax cases, to which I shall 
               <br />
               refer later. That judgment was such as to 
               <br />
               lead me to revise my views as to the de-

               <br />
               tained interviews upon that judgment from 
               <br />
               most of the Northwest members. In my 
               <br />
               statement to that correspondent, I spoke 
               <br />
