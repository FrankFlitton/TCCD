               pass will eventually be found to mean. Let 
               <br />
               us consider for a moment what the effect 
               <br />
               of this measure is likely to be. The Act of 
               <br />
               1875, which introduced separate schools into 
               <br />
               the Northwest. was very fully dealt with 
               <br />
               by the ex-Minister of the Interior. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman pointed out what. in his judg- 
               <br />
               ment, were the great defects of that system— 
               <br />
               what he calls the dual system of edu- 
               <br />
               cation. But if the ex-Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior was correct in stating that this 
               <br />
               dual system and all the evil which he 
               <br />

               the very section of the Act of 1875

               cum-ted by this parliament. word for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">word,</span> 
               <br />
               for all time to come, how can he escape the 
               <br />
               conclusion that by this measure we will be 
               <br />
               planting irrevocably in the west this inchi-

               <br />

               existing in the Territories been brought 
               <br />
               about? That there is at present in the 
               <br />
               Territories what many people consider a 
               <br />
               good system is proved by the testimony 
               <br />
               of men who ought to know. Well, the 
               <br />
               change has been brought about in this 
               <br />
               way. In the Territories we have a Commis— 
               <br />
               sioner of Education whose position is similar 
               <br />
               to that of the Minister of Education in the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. and the Territorial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov—</span> 
               <br />
               ernment assumed the responsibility of choos- 
               <br />
               ing the text—books and administering edu- 
               <br />
               cational matters generally. That they did 
               <br />
               by virtue of certain regulations which were 
               <br />
               adopted from time to time and not by 
               <br />
               amendment to the statute of 1875. It 
               <br />
               is by virtue of these regulations which 
               <br />
               have been adopted from time to time, and 
               <br />
               which may be repealed from time to time 
               <br />
               that the present school system in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories has been established. But if these 
               <br />
               regulations have gone beyond the statute of 
               <br />
               1875. if they have taken away any rights 
               <br />
               to which the minority are entitled, they were 
               <br />
               ultra vii-es, they were beyond the power of 
               <br />
               any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioner</span> of Education of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories to pass. If that be 
               <br />
               the case. what will happen ? This will no 
               <br />
               doubt ensue. Once the measure before us 
               <br />
               becomes law, the minority will have the 
               <br />
               right to declare that they propose to have 
               <br />
               the statute of 1875 applied to their claims 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges</span> in its integrity. They will

               protest that their rights have been shame-

               <br />
               have not the power of the statute law and are

               Let us deal for a moment with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques</span> 
               <br />
               tion of policy. It has been stated by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite that if we should adopt 
               <br />
               this measure, there will be no more trouble, 
               <br />
               no litigation. no unpleasantness. and that the 
               <br />
               duty and obligation rests on this parliament 
               <br />
               to deal with this matter and settle it for all 
               <br />
               time. But I submit ﬁrst of all that if the 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament has not the power to 
               <br />
               pass this legislation. then the only result 
               <br />
               of our passing it will be to provoke litigation 
               <br />
               ill order to determine our jurisdiction. In 
               <br />
               the second place should the courts hold that 
               <br />
               this parliament has power, the people of the 
               <br />
               ’i‘erritories—who. if this legislation were not 
               <br />
               passed. would no doubt treat with fairness 
               <br />
               and justice every class of the community—— 
               <br />
               considering themselves oppressed by a law, 
               <br />
               in the passing of which they had no voice, 
               <br />
               would resent its application and decline to 
               <br />
               obey it. And then. in all probability, we 
               <br />
               would have the parliament of Canada again 
               <br />
               called upon to exercise its remedial power. 
               <br />
               In that connection I wish to say that, so far 
               <br />
               as I am able to appreciate the jurisdiction 
               <br />
               of this parliament, it has no power to deal 
               <br />
               with the subject of education except by 
               <br />
               virtue of subsection 4 of section 93, and 
               <br />
               there it has only power to deal with it in cer- 
               <br />
               tain circumstances. Nowhere else in the 
               <br />
               Act is this parliament given the power to 
               <br />
               deal with that subject generally, and I 
               <br />
               would ask hon. gentlemen opposite whether 
               <br />
               they would consider for one moment that 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament can have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> 
               <br />
               power to deal with the subject of educa- 
               <br />
               tion when by the Confederation Act that 
               <br />
               parliament is only given the jurisdiction to
