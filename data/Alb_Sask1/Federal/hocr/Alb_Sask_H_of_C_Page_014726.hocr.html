               <br />
               inherent right, even if they had no other 
               <br />
               grounds on which to base their claims that

               their conscientious scruples in this regard 
               <br />
               should be respected. But they have another 
               <br />
               ground on which they base their claim. 
               <br />
               They claim that the right to educate the 
               <br />
               children as they see ﬁt is theirs not only as 
               <br />
               an inherent right, but as a right which was 
               <br />
               guaranteed to them by the parliament of 
               <br />
               1875, and they claim that right should be as 
               <br />
               binding on this parliament as on the par- 
               <br />
               liament of 1875. They claim that this par- 
               <br />
               liament is under a moral obligation even it' 
               <br />
