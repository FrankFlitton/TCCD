               Mr. BUREAU. As far as the law in

               England in concerned, I have 'here a report 
               <br />
               in the London ‘Times’ of April 5. 1905. 
               <br />
               of an Act recently passed in England, for 
               <br />
               the suppression of gambling on streets and 
               <br />
               other public places. The Act deﬁnes what 
               <br />
               gambling is and there is a special section 
               <br />
               of the law which says: 
               <br />
