               Mr. W. F. MAC‘LEAN. Mr. Speaker, the

               right hon. gentleman is trying to draw a 
               <br />
               red herring across the track. This news- 
               <br />
               paper which declares it is his organ, and 
               <br />
               he has not repudiated it, says that the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba is to be chastised be- 
               <br />
               cause of its pretentious school law, it is 
               <br />
               to be chastised by the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               and his party, and the chastisement is in 
               <br />
               evidence now before all the people. Mani- 
               <br />
               toba expected that her boundaries would be 
               <br />
               extended, and she expected that the Minister 
               <br />
               of the interior would be here to see that 
               <br />
               her boundaries were extended, but Manitoba 
               <br />
               is being chastised to-day, as the organ of 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman says, because of 
               <br />
               her pretentious school laws. They are not 
               <br />
               pretentious, they are constitutional, she had 
               <br />
               a right to make them, yet she is to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chas‘</span> 
               <br />
               tised to-day. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               said practically the other day that the 
               <br />
               province was entitled to have its boundaries 
               <br />
               enlarged, it was entitled to be put on an 
               <br />
               equality with the other provinces. All over 
               <br />
               the country the statement has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">publish.</span> 
               <br />
               ed that Manitoba is being chastised because 
               <br />
               of her manliness in connection with public 
               <br />
               schools. The right hon. gentleman says he 
               <br />
               does not propose to interfere with the Do- 
               <br />
               minion Lands Act. He does in substance. 
               <br />
               he does in a certain measure which I know 
               <br />
               of, where it is all outlined that the public 
               <br />
               school lands and the public funds in re- 
               <br />
               lation to education are to be interfered 
               <br />
               with. It may be in a special Bill, but the 
               <br />
               intention is to make laws in that direction. 
               <br />
               What follows then is this, that in the way 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman aproaches this 
               <br />
               question he is making ﬂesh of one and ﬁsh 
               <br />
               of the other ; certain provinces are to enjoy 
               <br />
               certain school lands and others are to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de‘</span> 
               <br />
               nied them. If that is not an injustice and 
               <br />
               an interference with the lands of the pro- 
               <br />
               rince. I do not know what it is. The right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is trying to get away from 
               <br />
               this question in saying that he does not 
               <br />
               propose to introduce remedial legislation. 
               <br />
               He is bound to introduce it if there is any- 
               <br />
               thing in the constitutional argument he 
               <br />
               made here the other day. There is nothing 
               <br />
               in that constitutional argument, but there is 
               <br />
               a great deal In the constitutional argument 
               <br />
               that Manitoba is entitled to remedial legis- 
               <br />
               lation. If that is true, I will have to put 
               <br />
               up for the present with the trivial reply of 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman; but before two 
               <br />
               weeks are over, before another week is 
               <br />
               over, he will sing on the other side of his 
               <br />
               face. He will ﬁnd that the people of Can- 
               <br />
               ada are in favour of the maintenance of 
               <br />
               provincial rights; they are not in favour of

               country it is speeches such as that hon.

               gentleman has delivered, and articles that 
               <br />

               which the hon. member for South York has

               with that liberality which no doubt they

               <br />
               the case of Manitoba. I am not going to

               this now, although these are matters which

               will more properly come up when the Bill
