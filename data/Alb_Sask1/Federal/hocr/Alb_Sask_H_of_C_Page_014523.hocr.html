               day—since the question' has been up

               for discussion I received a letter from

               door. It is near his own town where

               <br />
               trust the people of the Northwest? Well, 
               <br />
               I would be very glad to do that, because I

               ate schools as they existed under the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 and prior to 1892. He put that down- 
               <br />
               in plain black and white in his draft Bill, 
               <br />
               and no gentleman on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House can contradict the assertion. After 
               <br />
               preparing that Bill, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haulitain</span> appealed 
               <br />
               to the country, and he was returned be- 
               <br />
               cause the people of the Territories were 
               <br />
               satisﬁed with the school system. When Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain passed his ordinance in 1892, he 
               <br />
               was not at all certain, (and other members 
               <br />
               of the legislature shared his uncertainty) 
               <br />
               that the passage of the ordinance did not ex- 
               <br />
               ceed his powers. However, the fact that 
               <br />
               the law of 1892 has since remained in force
