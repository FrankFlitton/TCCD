               It was so with the other provinces, and, I

               inﬂammatory condition of indignation in the

               of the mail service in Prince Edward Island. 
               <br />
               I received on Saturday a despatch from a 
               <br />
               resident of Tignish saying that. in answer

               <br />
               absolutely no information as to the carriage 
               <br />
               of the mails, and the people throughout the 
               <br />
               district have now undertaken the service 
               <br />
               themselves, and the mails have been started 
               <br />
               by sleighs sent out by private individuals. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that this is very unsatis-

               factory, and, I should think, an illegal

               snow-blockade which has for some time 
               <br />
               existed on the Intercolonial—or that portion 
               <br />
               of it in the province of Nova Scotia—has 
               <br />
               been raised. I had communications to-day 
               <br />
               stating that the trains are now moving in 
               <br />
               and out of Halifax, and also between 
               <br />
               Sydney and Truro—so that the road is com- 
               <br />
               pletely free. The Dominion Atlantic line 
               <br />
               which is the line running between Halifax 
               <br />
               and Yarmouth, had been closed for a week 
               <br />
               or ten days. Even the highways are entirely 
               <br />
               impassable. With the assistance of the In- 
               <br />
               tercolonial and the using of the appliances of 
               <br />
               that road, the Dominion Atlantic has been 
               <br />
               opened up, and trains are now running over

               great drawback to the business interests of
