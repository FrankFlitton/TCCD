               <br />
               question, an entirely different question, and 
               <br />
               very pertinent to the present discuss-ion did 
               <br />
               arise, and upon that case arose the agitation 
               <br />
               of 1896. After Manitoba had been created 
               <br />
               a province, then, of its own free will, by its 
               <br />
               own legislature, it passed a separate school 
               <br />
               law, and after doing that, at the instiga- 
               <br />
               tion of some hon. gentlemen who now are 
               <br />
               apparently great friends of the Catho- 
               <br />
               llc minority, the Manitoba legislature re- 
               <br />
               pealed their school law, and thereupon 
               <br />
               the minority raised the question that 
               <br />
               the legislature, having granted separate 
               <br />
               school privileges and having afterwards 
               <br />
               repealed them, this parliament had the 
               <br />
               right and authority to interpose and 
               <br />
               grant remedial] legislation. The Judi- 
               <br />
               cial Committee of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               in England decided .that it was the 
               <br />
               duty of the government of the day .to intro- 
               <br />
               duce such legislation. They did not express 
               <br />
               the exact form. but they said the minority 
               <br />
               were entitled to relief, and it was for the 
               <br />
               government here who had the power to 
               <br />
               enforce a remedy, to say what particular 
               <br />
               line of action should be taken. I do not 
               <br />
               suppose anybody ever thought that, if the 
               <br />
               Remedial Bill had gone through this House, 
               <br />
               there was any obligation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:to</span> re-enact the 
               <br />
               exact provisions of the Manitoba law. But 
               <br />
               it was the duty of this parliament in carry- 
               <br />
               ing out the constitution, in carrying out 
               <br />
               this very subsection 4 which the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman is seeking to use now, it was the 
               <br />
               duty of parliament <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.to</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁord</span> a remedy so 
               <br />

               <br />
               in the opinion of parliament require. So 
               <br />
               when the Conservative government of that 
               <br />
               day, in obedience to the spirit and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">letterIOf</span>

               <br />
               duced a Remedial Bill into this parliament 
               <br />
               and sought to do justice to the Roman Ca-
