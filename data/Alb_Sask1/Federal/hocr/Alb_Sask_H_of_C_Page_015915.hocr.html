               census population of Humboldt in 1901 was 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But since that time there have 
               <br />
               been made 2,274 homestead entries. Fol- 
               <br />
               lowing the same principle of allowing 
               <br />
               three persons for each homestead entry 
               <br />
               that gives as far as homestead entries 
               <br />
               are concerned a population of 6,822, 
               <br />
               and including the population of 582 
               <br />
               as set out in the census of 1901, ‘a total 
               <br />
               population of 7,304 without counting any 
               <br />
               of the town population, and everybody who 
               <br />
               has gone over the main line of the Canada 
               <br />
               Northern Railway knows that there are 
               <br />
               very considerable towns growing up along 
               <br />
               that line. Therefore. I think that my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Humboldt is well within the 
               <br />
               mark when he says that there is a popula- 
               <br />
               tion in the district of Humboldt of between 
               <br />
               8,000 and 10,000 people. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle thinks that population is 
               <br />
               not entitled to one representative and that 
               <br />
               Humboldt should be added to Batoche. Now, 
               <br />
               I have here the ﬁgures which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               has read showing the homestead entries 
               <br />
               for the different districts. and I ﬁnd that in 
               <br />
               Batoche in 1901 there was a census popula- 
               <br />
               tion of 1.970 and in Humboldt a census 
               <br />
               population of 582. In addition, in Batoche. 
               <br />
               according to this list, there have been since 
               <br />
               1901 2,594 homesteads entered and in Hum-
