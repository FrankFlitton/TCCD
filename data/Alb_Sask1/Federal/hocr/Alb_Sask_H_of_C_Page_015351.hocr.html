               <br />

               of the debate to which he has referred, and

               I twice got the answer that the volume can-

               not be found. I have compared that por- 
               <br />
               tion of the debate contained in the 
               <br />
               ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leader"</span> of tile 2nd of January, 1902, which 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice has produced, and I 
               <br />
               find that it begins at a portion of the speech 
               <br />
               which follows that quoted by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle. Therefore my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Qu’Appelle in stating that there was a 
               <br />
               context which would explain the references 
               <br />
               of Mr. Haultain to this system, was abso- 
               <br />
               lutely right. The Minister of Justice, it 
               <br />
               seems to me. should not have made the con- 
               <br />
               tradiction which he did unless he had ex- 
               <br />
               amined the previous portion of the speech. 
               <br />
               which is not contained in this issue at all. 
               <br />
               it begins in this way : ‘Continued from last 
               <br />
               issue.’ and then proceeds almost at the very 
               <br />
               words which my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
