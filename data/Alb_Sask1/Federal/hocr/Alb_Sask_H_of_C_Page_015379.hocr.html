               Every nation has its quota of silly men. Some 
               <br />
               of them, by some curious mischance, ﬁnd their 
               <br />
               way into the parliament. Then, if they exer-

               cise their privilege and speak, their silliness is 
               <br />
               recognized. For instance, if Dr. Black, M.P., 
               <br />
               for Hants, had continued to practise medicine 
               <br />

               a wise man as well as a clever physician, but 
               <br />
               he heard the siren voice of political ambition 
               <br />
               and entered parliament. Even then that excel- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lent</span> reputation might have remained unim-

               one good Canadian whose life had been saved 
               <br />

               <br />
               bars or a. hundred Englishmen. Then the secret 
               <br />
               was out—there was another silly man in the

               Mr. LALOR. The member for East Grey 
               <br />
               is pretty well able to take care of himself. 
               <br />
               Gentlemen opposite have tried to cry him 
               <br />
               down, they have called ‘order’ they have 
               <br />
               called him an Orangeman, they have called 
               <br />
               him a bigot, they have said everything they 
               <br />
               could against him, but he is alive and ﬁght- 
               <br />
               ing and able to take care of himself. I am 
               <br />
               anxious to see this session ended, because 
               <br />
               we want to get home to attend to our busi— 
               <br />
               ness and look after our families, and the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice could shorten the ses- 
               <br />
               sion if he felt so disposed. I am pleased to 
               <br />
               hear that there is an arrangement that he 
               <br />
               is to tell us on Monday <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next,</span> what this school 
               <br />
               clause means. We have had the member 
               <br />
               for Centre York (Mr. Campbell) and the 
               <br />
               member for Saskatchewan <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> other Liberal 
               <br />
               members telling us that the Bill meant na- 
               <br />
               tional schools with religious teaching for 
               <br />
               one half hour each (lay, and it the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice will conﬁrm these statements. 
               <br />
               then we shall know what we are doing. It 
               <br />
               is unfair to parliament and to the country, 
               <br />
               that this Bill should be before the House 
               <br />
               for weeks and that there should be such di- 
               <br />
               vergencies of opinion expressed as to its 
               <br />
               meaning, while the Minister of Justice has 
               <br />
               declined to tell us exactly what the Bill 
               <br />
               means SO that we may vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intelligently</span> 
               <br />
               on it.

               Mr. INGRAM. I want to say a few words 
               <br />
               to my effervescent friend from Hants (Mr.
