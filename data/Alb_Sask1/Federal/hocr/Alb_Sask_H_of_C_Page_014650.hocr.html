               From my point of view I was very much 
               <br />
               disgusted with that declaration. I was 
               <br />
               here prepared to oppose legislation of this 
               <br />
               kind and I think there were several other 
               <br />
               hon. members—perhaps not very many— 
               <br />
               who were prepared to do the same thing. 
               <br />
               Then the hon. ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sitton) returned and resigned saying 
               <br />
               that he could not accept the principles of 
               <br />

               <br />
               nothing was done and I think it may fairly 
               <br />
               be said that the right hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               government was sparring for wind. Every— 
               <br />
               body was wondering what was going to be 
               <br />
               done by the hon. leader of the opposition. 
               <br />
               Everybody wanted to know what the great 
               <br />
               Conservative party was going to do upon 
               <br />
               this question. We had to wait a month 
               <br />
               during which time there were petitions ﬁled 
               <br />

               men opposite did not attend. The hon.

               <br />
               a meeting of protest, but I will 'cast back 
               <br />

               the hon. members from Toronto when a
