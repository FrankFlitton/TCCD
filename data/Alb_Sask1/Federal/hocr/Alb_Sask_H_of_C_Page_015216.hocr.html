               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after'they</span> are formed into provinces, when 
               <br />
               as provinces they, I think, ought to have 
               <br />
               their lands and the management thereof, 
               <br />
               for various reasons. But. you deny both 
               <br />
               of these premises. Then. why do you make 
               <br />
               the specious pretense of having anything to- 
               <br />
               do with lands at all? Why do you not 
               <br />
               simply make your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution</span> read in this 
               <br />
               way: That the Dominion government does 
               <br />
               not propose to give over to these provinces 
               <br />
               their lands, and yet, recognizing that they 
               <br />
               must have money to carry on their public 
               <br />
               works, you give them the amount of $37,500,— 
               <br />
               000 to be paid in a certain way. That would 
               <br />
               be a fair, open, clear exposition of the real 
               <br />
               facts which the hon. Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Oliver) has inadvertently let out. The 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of the Interior, being young. 
               <br />
               is less wily and less skilled in the arts of 
               <br />
               concealment than his older colleagues. I 
               <br />
               sincerely trust that his virgin modesty and 
               <br />
               openness will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> remain the same. and 
               <br />
               that he will be a shining example of a min- 
               <br />
               ister who is frank and outspoken, who will 
               <br />
               call a spade a spade, and who, when he 
               <br />
               makes a resolution to give money for any 
               <br />
               purpose. will not attribute it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to,</span> some re- 
               <br />
               ﬁned method of calculation as to the quan- 
               <br />
               tity of land and the present and prospective 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">value</span> of land, but will just simply say in lhis 
               <br />
               resolution. as he says before the committee, 
               <br />
               that he proposes to give these new provinces 
               <br />
               $37,500,000 each. This other is all subter— 
               <br />
               fuge and a specious application of the wily 
               <br />
               arts of the politician to lull the sentiments 
               <br />
               and probably the rightful sentiments of the 
               <br />
               people in the Northwest. The hon. Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior has been good enough to say 
               <br />
               that we should have the information. I 
               <br />
               would like to know the quantity of lands 
               <br />
               there is in each of these provinces that are 
               <br />
               considered to be arable lands, the acreage 
               <br />
               that is considered to be grazing lands and 
               <br />
               the area that is put in the category of 
               <br />
               mineral lands. I suppose there are certain 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">portions</span> of these lands, of which you already
