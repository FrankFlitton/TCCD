               <br />
               There was some excuse, whether Lord Dun-

               donal was right or wrong, for the course he

               <br />

               <br />
               treatment of Monseigneur Sharretti. If the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman was right in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1596</span> upon this 
               <br />
               school question, he must be Wrong now. It 
               <br />
               is not possible for him to take the position 
               <br />
               he did then and now turn around and take 
               <br />
               the very opposite and say: I am right all 
               <br />
               the time. Let me ask you what was the 
               <br />
               attitude of the inﬂuence that was operating 
               <br />
               upon the hon. gentleman in 1896‘? Did the 
               <br />
               church of his faith, when he stood up in this 
               <br />
               House and defended the doctrine that Mani- 
               <br />
               toba should not have separate schools, throw 
               <br />
               him out? Did it discard and did it discredit 
               <br />
               him ? Did it say he was wrong then and he 
               <br />
               ought not to advocate such a course? No, 
               <br />
               not one word of condemnation, not one word 
               <br />
               of criticism. Why? I will come to that in 
               <br />
               a moment. We ﬁnd him taking exactly the 
               <br />
               opposite course on this occasion and he could 
               <br />
               not have been right in both instances. But 
               <br />
               was that the case? No, just as in 1896, 
               <br />
               when they refused to condemn him for the 
               <br />
               course he took then, the church is standing 
               <br />
               by the right hon. gentleman although he is 
               <br />
               advocating an entirely different theory. 
               <br />
               There must be some reason for all that. The 
               <br />
               reason that appeals to my mind is this. That 
               <br />
               in 1896 there was some well deﬁned plan, 
               <br />
               thoroughly understood between those two 
               <br />
               elements which was to have been worked 
               <br />
               out at some subsequent date, and I think the 
               <br />
               evidence before us in the Bills now engag- 
               <br />

               Now, Sir, when these Bills were intro- 
               <br />
               duced in this House there was a spontaneous 
               <br />
               expression of disappointment. That feeling 
               <br />
               of disappointment, after all the discussion 
               <br />
               that has taken place in this House, after 
               <br />
               all the discussion that has taken place 
               <br />
               through the public press has not downed 
               <br />
               at all, but has been growing and growing 
               <br />
               until it is a perfect chorus of condemnation 
               <br />
               of this measure from one end of this Do- 
               <br />
               minion to the other. There is a general 
               <br />
               outcry against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">injustice</span> that will be 
               <br />
               done these new provinces by imposing upon 
               <br />
               them the system of separate schools pro- 
               <br />
               vided for in these measures. There is an out- 
               <br />
               cry <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aat</span> the injustice that will be done by 
               <br />
               binding and shackling the people in these 
               <br />
               new provinces by a system of education that 
               <br />
               is not agreeable to their wishes. These 
               <br />
               mutterings that we ﬁrst heard in this House 
               <br />
               upon the introduction of these Bills have 
               <br />
               grown and will continue to grow, I verily 
               <br />
               believe, notwithstanding the passing of these 
               <br />
               measures by the force behind the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister. These mutterings will in- 
               <br />
               crease and grow, and there will be no pos- 
               <br />
               sibility of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> being perfect rest and a 
               <br />
               feeling of perfect freedom, unless this gov- 
               <br />
               ernment shall see ﬁt, in its wisdom, to with- 
               <br />
               draw the educ-ational clauses of these 
               <br />
               Bills and allow these provinces to legislate 
               <br />
               on that subject as to them see-ms meet and 
               <br />
               just. And, now, Sir, this feeling of disap- 
               <br />
               pointment has been expressed by the press 
               <br />
               of this country, the greatest of all powers 
               <br />
               not only for the expression but for the 
               <br />
               formation of public opinion. The majority 
               <br />
               of the press have condemned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> educa- 
               <br />
               tional clauses. Resolutions have been passed 
               <br />
               by public meetings held in many places 
               <br />
               throughout the Dominion condemning this 
               <br />
               legislation. There have been pulpit dis- 
               <br />
               courses from almost every religious denom- 
               <br />
               ination in condemnation of these clauses. 
               <br />
               Educational bodies meeting in solemn con- 
               <br />
               clave for the discussion of this matter, have 
               <br />
               also passed resolutions condemning this leg- 
               <br />
               islation. E-duca-tionalists, who are especial- 
               <br />
               ly ﬁtted to judge of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> matter. have also 
               <br />
               announced themselves against this measure 
               <br />
               in unmistakable terms. And, Sir, hundreds, 
               <br />
               yes thousands. of the very best people in the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada have expressed the 
               <br />
               same sentiment by the petitions that have 
               <br />
               been presented from day to day to this 
               <br />
               House. And hon. members in this House 
               <br />
               have been endeavouring, for days and weeks 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convince</span> this government that the legis-

               lation proposed under these Bills is not in 
               <br />
               the interest of the new provinces. Now, "Sir,

               <br />
               these persons, all these petitioners, and the 
               <br />
