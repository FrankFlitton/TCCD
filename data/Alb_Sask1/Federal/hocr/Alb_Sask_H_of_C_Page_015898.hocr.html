               <br />
               to 2,140. They are to have one member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               each. Compare this with Souris, which, un-

               der this distribution, is to return only one 
               <br />
               member. Sonris polled 2,544 votes, over 
               <br />
               400 votes more for this one constituency 
               <br />
               than were cast in these ﬁve northern consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies. With two exceptions, every one 
               <br />
               of the sixteen southern constituencies polled 
               <br />
               more votes in the last election than the 
               <br />
               northern constituencies. The question might 
               <br />
               well be asked : How comes it that the voter 
               <br />
               in the south is not considered equal to the 
               <br />
