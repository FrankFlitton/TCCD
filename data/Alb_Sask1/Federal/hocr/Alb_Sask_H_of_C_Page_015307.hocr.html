               friend, who always takes his own law. We 
               <br />
               have not reached section 16; when it is dis- 
               <br />
               cussed I have no doubt the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice will show that it is entirely as We all 
               <br />
               understand it.

               far as it goes. But the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               should not forget this fact, that he treated 
               <br />
               this House to a very serious argument, or 
               <br />
               what he wanted us to accept as an argu— 
               <br />
               ment, explaining that practically the system 
               <br />
               of schools they have in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> was no system of separate 
               <br />
               schools at all, it was practically a system of 
               <br />
               national schools. He says that is the only 
               <br />
               conclusion the man in the street can come 
               <br />
               to. He says, let us take the common sense 
               <br />
               view of it, let us leave the constitution ques— 
               <br />
               tion out of consideration altogether. We 
               <br />
               believe that to-day, by the ordinances which 
               <br />
               have been brought into force, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act.</span> of 
               <br />
               1875 has been so amended <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> time to time 
               <br />
               that the schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> are practically no 
               <br />
               separate Schools at all, that they are national 
               <br />
               schools; and we are asking this House to per- 
               <br />
               petuate them, and not perpetuate a system 
               <br />
               of schools that were intended to be put in 
               <br />
               operation by the Act of 1875. That was the 
               <br />
               gist of his argument, that was the inference 
               <br />
               which he Wished the country to draw from 
               <br />
               the argument he presented to the House.
