               the opposition with the Gali'cian voters,

               to capture that vote and who depended for

               however—and it may contribute to the

               anywhere near that majority at any other

               that course. However, if we are to continue 
               <br />
               the discussion there is one circumstance 
               <br />
               which I wish to bring before the notice of 
               <br />
               the House and of our friends opposite and 
               <br />
               the leader of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> opposition particularly. I 
               <br />
               would like to have from him an explan- 
               <br />
               ntion on that one point. In his remarks he

               <br />
               district of Edmonton, and he asked 2" What 
               <br />
               about Centre Toronto? If the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman will remember when I had the hon- 
               <br />
               our of addressing the House on this question 
               <br />
               and was noticing the challenges that were 
               <br />
               being thrown out, notably by the hon. mem-
