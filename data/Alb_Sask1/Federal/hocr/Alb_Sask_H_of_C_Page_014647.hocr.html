               <br />

               to raise the race or religious cry, but simply 
               <br />
               said : Let us hand over this matter to the

               will not have constant friction arising in this

               <br />
               John Thompson would not acquiesce in the 
               <br />
               demands made to relegate either to the pro-

               <br />
               educational questions. Therefore. in 1894, 
               <br />
               a Bill was introduced in this House by 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy to repeal the separate 
               <br />
               school clauses of the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed. Quite a long debate took place on that 
               <br />
               motion ; and according to my way of think- 
               <br />
               ing that debate is the pivot upon which the 
               <br />
               discussion of this question almost wholly 
               <br />
               turns. That debate was so important, it 
               <br />
               had so much to do with the question now 
               <br />
               before us. that I am amazed that hon. gen-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.tleinen</span> opposite have not devoted more 
               <br />
               time and attention to it, because their leader 
               <br />
               at that time made the situation clear and 
               <br />
               plain. In that year, Sir John Thompson 
               <br />
               speaking in answer to Mr. Dalton Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy, said, as will be found at page 6127

               One other important characteristic was to be

               cumstances of the Territories. the fact that we

               ground that there can be no good reason given 
               <br />
               for its existence. As the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition has said to-night, no man knew 
               <br />
               better than those who were engaged in framing

               <br />
               disputes might create in that new country. No 
               <br />
               one realized better the fact, that in so far as 
               <br />
               the population was to be gathered into the 
               <br />

               <br />
               be gathered from different races, and from

               amongst men who had strong lines of diﬁerence 
               <br />

               Territories should remain under our control 
               <br />
               at least, there was to be the broadest tolera~
