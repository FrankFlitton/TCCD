               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I sincerely hope 
               <br />
               that not only will the men in the galleries 
               <br />
               have their eyes on us, but that they Will 
               <br />
               have their eyes on the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman.</span> (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) and if they and the country Will be 
               <br />
               good enough to read What has been said 
               <br />
               here by both the hon. Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               and myself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">both</span> of us will be con-tent. I 
               <br />
               trust that they will read not only What we- 
               <br />
               said but what my hon. friend (Mr. Foster)- 
               <br />
               said. I must confess that I am embarrassed 
               <br />
               somewhat by the wealth of vocabulary 
               <br />
               of my hon. friends opposite. I have to deal 
               <br />
               with the high-water mark of separate- 
               <br />
               schools, and with the ring-bolt of education 
               <br />
               and ‘hand-springs of ﬁnance.’ It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">em-</span>
