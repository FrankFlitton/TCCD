               did they receive in Quebec? Sir Charles 
               <br />

               <br />
               the opinion generally expressed throughout 
               <br />
               Ontario and the result was that many

               What did the Prime Minister say to the 
               <br />
               people of Quebec during the elections of 
               <br />
               1896 'I Did he tell them there would be no 
               <br />
               separate schools ? No, he said that if elected 
               <br />
               he would send a commission headed by 
               <br />
               Sir Oliver Mowat, to Manitoba, to ascertain 
               <br />
               the facts and settle the question, and if 
               <br />
               that failed then he would pass stronger 
               <br />
               remedial legislation than that proposed by 
               <br />
               Sir Charles Tupper. He said to his French 
               <br />
               co-religionists in the province of Quebec: 
               <br />
               You can surely trust me rather than a 
               <br />
               Protestant: like Sir Charles Tupper.
