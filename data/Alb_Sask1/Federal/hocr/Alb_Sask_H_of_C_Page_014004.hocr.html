               not have much weight when compared with

               proper understanding, both of these speeches

               were exceedingly optimistic in their trend

               as we have welcomed all Governors General 
               <br />
               to this Dominion of Canada. We welcome 
               <br />
               him especially as one of a long line of ances-

               the exertion of similar inﬂuences, not of ex- 
               <br />
               tension or of conquest, but of organization 
               <br />
               of development and the knitting together of 
               <br />
               all parts of the empire. Who does not

               know that the Canada of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> exercises 
               <br />
               a very large inﬂuence on the policies and

               the tendencies of government in the Bri-

               opinion may be made in this House, though 
               <br />

               <br />
               tendered in anyway, yet there is the atten-

               tive heed paid to what are the tendencies 
               <br />
               and thoughts and wishes of the great de- 
               <br />
               pendencies beyond the seas, which have 
               <br />
               their inﬂuence in determining policies and 
               <br />
               in determining the trend and action of the 
               <br />
               British government itself. Is it not equally 
               <br />
               true that distinguished men, members of the 
               <br />
               empire, coming from the mother islands to 
               <br />
               the dependencies and over-seas dominions 
               <br />
               such as this, have also a very strong part to 
               <br />
               play and to fulﬁl in so knitting together, in 
               <br />
               so carrymg out the idea of co-operation of 
               <br />
               sentiment and of effort, that this great, but 
               <br />
               yet to a large extent, unorganized world-wide 
               <br />
               empire may become more ﬁrmly and securely 
               <br />
               united than it is at the present time? So 
               <br />
               that our Governor General, welcomed here 
               <br />
               for himself and for his ancestry, is wel—

               <br />
