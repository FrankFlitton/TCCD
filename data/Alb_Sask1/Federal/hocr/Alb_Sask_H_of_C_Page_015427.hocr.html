               the control of the Dominion of Canada. after 
               <br />
               we had railroads built through the country, 
               <br />
               and instead of increasing in value, if such a 
               <br />
               thing were possible they decreased in value. 
               <br />
               But they at last began to increase. We 
               <br />
               on this side of the House say it was because 
               <br />
               of the policy of the government, because of 
               <br />
               the administration of the Minister of the In— 
               <br />
               terior ; they may give any other reason they 
               <br />
               like, but the fact was that the land did not 
               <br />
               increase in value until settlers came 
               <br />
               in to settle upon it. When they hold 
               <br />
               that the land was a value in itself, 
               <br />
               I say they are mistaking the point 
               <br />
               altogether. The land only has a value 
               <br />
               in so far as it is in demand by settlers. 
               <br />
               When my hon. friend made his careful cal- 
               <br />
               culation as to setting apart certain tracts of 
               <br />
               land, and the Dominion government ad— 
               <br />
               vancinig money on the security of that 
               <br />
               land, he based the success of his project on 
               <br />
               the idea that the country would continue to 
               <br />
               prosper, that. settlement would continue to 
               <br />
               increase, that the price of land would con- 
               <br />
               tinue to rise. Now that supposition is all 
               <br />
               based on the success of the administration 
               <br />
               in securing progressive settlement upon the 
               <br />
               land, and if circumstances arise in which 
               <br />
               that increase of value does not continue, 
               <br />
               then his whole calculation falls to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,ground.</span> The ﬁrst thing is to have such a 
               <br />
               policy and such an administration as will 
               <br />
               bring settlers into the country, as will give 
               <br />
               .value to the land, as will give revenue to 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and will do all those desirable 
               <br />
               things that my hon. friend depicted as oc- 
               <br />
               curring if the land were in the hands of the 
               <br />
               provincial authorities. The thing is to get 
               <br />
               the settler, and the question of who admin- 
               <br />
               isters the land is a small consideration. It is 
               <br />
               a small matter whether it is the Dominion 
               <br />
               or the province, but we say that the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion is in a better position to administer the 
               <br />
               lands satisfactorily and well than is the 
               <br />
               province. My hon. friend spoke of the time 
               <br />
               when these provinces would have a popu- 
               <br />
               lation 0f millions, and he declared that when 
               <br />
               that time came they would have their faces 
               <br />
               set towards Ottawa, and come here demand- 
               <br />
               ing inicreased subsidies. Otherwise they 
               <br />
               would have to resort to direct taxation, or 
               <br />
               else they would not have the funds with 
               <br />
               which to carry on the provincial govern- 
               <br />
               ment. There is a possibility such as he has 
               <br />
               spoken of. But when a few minutes after, 
               <br />
               he suggested that I was under a mistake in 
               <br />
               saying that the increase of settlement would 
               <br />
               increase the burdens of the provincial gov— 
               <br />
               ernment, and went on to point out that the 
               <br />
               settler who goes into the province is a bene- 
               <br />
               ﬁt to the provincial government and not a 
               <br />
               burden, that he is not a source of expendi- 
               <br />
               ture to the provincial government, I ask him 
               <br />
               respectfully, how he reconciles his two argu- 
               <br />
               ments. If so large a population is going to 
               <br />
               put the provincial government behind ﬁnall- 
               <br />
               cially, then certainly my statement is borne 
               <br />

               Now, I want to say a word in regard to 
               <br />
               the objections that have been persisted in 
               <br />
               by some of our hon. friends on the other 
               <br />
               side to the inclusion of the district of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska in these two new provinces. Do these 
               <br />
               gentlemen not know that the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, this pet province of theirs, is, as 
               <br />
               we are told by the papers, on the verge of 
               <br />
               rebellion ? The government is about to re- 
               <br />
               sign and demand a dissolution, because that 
               <br />
               province has not had the territory to its 
               <br />
               north included within its boundaries; and 
               <br />
               the reason that it makes these demands, 
               <br />
               the reason for the excitement in that pro- 
               <br />
               vince, is because these provinces of the west 
               <br />
               have been given the increase of territory 
               <br />
               that the province of Manitoba desires, and 
               <br />
               which every authority of our friends on the 
               <br />
               opposite side in that province declares it is 
               <br />
               entitled to and should have and cannot get 
               <br />
               along without. If the government of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba is honest and sincere in its declaration 
               <br />
               that the province of Manitoba is entitled to 
               <br />
               an addition to its northern boundary—and 
               <br />
               who is there to say it is not—surely these 
               <br />
               two provinces are equally entitled to the 
               <br />
               inclusion of this territory of Athabaska. I 
               <br />
               shall not go over what has been gone over 
               <br />
               so often as to the certainties of development 
               <br />
               of that part of the district of Athabaska, 
               <br />
               which will form part of the province of Al- 
               <br />
               berta. There is no reason from any point 
               <br />
               of view why that country should not be in- 
               <br />
               cluded in the new province. There is every 
               <br />
               reason, from every point of view, why it 
               <br />
               should be included in the new province.

               As to the causes of offence which the other

               <br />
               thinking at any rate that our hon. friends

               who argue so eloquently, who have argued 
               <br />
               so eloquently and forcefully, for the control 
               <br />
               by these new provinces of their lands for 
               <br />
               the sake of revenue from those lands, are 
               <br />
               rather anxious to save‘the Dominion trea-

               this agreement gives those provinces than 
               <br />
               to give the provinces control of their lands. 
               <br />
               I think that if the matter is discussed to a

               we cannot sell our lands and give them
