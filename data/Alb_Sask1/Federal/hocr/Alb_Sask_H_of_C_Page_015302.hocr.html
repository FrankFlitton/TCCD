               criticism upon the mode in which I dealt

               <br />
               My hon. friend from Colchester was good 
               <br />
               enough to suggest that I had dealt with 
               <br />
               this question from a constitutional stand- 
               <br />
               point because I lacked the courage to deal 
               <br />
               with it in any other way. Well, I do not 
               <br />
               know that I regard that taunt very much 
               <br />
               from the hon. gentleman, because I do not 
               <br />
               know that during his career, of which I 
               <br />
               have some knowledge, he has been specially 
               <br />
               conspicuous for any unusual display of 
               <br />
               courage. Be that as it may, I would com- 
               <br />
               mend him to the words and arguments of 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister who, both on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">let</span>

               made his argument in this House solely 
               <br />
               from the constitutional standpoint. I would

               courage which he was good enough to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11m</span> 
               <br />
               pute to me. My lion. friend from Labelle 
               <br />
               gave a description of himself in this House 
               <br />
               ——he is very fond of describing himself— 
               <br />
               and on this occasion he came before the 
               <br />
               House, to use his own words, as ‘a cool 
               <br />
               and common sense outsider’; and as 
               <br />
               a cool and common sense outsider, without 
               <br />
               particularly referring to me by name, he 
               <br />
               made some observations which were evi- 
               <br />
               dently intended for me. I regret that that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thou.</span> gentleman, as usual, is not in the 
               <br />
               House. and I do not know that I would 
               <br />
               have any opportunity of making these ob- 
               <br />
               servations if I waited for his return, so I 
               <br />
               shall be obliged to proceed in his absence. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman was very tender at 
               <br />
               this particular part Of his speech to those 
               <br />
               who had displayed what he called passion 
               <br />
               and prejudice. He said that those emo- 
               <br />
               tions proceeded from the noblest feelings 
               <br />
               of our nature, although later on he used 
               <br />
               very strong language with regard to any 
               <br />
               display of passion and prejudice. At this 
               <br />
               portion of his speech it suited him very 
               <br />
               well to say that he did not object to pas- 
               <br />
               sion or prejudice, but he was particular 
               <br />
               to criticise those who had dealt with this 
               <br />
               qusetion from a constitutional standpon‘it.
