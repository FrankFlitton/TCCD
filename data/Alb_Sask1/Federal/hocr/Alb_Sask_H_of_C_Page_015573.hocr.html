               the hon. minister has made out no case to 
               <br />
               Show that the north has increased any faster 
               <br />
               in the last year or two than the south. We 
               <br />
               have the good fortune of knowing that 
               <br />
               they have both increased, but last year the

               <br />

               year north—that is at Red Deer hnd Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton—were 4,057. In other words last year 
               <br />
               there were 497 less homestead entries north 
               <br />

               <br />
               some ﬁgures taken from a map which had 
               <br />
               been prepared from government sources 
               <br />
               showing the thickly settled townships and

               the sparsely settled townships, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> ﬁgures 
               <br />
               go to show that there has been no propor-

               tionately greater increase in the north than 
               <br />
               in the south because there were 325 thickly 
               <br />
               settled townships south of this mysterious 
               <br />

               <br />
               cent north and 56 per cent south. The 
               <br />
               sparsely settled townships are even more in 
               <br />
               favour of the south. I ﬁnd from my hon.

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">35;</span> per cent north. I merely quote these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures to show that the northern part of 
               <br />
               this province has certainly not increased 
               <br />
               more in proportion during the last year or 
               <br />
               two than the south has. In regard to the 
               <br />
               future increase the hon. minister dilated

               Let us grant that the north is going to

               <br />

               lation of the whole of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Athabaska</span> was 
               <br />
               6,615, including whites, Indians and half- 
               <br />
               breeds. Out of this number there were 
               <br />
               3,716 Indians or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">58‘?)</span> per cent of the whole, 
               <br />
               and these Indians would have no vote. 
               <br />
               There were 2,395 half-breeds or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">377</span> per 
               <br />
               cent of the whole, and there were 242 
               <br />
               white men, being 3'8 per cent of the total 
               <br />
               population. In addition to these there 
               <br />
               were 262 given as unspeciﬁed as to race. 
               <br />
               I have applied the same basis of percent- 
               <br />
               age to these 262 unspeciﬁed, and the re- 
               <br />

               <br />

               half of Athabaska, not counting the In- 
               <br />
               dians, he made a mistake. I have made 
               <br />
               inquiries from people who know something 
               <br />
               about it, and I am told there are no more 
               <br />
               white men in Athabaska to-day than 
               <br />
               there were in 1901; in fact I am told 
               <br />
               there are probably less, because expedi- 
               <br />

               breeds and white men in Athalbaska di- 
               <br />
               vided by ﬁve, would give 549 voters in the 
               <br />
               whole of A'thabaska. How many voters 
               <br />
               there are in this half ‘of the territory 
               <br />
               which goes to Alberta nobody knows; the 
               <br />
               government do not seem to know. How— 
               <br />
               ever, if we take one—half of the whole 
               <br />
               vote in Athabaska, it will give us_ 275 
               <br />
               voters in this part. For the sake of argu- 
               <br />
               ment 1 will say that there are 300 voters 
               <br />
               in the part of Athabaska that will belong 
               <br />
               to Alberta I submit, that considering 
               <br />
               there are only 2,746 half-breeds and whites 
               <br />
               in the whole of Athabaska altogether, an 
               <br />
               allowance of 300 voters for the western 
               <br />
               half is quite liberal. The Prime Minister’s 
               <br />
               ﬁgures of 3,400 as the population must 
               <br />
               have included Indians, and taking the 
               <br />
               same percentages as above. I have ﬁg~ 
               <br />
               ured out that there are 1,411 out of 
               <br />
               that total of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3.400</span> who would be
