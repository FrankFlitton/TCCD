               Speaker, in resuming the debate upon’what 
               <br />
               1 hold to be the most important piece of 
               <br />
               legislation that has been discussed by the 
               <br />
               Canadian parliament since confederation. I

               <br />
               shall express to—day. In the course of the 
               <br />
               very remarkable speech in which the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister introduced this legislation over a 
               <br />
               month ago, I was especially struck with 
               <br />
               one sentence, and that sentence has remain- 
               <br />
               ed in my memory ever since. Having re- 
               <br />
               viewed the leglslation through which these 
               <br />
               Territories had passed since their entrance 
               <br />
               into confederation. the Prime Minister said : 
               <br />
               ‘ Now the time has come to put upon these 
               <br />
               Territories the stamp of Canadian nation- 
               <br />
               ality.’ It is under the light of that principle 
               <br />
               that I intend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to.</span> carry on this discussion. 
               <br />
               It seems to be that. through the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turmoil.</span> 
               <br />
               passions and prejudices that have been 
               <br />
               aroused. in sincerity perhaps on the part of ' 
               <br />
               people. but surely with no other purpose on
