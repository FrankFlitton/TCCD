               That resolution is a very moderate one 
               <br />
               and a very wise one, and either of the 
               <br />
               three courses it recommends should have ap-

               The general elections, Sir, took place a 
               <br />
               few weeks before the meeting of this House. 
               <br />
               These Bills had no doubt been fully decid— 
               <br />
               ed upon, at any rate in their general lines, 
               <br />
               before that election; and that being the 
               <br />
               case, surely their provisions should have 
               <br />
               been submitted to the people. It constitutes 
               <br />
               a gross deception upon the electors, espec- 
               <br />
               ially the electors of the Northwest, that 
               <br />
               such measures should have practically been 
               <br />
               decided upon, and not one reference made 
               <br />
               to them by any one on behalf of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment during the last general elections. In 
               <br />
               my opinion this conduct of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment is deserving of the ‘severest censure.

               <br />
               enormous number of his followers men 
               <br />
               who had been his steady followers for 
               <br />

               <br />
               mark in saying that the Prime Minister has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span> more strong remonstrances from his 
               <br />
               own supporters in Ontario than from all 
               <br />
               the rest of the country put together. The 
               <br />

               ing upon the constitution of the country. In 
               <br />
               that respect he was right because if the 
               <br />
               constitution is good for anything it surely 
               <br />
               ought to be capable of meeting such a case 
               <br />
               as the present. But the Minister of Fin-

               ance (Mr. Fielding) threw to the winds 
               <br />

               <br />

               Minister of Justice will not shirk respon- 
               <br />

               <br />
               knowingly, they were drawn in the shape 
               <br />
               they were, although it was known that they 
               <br />
               would not be accepted by the great bulk 
               <br />
               of the people. They were concealed from 
               <br />
               those who, the Prime Minister and the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice knew, would oppose them 
               <br />
               tooth and nail. They were only presented 
               <br />
               to Mr. Haultain the day they were sub- 
               <br />
               mitted to this House and to the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and Finance not more than 
               <br />
               a day or two before they were introduced 
               <br />
               here. They were deliberately suppressed 
               <br />
               and kept back from all those who as the

               Prime Minister and other members of the

               government well knew, would strongly and 
               <br />
               strenuously oppose them. What the people 
               <br />
               want to know is why were these clauses 
               <br />
               forced on an unwilling cabinet ? Why were 
               <br />
               they forced upon people who objected

               very people who are most interested in 
               <br />
               this Bill ? These people were not consulted 
               <br />
               The man who represented them in the 
               <br />
               cabinet was not consulted, and yet apparent- 
               <br />
               ly such force was brought to bear upon 
               <br />
               the government that they were inserted in 
               <br />
               the Bill and kept secret until the very 
               <br />
               last moment. Surely that is not the way to 
               <br />
               bring about conciliation, but it is rather 
               <br />
               the way to arouse the worst feelings on 
               <br />
               both sides. There must have been some 
               <br />
               strong power that forced the government to 
               <br />
               take this position and what the people want 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> know is who is that power, who pulled
