               <br />

               The Philadelphia baseball team is called ‘The

               It surely is possible to ﬁnd names for the new

               or possible, the new provinces should at least 
               <br />
               be given short names. Parents are particular

               names new applied to the new provinces? 
               <br />
               ‘ Alb.’ would not be easily written with a pen, 
               <br />
               because of the loops in ‘ l ’ and ' b.’ But what 
               <br />
               are we to say about ‘ Saskatchewan ? ’ Shall we 
               <br />
               make the contraction ‘Sask.’ ? If we do, then 
               <br />
               we have the name, ‘Saskey,’ and that would

               Saskatchewan should certainly be dropped, for
