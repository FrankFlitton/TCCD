               <br />
               a representative of the Northwest people, 
               <br />
               whose interests are being legislated upon; 
               <br />
               and I hope the right hon. gentleman will 
               <br />
               levise the statement which he made a few 
               <br />
               days ago, that he does not propose to give 
               <br />
               his attention to that matter at the present 
               <br />
               time. I think it ought to be done; we on 
               <br />
               this side of the House think it ought to be 
               <br />
               done; I believe the people of the great 
               <br />
               Northwest think it ought to be done. De- 
               <br />
               prived of their own champion and repre- 
               <br />
               sentative in this matter, they do at least 
               <br />
               ask the government of the day to give them 
               <br />
               another representative through whom they 
               <br />
               can voice their opinions. It is not enough to 
               <br />
               say to that great country and the million 
               <br />
               of people who are there : Give your views 
               <br />
               to us, and we will take them into consider- 
               <br />
               ation. Everybody knows that even a repre- 
               <br />
               sentative cannot go where a minister goes. 
               <br />
               The formative process is in the cabinet itself, 
               <br />
               and it is difﬁcult to decide upon what is 
               <br />
               not formulated in the cabinet. Therefore 
               <br />
               I say' the west needs its representative, 
               <br />
               needs its champion. How inadequate was 
               <br />
               the argument of my right hon. friend that 
               <br />
               there was no objection to any part of this 
               <br />
               Bill but one clause. Suppose we take that 
               <br />
               for granted, will not my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               admit that that one clause is the great clauSe 
               <br />
               for this whole Dominion as well as for the 
               <br />
               Northwest ? If public opinion centres, with 
               <br />
               unerring aim and unerring sense of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right;</span> 
               <br />
               upon the one great essential clause, is that 
               <br />
               an argument for saying that all the rest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oli</span> 
               <br />
               a multiplicity of enactments are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactorm</span> 
               <br />
               and ﬁnd no dissentients in the Northwest 
               <br />
               or anywhere else in this country? It is 
               <br />
               simply that this one overshadows the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others,</span> 
               <br />
               but that there are others my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend knows and he will know still better 
               <br />
               as this discussion goes on. He will ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               one thing I think and that is that his ﬁn-
