               <br />
               of things, and as I said last night and as I 
               <br />
               repeat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lto—night,</span> has it not been up to this 
               <br />
               time the opinion of the vast majority of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party that, as a matter of fact, 
               <br />
               this amendment meant to secure the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exist-</span> 
               <br />
               ing state of things in the Northwest? Now 
               <br />
               we have the deliberate opinion of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice that the only thing which 
               <br />
               is secured by this clause is the right of Ca- 
               <br />
               tholics with respect to separate schools. I 
               <br />
               stated last night, and I proved by docu- 
               <br />
               ments emanating from the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, that the only separate schools 
               <br />
               which can exist under the law are reduced 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the paltry number of 9, and that there 
               <br />
               are to—day 150 schools organized by Catho- 
               <br />
               lics which receive no guarantee whatever 
               <br />
               under this amendment, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.I</span> have the 
               <br />
               word of the Minister of Justice for it. 
               <br />
               Therefore, when the Minister of Inland 
               <br />
               Revenue says that the object of this amend- 
               <br />
               ment is to crystallize the existing system, 
               <br />
               he is giving a straight denial to the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Justice. Therefore I think I am jus- 
               <br />
               tiﬁed in saying that either the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MinisteL</span> of 
               <br />
               Inland Revenue or the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               is deceiving us and deceiving the minority 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest.</span> When we are told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">positive-</span> 
               <br />
               ly by the Minister of Inland <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Revenue,</span> that

               the minority in the Northwest have accept-

               ed the present amendment, I tell him that 
               <br />
               they have accepted it just as the people of 
               <br />
               Quebec accepted it, because they have been 
               <br />
               positively assured during the last few 
               <br />
               months by the government supporters and 
               <br />
               the government press, and privately by 
               <br />
               members of the government, that the object 
               <br />
               of this amendment was to secure the whole 
               <br />

               <br />
               schools as well as minority schools. There- 
               <br />
               fore when I have before me the straight 
               <br />
               declaration of the Minister of Justice, the 
               <br />
               member of the government who is respon- 
               <br />
               sible for this legislation, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> Lot 
               <br />
               true, and that these 150 schools organized 
               <br />
               in places where Catholics are in a majority, 
               <br />
               receive no guarantee whatever, and when 
               <br />
               I have shown by the ordinances that in 
               <br />
               every district where Catholic will be thus 
               <br />
               situated they will be in the same position. 
               <br />

               and I know something of the word ‘dema-

               <br />
               ter of Inland Revenue, who tries to fan the 
               <br />
               prejudices of people without any other ob-

               <br />
               did the hon. Minister of Inland Revenue 
               <br />
               insinuate against me? That, without hav— 
               <br />
               ing regard to the needs of the minority, I 
               <br />
               had brought in an amendment which meant 
               <br />
               nothing for the minority, and that I was 
               <br />
               fanning the prejudices of the Catholic peo- 
               <br />
               ple of Quebec against the Prime Minister.

               Why, the only kind of appeal I made in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec was against the hypo- 
               <br />
               critical campaign carried on by the govern-

               ment organs in that province for the last

               three months, saying that, as a matter of 
               <br />
               fact, justice is not rendered to the minori- 
               <br />
               ty, and that justice cannot be rendered to the 
               <br />
               minority because the English Liberals did 
               <br />
               not want to render justice to the minority.

               Mr. BOURASSA. It has been stated p0si— 
               <br />
               tively in an article in reply to a letter I 
               <br />
               sent to ‘Le Canada’ of Montreal. I have 
               <br />
               not the paper here, and I do not remember 
               <br />
               the date, but my hon. friend had better not 
               <br />
               be too sure about it or we will have a re—

               petition of the event of last night, when it 
               <br />
               was stated positively that ‘ Le Canada’ had 
               <br />
               not called the henchmen of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite yellow dogs. It has been stated 
               <br />
               positively in ‘Le C-anada’ that it was true 
               <br />
               justice was not rendered to the minority by 
               <br />
               the Quebec Liberals, that they must take 
               <br />
               this measure or nothing, because the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish-speaking members of the House would 
               <br />
               not agree to give more. What is the posi-

               clearly expressed there a short time ago by
