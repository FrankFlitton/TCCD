               I happened lately to be reading the life of

               the late revered Principal Grant, written by 
               <br />
               his son. He was the principal of Queen's 
               <br />

               <br />
               memory stands hallowed, not only in the 
               <br />
               Presbyterian Church, of which he was a

               foremost divine, but by all classes and creeds 
               <br />
               throughout Canada. Principal Grant was 
               <br />
               referring to an agitation similar to this. 
               <br />

               work no radical or revolutionary change up 
               <br />
               there. These Territories have gradually 
               <br />
               been growing up to a provincial status.

               <br />

               <br />
               these Bills will become law, things will be 
               <br />
               very much the same in those Territories as

               they were on the 30th of June, the day pre- 
               <br />

               <br />
               not change the face of nature. It will not 
               <br />
               make the prairies any more productive; it 
               <br />
               will not add a dollar’s worth to the assets

               <br />
               this, that it‘ the granting of autonomy were 
               <br />
               put off for some indeﬁnite period, undoubted— 
               <br />
               ly these educational rights or privileges of 
               <br />
               the minority would continue. Then, should 
               <br />
               the fact that we are admitting those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories to full provincial status militate 
               <br />
               against the continuance of these rights and 
               <br />
               privileges? That is to say, the minority 
               <br />
               may enjoy these rights and privileges ac- 
               <br />
               cording to their conscientious convictions 
               <br />
               while those Territories remain in a state 
               <br />
               of tutelage merely as Territories ; but when 
               <br />
               they become autonomous provinces are we 
               <br />
               then to put that minority in a less secure 
               <br />
               and less beneﬁcial position by reason of 
               <br />
               our own act? Supposing autonomy were 
               <br />
               not granted at the present time, the rights

               1875 would continue. If those rights were 
               <br />
               infringed, this parliament would be appealed 
               <br />
               to, as it was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">189i</span> when the representatives
