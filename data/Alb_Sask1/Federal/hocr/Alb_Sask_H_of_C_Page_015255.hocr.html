               <br />
               anxious to retain these lands in the hands 
               <br />
               of the Dominion government. It is be- 
               <br />
               cause of the wonderful inﬂuence that these 
               <br />
               government oﬂicials have over these peo- 
               <br />
               ple, who, as the hon. Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior states, are not at all acquainted with 
               <br />
               our homestead laws and whose future pros-

               <br />
               effect what they have threatened to do. 
               <br />
               would suffer a very serious impediment. 
               <br />
               That is one reason why the lands are not 
               <br />
               handed over to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces:</span> If they were 
               <br />

               own ofﬁcials and it would not interfere 
               <br />
               with the immigration policy of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government any more than it does 
               <br />
               in the other provinces of the Dominion 
               <br />
               where they have the ownership of the pub- 
               <br />
               lic domain. They could work in harmony 
               <br />
               with the officials of the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment and it would not be an impediment 
               <br />
               to the encouragement of immigration. At 
               <br />
               this late hour I will not take up the time 
               <br />
               of the committee any longer, but I protest 
               <br />
               against the government retaining these 
               <br />
               lands and I claim that there can be no suﬂi-

               <br />
