               to remedy some of the evils which I have

               mentioned. One hon. member opposite, the

               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settlers</span> coming into that country as one

               reason why the Dominion government should 
               <br />
               retain control of the _ lands. He made 
               <br />
               allusion to the Americans who are coming 
               <br />
               in and stated that it was not safe, that

               they might come in in such numbers as to 
               <br />
               constitute a danger. He did not state what 
               <br />
               they might do, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> inferred from what he

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HvERRON.</span> I do not exclude settlers

               from any foreign country. I prefer, of 
               <br />
               course, our own people from our own pro- 
               <br />
               vinces of Canada, but of the people from 
               <br />
               any foreign countries, there is no doubt in 
               <br />
               the world that the people of the United 
               <br />
               States are going to be our best settlers, 
               <br />
               and I think they are going to be as loyal 
               <br />
               citizens of this country as can be found in 
               <br />
               the Dominion of Canada. I know they 
               <br />
               have proved themselves to be that up to the 
               <br />
               present time, and I think we are quite safe 
               <br />
               in trusting them in the future. When I 
               <br />
               heard the Prime Minister introducing this 
               <br />
               Bill declare that the Dominion was simply 
               <br />
               putting the stamp of nationality on the new 
               <br />
               provinces, that that was all they required 
               <br />
               to make them full ﬂedged provinces, I was 
               <br />
               delighted with the noble sentiments he 
               <br />
               expressed, but when I learned all the condi- 
               <br />
               tions to be placed on the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest, I began to think it would be 
               <br />
               more appropriate, not so parliamentary, 
               <br />
               but more appropriate, if he had called us 
               <br />
               reserves; if he had said that he was go- 
               <br />
               ing to make two great reserves. We are 
               <br />
               familiar with reserves in our country, we 
               <br />
               have Indian reserves and half-breed re- 
               <br />
               serves, and if he had called them reserves, 
               <br />
               it he had stated that the government were 
               <br />
               going to retain the control of the lands and 
               <br />
               minerals in those provinces and that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> were to have separate schools 
               <br />
               placed on them, that they were to he dic- 
               <br />
               tated to from Ottawa, I think it Would have 
               <br />
               been more in keeping than to say that we 
               <br />
               were to have the great stamp of nationality 
               <br />
               placed on the two new provinces. If he 
               <br />
               had said that they were putting the Mave- 
               <br />
               rick brand on us and placing us in the 
               <br />
               Maverick herd, it would have been nearer 
               <br />
               the truth. If I was to vote alone on this 
               <br />
               question, but I am glad to see there are 
               <br />
               several members on this side at least, who 
               <br />
               have some consideration for the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories and are willing to 
               <br />
               do justice to those Territories,—but if I

               <br />
               Speaker, I feel almost like apologizing for 
               <br />
               venturing to address the House in this de- 
               <br />
               bate which has now lasted for a great many 
               <br />
               weeks. However, I can plead the excuse 
               <br />
               that I do not often abuse the patience of the 
               <br />
               House and further, that as one of the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant minority of the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               I may feel that a few observations from me 
               <br />
               will not be out of place. The question we 
               <br />
               are now discussing is an important one. We 
               <br />
               have before this House of Commons meas- 
               <br />
               ures creating two new provinces in the great 
               <br />
               west; provinces which some day we hope 
               <br />
               will become among the most populous and 
               <br />
               most prosperous in this whole Dominion, 
               <br />
               and provinces for the future welfare of 
               <br />
               which we have the greatest aspirations. It 
               <br />
               is, therefore, an act of the highest states- 
               <br />
               manship that we should give these new prov- 
               <br />
               inces a constitution under which they can 
               <br />
               successfully Work out their destiny. I may 
               <br />
               remark in passing that I fully endorse the 
               <br />
               proposal of the government in respect to the 
               <br />
               public lands of these provinces. In view of 
               <br />
               the vast importance to this western country 
               <br />
               that it should be peopled with an enterpris- 
               <br />
               ing and energetic population, it is a wise 
               <br />
               provision .that the Dominion government 
               <br />
               should retain the lands and continue the 
               <br />
               splendid immigration policy which for some 
               <br />
               years past has been so successful. Then, 
               <br />
               too, I am fully in accord with the very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               generous ﬁnancial terms which the Bills ac- 
               <br />
               cord to the new provinces. I believe we 
               <br />
               have made them ﬁnancial concessions which 
               <br />
               will place them in perhaps a better position 
               <br />
               to construct bridges, to build roads, to main- 
               <br />
               tain schools and to support their provincial 
               <br />
               institutions generally than if they had the 
               <br />
               management of the lands in their own hands. 
               <br />
               My remarks Will be directed chieﬂy to the 
               <br />
               school clauses in the Bills before us, and in 
               <br />
               order that I may be brief I shall make no 
               <br />
               quotations. Although I may be a little out 
               <br />
               of the fashion in that respect I feel that I 
               <br />
               will earn the good will of my fellow mem- 
               <br />
               bers by adhering to this rule. 
               <br />

               The great bone of contention in this de- 
               <br />
               bate has been the schools which are to be 
               <br />
               established in these new provinces, and on 
               <br />
               this question I fear that a great deal more 
               <br />
               than was at all necessary has been said. As 
               <br />
               a layman it would not be ﬁtting for me to 
               <br />
               expound the constitution, but, Sir, the ordin- 
               <br />
               ary man reading the provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act cannot help seeing 
               <br />
               that there is written in the constitution of 
               <br />
               Canada the principle of separate schools 
               <br />
               for the protection of minorities. If we go 
               <br />
               back to the genesis of separate schools 
               <br />
