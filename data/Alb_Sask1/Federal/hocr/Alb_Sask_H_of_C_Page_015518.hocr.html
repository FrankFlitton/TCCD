               <br />
               There is also a very small part of the riding 
               <br />
               of Battleford out of the east which also 
               <br />
               extends north. Now south of the main line 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, there 
               <br />
               were eight ridings: Medicine Hat, Cardston, 
               <br />
               Lethbridge, Macleod, High River, Banﬁt, 
               <br />
               East Calgary and West Calgary. Grouped 
               <br />
               together you would not have three whole 
               <br />
               ridings north of the city of Edmonton, as 
               <br />
               divided by the Legislative Assembly in May 
               <br />
               1902, while this distribution gives eight rid- 
               <br />
               ings north of Edmonton. As I pointed out 
               <br />
               before, there were eight ridings south of 
               <br />
               the main line of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way, whereas, now there are in all nine. 
               <br />
               They proceeded upon the assumption that 
               <br />
               conditions have so changed in that country 
               <br />
               that it is necessary to add ﬁve ridings north 
               <br />
               of Edmonton and only one riding south of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. The eight 
               <br />
               ridings north of Edmonton now are Atha- 
               <br />
               baska, Peace River, St. Albert, Sturgeon, 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, Edmonton, Stony Plain and 
               <br />
               Vermilion. Take another example. Township

               38, which the Minister of the Interior sub— 
               <br />
               mits as a fair line to divide that country 
               <br />
               in two—under that distribution which has 
               <br />
               never been complained of, there were, he 
               <br />
               says, six ridings north and the nine 
               <br />
               ridings south of township 38, and it is pro- 
               <br />
               posed by this schedule to give only eleven 
               <br />
               and a fraction south of that township, and 
               <br />
               thirteen and a fraction north. That is 
               <br />
               there have been added to the northenn 
               <br />
               country seven and a fraction and to the 
               <br />
               southern country only two and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fraction.</span> 
               <br />
               That is taking the line of township 38 and 
               <br />
               working out this scheme about 60 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles</span> 
               <br />
               further north. It does not matter which 
               <br />
               line you take, it works out the same 
               <br />
               way, showing there must have been the 
               <br />
               grossest discrimination gainst the southern 
               <br />
               country or else the southern country has 
               <br />
               stood practically still since the 1st May, 
               <br />
               1902. Now the hon. member for Strath- 
               <br />
               cona (Mr. Talbot) says he was not in the 
               <br />
               Legislative Assembly when that division 
               <br />
               was made. Perhaps we will be able to give 
               <br />
               another example of a division which was 
               <br />
               made when hon. members now in this 
               <br />
               House for that country had seats here. Let 
               <br />
               us look at. the country as it is divided up 
               <br />
               for federal purposes. Let us look at the 
               <br />
               constituencies in this House. They are four 
               <br />
               in number: Edmonton, Strathcona, Calgary 
               <br />
               and Alberta. That division was made in 
               <br />
               this House, only a couple of years ago. 
               <br />
               When it was made the hon. gentlemen from 
               <br />
               the Territories at that time were all of 
               <br />
               the one shade of politics. They were all 
               <br />
               supporters of the right hon. the First Minis- 
               <br />
               ter. Surely they would not have made a 
               <br />
               division which would have been unfair to 
               <br />
               any part of the country or have discrimi- 
               <br />
               nated against the interests of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party. That division was made within the 
               <br />
               last two years, and I ﬁnd that south of that.

               <br />

               <br />
               constituency of Strathcona and part of the 
               <br />
               constituency of West Assiniboia. That is 
               <br />
               those two whole constituencies and a con- 
               <br />
               siderable portion of two more only get 
               <br />
               eleven seats under this proposed redistri- 
               <br />
               bution, while the constituency of Edmonton 
               <br />
               and the balance of Strathcona, north of the 
               <br />
               township 38, get thirteen and a fraction. 
               <br />
               When that division was made, it is to be 
               <br />
               presumed that the hon. gentlemen then rep- 
               <br />
               resenting the Territories, and who have a 
               <br />
               seat in this House now, divided the country 
               <br />
               so that every class and interests would have 
               <br />
               equal representation. That is there is given 
               <br />
               to one and a part constituency in this House 
               <br />
               thirteen in the local house, with the ad- 
               <br />
               dition of Athabaska and Peace River, and 
               <br />
               two entire federal ridings and a portion of 
               <br />
               two others are allowed only eleven. There 
               <br />
               is another evidence of gross discrimination 
               <br />
               against the southern country. They have 
               <br />
               turned the scheme of-the Legislative Assem- 
               <br />
               bly of 1902 up side down and have done 
               <br />
               the same with the division made by this 
               <br />
               parliament two years ago. All that need be 
               <br />
               done to see that is to look at the map. 
               <br />
               Take another example. In the constituency 
               <br />
               of Strathcona there were 5,871 votes cast 
               <br />
               last November, and to this constituency is 
               <br />
               given seven and a fraction, or practically 
               <br />
               eight seats. In the constituency of Cal- 
               <br />
               gary, where 5,653 votes were cast, they 
               <br />
               only get ﬁve seats. Is that representation 
               <br />
               according to the vote ? The only justiﬁca- 
               <br />
               tion possible for that division would be to 
               <br />
               show that the inﬂux of population has been 
               <br />
               greatly to the north. I submit they cannot 
               <br />
               snow that because every evidence shows 
               <br />
               that the inﬂux of population has been to 
               <br />
               the south and the greater development has 
               <br />
               been south of township 38. There will be 
               <br />
               in the local house 25 seats. Out of 23 of 
               <br />
               these votes were cast last November, and 
               <br />
               we have a correct tally of those 23, leaving 
               <br />
               out Athabaska and Peace River where no 
               <br />
               votes were cast. If we take the ﬁrst 11

               and taking the 11 next north, it will be

               found that in the 11 south there voted 10,833 
               <br />
               and in the 11 north there only voted 9,356, 
               <br />
               making a diﬁerence of 1,477 discrimination
