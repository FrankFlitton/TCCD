               tleman drew my attention -to that, but I 
               <br />
               think we would get along in this debate 
               <br />
               very much more amicably if there were not 
               <br />
               so many interruptions, because these inter- 
               <br />
               ruptions are apt to be met with rather 
               <br />
               short answers. My reply is that in every 
               <br />
               place in Canada the number of votes per 
               <br />
               constituency either for Dominion or provin- 
               <br />
               cial purposes is necessarily larger than it

               is in the Northwest under present condi- 
               <br />
               tions. Taking the proportion of votes in 
               <br />
               these cities to the total vote of the consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies, the position is exactly the same 
               <br />
               under the peculiar circumstances of the 
               <br />
               west as it is in the rest of the Dominion 
               <br />
               under its circumstances. Let me ask my 
               <br />
               hon. friend if the case of Calgary is par- 
               <br />
