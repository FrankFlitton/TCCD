               I for one, Mr. Speaker. am of opinion

               a mixed population, honourable compromises 
               <br />

               against us ? In 1892, the minority had a

               feeling that they were downtrodden, and 
               <br />
               that they could not get along under the new

               showed that their fears had been exagger-
