               tunity has been taken advantage of by 
               <br />
               .other hon. gentlemen opposite and the ob- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chct.</span> as I conceive it, that these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen have is not to discuss whether 
               <br />
               church and state are being united in the 
               <br />
               Bill before this House or Whether the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of provincial rights is involved; the 
               <br />
               one object it seems to me, not judging un- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charitahly.</span> of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">letter,</span> that manifesto— 
               <br />
               call it what you will—of Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">logers,</span> the 
               <br />
               speeches of the hon. leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               and the bringing it 11p in the House the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sec.</span> 
               <br />
               and time, the speech of the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for South York (Mr. Maclean) were 
               <br />
               not to establish a principle or to declare 
               <br />
               that church and state shall not be united. 
               <br />
               but the object is that these men want to 
               <br />
               inﬂame the passions of the people of this 
               <br />
               country. There is no other object. A high 
               <br />
               object that is for gentlemen sitting in the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada! Upon what state- 
               <br />
               ment has this been brought up——a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement</span> 
               <br />
               by Mr. Rogers. Who is he? The bosom friend 
               <br />
               of hon. gentlemen opposite, is he not? Why 
               <br />
               did he write that letter on the 23rd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'3</span> What 
               <br />
               did the hon. member for Macdonald (Mr. 
               <br />
               Staples) tell us—it was written and he rang 
               <br />
               the bell from room No. (i and it was sent. 
               <br />
               What was he doing in No. 6 ?
