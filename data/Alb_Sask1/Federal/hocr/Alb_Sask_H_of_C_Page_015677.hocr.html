               the information asked for yesterday from 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister with regard to schools. 
               <br />
               He had told us that the number of schools 
               <br />
               in this district, and I asked him to state 
               <br />
               the attendance at those schools, distingu- 
               <br />
               ishing if possible between white, half- 
               <br />
               breed and the Indian pupils. It may not 
               <br />
               be possible to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> information, but I 
               <br />
               think if the attempt had been made in time

               it could have been procured. Some other 
               <br />
               sources of information may be discovered 
               <br />
               between now and Monday. That informa- 
               <br />
               tion is important, as enabling us to come 
               <br />
               to a conclusion as to the population in that 
               <br />
               northern country. Those are all the items 
               <br />
               I think of at the moment. If anything 
               <br />
               should occur to me between now and an 
               <br />

               hon. gentleman a reasonable time to pre- 
               <br />
               pare it, I trust he will permit me to com-

               municate it to him so that we may have

               <br />
               I took it for granted that when the census 
               <br />
               shows the population of the towns of Ed— 
               <br />
               monton and Calgary it means for those 
               <br />
               towns and not for the surrounding country. 
               <br />
               It‘ a part of the surrounding country is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span>

               like to urge the point to which I have just 
               <br />
               called attention. For instance take Pincher 
               <br />
               Creek. In 1901, according to the census it 
               <br />
               had a population of 837. But we are told 
               <br />
               that since then it has very considerably in- 
               <br />
               creased. It seems to me it would be fairer 
               <br />
               to include incorporated villages over say 500. 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite</span> willing to take

               <br />
               it was agreed the other way. Because, with

               us, when a place grows to any size at all, it
