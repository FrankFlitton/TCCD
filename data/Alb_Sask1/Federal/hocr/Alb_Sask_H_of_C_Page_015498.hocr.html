               a rather curious argument. Is it because the

               <br />

               it because the lamb has been shorn of

               to give up the rest? That is a curious 
               <br />
               sort of argument. So far as I am con-

               think ﬁt; and that there 'as to all intents

               <br />
               the Territories a dual system of schools, to 
               <br />
               the same extent and in the same manner 
               <br />
               that that system was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">established</span> in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               pretation of section 11, it follows as a ne- 
               <br />
               cessary corollary. that the distinction be- 
               <br />
               tween clause 16, No. 1 and clause 16. No. 2 
               <br />
               is very evident. It is quite plain to me, 
               <br />
               speaking as a Roman Catholic and a French 
               <br />
               Canadian, that by clause 16. No. 2 we have 
               <br />
               given up something which we certainly 
               <br />
               were'entitled to under the original clause 
               <br />
               ‘16, No. 1 and under the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of 1875. If 
               <br />
               the Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">18723</span> is still law to-day, and I 
               <br />
               believe it is, We are entitled in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories to a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools as a matter of right, not merely 
               <br />
               for the purpose of giving half an hour or 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">srhools.</span> I submit that not only parliament, 
               <br />
               but even any court of justice should give that 
               <br />
               interpretation to the Act of 1875. So far 
               <br />
               as parliament is concerned, I think we have 
               <br />
               something more to do than to give a nar-

               <br />

               <br />
               ber of this House to inquire and ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               for himself what was the intention of par- 
               <br />
               liament at that time—to look at the extra- 
               <br />
               neous and surrounding circumstances in 
               <br />
               order to determine what that intention was 
               <br />
               and what the interpretation should be. I 
               <br />
               do not think it should be circumscribed or 
               <br />
               narrowed down to the circumstances which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cnist</span> to-day; but we should go back to the 
               <br />
               Circumstances as they existed at the time 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 was passed and interpret 
               <br />
               the law accordingly.

               What I said was that the majority whether

               <br />
               if you had a thousand Catholics and ﬁve

               hon. friend said distinctly yes. He would
