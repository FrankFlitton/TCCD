               Bill what it Should be. In a word, this

               is a question of provincial autonomy in the 
               <br />

               will carry out the well recognized prin-

               ciple that the various provinces should—-

               <br />
               plored that the leader of the opposition

               had not laid down a policy, and had not 
               <br />
               discussed the question whether <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~separate</span> 
               <br />
               schools were good or bad per se. Since 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition introduced this

               Sir, the statesmanship of the leader of the

               and the wise policy is to leave to these 
               <br />
               provinces the management of their own 
               <br />
               affairs. The ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               has told us that the people of the west are 
               <br />
               as capable of managing their own affairs 
               <br />
               as are any people in the world, and we 
               <br />
               can quite believe it. Are you going to let 
               <br />
               this splendid people come in as equal 
               <br />
               partners in the confederation, or are you 
               <br />
               going to declare, that they shall be man— 
               <br />
               acled and throttled at the beginning of their 
               <br />
               career ? What subtle inﬂuence is it which 
               <br />
               causes the government to say, that the new 
               <br />
               provinces shall have forced upon them 
               <br />
               onerous conditions from which the other 
               <br />
               provinces are free? In the last few days 
               <br />
               there has come to our knowledge certain 
               <br />
               things which cast a new light upon this 
               <br />
               discussion. Yesterday we had an interest- 
               <br />
               ing discussion upon certain matters that 
               <br />
               had arisen in connection with the exten-
