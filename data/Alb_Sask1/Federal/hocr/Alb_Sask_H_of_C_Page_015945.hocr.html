               to impose restraints on the action of the

               control of religious education in the hands 
               <br />
               of the trustees. My construction of the Bill 
               <br />
               —I am not dealing with it otherwise than 
               <br />
               as I construe it—is that which is placed

               upon it by the leader of the government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Sir</span> \Vilfrid Laurier). Secular education, 
               <br />
               for which the state pays, is under control 
               <br />
               of the statute; but religious education, 
               <br />
               which is essentially that which concerns 
               <br />
               the parents themselves, remains under the 
               <br />
               control of the parents. The trustee is the 
               <br />
               representative of the parent, for he is elected 
               <br />
               by the parent. I take all the responsibility 
               <br />
               for saying that I have no desire to see the 
               <br />
               control of religious education vested in any 
               <br />
               other person or authority than the parent. 
               <br />
               I have no desire to see it vested in the 
               <br />
               superintendent of education or any person 
               <br />
               who is under the control of the state. I 
               <br />
               Wish to see it vested in the person elected 
               <br />
               as representative of the parent. That is 
               <br />
               what I think my hon. friend’s amendment 
               <br />
               carries out, and that. I think, we ought to

               )Ir. BOURASSA. There is a point which 
               <br />
               is not very clear and which I would like 
               <br />
               to have explained, if the minister will al- 
               <br />
               low me a question. Under clause 137, the 
               <br />
               minister has just stated, the trustees would 
               <br />
               decide what kind of religious instruction 
               <br />
               would be given. It is perfectly clear so 
               <br />
               far as that is concerned. But suppose a 
               <br />
               school section in which the majority is not 
               <br />
               Protestant or Roman Catholic say. for in- 
               <br />
               stance, of the Greek Orthodox church. And 
               <br />
               suppose they decided to devote the half 
               <br />
               hour for religious instruction to instruction 
               <br />
               according to that church. Then, I suppose 
               <br />
               the minority would either have to simply 
               <br />
               prevent their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">children</span> from attending the 
               <br />
               school during that half hour of religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> 
               <br />
               struction or form a separate school. In 
               <br />
               that case, which would be the minority to 
               <br />
               have the right to form a separate school

               In case the majority is neither Protestant

               Minister of Justice. We know that a pro-

               vince has an absolute right to legislate with 
               <br />
               respect to education. I ask this question: 
               <br />
               What legislative authority outside of the 
               <br />
               legislative assembly of the province of New 
               <br />

               <br />
               province in respect to education ? No legis- 
               <br />
               lative authority whatever; Sir, except the 
               <br />
               assembly of the province of New Bruns- 
               <br />

               <br />

               certain rights to the minority, and next
