               for in section 15. Probably the answer which 
               <br />
               will be made by the draughtsman is that the 
               <br />
               statutes are repealed but their provisions 
               <br />
               are continued in force by reference and that 
               <br />
               those provisions so continued in force by re- 
               <br />
               ference are to be dealt with afterwards un- 
               <br />
               der the provisions of section 15 by either 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada or by the- legis-

               isdiction of either the one legislative body

               words in section 15 which constitute a con-

               west Territories Act’ are repealed by my 
               <br />
               amended clause. The history of the legis- 
               <br />
               lation is that the original section 15 in that 
               <br />
               brief form was drafted by myself. When 
               <br />
               this clause came up for further considera-_ 
               <br />
               tion it was necessary to amplify the original 
               <br />
               clause to some extent, and hence clause 15 
               <br />
               in the form which my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk) has it in his possession. That clause 
               <br />
               was drawn in anticipation of a brief repeal- 
               <br />
               ing section such as you have it in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ori‘</span>

               repeal of the Northwest Territories Act. 
               <br />

               would seem to me to be preserved. There 
               <br />
               is no clause in the Alberta Act under consi— 
               <br />
               deration which provides any special <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub«</span> 
               <br />
               stitnte for that, nor is it inconsistent with 
               <br />
               any of the clauses of the Alberta Act, as I 
               <br />
               understand them. It would remain in the 
               <br />
               law, and I would venture the opinion that 
               <br />
               it would remain there very probably, sub- 
               <br />
               ject to repeal by the local legislature as 
               <br />
               being a local matter within the province.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. If section 110 is 
               <br />

               the law as they will have it in the province

               after this constitutional Act is passed. Then 
               <br />
               of course, it would become subject to the

               <br />
               be a matter to be dealt with by them ; and 
               <br />
               I say emphatically. Mr. Chairman, that is 
               <br />
               my intention. That is, the matter as I
