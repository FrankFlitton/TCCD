               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> government will in future regret it. 
               <br />
               I say that no portion of the people of these 
               <br />
               two new provinces have any right to ask 
               <br />
               this parliament, in framing a constitution 
               <br />
               for the provinces, to provide that there 
               <br />
               shall be only public or national schools; 
               <br />
               nor have the Roman Catholics the right to 
               <br />
               ask that this parliament shall enact that 
               <br />
               they shall have the right to separate schools. 
               <br />
               And Why? Because the constitution does 
               <br />
               not give that right to either class of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Deeple.</span> And while the people have no 
               <br />
               right to make that demand on this 
               <br />
               parliament, this parliament is bound by 
               <br />
               the very same principle, and what the 
               <br />
               people have no right to demand from parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, this parliament has no right to in- 
               <br />
               ﬂict upon them. I argue from that, that 
               <br />
               this legislation is not only an infraction of 
               <br />
               the constitutional rights secured to the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> of these provinces, but it is placing 
               <br />
               an obligation upon this parliament which 
               <br />
               it ought not to assume. Another reason 
               <br />
               why this government should not be asked 
               <br />
               to initiate legislation on this subject is, 
               <br />
               that it would be perfectly just and com- 
               <br />
               petent for them to say: we may have to 
               <br />
               sit in appeal upon whatever legislation may 
               <br />
               be enacted in these new provinces, and 
               <br />
               therefore it would not be fair for us to ex- 
               <br />
               press our opinion in legislation beforehand. 
               <br />
               If these Bills are passed the government 
               <br />
               cannot take that position, and that shows 
               <br />
               again that the right of appeal has been 
               <br />
               taken away or interfered with by this legis- 
               <br />
               lation. After all, the question is not whe- 
               <br />
               ther these provinces shall or shall not have 
               <br />
               separate schools; the question is: shall 
               <br />
               this parliament interfere with the educa- 
               <br />
               tional rights of the provinces. I concur in 
               <br />
               the opinion expressed by my honoured 
               <br />
               leader; I venture to think that the sub— 
               <br />
               sequent legislation has in no manner 
               <br />
               changed the position which I have argued 
               <br />
               prevails under the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. Take the Manitoba Act of 1870 or the 
               <br />
               conﬁrmatory Act of 1871. It may be 
               <br />
               observed that that legislation was passed 
               <br />
               under very exceptional circumstances. It 
               <br />
               was passed owing to conditions prevailing 
               <br />
               in that province at that time, and I might 
               <br />
               say passed by agreement between the 
               <br />
               people of Manitoba and this government. 
               <br />
               Now, no such conditions as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed</span> in that 
               <br />
               province exist in regard to these two new 
               <br />
               provinces. The right hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               government, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introducing</span> these Bills, 
               <br />
               did not see ﬁt to shelter himself behind the 
               <br />
               legislation of 1870 or 1871; and perhaps I 
               <br />
               need not trouble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> that more than to 
               <br />
               say that the Imperial Act of 1871 appears to 
               <br />
               give unlimited power to this parliament to 
               <br />
               frame a constitution for a new province; 
               <br />
               but while that appears to be the effect of 
               <br />
               that Act, the British North America Act was 
               <br />
               in full force at that time. Now, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬁrma»</span> 
               <br />
               tory Act of 1871 makes no reference what-

               ever to the British North America Act and 
               <br />
               it cannot be contended that there was any

               Acts are both of equal force, we have the

               British North America Act which says you 
               <br />

               you may give these rights or not as you

               please. Granted that they are both of

               equal force, what is the fair position that

               this parliament should take '2 To carry out 
               <br />
               the guarantee which these people had under 
               <br />
               the constitution, or to take advantage of the 
               <br />
               permissive right which the statute of 1871 
               <br />
               gives them ? In the constitution it is obli- 
               <br />
               gatory ; in the Act of 1871 it is only permis- 
               <br />
               sive; and for this reason I argue that the 
               <br />
               fair course to be taken by this parliament 
               <br />
               would be to say we will observe the obliga—

               tion which we have entered into with you 
               <br />

               right We have of denying you your full 
               <br />
               right of provincial government. Now, when 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 was passed. the Act of 1871 
               <br />
               was in full force ; but we do not ﬁnd in that 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 any reference whatever to the 
               <br />
               Act of 1871; so that that Act of 1875 could 
               <br />
               not have been based upon the right that was 
               <br />
               conferred by the Imperial Act of 1871. Such 
               <br />
               being the case, I conclude that the statute 
               <br />
               of 1875 offers no Warrant whatever for leg-
