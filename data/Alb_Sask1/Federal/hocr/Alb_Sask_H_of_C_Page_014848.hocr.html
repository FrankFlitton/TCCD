               in which there is nothing, and that is prac~ 
               <br />
               tically what is being done in a very great 
               <br />
               part of the discussion that has taken place 
               <br />
               in this debate. They have gone far from 
               <br />
               the question before the House. they have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> up a great deal of valuable time, both 
               <br />
               of the House and of the country. I should 
               <br />
               like to tell the people of Canada that We 
               <br />
               are squandering their money here to-day 
               <br />
               by thousands. almost by hundreds of 
               <br />
               thousands, in continuing this debate. Yet 
               <br />
               every member has decided weeks ago the 
               <br />
               position he will take on this Bill. Members 
               <br />
               opposite know their position as well as we 
               <br />
               do, but they are continuing this debate 
               <br />
               day after day simply for the purpose of 
               <br />
               having their words printed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Hansartl’</span> 
               <br />
               to spread over this country, not for any 
               <br />
               good or any beneﬁt which it will do to this 
               <br />
               country. I do not intend to go into the 
               <br />
               legal aspects of this question. I have listen- 
               <br />
               ed with a great deal of interest to the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion from day to day, and I have come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that even those whose 
               <br />
               minds have been educated along legal lines 
               <br />
               have failed to come to any ﬁxed opinion as 
               <br />
               to what our powers really are in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with the matter now before us. I 
               <br />
               might, as others have done, quote the 
               <br />
               opinions of eminent men, the opinions of 
               <br />
               Hon. Edward Blake, Hon. George Brown, 
               <br />

               <br />
               Macdonald, and a great many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others</span> The 
               <br />
               last opinion which I have noticed is that of 
               <br />
               Mr. Christopher Robinson. and if hon. mem-
