               But the proposition of the government is 
               <br />
               very different. It is that we are absolutely 
               <br />
               the master. I pressed my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice one evening, when we 
               <br />
               were providing for a new distribution of 
               <br />
               seats after ﬁve years, on that point. I 
               <br />
               called his attention to the fact that by that 
               <br />
               provision we were violating the law as con- 
               <br />
               tained in the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               which provided that a distribution could 
               <br />
               only take place after the decennial census, 
               <br />
               and my hon. friend explained that we were 
               <br />
               not bound by that very clear provision of 
               <br />
               the Confederation Act. In support of that 
               <br />
               View he pointed to- the closing clause of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act amendment of 
               <br />
               1886. But we need not go so far as that. 
               <br />
               The British North America Act provides 
               <br />
               expressly that Crown Land's vest in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince, and we are legislating absolutely in 
               <br />
               an opposite sense. We are keeping the 
               <br />
               Grown lands by virtue of a formal clause 
               <br />
               in this Bill. On another occasion I asked 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Minister of Inland Rev- 
               <br />
               enue if he went so far as to say that we 
               <br />
               could reserve to ourselves exclusive juris- 
               <br />
               diction on the subject of agriculture, which 
               <br />
               is one of those assigned to the provinces 
               <br />
               under the British 'North America Act. He 
               <br />
               said that we could. Then my hon. friend, 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition. asked if we 
               <br />
               could keep under our jurisdiction the im- 
               <br />
               portant subject of property and civil rights, 
               <br />
               and he said we could undoubtedly. I asked 
               <br />
               him if clause 93 of the British North Am- 
               <br />

               it. I have, therefore, good ground for say—

               the government we are not bound by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               late with absolute power on all subjects 
               <br />
               mentioned in that Act, and there is no such

               theory as the application automatically of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act to any new 
               <br />
               provinces we may create. I explained my 
               <br />
               view at that time, and my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Hamilton (Mr. Barker) went a great deal 
               <br />
               more fully into that point. Section 2 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               which is rather a long section to quote, 
               <br />
               according to our interpretation, merely gave 
               <br />
               us the power to provide the necessary ma- 
               <br />
               chinery for the creation of a province, but 
               <br />
               once the province was created, it became 
               <br />
               subject to the British North America Act.

               As to what Mr. Haultain said, I have 
               <br />
               not here the papers which contain all the 
               <br />
               documents connected with the negotiations 
               <br />
               between the government of the Territories 
               <br />
               and the government here regarding the crea- 
               <br />
               tion of these two provinces, but hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen will ﬁnd, by reference to those docu- 
               <br />
               ments, that Mr. Hanltain’s view was shown 
               <br />
               by his draft Bill and expressed throughout 
               <br />
               all his comments upon it, and it is that the 
               <br />
               British North America Act should apply, 
               <br />
               and consequently section 93 should apply. 
               <br />
               This is precisely what my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) asked for in his 
               <br />
               amendment; and I stated under my view of 
               <br />
               our powers, that I thought that was the 
               <br />
               best perfection we could have. But I stated 
               <br />
               that it would be necessary probably to 
               <br />
               modify the words of Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hiaultain’s</span> draft 
               <br />
               Bill. I had not that Bill before me at the 
               <br />
               moment. But the principle was admitted 
               <br />
               that section 93 was to be applied, and I 
               <br />
               thought that was all the protecion which 
               <br />
               the minority could claim in any newly- 
               <br />
               organized province. The Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice and other hon. gentlemen on that 
               <br />
               side representing the "government, con- 
               <br />
               tended that our powers are far more ex— 
               <br />
               tensive. Then we had clause 16 as at ﬁrst 
               <br />
               brought down. Well. that clause provided 
               <br />
               for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> application of section 93, and in ap- 
               <br />
               plying that section we always ﬁnd the dif-
