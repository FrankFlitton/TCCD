               The letter of the constitution was depart- 
               <br />
               ed from as to the subject of language in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, and was made suit-

               able to the local conditions, needs and in— 
               <br />
               terests of that province. Yet if the letter 
               <br />
               of the law is to be regarded, you have no 
               <br />
               justiﬁcation for this departure from the con- 
               <br />
               stitution which is to be found in the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. Take the subject of 
               <br />
               education. At the time of confederation it 
               <br />
               was found that the minority in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec had separate schools. the British 
               <br />
               North America Act preserved- separate 
               <br />
               schools to them; it was found that there 
               <br />
               were separate schools in Ontario, and the 
               <br />
               British North America Act retained separ— 
               <br />
               ate schools in Ontario; there were no sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools in Nova Scotia, and the status 
               <br />
               quo was recognized there; there were no 
               <br />
               separate schools in New Brunswick, the 
               <br />
               status quo was recognized there. But al- 
               <br />
               though the British North America Act in its 
               <br />
               general scheme declared that the subject of 
               <br />
               education should be under the exclusive 
               <br />
               jurisdiction of the provinces, it made two 
               <br />
               exceptions in the case of Ontario and Que- 
               <br />
               bec, as my hon. friend admits <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> and 
               <br />
               that exception extends to other provinces as 
               <br />
               well. Yet, if you were to adopt the strict 
               <br />
               letter of the law, you have no right in a 
               <br />
               constitution resting on the bed rock of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act to make these 
               <br />
               exceptions in the constitution of any prov— 
               <br />
               ince. Take the subject of ﬁnance. Although 
               <br />
               this is not strictly a constitutional subject, 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that whilst the general scheme 
               <br />
               is to treat all the provinces alike ﬁnancially, 
               <br />
               in the case of Prince Edward Island there 
               <br />
               was a material departure made from the 
               <br />
               general scheme of finance. In fact, you do 
               <br />
               not ﬁnd the same corresponding ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               arrangements made in any two provinces. 
               <br />
               In fact, there are just two ways of looking 
               <br />
               at the British North America Act; you may 
               <br />
               look at it from the standpoint of a lawyer, 
               <br />
               or you may look at it from the standpoint 
               <br />
               of a statesman. It‘ you look at it from the 
               <br />
               standpoint of a lawyer—and I submit that 
               <br />
               is the standpoint of the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion—you take the letter of the constitution 
               <br />
               without regard to its bearings and its ap- 
               <br />
               plication to the time being, and apply it 
               <br />
               literally, whether the application tits the 
               <br />
               time and occasion or not. But taking the 
               <br />
               spirit of the Act on each occasion of creat- 
               <br />
               ing a new province, you adopt the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion. as far as possible, to the new province, 
               <br />
               having due regard to the conditions then 
               <br />
               prevailing.

               Take the case of Manitoba to which my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has referred. The province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba was established in 1870, prior to 
               <br />
               that it had been under the jurisdiction of 
               <br />
               the Hudson Bay Company. There were no 
               <br />
               laws there except the old common law of 
               <br />
               England. There were no schools establish- 
               <br />
               ed by law, but it was thought that there 
               <br />
               were some schools established by practice,

               <br />
               the words ‘by law’ would have afforded no

               those who were engaged in framing this

               <br />
               ture <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘1</span> How do we account for that depar- 
               <br />
               ture? Simply because the strict letter of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act would not 
               <br />
               have met the case of Manitoba, and it was 
               <br />
               necessary to apply it in spirit, and in that 
               <br />
               way the legislators of those days felt jus-

               ing section 93. Now, what happened after 
               <br />
               that? Manitoba was carved out of Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land, the Territories we are about to raise 
               <br />
               into provinces are part of the remainder of 
               <br />
               Rupert‘s Land. The Manitoba Act was 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬁrmed</span> by imperial legislation, and that

               the Act creating the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
