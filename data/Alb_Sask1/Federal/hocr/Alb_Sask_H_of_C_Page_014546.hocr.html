               duties of this Papal delegate? We were 
               <br />
               told that his duties were to settle differ- 
               <br />
               ences between the Roman Catholic people 
               <br />

               himself to those duties we have no com- 
               <br />
               plaint to make. It is a fact well known in 
               <br />
               this country that in 1896 there was a differ- 
               <br />
               ence between the present Reform party, or 
               <br />
               at least one portion of that party, the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic element of the party, and 
               <br />
               the bishops in regard to the school question 
               <br />
               and it was said that the Papal delegate was 
               <br />
               brought here for the purpose of settling that 
               <br />
               diﬂiculty. So long as he attempted to set- 
               <br />
               tle that diﬂicnlty you heard no complaint 
               <br />
               from any Protestant in this country as to 
               <br />
               What he was doing and no complaint that 
               <br />
               he was here. But, is he conﬁning himself 
               <br />
               to the interests of the church ? The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Labelle says that he has a per- 
               <br />
               fect right in the interests of his church and 
               <br />
               of his co-religionists to take part in anything 
               <br />
               which is going on and in which that church 
               <br />
               is directly interested. In my judgment he 
               <br />
               has no right to go the distance that it is 
               <br />
               alleged he has gone. Now. it is said some- 
               <br />
               times. and I think correctly said, that eter- 
               <br />
               nal vigilance is the price of liberty.

               The history of the ages has taught that 
               <br />
               lesson over and over again, and the maxim is 
               <br />
               as true <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> as when it was ﬁrst an-

               nounced. The complete separation of church 
               <br />
               and state is another principle recognized in 
               <br />

               <br />

               tutional government, and we are trying to 
               <br />
               live up to it and we desire to carry it out to 
               <br />

               distributed them for‘ the beneﬁt of the 
               <br />
               state we asserted that principle because 
               <br />
               we desired there should be no sem-

               blance of connection between church 
               <br />
               and state. We declared that every church 
               <br />
               should stand on its own footing and we have 
               <br />
               lived up .to that according to the best of our 
               <br />
               judgment. But as I said, eternal vigilance 
               <br />
               is the price of liberty, and when we see any

               encroachment on that principle we are bound

               our constitutional rights and in the interest 
               <br />

               they would not agree to that and the Bill

               <br />
               could not be done. and he did not deign the
