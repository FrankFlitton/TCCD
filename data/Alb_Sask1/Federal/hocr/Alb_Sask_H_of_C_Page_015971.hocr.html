               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. Well, the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman will have to be content with his own 
               <br />
               opinion. It seems to me to be absolutely 
               <br />
               clear that we had the right to make that 
               <br />
               contract in 1881. It became a contract bind- 
               <br />
               ing upon the Crown in the right of the peo— 
               <br />
               ple of Canada and that binds the Dominion 
               <br />
               and the provinces after the Territories have 
               <br />
               been created into provinces. On the very 
               <br />
               lowest position that can be taken it is proper 
               <br />
               to insert in his Bill a notice to the provinces 
               <br />
               of the contract so entered into by the CrOWn 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ratiﬁed</span> by parliament at a time when parlia- 
               <br />
               ment had power so to legislate. I do not 
               <br />
               want to take up the time of the House, be— 
               <br />
               cause this is a matter between the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber for Western Assiniboia, the right <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> 
               <br />
               i'rime Minister and the Minister of Justice. 
               <br />
               1 am not responsible for section 23. I 
               <br />
               think it is right to give notice to these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, but after all the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               is responsible for this measure as he is re- 
               <br />
               sponsible for a similar chime in the Bill in 
               <br />
               regard to the Hudson Bay Company. I 
               <br />
               have stated my view as to what should be 
               <br />
               done. The contract should be observed. 
               <br />
               There should be no expropriation without 
               <br />
               compensation. I think upon that we can all 
               <br />
               agree. It seems to me, as I have stated 
               <br />
               over and over again, that the right 
               <br />
               of the Dominion to legislate and the 
               <br />
               right of the provinces to legislate within 
               <br />
               their respective spheres of jurisdiction con- 
               <br />
               tinue subject to the contract in both cases. 
               <br />
               I might, in conclusion. refer the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for West Assiuiboia (Mr. Scott) to some 
               <br />
               language of his upon a motion in regard to 
               <br />
               this same tax exemption which was intro- 
               <br />
               duced in 190]. The hon. gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then.</span>

               said:
