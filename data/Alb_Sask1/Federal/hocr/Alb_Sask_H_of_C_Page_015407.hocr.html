               during this debate has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expressed</span> his ap- 
               <br />
               prehension that if these lands were handed

               over to the control and administration of 
               <br />
               the provinces we might expect maladminis-

               gestion should be repudiated by every hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               every hon. gentleman from the Northwest

               Territories. I think these people are as 
               <br />
               fully alive to their rights, as fully alive 
               <br />
               to the necessity of utilizing the public do— 
               <br />
               main in the public interest as the people of 
               <br />
               any part of Canada. The brief observation 
               <br />
               of the conditions in that country which I 
               <br />
               was enabled to make some two and a half 
               <br />
               years ago and my knowledge derived from 
               <br />
               some acquaintance with the public affairs 
               <br />
               of this country in connection with the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, would lead me to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that they are at least equally 
               <br />
               alive to the value of the public domain as 
               <br />
               are the people of the rest of Canada and 
               <br />
               certainly we might expect that the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories would be at 
               <br />
               least as much alive to the value of their 
               <br />
               own domain to themselves as the people of 
               <br />
               the whole of Canada would be alive to the 
               <br />
               value of that domain to the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. We are referred to 
               <br />
               the example of the United States. Well, if 
               <br />
               we are to look to the example <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ot</span> the United

               look to the example of the United States 
               <br />

               think that the administration of public lands

               <br />
               scandals. For these reasons it seems to 
               <br />
               me, Mr. Chairman, that the grounds ad- 
               <br />
               vanced by the Prime Minister to the House 
               <br />
               in support of this policy are not well found- 
               <br />
               ed, and that it would be in the interest of 
               <br />
               the people in the provinces, in the interest 
               <br />
               of the people of Canada as a whole, to en- 
               <br />
               trust the administration of those lands to 
               <br />
               the people of the provinces, and in doing that 
               <br />
               we would be doing exactly that which the

               British government has done so far as the 
               <br />

               gone over already in the House since the 
               <br />
               Bill came up, and I do not know that any-

               <br />
               casion. The contention as I understand it 
               <br />
               is that the province is the better authority 
               <br />
               for the administration of the land. That 
               <br />
               contention has already been placed before 
               <br />
               the House and in opposition to it has been 
               <br />
               placed the contention that the Dominion is 
               <br />
               the better authority for controlling these 
               <br />
               lands. There is no question involved as to 
               <br />
               the respective business ability of the people 
               <br />
               of the Territories and of the Dominion. 
               <br />
               There is no question as to the respective 
               <br />
               honesty of administration on the part of the
