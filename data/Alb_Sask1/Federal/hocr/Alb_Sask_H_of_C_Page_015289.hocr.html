               introduced as part of a political arrange-

               ment, and in adding that if the government 
               <br />
               had carried out their policy of years ago, 
               <br />
               namely, that matters of this kind should 
               <br />
               be left to a commission of judges, then 
               <br />
               instead of having a party political piece 
               <br />
               of legislation, there would be no necessity 
               <br />
               for putting this line where it is? That is 
               <br />
               the comparison I made in discussing sec- 
               <br />
               tion 1, and in that I am quite within my 
               <br />
               rights. All these questions being involved 
               <br />
               in this section No. 1. it is a very serious 
               <br />
               thing to the people of the Territories and 
               <br />
               to the members of this House representing 
               <br />
               the Conservative party in the Northwest, 
               <br />
               where these two provincial governments 
               <br />
               will be. and it is a serious matter to men 
               <br />
               l1ke my hon. friend from Alberta, who 
               <br />
               are vitally interested in the matter of rais- 
               <br />
               ing stock and ranching. Then it is of 
               <br />
               vital consequence to people who have these 
               <br />
               15.000 brands to deal with. I would like 
               <br />
               to know how are the two governments go- 
               <br />
               ing to arrange their branding laws so that 
               <br />
               they will be satisfactory to both provinces. 
               <br />
               Will there not be a great deal of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span> 
               <br />
               in that matter under those circumstances ? 
               <br />
               Is it not true that the cattle interest, to 
               <br />
               which the question of branding is so im- 
               <br />
               portant will be but a minor industry in the 
               <br />
               province of Saskatchewan. and will there 
               <br />
               not be difﬁculty, therefore. in these people 
               <br />
               getting laws they wish and ought to have. 
               <br />
               So, our action is of very great importance 
               <br />
               to the people of the Northwest. and we 
               <br />
               should give it the most serious considera- 
               <br />

               Let me call attention also to the fact that 
               <br />
               ministers of the Crown seem to act as though 
               <br />

               <br />

               these circumstances. what does the Prime

               legislation will slip all the more easily for 
               <br />
               that reason ? I think he will have to under-

               one province. and still continue to do so.

               possession of its public lands, I feel that I

               Mr. W. F. MAC-LEAN. I introduced that 
               <br />
               amendment to bring out a discussion of the 
               <br />
               question and I think we have had a con- 
               <br />
               siderable amount of light thrown upon it. 
               <br />
               I am altogether in favour of a single pro- 
               <br />
               vince rather than too small a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province.</span> I 
               <br />
               think a great mistake was made when Mani- 
               <br />
               toba was established as a small province. 
               <br />
               And a greater mistake is made in not en- 
               <br />
               larging her boundaries now. Manitoba is 
               <br />
               entitled to larger boundaries. But we have 
               <br />
               been told recently why she is not given 
               <br />
               them. We have been told on the ﬂoor of 
               <br />
               this House that she has been punished be- 
               <br />
               cause of her school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation.</span> We know 
               <br />
               that the maritime provinces would probably 
               <br />
               be better off with one strong provincial gov- 
               <br />
               ernment than with the three they have to- 
               <br />
               day. And it is clear that if the provinces 
               <br />
               in the west have not their Crown lands, as 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman pointed out, it will be 
               <br />
