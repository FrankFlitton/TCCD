               the imperial authorities. In 1875, the Act 
               <br />
               organizing the Northwest Territories was 
               <br />
               passed; but you will notice that in that

               Act, there is not a line concerning the use 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Territories or in the courts. It was only 
               <br />
               in 1877, in a Bill introduced by the late 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Mills, and moved in the Senate 
               <br />

               At that time there was a comparatively 
               <br />
               large French Canadian element in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. That Act passed the House 
               <br />
               of Commons and became the law of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, and remained so until 
               <br />
               1890. The House is aware of the agitation 
               <br />
               which took place as a result of the cam- 
               <br />
               paign led by the late Mr. Dalton McCarthy. 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy advocated the abolition of the 
               <br />
               separate schools system, and the abolition 
               <br />
               of the French language in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories and in the Manitoba legislature. 
               <br />
               The older members of this House are con- 
               <br />
               versant with the Bill which was introduced 
               <br />
               during the memorable session of 1890 by 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy. In the preamble of 
               <br />
               that Bill Mr. McCarthy declared that it was 
               <br />
               essential to the welfare of the country that 
               <br />
               there should be one language only; but the 
               <br />
               enacting clause only proposed to abolish the 
               <br />
               use of the French language in the Northwest 
               <br />
               assembly. I may say that a few months or 
               <br />
               perhaps a year before, the Northwest as- 
               <br />
               sembly had practically unanimously decided 
               <br />
               to expunge the French language from its 
               <br />
               records and its deliberations. The Bill of 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy was of a very radical nature, 
               <br />
               . especially the preamble, which conveyed the 
               <br />
               idea that if it were passed by the House of 
               <br />
               Commons of Canada, it meant that not only 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories the French 
               <br />
               language be abolished, but that it would be 
               <br />
               the signal of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">campaign</span> against the use of 
               <br />
               that language in this parliament and even 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. In fact, Mr. Mc- 
               <br />
               Carthy and several other gentlemen made a 
               <br />
               very bitter campaign against the separate 
               <br />
               school system and the dual language. What 
               <br />
               happened then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> The Bill was introduced in

               I may say that only one French Canadian 
               <br />
               member voted against Mr. Beausoleil’s sub- 
               <br />
               amendment ; that was the late Sir Adolphe 
               <br />
               Chapleau, then Secretary of State. The 
               <br />
               debate went on and Sir John Macdonald 
               <br />
               delivered probably the most remarkable 
               <br />
               speech of the latter part of his career.

               He appealed to the leader of the opposi-
