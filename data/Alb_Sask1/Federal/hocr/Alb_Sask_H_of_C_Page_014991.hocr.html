               more noise and wind than anything else. 
               <br />

               <br />
               nor do I think that there is so much at 
               <br />
               the bottom of it as some have thought. 
               <br />
               There are not so many sounding the big 
               <br />
               trombone in Toronto as they would have 
               <br />
               us believe. It reminds me of a story which 
               <br />
               I heard of a commercial gentleman who 
               <br />
               came from the city of New York to a rural 
               <br />
               section where there was a large pond. The 
               <br />
               New Yorker wanted to buy a large number 
               <br />
               of frogs and he went to a farmer and said : 
               <br />
               I want to contract with you for 1,000 frogs. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Yes, the farmer said, I will undertake to 
               <br />
               supply them. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The terms were agreed upon and the next 
               <br />
               day the buyer came back and said: Where 
               <br />
               are my frogs ? 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The farmer replied: Well, Sir, to tell you 
               <br />
               the truth I have just ﬁve frogs. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               But, I thought you were to deliver the 
               <br />

               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The farmer answered: Well now, to tell 
               <br />
               you the truth, when I heard the immense 
               <br />
               amount of noise these frogs made I certainly 
               <br />
               thought there must be 10,000 of them, but 
               <br />
               when I came to catch them, all I could 
               <br />
               really ﬁnd, was ﬁve. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I think when this matter comes to

               <br />
               are not the thousands of people in Toronto 
               <br />

               on the 5th day of this month when the elec-

               trical currents were surcharged and were

               I do not want to be sent to that kind of a 
               <br />
               paradise. Just at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clpse</span> of that article 
               <br />
               the ‘Globe’ advised us to consult our con- 
               <br />
               stituents and the country at large. I thor- 
               <br />
               oughly endorse that advice. They say that 
               <br />
               great minds think alike, and the right hon. 
               <br />
               the First Minister evidently took the same 
               <br />
               view. The result was that he opened the 
               <br />
               constituenCy of Edmonton just to see what 
               <br />
               the people really did think, and the moment 
               <br />
               the telegraph wires carried the glad news 
               <br />
               to that district that there was to be an elec- 
               <br />
               tion and that Mr. Oliver was to be the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment candidate and Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, what happened? Did the thousand 
               <br />
               and one opponents jump up there like a 
               <br />
               Hydra’s—head antagonist ‘2 Not at all. On 
               <br />
               the contrary there was not the slightest op— 
               <br />
               position. The people out there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said;</span> This 
               <br />
               is the man we want. In every corner of 
               <br />
               that constituency meetings were held, and 
               <br />
               both Tories and Reformer-s agreed that Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver was the man for Galway. The result 
               <br />
               was that he was elected by acclamation. 
               <br />
               Surely this is one of the constituencies chief- 
               <br />
               ly interested; and if that is not good evi- 
               <br />
               dence that the country is with us, I do not 
               <br />
               know what better we could have.
