               <br />
               try could be ventilated, and so that the pe-

               culiar wants and requirements of the com- 
               <br />
               munity could be made known. To my mind 
               <br />
               these things apply equally well at the pres- 
               <br />
               ent day as in former times. The concession 
               <br />
               has been made by the opposition during this 
               <br />
               discussion that Athabaska should get at 
               <br />
               least one member. When the debate com- 
               <br />
               menced four days ago, gentlemen opposite 
               <br />
               contended that Athabaska should not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> 
               <br />
               a representative, but that the boundaries of 
               <br />
               St. Albert <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and.</span> Sturgeon should be extended 
               <br />
               north to the limits of Athabaska and Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie, and that Athabaska should be in- 
               <br />
               cluded in these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituencies.</span> That was the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst proposition made by gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               other side. They have evidently now come 
               <br />
               to the conclusion that this would not be fair 
               <br />
               to the people now in Athabaska as well as 
               <br />
               to people who are going into that Territory, 
               <br />
               and who have their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oxvn</span> interests and their 
               <br />
               own requirements, and whose voice should 
               <br />
               be heard in the legislature of the province. 
               <br />
               The point now is whether Athabaska should 
               <br />
               have one member or two. If we look at the 
               <br />
               population alone I grant that one member 
               <br />
               ought to be enough, but if you look at the 
               <br />
               peculiarities of the geographical conditions, 
               <br />
               I leave it to the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               himself and to his friends behind him to 
               <br />
               say whether or not it is fair that you should 
               <br />
               have only a single <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> for that 
               <br />
               immense territory in which there are at 
               <br />
               present no lines of communication, in which 
               <br />
               the settlements are centred upon the Peace 
               <br />
               and the Athabaska rivers, and between 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">too</span> rivers so far as I know there is 
               <br />
               no direct communication. Under such cir- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rumstances</span> I ask if it would be reasonable 
               <br />
               to give only one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representativeto</span> the dis— 
               <br />
               trict of Athabaska. I do not pronounce 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">categorically</span> on the question; I am willing 
               <br />
               to listen to argument, but again I repeat 
               <br />
               that unless I am greatly mistaken no one 
               <br />
               would begrudge two members to the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska, but for the fact that the 
               <br />
               capital has to be selected and the gentlemen 
               <br />
               from Calgary seem to think that if Atha- 
               <br />
               baska is given two representatives instead 
               <br />
               of one, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Calgary</span> has no chance of being the 
               <br />
               capital. My hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               suggests <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> that we should adopt another 
               <br />
               method of division and take as a basis the 
               <br />
               four federal electoral districts of Calgary, 
               <br />
               Alberta, Saskatchewan and Strathcona, giv- 
               <br />
               ing six members to one, and three members 
               <br />
               to another, and ﬁve members to another. 
               <br />
               Why not give six members to the other in- 
               <br />
               stead of ﬁve. I do not know how that 
               <br />
               would work out. If you gave six members 
               <br />
               to these districts, you might also have to 
               <br />
               give six to the others; but it seems to me 
               <br />
               that the best thing to do is not to do that in 
               <br />
               advance, but to take up the constituencies 
               <br />
               as they are on the map, one atter another, 
               <br />
               and see whether they are fair or not. and, if 
               <br />
               they are not fair, to try to rectify them.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEIN. Might I be permitted

               to say in reply to the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               that the question of the capital does not 
               <br />
               affect in any way the conclusions which I 
               <br />
               have been endeavouring to express to the 
               <br />
               House. The right hon. gentleman says that 
               <br />
               if there were no question of the capital 
               <br />
               concerned, no one in this House would be— 
               <br />
               grudge two members to the unorganized

               territory which is to form part of the new 
               <br />

               <br />
               I am proposing to allot to every man in the

               province of Alberta, so far as we can reason- 
               <br />
               ably do it. the same voice in the legislature 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> every other man has. My right hon. 
               <br />
               friend talks of a concession having been 
               <br />
               made. I thought I had made myself reason- 
               <br />
               ably clear. I stated Over and over again 
               <br />
               that I did not think there was any evidence 
               <br />
               before this committee that would justify the 
               <br />
               conclusion that there are 5,000 people in 
               <br />
               that unorganized territory. I am of that 
               <br />
               opinion still. But we have got past that, 
               <br />
               not as a matter of fact, but for the purpose 
               <br />
               of this argument. .I am taking the estimates 
               <br />
               made by the members of the administration 
               <br />
               themselves, and I am pointing out that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">245,-</span> 
               <br />
               000 people are to have a representation of

               23. and 5,000 people are to have a repre— 
               <br />

               moment that there are conditions which 
               <br />
               would justify that? I know of no such 
               <br />
               conditions. If there are any let us know 
               <br />
               what they are. I have not heard 
               <br />
               from my right hon. friend what they 
               <br />

               there in having two representatives instead of

               further towards the north pole, and had a 
               <br />

               thousand miles of that territory, would you
