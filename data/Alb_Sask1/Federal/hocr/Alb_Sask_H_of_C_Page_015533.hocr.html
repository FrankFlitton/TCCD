               are quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equal]</span> to any in any country local-

               no part of Manitoba or of the Northwest

               Territories that is more closely settled than

               the settled portion of this particular district

               of Stony Plain, and there is no part more 
               <br />
               successful in its farming operations. But 
               <br />
               my hon. friend, by the scratch of a pen, ab- 
               <br />
               solutely wipes it out of existence. He says 
               <br />
               that the district of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Atha‘baska</span> might be just 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> as well represented by some one who lived 
               <br />
               somewhere else. Now if that argument of 
               <br />
               my hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend:</span> is to prevail, I suppose by 
               <br />
               the same reasoning some of the constitu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encies</span> of Ontario and Quebec might be 
               <br />
               wiped out of existence because they are re— 
               <br />
               presented by non-residents, by gentlemen 
               <br />
               who live in Montreal and Quebec, or in 
               <br />
               Toronto. But the people of Stony Plain 
               <br />
               do not recognize that they are off the map, 
               <br />
               for they have been busy in selecting a 
               <br />
               resident candidate to represent them local- 
               <br />
               ly. My hon. friend mentioned some names 
               <br />
               as having some connection with this parti- 
               <br />
               cular constituency. These gentlemen have 
               <br />
               no connection with it. and that only shows 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend is not careful in the

               Sllbject. I do not know that it is necessary

               to discuss in further detail the diil‘erences 
               <br />

               <br />
               much stress upon certain conditions which, 
               <br />
               he says, point to a large population in one

               part and small populationin the other, and 
               <br />
               perhaps it may be right also to allude to 
               <br />
               some of these same matters. When he ﬁnds 
               <br />
               more post ofﬁces in the north than in the 
               <br />
               south he says that is no evidence of popula- 
               <br />
               tion; it is only evidence that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Postmas‘</span> 
               <br />
               ier General has favoured that end of the 
               <br />
               country, and he proceeds to tell us of a cer- 
               <br />
               tain town in his own constituency where the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Postmaster</span> General granted a post ofﬁce 
               <br />
               simply because a lady asked him. If any- 
               <br />
               thing could be easier than that, I do not 
               <br />
               know what it is. I think, having regard to 
               <br />
               the action of the Postmaster General in 
               <br />
               granting post ottices in his constituency, it 
               <br />
               is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.fair</span> of him to allege that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> northern 
               <br />
               country has been favoured to a greater ex— 
               <br />
               tent than the part where he says the popula- 
               <br />
               tion is, particularly when he tells us that in 
               <br />
               this great district of Athabaska, with an 
               <br />
               area greater than that of all the rest of the 
               <br />
               province of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta,</span> the Postmaster General 
               <br />
               has only seen ﬁt to grant one post oﬂice in 
               <br />
               three years. He can have his argument 
               <br />
               that way if he likes. Either the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General is stingy with post otﬁces or he is 
               <br />
               liberal with post ofﬁces. If he is stingy with 
               <br />
               post ofﬁces, then northern Alberta has not 
               <br />
               got more than it is entitled to in proportion 
               <br />
               to the rest of the country; and it he is 
               <br />
               liberal with post ofﬁces, then surely the 
               <br />
               south is advantaged more than the unfor- 
               <br />
               tunate district of Athabaska is. As a matter 
               <br />
               of fact, the question of the number of post 
               <br />
               ofﬁces has only an indirect bearing on the 
               <br />
               question. The district of Athabaska is tra- 
               <br />
               versed by two great rivers—the Athabaska 
               <br />
               and the Peace. I think my hon. friend said 
               <br />
               there was no travel in the country. These 
               <br />
               two rivers are navigated by lines of steam— 
               <br />
               boats. There are plying on the waters 
               <br />
               of the Athabaska river within the proposed 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska four river steamers. 
               <br />
               one belonging to the Hudson Bay Company. 
               <br />
               one belonging to the ﬁrm of Cornwall &amp; 
               <br />
               Woods, one belonging to the Roman Catho-

               <br />
               Hlslop &amp; Nagle. On the Peace river they 
               <br />
               have three steamers, a large one and a small 
               <br />
               one belonging to the Hudson Bay Com— 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undertaken</span> to belittle the resources and peo— 
               <br />
               ple of the Peace river country. There is a 
               <br />
               purely agricultural settlement; I will go so 
               <br />
               far as to say a more purely agricultural
