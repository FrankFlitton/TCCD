               Mr. LANCASTER. I think it is not fair 
               <br />
               for a gentleman addressing you, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Speak‘</span> 
               <br />
               er, to be interrupted even by an hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber from the Northwest Territories, as I 
               <br />
               have been interrupted. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. Scott) had better have the local re- 
               <br />
               sponsibility in this matter—for he is not 
               <br />
               yet elected for the provincial legislature— 
               <br />
               before he undertakes to have an opinion 
               <br />
               about it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Even</span> a gentleman with cabinet 
               <br />
               aspirations ought not to stand up in this 
               <br />
               House, after the exhibition the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General (Sir William Mulock) made of him- 
               <br />
               self, and undertake to tell an hon. member 
               <br />
               reading plain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">English</span> that there was the 
               <br />
               same provision in the law relating to Mani- 
               <br />
               toba schools, and, when it was proved up to 
               <br />
               the hilt that he was mistaken, explain that 
               <br />
               that is not what he meant. It is wasting the 
               <br />
               time of the House as the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral wasted it—not quite so completely. 
               <br />
               perhaps, but very near even that limit. I 
               <br />
               have been wondering, Mr. Speaker—and I 
               <br />
               am sorry that your mouth is closed and that 
               <br />
               you cannot <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giveme</span> the information—having 
               <br />
               seen what I have since eight o’clock, I have 
               <br />
               been wondering whether there is another 
               <br />
               cabinet crisis, and whether that is the rea- 
               <br />
               son why thc cabinet is wasting the time of 
               <br />
               the House. The Postmaster General took 
               <br />
               up nearly two hours, and proved only one 
               <br />
               thing, and that is that a man could talk that 
               <br />
               long and say nothing. And now an aspirant 
               <br />
               to the cabinet takes up more time in the 
               <br />
               fashion I have shown. Now, the Solicitor 
               <br />
               General wished to ask me a question.
