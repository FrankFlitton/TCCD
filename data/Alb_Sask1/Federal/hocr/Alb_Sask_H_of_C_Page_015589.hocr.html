               <br />
               still point to the fact that the redistribu— 
               <br />
               tion made in 1902 took into consideration 
               <br />
               the three great divisions of the country— 
               <br />
               Assiniboia, Alberta and Saskatchewan—and 
               <br />
               that the seats for these three provisional 
               <br />
               districts were distributed in such a way as 
               <br />
               to _make only a variation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4%</span> per cent in 
               <br />
               the number of seats given to each of these

               provisional districts. Further than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>

               while Batoche, Moosejaw and Prince Albert 
               <br />
               were all represented in that House there 
               <br />
               was no serious criticism of this measure. 
               <br />
               The member for Prince Albert was the 
               <br />
               only one to introduce an amendment which 
               <br />
               was to the effect that there should be 36 
               <br />
               seats. The question was where would the 
               <br />
               odd seat go. Provision was made for 35 
               <br />
               seats already, and with 35 seats Saskat- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was no serious objectiton to that redistri- 
               <br />
               bution at all or else we should have heard 
               <br />
               of it. There is no question about that. At

               Mr. LAKE. It is all pointing to a moral. 
               <br />
               We have been told to—day that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have proceeded with this distribution 
               <br />
               upon principle; that they have. adopted the 
               <br />
               principle of being guided by the voters’ 
               <br />
               lists and the votes cast on the 3rd of No- 
               <br />
               vember last and by justice and fair-play. I 
               <br />
               am simply making a comparison of the two 
               <br />
               districts. As a matter of fact it appears 
               <br />
               to me that the gerrymander, shall I call it, 
               <br />
               in Saskatchewan is so glaring that it must 
               <br />
               in itself call attention to the fact that there 
               <br />
               has been something wrong in the distribu- 
               <br />
               tion of seats in Alberta. Of course when 
               <br />
               the schedules of the province of Saskat- 
               <br />
               chewan come up I will be prepared to go 
               <br />
               into the ﬁgures in regard to that pr0vince 
               <br />
               at far greater length than I have done; I 
               <br />
               have not completed my notes in regard to 
               <br />
               that matter, and I have spent a good many 
               <br />
               weary hours over it. “’hat I ask is that 
               <br />
               the principles of fair-play which prevail 
               <br />
               throughout I think the whole British em- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ple of the world, should govern in this case, 
               <br />
               that there should be a fair distribution of
