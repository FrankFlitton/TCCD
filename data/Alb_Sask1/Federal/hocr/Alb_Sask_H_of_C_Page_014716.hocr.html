               the new Minister of the Interior, and i 
               <br />
               would ask him to answer this question. 
               <br />
               Of course it would not be right to recall him 
               <br />
               from the west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">altithis</span> particular time; his

               this, that according to the Act of 1885, and 
               <br />
               at that time, there were fully 7,000,000 acres

               giving you a history of how we have been

               dealt with-in regard to the school lands of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. I would say to the hon. gentle-

               men who represent the west that is being 
               <br />
               now formed into new provinces, that they 
               <br />
               had better be careful because if they get 
               <br />
               the same treatment that was and is being 
               <br />
               meted out to Manitoba, I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afraid</span> they 
               <br />
               will come to the conclusion that it would 
               <br />
               be much better for the provinces to 
               <br />
               retain control of their public lands. The 
               <br />
               government, when dealing with this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. or when purchasing the territory, set 
               <br />
               aside certain lands to be used for edu- 
               <br />
               cational purposes. There is no doubt that if 
               <br />
               these lands were handed over to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces they would deal with them much 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better</span> and more wisely than the federal gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. So far as Manitoba is concerned. 
               <br />
               there never was a time in the history of that 
               <br />
               province when it needed so badly the school 
               <br />
               lands and the revenue derived therefrom. 
               <br />
               as at the present. Our schools have been 
               <br />
               nationalized, but, Sir, we are taking a step 
               <br />
               in advance of that, we are endeavouring to 
               <br />
               centralize them and therefore we need all 
               <br />
               the possible assistance that is coming to us 
               <br />
               from these sources of revenue.

               Let me say a word too on the school lands,

               The money we are giving Manitoba <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to‘day</span> 
               <br />
               does, by the admission of everybody, not be— 
               <br />
               long to Canada. but to Manitoba. If this money 
               <br />
               is ours, why have we been paying interest on 
               <br />
               it all along ‘2 We are not to—day giving a single 
               <br />
               cent to Manitoba, we are doing nothing else 
               <br />
               than repairing the injustice which was com- 
               <br />
               mitted to the prejudice of Manitoba. If we are 
               <br />
               going to look into the question, as it ought to 
               <br />
               be looked into, whether it is a. trust or not, let 
               <br />
               me say that in this legislation, dealing with and 
               <br />
               amending to some extent the Dominion Lands 
               <br />
               Act, we are only dealing as one of the anoma- 
               <br />
               lies of which we have too many in this country. 
               <br />
               Fortunately, in this instance, it is not one 
               <br />
               that is embedded in the constitution, but one of 
               <br />
               our making, and therefore subject to our un- 
               <br />
               making. A certain proportion of the public 
               <br />
               lands of this country, in the province of Maui— 
               <br />
               toba and the Northwest Territories, have been 
               <br />
               applied for school purposes. I submit this 
               <br />
               point to the judgment of every man in the 
               <br />
               House. The education of this country has been 
               <br />
               placed in the hands of the provinces. The sub- 
               <br />
               ject of education in Manitoba is in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">control</span> 
               <br />
               of that province. The question of education is 
               <br />
               subject to provincial jurisdiction. In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span>
