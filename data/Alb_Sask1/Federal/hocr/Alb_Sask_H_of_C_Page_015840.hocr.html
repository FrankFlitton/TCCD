               question upon the broad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principle</span> of this con- 
               <br />

               of the majority and the protection of the min-

               I quote my right hon. friend, in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place, as a justiﬁcation for my bringing up 
               <br />
               the question at present, because, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">according</span> 
               <br />
               to what he then said, this is the proper time 
               <br />
               to deal with that question. That is one 
               <br />
               point, but there is another which I invoke 
               <br />
               in favour of the contention I have the 
               <br />
               honour to submit, and that is what my hon.

               friend said, namely. that when the time

               came to deal with this question, we must 
               <br />

               <br />
               the same time protecting the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minority.</span>
