               the amount of ungranted land available for 
               <br />
               revenue purposes. It is because of the

               large areas of the new provinces that it is

               Mr. OLIVER. I will accept the apology 
               <br />
               of the hon. member (Mr. Foster), and I will 
               <br />
               say that he was threatening revenge and

               <br />

               <br />
               eloquent in informing us of how little im- 
               <br />
               portance this division was because it was 
               <br />
               momentary, and immediately the legisla— 
               <br />
               ture met it could make its own redistribu— 
               <br />
               tion. I say that this parliament has respon- 
               <br />
               sibility in this matter irrespective of what 
               <br />
               action the provincial legislature may take. 
               <br />
               We propose to create these provinces with 
               <br />
               these areas, the duty is laid upon us of dis- 
               <br />
               tributing the seats, and our responsibility is 
               <br />
               to see that that area is represented proper— 
               <br />
               ly and adequately. It is for that reason we 
               <br />
               propose to give this representation to the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska. It is entitled to re- 
               <br />
               presentation as a part of the province, and 
               <br />
               this parliament would be doing less than its 
               <br />
               duty if it did not provide representation for 
               <br />
               that district. Is it to be said that the dis—

               <br />
               which already are two or three times the
