               <br />
               Liberal-Conservative party under him ? 
               <br />
               \Vell, Sir, if it be, all I can say is that it 
               <br />
               is unworthy of any party or any paper to 
               <br />
               take such a position as that which he has 
               <br />
               taken. Sir, what is implied in it, and what 
               <br />
               is in it ? That two—ﬁfths of the people of 
               <br />
               this country can never expect to have one 
               <br />

               <br />
               he cannot have that position because he is 
               <br />
               :1 French Canadian. That is something 
               <br />
               which I think the people of my province 
               <br />
               will not endorse. That is something which 
               <br />
               the people of this country will not endorse, 
               <br />
               and I hope to hear a repudiation of that 
               <br />
               from hon. gentlemen opposite, for it will be

               better for them to denounce such sentiments 
               <br />
               as that. Sir, all I want to say in conclu- 
               <br />
               sion is this: The attempt is made by the 
               <br />
               party opposite, in order to secure power, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the strong man that he is, and believing 
               <br />
               that if they can strike him down, they 
               <br />
               might then hope to attain oﬂice, and to this 
               <br />
               end you will ﬁnd such articles as I have 
               <br />

               House. These attacks are made in order 
               <br />
               that he may be struck and that, by striking 
               <br />
               him and by possibly weakening his power, 
               <br />

               how? Are these separate schools, as they

               <br />
               them as a whole, there are several localities

               where the Protestants are in the minority, 
               <br />
               and if in some of these they desire to have 
               <br />
               their minority schools, they are, under the 
               <br />
               law which it is proposed to continue, the 
               <br />

               <br />
               by being in favour of securing liberty and 
               <br />
               rights to the minorities, but by being in

               clauses in the Bill that now gives liberty to 
               <br />
               the minority. He told us on a previous oc-

               <br />
               long as grasg grew and waters ran, he did 
               <br />
               not feel disposed to go against that will as 
               <br />
