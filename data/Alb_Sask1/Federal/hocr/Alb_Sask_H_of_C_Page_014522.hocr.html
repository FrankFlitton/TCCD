               <br />
               long time back. Over twenty years ago I

               was a member of the Territorial legislature

               most satisfactory law that you can get, 
               <br />

               is only a small vestige of: them left, and 
               <br />
               for this reason : That the separate Catholic 
               <br />
               school in the Northwest, or the public Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schooleit</span> does not matter much which 
               <br />
               —is to all intents and purposes a public

               school. It is exactly the same as a public 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Si'hOO].</span> The teachers of the Roman Catholic

               ﬁrst and second readers the text is a little 
               <br />
               different, but even these books have to be

               authorized by the Minister of Education. 
               <br />
               There is no church or clerical control in any

               of the local legislature, every one Of them, 
               <br />
               and the only difference—and it is not much 
               <br />
               or a difference either, because the public 
               <br />
               schools have the same right if they choose 
               <br />
               to use it—is that between half-past three 
               <br />
               o‘clock in the afternoon and four, they may 
               <br />
