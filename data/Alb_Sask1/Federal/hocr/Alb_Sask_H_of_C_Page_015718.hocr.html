               Mr. E. M. MACDONALD. The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) says that his 
               <br />
               policy is to apply section 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act simply. Why is it that, 
               <br />
               in his resolution on this subject he seeks 
               <br />
               to apply it with a peculiar construction 
               <br />
               which he chooses to put upon it and not 
               <br />
               simply and directly?

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. Because that is 
               <br />
               the construction I believe it bears. That 
               <br />
               is the construction by which I am prepared 
               <br />
               to stand. And 1 will give my hon. friend 
               <br />
               a motion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by-and‘by,</span> which I think will 
               <br />
               satisfy even his discriminating taste in that 
               <br />
               regard. Now, my right hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) is not 
               <br />
               prepared, at least at the moment, to give 
               <br />
               a plain answer to a plain question. He 
               <br />
               says he is applying the constitution. But 
               <br />
               when we look at his measure, we ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               he is not applying the constitution, but he 
               <br />
               is mangling the constitution before he an- 
               <br />
               plies it. I ask him: Do you wish us to 
               <br />
               understand by this language which you are 
               <br />
               substituting for the constitution that you 
               <br />
               mean to bring about exactly the same thing 
               <br />
               that would be brought about by the con- 
               <br />
               stitution if you did not mangle it in that 
               <br />
               way? And he says he will answer in his 
               <br />
               own time and in his own way. I should 
               <br />
               think it would be easy to answer at once 
               <br />
               so plain and simple a question. I say 
               <br />
               that if section 93 means what I suppose 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">riglit'ho'n.</span> gentleman says it means—- 
               <br />
               although he will not say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">i‘t—then</span> there is 
               <br />
               no need to change that section; there is no 
               <br />
               need to add to it or to take from it. On 
               <br />
               the other hand, if section 93 does not mean 
               <br />
               the same as the amendment 0f the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman. then, I say, we have no right 
               <br />
               to make a change in the words. That is 
               <br />
               the dilemma in which I place the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. If it means the same 
               <br />
               thing. what is the necessity of the amend- 
               <br />
               ment which he says is merely carrying out 
               <br />
               the provisions of the constitution: and if 
               <br />
               it does not mean the same thing. by what 
               <br />
               right does the right 1101]. gentleman stand 
               <br />
               up in this House and move an amendment 
               <br />
               which alters the wording of the constitution, 
               <br />
               while at the same time he declares that he 
               <br />
               is adhering to the terms of the constitution 
               <br />
               Without any amendment whatever ‘2

               The right hon. gentleman is very particular 
               <br />
               about some of the provisions of his amend- 
               <br />
               ed section 93: he is very particular about 
               <br />
               subsection 3, both in his speech and in his 
               <br />
