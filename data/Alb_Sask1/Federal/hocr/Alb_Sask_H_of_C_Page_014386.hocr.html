               reference to the question whether there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span>

               <br />
               with unanimity. On the 21st of May, 1902, 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">general</span> election was held throughout the

               Territories and the question of autonomy

               Bill was distributed throughout the whole

               who were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supporting</span> him in that election 
               <br />
               in these words : ‘These are the matters up—

               on which your judgment is invited. The 
               <br />
               issue is plain: it is for the people of the

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The people of the Territories did decide 
               <br />
               by returning Mr. Haultain to power by an 
               <br />
               overwhelming majority. In spite of this 
               <br />
               fact a great many excuses were made by

               the Dominion government for delay in deal- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> with the question. Two more sessions 
               <br />
               of the legislative assembly were held and 
               <br />
               in 'each one of these sessions a resolution 
               <br />
               demanding that this question be taken up 
               <br />
               was passed unanimously, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> voted for 
               <br />
               by both Liberals and Conservatives. There 
               <br />
               was no dissentient voice on either occasion, 
               <br />
               but still the matter was not taken up by the 
               <br />

               the demand would be repeated, we suddenly 
               <br />
               received the well known letter from the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister in which he made his prom-

               ise that if he was returned to power he 
               <br />
               would deal with the matter at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present,</span>

               I have indulged in this history in orderl 
               <br />
               to show that the government of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Terri-i</span>

               provinces. The government of the Terri~

               of the present year. The premier of the

               Territories and a member of his executive

               <br />
               here that as far as my information goes, 
               <br />
               there was no change in the conditions which 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain demanded from the Prime 
               <br />

               Mr. Bulyea had just the same mandate that 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain had from the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. That mandate was 
               <br />
               too clear for it to have been possible for him 
               <br />
               to have taken any position other than one in 
               <br />
               accordance with the views of his leader and 
               <br />
               the fact remains, that he is still a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of Mr. Haultain's government. I have 
               <br />
               also gone into this history to show that two 
               <br />
               Dominion general elections have been held 
               <br />
               since this matter was placed before the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. The government 
               <br />
               refused to act or deﬁne their policy in any 
               <br />
               particular during the whole lifetime of one 
               <br />
               parliament. More than that, when another 
               <br />
               appeal to the people became imminent they 
               <br />
               refused to deﬁne their policy before the elec— 
               <br />
               tions. Although they had had the draft pro- 
               <br />
               positions before them for three years they 
               <br />
               were not prepared to declare themselves in 
               <br />
               any respect. The hon ex—Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior ()Ir. Sifton) went into the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories and when he was questioned 
               <br />
               in regard to this matter he refused to com- 
               <br />
