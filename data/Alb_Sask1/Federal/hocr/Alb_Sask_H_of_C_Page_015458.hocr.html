               Now, to my mind the two clauses are 
               <br />
               practically similar, with this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> 
               <br />
               possibly, that the case before us is a 
               <br />
               stronger case in favour of the province 
               <br />
               withdrawing the money than was the case 
               <br />
               of Ontario. It~is doubtful whether this 
               <br />
               sum of $2,848,000 was a debt or not; 
               <br />
               but in any case it was practically a 
               <br />
               sum made up as the basis of a subsidy, but 
               <br />
               in the Act of parliament creating that sub- 
               <br />
               sidy it was called capital, and then 5 per 
               <br />
               cent of that sum was to be paid as addi- 
               <br />
               tional subsidy. Here we declare this sum 
               <br />
               of $8,107,500 to be a principal sum, and 
               <br />
               we name the amount of interest that 
               <br />
               is to be paid on account of that principal 
               <br />
               sum, namely, $405,375. Now to my mind, 
               <br />
               as the resolution is now worded, this sum 
               <br />
               of $405,375 being speciﬁcally designated as 
               <br />
               interest under the Act of 1885, the Minister - 
               <br />
               of Finance would be obliged, if the proper 
               <br />
               application was made by the province of 
               <br />
               Alberta by Act of the legislature, to pay 
               <br />
               over any portion of this sum of over $8,- 
               <br />
               000,000 so long as it was required by that 
               <br />
               province for the purposes of public works. 
               <br />
               I do not think that is the intention of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance, but I do not think that 
               <br />
               he has yet secured'n wording of the reso- 
               <br />
               lution that would actually prohibit the pro- 
               <br />
               vince from demanding it. Now we may 
               <br />
               say: Let us pay it to the province if ‘they
