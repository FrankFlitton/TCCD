               Mr. SCOTT. Was the action of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of 1884 not in accordance with that 
               <br />
               report? Of course it was, and the lands 
               <br />
               were withheld from the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. I do not say that I agree with every 
               <br />
               sentiment expressed in this report. But 
               <br />
               our friends opposite are extremely suspi- 
               <br />
               cious of the intention of the present gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in dealing with this subject in the 
               <br />
               same way as their predecessors dealt with 
               <br />
               it. Are the suspicious of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite based on their experience of twenty 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> ago ? The leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. R. L. Borden) made some reference for 
               <br />
               the fourth or ﬁfth time, to the idea that the 
               <br />
               government here is going to the United 
               <br />
               States for a precedent. And he spoke for 
               <br />
               the fourth or ﬁfth time of the British prac- 
               <br />
               tice with regard to lands and put the ques— 
               <br />
               tion : What would have been the result with 
               <br />
               regard to the northern half of the North 
               <br />
               American continent if the British practice 
               <br />
               of many years ago had not been changed. 
               <br />
               The obvious answer is that the British 
               <br />
               Crown would have lost British North Amer- 
               <br />
               ica as she lost the thirteen American colon- 
               <br />
               ies. But it seems to me that the cases put 
               <br />
               by the leader of the opposition are not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parallel;</span> and, if my hon. friend will look 
               <br />
               further into the matter, I think he will 
               <br />
               agree with that View. What did the United 
               <br />
               States do ? Immediately they obtained 
               <br />
               their independence, the ﬁrst thing they did 
               <br />
               was to provide for control of all lands 
               <br />
               throughout the United States by the central 
               <br />
               government. I think that is sufﬁcient proof 
               <br />
               that the cases are not parallel.

               years and its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">experience</span> so far is that, with 
               <br />
               the free settlement policy, it has not made a 
               <br />
               cent out Of the lands, in fact it is about 
               <br />
               $1,000,000 behind. I have a calculation to 
               <br />
               show the amount that these new provinces 
               <br />
               will receive in the next thirty-ﬁve years 
               <br />
               under the arrangement proposed by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. In the ﬁrst place it is proposed 
               <br />
               in the resolution that the sum of $937,500 is 
               <br />
               to be paid to the two provinces as a special 
               <br />
               grant from the land fund for public build- 
               <br />
               ings within the next ﬁve years. Then, with- 
               <br />
               in the same period the two governments will 
               <br />
               receive as ordinary land subsidy, $3,750,000. 
               <br />
               And if, at the end of ﬁve years it is found 
               <br />
               that the population of each province has in- 
               <br />
               creased to 400.000 souls, which is altogether 
               <br />
               likely, in the succeeding ﬁve years the two 
               <br />
               provinces will receive a total of $5,625,000 
               <br />
               from the lands. I calculate that, at the 
               <br />
               end of that period of ﬁve years the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of each province will be 800,000, in 
               <br />
               which case, in the next period, they will 
               <br />
               receive $7,500,000 for the two provinces. 
               <br />
               If, at the end of that period, the popula- 
               <br />
               tion has increased to 1,200,000, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay—</span> 
               <br />
               ments will amount, within the next period 
               <br />
               of ﬁve years, to $11,125,000. Then in the 
               <br />
               ﬁfth period the amount will be equal, $11,- 
               <br />
               125,000. In the sixth period the same, in 
               <br />
               the seventh period the same, bringing us
