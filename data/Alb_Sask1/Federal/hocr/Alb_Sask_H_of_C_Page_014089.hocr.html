               any one who has listened to the remarks 
               <br />

               to any other conclusion than that he has

               treated this question as what it really is,

               <br />
               I fail to discover a single argument. In-

               stead of arguing seriously the points raised

               <br />

               <br />
               discussed at all until it suited the right

               more uncomfortable and his difﬁculties in- 
               <br />
               creasing is evidenced by -the fact that in 
               <br />
               his reference to the hon. member for East 
               <br />
               Grey (Mr. Sproule) he let slip an allusion 
               <br />
               of a personal nature, because that is a_ 
               <br />
               species of retort which my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend is usually careful to avoid. In refer- 
               <br />
               ring to the hon. member, he spoke of him 
               <br />
               as not being a member of parliament only, 
               <br />
               but as something else. Well, we all know

               that the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) was the chief source of those pe- 
               <br />
               titions which are being daily presented 
               <br />
               against the clause in this Bill relating to 
               <br />
               schools. For my part I can say, so far as 
               <br />
               my knowledge goes, that my hon. friend is 
               <br />
               not the chief source of those petitions. In 
               <br />
               fact I have been very much surprised that 
               <br />
               the body which the hon. member for East

               oughly self contained throughout this mat-

               ter. I do not believe that the First Minister 
               <br />
               realizes for a moment the feeling which this 
               <br />
               Bill has created. Already by this measure 
               <br />
               he has set creed against creed in the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. Already he has done 
               <br />
               evil which ten years will not wipe out; and 
               <br />
               I appeal to him to lose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> another day 
               <br />
               in submitting this Bill to the House and 
               <br />
               the people because every day’s delay is 
               <br />
               widening the breach and intensifying the 
               <br />
               feeling against it. It is intensifying that 
               <br />
               feeling to such an extent that no matter 
               <br />
               whether the Bill be altered to meet the 
               <br />
               views of those who are opposing it or not 
               <br />
               the bitterness now created will last longer 
               <br />
               than the lifetime of many in this House. 
               <br />
               I have been astonished at the strength 
               <br />
               of the feeling which has been aroused 
               <br />
               in connection with this educational clause. 
               <br />
               My right hon. friend pleads that as this 
               <br />
               is the only clause in. the Bill to which 
               <br />
               objection has been made, we must con- 
               <br />
               clude that great consideration has been 
               <br />
               given to it. But, Mr. Speaker, the fact 
               <br />
               rather is that this educational clause so 
               <br />
               overshadows all the others that the other 
               <br />
