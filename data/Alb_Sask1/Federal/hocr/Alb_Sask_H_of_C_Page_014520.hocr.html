               good reason why 80c. of that should not go 
               <br />
               back to the province for the carrying on 
               <br />

               <br />
               the other provinces shall make a demand

               on this government to have that per capita 
               <br />
               grant paid on their actual population. 1 
               <br />
               should think they would be within their 
               <br />
               rights, and also that the Dominion would 
               <br />
               be perfectly justiﬁed in granting that de- 
               <br />
               mand. And I am sure that the provinces 
               <br />
               of Alberta and Saskatchewan would take 
               <br />
               exactly the same view in asking that the per 
               <br />
               capita grant be made on the actual popula- 
               <br />
               tion of each province. I believe that in this 
               <br />
               matter there is not much to complain of. 
               <br />
               Now, as to what we get in lieu of our lands 
               <br />
               ——which, I suppose, is what the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem‘</span>

               <br />
               with the arrangement made. I think it is 
               <br />
               a better arrangement than to have handed 
               <br />
               over the lands to the provinces. That was 
               <br />

               ion government has also made a bargain 
               <br />
               that is absolutely justiﬁable. I am pleased 
               <br />
               to say that there has been very little

               criticism in connection with this phase 
               <br />
               of the matter. One thing I might point 
               <br />
               out is that there is no danger of the 
               <br />
               public domain, the source of revenue, being 
               <br />
               squandered. Now, I would not for a mo- 
               <br />
               ment allow that the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories are not as well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ablehto</span> look after 
               <br />
               their own affairs as are any other people 
               <br />
               in the Dominion. But there is this fact 
               <br />
               that we must all acknowledge—that in the 
               <br />
               past the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> railway companies have 
               <br />
               managed to get bonuses and guarantees out 
               <br />
               of practically every province in the Domin- 
               <br />
               ion. I cannot say how it is in Prince Ed- 
               <br />
               ward Island,'but I know how it is in every 
               <br />
               other province in the Dominion. Take, for 
               <br />
               instance, the province of Manitoba. As I 
               <br />
               said a little while ago they have gone secur- 
               <br />
               ity for between $19,000,000 and $20,000,000 
               <br />
               for one railway company alone. That rall- 
               <br />
               way may be all right, but we know what 
               <br />
               the history of railway companies has been. 
               <br />
               There is always a chance of that liability 
               <br />
               being called upon. We know what British 
               <br />
               Columbia has done in giving away large 
               <br />
               tracts of land and coal and timber bonuses 
               <br />
               to railways. We know what the lower 
               <br />
               provinces and Quebec and Ontario have 
               <br />
               given in cash or guarantees. And we know 
               <br />
               that the Northwest Territories have been 
               <br />
               for years getting hundreds of miles of rail- 
               <br />
