               is vested with the property of its lands. 
               <br />
               Such has been the case with Ontario, Que- 
               <br />
               bec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Bri- 
               <br />
               tish Columbia. But one must remember 
               <br />
               that when they entered into confederation, 
               <br />
               each of these provinces had the property of 
               <br />
               its lands. They were independent colonies 
               <br />
               and they exercised a sovereign power over 
               <br />
               their Crown lands. Nearly all their re- 
               <br />
               venues have since been derived from that 
               <br />
               source. Their right was inalienable and 
               <br />
               they stipulated in 1867, that they would 
               <br />
               continue to exercise it. Quite different in 
               <br />
               the case with the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">At</span> the time of confederation, the delegates 
               <br />
               of the provinces inserted a clause in the 
               <br />
               British North America Act by which they 
               <br />
               empowered the Dominion to purchase from 
               <br />
               the Hudson Bay Company—then suzerain 
               <br />
               of the Territories—all this vast tract of 
               <br />
               country. The purchase was made in 1870, 
               <br />
               and the price paid by the Dominion to the 
               <br />
               Hudson Bay Company amounted to £300,- 
               <br />
               000. Out of that domain, was ﬁrst carved 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba, but, with the ex-

               If the land in the Northwest remains vested

               <br />

               <br />
               does not seem to have been necessary, ac-

               other provinces have their public lands and 
               <br />
               we must have our public lands. Therefore 
               <br />
               there was a special enactment in the Act 
               <br />
               of 1870, that Manitoba'should not have its

               ministered by Canada since 1870, it has 
               <br />
               added not a little burden to the public ex- 
               <br />

               <br />
               rebellions and besides, we have—in order 
               <br />
               to maintain law, peace and order—equipped 
               <br />
               a corps of mounted police, which has pat-

               rolled the west and afforded ample protec-

               tion against the Indians and the rough

               millions to advertise and settle the west. 
               <br />
               We have subsidized the vast system of rail-

               the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc are in a sense 
               <br />

               <br />
               read some very wild statements in the

               <br />
               lands. Having myself been a journalist; 
               <br />
               far be it from my mind to minimize the

               inﬂuence of the press but it thus happens 
               <br />
               that sometimes the press ﬁnds grievances 
               <br />
               which are more imaginary than real. Some 
               <br />

               the new provinces. First, it must be admit- 
               <br />
               ted that a revenue had to be provided to 
               <br />
               run the machinery of the local government. 
               <br />
               This is what is being done by granting a 
               <br />
               subsidy in lieu of lands. Is this subsidy 
               <br />
               a fair equivalent for the public lands sur- 
               <br />
               rendered to us? In order to answer this 
               <br />
               question, one must bear in mind the follow- 
               <br />
               ing facts. The lands are not sold by the 
               <br />
               federal government, but are given away as 
               <br />
               an inducement to the settlers. Suppose the 
               <br />
               lands were left to the now provinces, would 
               <br />
               they depart from the policy of free grants 
               <br />
               to the settlers ? I assume that they would 
               <br />
               —in all wisdom—continue the issuing of 
               <br />
               free grants. Thus, the revenue which other- 
               <br />
               wise would accrue from the sale of these 
               <br />
