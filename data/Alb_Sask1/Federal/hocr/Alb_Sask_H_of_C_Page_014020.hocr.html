               allowed a certain sum every year to defray 
               <br />
               the expenses of their own local govern- 
               <br />
               ments and administrations. This is the 
               <br />
               reason why this provision is to be found 
               <br />
               in the British North America Act. It is 
               <br />
               there. I do not think it is sound, but 
               <br />
               though in my judgment unsound, it is the 
               <br />
               duty of everybody in this House and in this

               it, with its good points and'its blemishes, 
               <br />
               and carry it to the end on the principle 
               <br />
               upon which it was established. Therefore 
               <br />
               upon this point I believe it is the duty of 
               <br />
               the Canadian parliament to continue that 
               <br />
               policy in this instance and make a liberal 
               <br />
               provision for these two new provinces 
               <br />
               which we are about to admit into the Can- 
               <br />
               adian family.

               But before I come to the revenue to be

               given these provinces, it will perhaps be 
               <br />
               preferable that I should give an idea of
