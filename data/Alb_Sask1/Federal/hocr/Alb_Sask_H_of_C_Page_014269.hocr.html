               There is no more saddening aspect in the 
               <br />
               condition of our province than the groups of 
               <br />
               Protestant children to be found here and there 
               <br />
               all over it destitute of the means of acquiring 
               <br />
               the elements of education, and threatening us 
               <br />
               with a coming generation of Protestant farmers 
               <br />
               as ignorant as Russian moujiks. This is a. fruit 
               <br />
               of separate schools. If we had national schools, 
               <br />
               instead of sectarian schools, no child in the 
               <br />
               province would be without opportunity to learn 
               <br />
               to read and write. Another consequence of 
               <br />
               these sectarian schools should never be lost 
               <br />
               sight <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cigand</span> that is, where Protestant farmers 
               <br />
               are too . w to have a school, they are taxed to 
               <br />
               support Catholic schools, which, sometimes, 
               <br />
               have as their teachers nuns and Christian 
               <br />
               brothers. There are hundreds of Protestant 
               <br />
               farmers who are forced either to support Catho- 
               <br />
               lic schools or sell out.
