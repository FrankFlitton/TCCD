               <br />
               ister of Justice has denied it, I have nothing 
               <br />

               the delegate from Manitoba should come to 
               <br />
               the conclusion that the government's hand

               <br />
               certainly it would not have been any one in 
               <br />
               the Manitoba government, for they (lid not 
               <br />
               accept it. Now, it is admitted and not 
               <br />
               denied that the Papal ablegate took an im-

               portant part in preparing these Autonomy 
               <br />

               is admitted that conferences took place,

               that he was satisﬁed and accepted them.

               Now, if separate schools are fastened on 
               <br />
               half a continent there, who has done it? 
               <br />
               The government through the representative

               And if he was successful in establishing 
               <br />
               them over 500,000 square miles of territory. 
               <br />
               is it any wonder that he attempted to go 
               <br />
               farther and fasten them on Manitoba as

               speciﬁc items mentioned by Rogers which 
               <br />
               are known to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> ad- 
               <br />
               mitted to be correct. As to the fourth one 
               <br />
               a lapse of memory is pleaded; the First 
               <br />
               Minister says: I have no remembrance of 
               <br />
               it and I think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘1</span> would remember it if it was 
               <br />
               so—but he does not say it was not so. On 
               <br />
               the ﬁfth one the government denies that 
               <br />
               they had any knowledge of what took 
               <br />
               place when the Manitoba delegates were 
               <br />
               with the Papal ablegate. Rogers never 
               <br />
               said they knew what took place but he 
               <br />
               assumed they did in cons‘equence of the 
               <br />
               circumstances that surrounded it, and I say 
               <br />
               he was justiﬁed in that conclusion. Then 
               <br />
               we take the Papal ablegate’s admission that 
               <br />
               he invited them ; as Rogers said an invita- 
               <br />
               tion came. When did it come ? Mr. Rogers 
               <br />
               says March 20, the Papal ablegate says : I 
               <br />
               think I met them on the 23rd or the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">24th</span> 
               <br />
               before they left for home. The invitation 
               <br />
               seems to have been on the 20th of March. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Vhen</span> was the Bill to be introduced in the

               When was the ﬁrst disclosure to be given

               to the people whether or not their boundar-

               ies were to be extended ? On the 21st. Is it 
               <br />
               not natural to reach the conclusion that that
