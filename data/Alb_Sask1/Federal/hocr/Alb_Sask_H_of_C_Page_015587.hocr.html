               Of course there was a small population in the

               These people living along the two southern

               Mr. SCOTT. I am perfectly willing to 
               <br />
               accept the explanation of my hon. friend 
               <br />

               Mr. LAKE. I cannot say how many of 
               <br />
               these electors have been naturalized, I know 
               <br />
               that in a return brought down the other day, 
               <br />
               forty—ﬁve of them have been apparently de- 
               <br />
               prived of their homesteads and sent to locate 
               <br />
               on other lands, and I think it was stated that 
               <br />
               a great majority of these had naturalized. 
               <br />
               I know that one man was spoken of as 
               <br />
               having naturalized, but the only source of 
               <br />
               information I have as to that is to be found 
               <br />
               in these papers which were brought down 
               <br />
               the other day. At any rate it is for us to 
               <br />
               deal with existing conditions. It has been 
               <br />
               admitted by the Minister of the Interior and 
               <br />
               by the Prime Minister that the fairest basis 
               <br />
               of calculation in regard to this redistribution 
               <br />
               which is to be for an election which will take 
               <br />
               place within six months, is the basis of the 
               <br />
               voters’ lists and the votes cast at the recent 
               <br />
               election. Surely that should be sufﬁcient for 
               <br />
               the members on the other side of the House 
               <br />
               as it is sufﬁcient for us. We are quite pre- 
               <br />
               pared to accept that as a basis, we con- 
               <br />
               sider it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> fair basis and if it is adher- 
               <br />
               ed to we will have nothing more to say in 
               <br />
               regard to this matter. For my part at 
               <br />
               any rate, I would have nothing more to 
               <br />
               say. I do not care how these are divided up 
               <br />
               so long as there is a fair distribution of the 
               <br />
               population; they may zig-zag them in any 
               <br />
               way they please so long as they give a fair 
               <br />
               distribution of the population. Let the man 
               <br />
               who has lived in the southern part of that 
               <br />
               country and who has made that country, and 
               <br />
               who has proved that the country is of some 
               <br />
