               Mr. SCOTT, I hope I am not displaying

               any undue agitation, but I do feel, and I have 
               <br />

               rowing money in their early years, I would

               have less objection to the land being trans-

               <br />
               especially in their early years, if they had

               ﬂict between the provincial and the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion authorities in carrying out the im- 
               <br />
               migration policy. I say that that objection 
               <br />
               does not hold, and I say further that I do not 
               <br />
               believe there is a member from the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories sitting on that side of the 
               <br />
               House who in the west and until he came 
               <br />
               to this parliament, did not advocate that 
               <br />
               the lands in these provinces belong to the 
               <br />
               prbvinces absolutely and that the provincial 
               <br />
               government should administer them. I may 
               <br />
               be speaking in error, but if so I am subject 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">correction,</span> I know that the hon. member 
               <br />
               for ‘Western Assiniboia (Mr. Scott) has for 
               <br />
               years advocated not only on the public 
               <br />
               platform, but in his paper the Regina ‘Lead- 
               <br />
               er,’ that these lands belong to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[11'0-</span> 
               <br />
               vince and should be administered by the 
               <br />
               province. That is the position he took and 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Assiniboia (MY- 
               <br />
               Turriff’) has made a similar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement</span> The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Strathcona (Mr. Talbot) 
               <br />
               I think has made similar statements, but 
               <br />
               now they come down here to this purl-a- 
               <br />
               ment and the only reason I have yet heard
