               Mr. PATERSON. We have had strong

               <br />
               ofﬁces from thirty or forty places, but it is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to accommodate them all. The open-

               ing of every new port means an additional 
               <br />
               expenditure. Then, while we are very 
               <br />
               anxious to oblige the business community as 
               <br />
               far as we can, we are not able to secure the

               same judgment with reference to values and 
               <br />
               as to whether invoices are correct, at many 
               <br />
               of these points that we can at larger points, 
               <br />
               where we can afford to pay larger salaries 
               <br />
               and have men especially delegated for the 
               <br />
               work. In the United States there are only a 
               <br />
               few very large ports. I believe it is a fact that 
               <br />
               for their 80,000,000 people, they have not 
               <br />
               as many ports as we have in Canada—not 
               <br />
               relatively, but absolutely. But the people 
               <br />
               of Canada have been accustomed to having 
               <br />
               conveniences nearer home. I can well under- 
               <br />
               stand what the hon. gentleman says as to 
               <br />
               the strong claims of the district he repre-
