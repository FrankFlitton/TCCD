               House what purported to be a brief history, 
               <br />
               from ofﬁcial sources, of the legislation with 
               <br />
               respect to separate schools since 1863. At 
               <br />
               the end of that pamphlet they went beyond 
               <br />
               the bounds of history, and made a distinct 
               <br />
               appeal on the subject. They said that ‘it 
               <br />
               would be a breach of faith and a 
               <br />
               violation of the British North Amer- 
               <br />
               ica Act to disturb now rights and 
               <br />
               privileges granted thirty years ago’—a 
               <br />
               violation of the British North Ameri— 
               <br />
               ca Act; and I would like, by the way, to 
               <br />
               ask who it is that now proposes to violate 
               <br />
               the British North America Act? But the 
               <br />
               pamphlet did not rest at this. The rights 
               <br />
               and privileges granted thirty years ago 
               <br />
               were deﬁned in another pant of this 
               <br />
               pamphlet as ‘the same system as pre- 
               <br />
               vailed in Ontario and Quebec.’ After 
               <br />
               issuing this pamphlet, in which this strong 
               <br />
               appeal is made for separate schools, they 
               <br />
               proceeded to draw up a set of clauses. To 
               <br />
               provide for what ? According to the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister in his speech on the introduction 
               <br />
               of the Bill, it was to enable the minority to 
               <br />
               establish their own schools and to share in 
               <br />
               the public moneys as the law is to—day. A 
               <br />
               similar statement was made a few days later 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice, that they drew up 
               <br />
               these clauses to give effect to the provisions 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1875 and the conditions that 
               <br />
               are now in force in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. Now, we are told by the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance, the Minister of Customs, the 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) and many 
               <br />
               others that the ordinances now in force in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, for all practical 
               <br />
               purposes, simply provide for a national 
               <br />
               school system, and not for a separate school 
               <br />
               system in its recognized sense—that is, in 
               <br />
               the sense in which it prevails in Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               So we have this position, that, after 
               <br />
               issuing a pamphlet in favour of separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools, they drew up a clause which 
               <br />
               did not provide for separate schools as they 
               <br />
               understood them, but simply provided for 
               <br />
               what was in practice a national school sys— 
               <br />
               tem. These four legal gentlemen drew up 
               <br />
               this clause which the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               said was drawn up designedly to be‘so 
               <br />
               clear and simple that any man might under- 
               <br />
               stand lt;’ those were his very words. But a 
               <br />
               revelation came a few days later. The hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) returns 
               <br />
               and tells us that those clear and simple 
               <br />
               words have a deeper meaning, that they 
               <br />
               actually do provide for the same system as 
               <br />
               prevails in Ontario and Quebec, and in ad- 
               <br />
               dition give, for the support of separate 
               <br />
               schools, a share of a $50,000,000 endowment 
               <br />
               which had been specially held in trust for 
               <br />
               public schools. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               And these four legal gentlemen apparent- 
               <br />
               ly never saw what they were embodying in 
               <br />
               this clause! They believed all the time 
               <br />
               they were simply perpetuating the law as 
               <br />
               it exists at present. For the last three

               <br />
               blame on the poor draughtsman. These 
               <br />
               four gentlemen then took back the clauses 
               <br />
               they had drafted originally, and pro- 
               <br />
               vided a substitute which in the opin- 
               <br />
               ion of the member for Brandon really 
               <br />
               does provide for the schools now in 
               <br />
               existence and nothing more. The Prime 
               <br />
               Minister in introducing the amended clauses 
               <br />
               explained that the objections to the original 
               <br />
               clauses were that they were ‘too broad and 
               <br />
               too vague, and if adopted would create con- 
               <br />
               fusion instead of certainty.’ Remember 
               <br />
               these were the very clauses which we were 
               <br />
               told were to be so clear and simple that 
               <br />
               any man could understand them. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister told us that the amended 
               <br />
               clauses simply embody the law of the coun- 
               <br />
               try Which has been in force for thirteen or 
               <br />
               fourteen years; but I would remind the 
               <br />
               House that the right hon. gentleman said 
               <br />
               the same thing in reference to the original 
               <br />
               clauses. The Minister of Finance says that 
               <br />
               the present clauses continue for ever the 
               <br />
               school system which now exists, and the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs explained how simple 
               <br />
               it all was, and he told us which of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diifer—</span> 
               <br />
               ent clauses of the territorial ordinances 
               <br />
               were affected by this Bill. If the Minister 
               <br />
               of Customs were a lawyer he would have 
               <br />
               been a little more careful, but having had 
               <br />
               experience of the diﬂiculties of four of the 
               <br />
               leading legal gentlemen of the cabinet, some 
               <br />
               of us began to think a layman‘s opinion 
               <br />
               might throw some light upon the question. 
               <br />
               However that may be, the member for Cal- 
               <br />
               gary (Mr. M. S. McCarthy) showed us pretty 
               <br />
               conclusively the other day that there is more 
               <br />
               behind this matter than we have been led 
               <br />
               to believe, and that the separate school 
               <br />
               clause of 1875 is re-enacted in its entirety 
               <br />
               by the present legislation, and that for all 
               <br />
               practical purposes the substituted clauses 
               <br />
               are just the same as the original. Is it any 
               <br />
               wonder that parliament and the country 
               <br />
               are extremely suspicious as to what there 
               <br />
               is underlying all this, and that we want to 
               <br />
               know distinctly and deﬁnitely what this 
               <br />
               proposal really does mean? We ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               very peculiar circumstance that the most 
               <br />
               violent advocates of separate schools as 
               <br />
               well as the most violent opponents of 
               <br />
               separate schools on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House, are, one and all of them urging 
               <br />
               us to accept these educational clauses. We 
               <br />
               are told by one set of these gentlemen that 
               <br />
               they strongly approved of these clauses be- 
               <br />
               cause they would tend to disminish the 
               <br />
               number of separate schools and I suppose, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tit-ally</span> do away with them altogether. By 
               <br />
               another set we are urged in impassioned 
               <br />
               language to vote for the clauses and give 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic minority their rights; 
               <br />
               we are told that there is a religious 
               <br />
               principle at stake and that no country can 
               <br />
               be great and can endure without separate
