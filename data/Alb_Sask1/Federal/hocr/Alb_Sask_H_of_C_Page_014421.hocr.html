               people of the Northwest through their legis- 
               <br />
               lature and government. We must bear in 
               <br />
               mind that Mr. Haultain‘s draft Bill con- 
               <br />
               templated only one province whereas now 
               <br />
               we are creating two provinces. The draft 
               <br />
               Bill asks for a grant for government of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000</span> and we are giving a grant of $100,- 
               <br />
               000. The original draft Bill asked for a 
               <br />
               debt allowance which would have yielded 
               <br />
               only $405,375, being calculated on a popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 250,000 for the Whole area, where- 
               <br />
               as the population to-day is estimated at 
               <br />
               500,000 and the allowance is just twice the 
               <br />
               amount in the draft Bill. The claim in 
               <br />
               the draft Bill with regard to the per capita 
               <br />
               subsidy was 80 cents up to a limit of popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 1,300.000. that being the limit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap.</span> 
               <br />
               plied in the case of the province of Ontario, 
               <br />
               whereas this Bill provides for payment 
               <br />
               up to a limit of population of 1,600,000. This 
               <br />
               will mean a difference eventually of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">98103;.</span>
