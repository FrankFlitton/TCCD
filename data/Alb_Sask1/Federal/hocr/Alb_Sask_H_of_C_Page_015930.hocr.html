               tains the report of Charles Francis Adams and

               <br />
               law upon this subject and makes it to appear 
               <br />
               that in the whole of the states of the Union 
               <br />
               there is no instance of general exemption from 
               <br />
               taxation. There may be one or two isolated 
               <br />
               cases in particular states of partial and tem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               railways under special circumstances; but the 
               <br />
               general rule of almost universal application is 
               <br />
               that there is no exemption in one form or 
               <br />
               another from taxation. The instances which 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Railways quoted in other 
               <br />
               places in Minnesota and Wisconsin, are in- 
               <br />
               stances of exemption from taxation by one 
               <br />
               statute and the imposition of taxation by ano— 
               <br />
               ther—a license tax, a tax upon gross receipts. 
               <br />
               is imposed in lieu of other taxes, and it may 
               <br />
               be that this is the fairest mode of taxation. 
               <br />
               Some hon. gentlemen have said that it is of 
               <br />
               very little consequence, that the road-bed is 
               <br />
               taxed very lightly in Ontario, thnt some of our 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislatures</span> have declined to tax railway com— 
               <br />
               panies at all. But what kind of railway com- 
               <br />
               panies were these? They were railways built 
               <br />
               by private capital, and were not paying interest 
               <br />
               on their investments. I do not say that a rule 
               <br />
               of this kind does not apply to a railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> is 
               <br />
               built at public charge and that is given 3. mon-

               <br />
               its trailic. But this is no' temporary exemption, 
               <br />
               it lasts for ever; no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> how bloated this 
               <br />
               corporation may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">become;</span> no matter how magni- 
               <br />
               ﬁcent may be its network of railways, no mat-

               <br />
               prosperous the towns which are tributary to it, 
               <br />
               no matter how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exaggerated</span> its dividend, for 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion.</span> In considering that, you have to look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               the general result of taxation. Some of the 
               <br />
               United States railways you ﬁnd paying a tax of 
               <br />
               $300 or $400 per annum, and $600 or $800 per 
               <br />
               annum is paid as taxes by the English railways. 
               <br />
               You ﬁnd. therefore, that the possibilities of 
               <br />
               railway taxation are very great. You ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               Illinois Central Railway paying almost the 
               <br />
               whole expenses of the government of that state,

               referred to the general voice of the people.

               But you do not keep your hands free, you tie

               charge this railway company any taxation upon 
               <br />
               its property, its stock, or its capital. I‘say 
               <br />
               that I can well conceive a time when a tax on 
               <br />
               the gross receipts of railways might be a very 
               <br />
               satisfactory tax and a very satisfactory source 
               <br />
               A tax for trans- 
               <br />
               portation would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apparently</span> be a very equal 
               <br />
               taxation, and if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> necessity arose of adding 
               <br />
               to the revenue, it is quite possible that we 
               <br />
               might wish to avail ourselves of such a tax. 
               <br />
               There is another point in which this exemption 
               <br />
               is objectionable. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Int</span> places this company in the 
               <br />
               position of a monopoly by itself, because it 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">places</span> at a disadvantage all competitors who 
               <br />
               are to raise the funds themselves to build‘their 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railways.</span> The contract requires perpetual ex- 
               <br />
               emption, the other otter does not demand any ex- 
               <br />
               emption at all. Choose! The choice is yours! 
               <br />
               Take the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perpetual</span> exemption in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contract</span> 
               <br />
               or take the liability to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation</span> in the offer. 
               <br />
               Yours is the choice ; for it you will be held re- 
               <br />
               sponsible. Then the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contract</span> provides that the 
               <br />
               land grant shall be exempt from taxation for 
               <br />
               twenty years, unless sold or occupied from the 
               <br />
               date of the grant. The money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gain</span> to the com— 
               <br />
               pany is enormous, there can be no doubt about 
               <br />
               that. There can be no doubt but that the 
               <br />
               burdens which this company are freed from 
               <br />

               they are not to pay the same taxes as the rest

               of the community. Why should they not? Is 
               <br />
               it because they get a large proﬁt? Because 
               <br />
               they are getting altogether four prices for 
               <br />

               you make them subject to taxation ? Will you 
               <br />
