               Siniboia (Mr. Scott) state in this House that

               amongst the Protestant population of this 
               <br />
               country the opinion prevailed that the pri- 
               <br />
               vileges of the Catholic minority had been 
               <br />
               called for by them. Nothing could be further 
               <br />
               from the truth. The educational privileges 
               <br />
               of the minorities in this country were called 
               <br />
               for. not by Catholics, but by Protestants. 
               <br />
               They were called for by Mr. Gait, and I 
               <br />
               will go further. I will say that the man

               who had every authority to represent the 
               <br />
               Catholic population of this country, John 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sandﬁeld</span> Macdonald, moved a resolution in 
               <br />
               the parliament of United Canada asking 
               <br />
               that the Catholic minority be left in the 
               <br />
               hands of the Protestants of this country, 
               <br />
               as they could rely on the good faith of the 
               <br />
               Protestants—and what was the fate of that 
               <br />

               of view of a layman. There are two alter-

               natives, I believe, which confront every 
               <br />
               member of parliament on this matter. Are 
               <br />
               these Territories entering confederation to— 
               <br />

               <br />
               1870? You may take Whichever view you

               prefer, but you must adopt the one or the 
               <br />
               other. Either they entered the union in 
               <br />
               1870 or they are going into it to—day. If they

               repudiate them ? I think' that when we

               know that this parliament in 1875 passed 
               <br />
               a law conferring upon the Catholic minority 
               <br />

               of its power so long as these ordinances 
               <br />
               have not been repealed by this parliament

               paramount duty is to confirm the legislation

               those eminent statesmen, what would be

               There are three systems of school-s; ﬁrst 
               <br />
               there is the system of separate schools with 
               <br />
               two boards, each board having the super— 
               <br />
               vision of its schools, the qualiﬁcation of 
               <br />
               teachers, text books, inspection and so on. 
               <br />
               The type of these schools is to be found in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec. There is a second 
               <br />
               system of schools which you call neutral 
               <br />
               or godless schools. The best illustration 
               <br />
               of that system of schools is, I believe, to 
               <br />
               he found in the United States of America. 
               <br />
               There is a third system of schools which 
               <br />
               may be called either separate or public 
               <br />
               schools, which are under one single board, 
               <br />
               and in which religious instruction is al- 
               <br />
               lowed, according to the Wishes of the par- 
               <br />
               ents. This system, I believe. is the one 
               <br />
               which is in- force in the Northwest at the 
               <br />
               present moment. The argument of the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule)

               the schools was prejudicial to their efﬁ- 
               <br />
               ciency. He went so far as to say that in- 
               <br />
               forma-tion which he has gathered permitted 
               <br />
