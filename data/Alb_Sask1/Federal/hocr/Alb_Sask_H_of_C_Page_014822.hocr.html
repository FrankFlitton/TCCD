               it is amazing that to some men experience 
               <br />
               brings no wisdom. There is Mr. George Brown 
               <br />
               who used to ride so high a Protestant horse 
               <br />
               in the old days in Upper Canada. He wound 
               <br />
               up his agitation against separate schools by 
               <br />
               guaranteeing their continued existence and 
               <br />
               support by means of a clause of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act based upon one of the 
               <br />
               resolutions of the Quebec conference to which 
               <br />
               he was a consenting party. By their North-

               <br />
               regard as eminently wise, and with the ex- 
               <br />
               perience which he had had, Mr. Brown should 
               <br />
               have been the last man to oppose it. Yet he 
               <br />
               had not only opposed the principle itself, but 
               <br />
               appealed to the British North America Act as 
               <br />
               containing sound legal objections to the course 
               <br />
               proposed to be taken by the government. He 
               <br />
               said: He thought this provision was quite 
               <br />
               contrary to the British North America Act.

               Nothing was more clear than that each pro-
