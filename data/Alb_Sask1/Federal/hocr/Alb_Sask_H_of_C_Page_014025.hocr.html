               <br />
               were heard 50 years ago. The arguments 
               <br />
               we hear to-day are but the attenuated echo 
               <br />
               of the strong denunciations of Mr. Brown, 
               <br />
               which were heard by our fathers two gen- 
               <br />
               erations ago. But the views of Mr. Brown 
               <br />
               did not prevail, and notwithstanding his 
               <br />
               efforts, he was not in the House when 
               <br />
               the law of 1863 passed, which conﬁrmed to 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic minority of Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cane</span>

               View of the agitation then maintained by 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown in favour of representation by 
               <br />
               population, it is perhaps not inopportune to 
               <br />
               analyse that vote. The Bill of 1863 in 
               <br />
               favour of separate schools was carried by 
               <br />
               a vote of 80 against a minority of 22. Of 
               <br />
               this minority of 22, 21 belonged to the 
               <br />
               province of Upper Canada, and of the ma- 
               <br />
               jority of 80. 33 belonged to that province, 
               <br />
               so that, leaving the vote of Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"an-"l“</span>

               aside, taking only the vote of Upper Canada, 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd that the law of 1863 was carried by 
               <br />
               a majority of the representatives of Upper 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> at that time. This is signiﬁcant. 
               <br />
               Mr. Brown at that time was carrying on the 
               <br />
               strong agitation which he had maintained 
               <br />
               for years, and which he continued to main- 
               <br />
               tain in favour, within the constitution of 
               <br />
               that day, of representation by population. 
               <br />
               Sir, if we review the events of that period 
               <br />
               of our history, we must all admit that the 
               <br />
               constitution of 1841, which united Upper 
               <br />
               Canada and Lower Canada, was radically 
               <br />
               faulty. It was so constructed that it, never 
               <br />
               gave satisfaction to either province. Lower 
               <br />
               Canada from the ﬁrst looked upon it as an 
               <br />
               instrument of oppression, designed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de</span> 
               <br />
               piive her of some of those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whim</span> 
               <br />
               she held dearer than life. Yet she it was 
               <br />
               who in after years held to that constitution, 
               <br />
               and defended it against reforms which she 
               <br />
               regarded as fraught with still <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">creator</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dun»</span> 
               <br />
               gers to herself. Upper Canada accepted 
               <br />
               that constitution, not with any enthusiasm. 
               <br />
               but because it relieved her for the time 
               <br />
               from serious ﬁnancial embarrassments. But 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, before many years had 
               <br />
               elapsed commenced also to ﬁnd herself op- 
               <br />
               pressed by the clumsy clauses which it con- 
               <br />
               tained, and sought relief in the agita— 
               <br />
               tion of Mr. Brown in favour of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represen-</span> 
               <br />
               tation by population. The radical fault of 
               <br />
               the constitution of 1841 was that it 
               <br />
               was neither federative nor legislative. It 
               <br />
               united two provinces, but kept them as sep- 
               <br />
               arate entities, gave them the same number 
               <br />
               of members, provided against an increase 
               <br />
               of representation, and allowed only a 
               <br />
               single executive. This equality in repre- 
               <br />
               sentation coupled with a single executive 
               <br />
               was a defect which no expedients thereafter 
               <br />
               could altogether overcome. As soon as Mr.

               but simply from expediency. Mr. Lafon-

               <br />
               would grow in population faster than Lower 
               <br />

               ting an immigration which Lower Canada 
               <br />
               did not, Upper Canada would soon be the 
               <br />
               stronger province and therefore all the ar-

               <br />
               the repeal of that portion of the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion on behalf of Lower Canada, would react 
               <br />
               against her. The predictions of Mr. Lafon- 
               <br />
               taine as to the movement of popula- 
               <br />

               <br />
               came the more populous province. Then Mr.

               <br />
               years, with never abating vigour. He opened

               day came in 1864 when there were two 
               <br />
               hostile majorities. one from Lower Canada 
               <br />
               and one from Upper Canada, facing each 
               <br />
               other and unyielding. There was a dead- 
               <br />
               lock, and the government of the Queen 
               <br />
               was almost impossible if not actually im- 
               <br />
               possible in the province of Canada. That 
               <br />
               was Mr. Brown’s opportunity, and he seized 
               <br />

               events must admit that on that occasion Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown rose to the highest stature of states- 
               <br />
               manship. He was not satisﬁed to take 
               <br />
               advantage of the occasion simply to obtain 
               <br />
               the realization of the principle which he had 
               <br />
               at heart, but he made it the basis for a union

               of all the British provinces on the conti-
