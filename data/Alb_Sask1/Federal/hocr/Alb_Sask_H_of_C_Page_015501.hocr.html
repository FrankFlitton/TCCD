               (111'. Barker) is satisﬁed, I am.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I certainly thought 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman (Mr. Belcourt) was de— 
               <br />
               ﬁning separate schools as denominational 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thOOlS—I</span> thought that was part of his 
               <br />
               argument. If I understood him wrongly, 
               <br />
               1 am sorry. But I followed him carefully 
               <br />
               and understood him to say—and he was 
               <br />
               support-ed by the hon. member for Mont- 
               <br />
               magny <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> A. Lavergne)—that separate 
               <br />
               schools meant necessarily denominational 
               <br />
               schools, and therefore, as he said, the word 
               <br />
               ‘separate' in section 11 of the Act of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1875</span> meant not merely a school separated, 
               <br />

               but meant a denominational school. If I 
               <br />
               did not hear the hon. gentleman make 
               <br />
               that argument my ears deceived me. As

               to the misunderstanding which occurred 
               <br />
               between the hon. gentleman and my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from St. John (Mr. Stockton), I cer- 
               <br />
               tainly did understand the member for Ot- 
               <br />
               tawa to say this, in answer to a question 
               <br />
               of mine: I asked him whether the major- 
               <br />
               ity mentioned in the ﬁrst part of section 
               <br />
               11 of the Act of 187:"), was a religious maj- 
               <br />
               ority, and the hon. gentleman said, yes. 
               <br />
               Then I asked him whether, in a community 
               <br />
               where there were 1,000 Roman Catholics, 
               <br />
               and 500 Protestants and 2,000 Mormons, 
               <br />
               the 1,000 Catholics would be the majority 
               <br />
               within the meaning of the statute, and he 
               <br />
               said, yes. I do not think my hon. friend 
               <br />
               will deny having given that answer. It 
               <br />
               seems to me a very extraordinary result. 
               <br />
               For example, in a community of 1,000 
               <br />
               Mormons, not having a school established, 
               <br />
               ir‘ one Roman Catholic or one Protestant 
               <br />
               should enter. then the one Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               or the one Protestant would be the major- 
               <br />
