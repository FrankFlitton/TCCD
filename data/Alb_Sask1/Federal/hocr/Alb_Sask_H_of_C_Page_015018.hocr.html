               will bear with me when they hear the names 
               <br />
               of those whose words I desire to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give.</span> 
               <br />
               First I would refer to the late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rev.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">D12,</span> 
               <br />
               Robertson, and I am sure, when I mention 
               <br />
               his name, those hon. members who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belongr</span> 
               <br />
               to the. Presbyterian church—and I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">glad</span> 
               <br />
               to say there are a large number in this 
               <br />
               House who belong to it—and all the adhe~ 
               <br />
               rents of that church throughout the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coun-</span> 
               <br />
               try, will receive almost as ﬁnal evidence 
               <br />
               any utterance of Dr. Robertson with regard 
               <br />
               to the Northwest. Dr. Robertson became a 
               <br />
               superintendent of missions of the Presby- 
               <br />
               terian church in 1882 and continued in that 
               <br />
               work until his death in 1902. And I believe 
               <br />
               that I state only the simple truth when I 
               <br />
               say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> in the twenty years of his service 
               <br />
               no man ever did more for the Northwest, 
               <br />
               or said more for the Northwest, than this 
               <br />
               great man whose name I have given. Those 
               <br />
               of us who have had the honour and pleas- 
               <br />
               ure of receiving him at our own ﬁresides 
               <br />
               kiiow that his whole conversation was of 
               <br />
               the Northwest. And those of us who have 
               <br />
               attended the courts of the church to which 
               <br />
               he belonged, know that his great theme in 
               <br />
               the courts of our church was the 
               <br />
               building up of the Northwest and 
               <br />
               the extending of religious ordinances 
               <br />
               to the people of that great country. 
               <br />
               Dr. Robertson was a broad man. Dr. Rob— 
               <br />
               ertson was a man who could see past his 
               <br />
               own church. I have heard him say time 
               <br />
               and again that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> was glad to see other 
               <br />
               churches in the Northwest, he wanted other 
               <br />
               churches to prosper, but one. of his greatest 
               <br />
