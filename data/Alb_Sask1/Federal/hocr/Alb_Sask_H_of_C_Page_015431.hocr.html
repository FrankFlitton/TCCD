               Mr. P. TALBOT. I would like to take 
               <br />
               up a few minutes explaining the basis on 
               <br />
               which I reason out this matter from a prac- 
               <br />
               tical standpoint. As nearly as I could es- 
               <br />
               timate, the area of the two provinces will 
               <br />
               be about 300 million acres or perhaps slight- 
               <br />
               ly more than that. We know that the 
               <br />
               northern and eastern part of Athabnska and 
               <br />
               the northeastern part of the old <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Saskatche-</span> 
               <br />
               wan district will never be ﬁt for actual set- 
               <br />
               tlement. I think it is a very liberal esti- 
               <br />
               mate to say that we have 200,000,000 acres 
               <br />
               of agricultural land in those two provinces. 
               <br />
               Now, since the Dominion government con- 
               <br />
               tinues the policy of giving free grants to 
               <br />
               settlers or homesteaders, we actually in the 
               <br />
               provinces get half the land. We get the 
               <br />
               even—numbered sections just as thoroughly, 
               <br />
               just as completely as if we got all the 
               <br />
               land and were to continue the policy of 
               <br />
               giving free homesteads. That leaves 
               <br />
               then 100,000,000 acres of odd-numbered 
               <br />
               sections which will be retained by the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government. We must remember 
               <br />
               that the odd-numbered sections 11 to 29 al- 
               <br />
               ready belong to us by a previous arrange- 
               <br />
               ment. These are the schools lands. That 
               <br />
               will make 11,000,000 acres of that land 
               <br />
               which clearly belongs to the province, in 
               <br />
               spite of anything we can do at present. 
               <br />
               That leaves to the Dominion government 
               <br />
               really 89,000,000 acres, that is 89,000,000 
               <br />
               of odd-numbered sections. But there have 
               <br />
               been alienated to railway and colonization 
               <br />
               companies some 30,000,000 acres of these 
               <br />
               odd—numbered sections; that leaves a bal- 
               <br />
               ance of 59,000,000 acres.

               Mr. SPROULE. This return which I 
               <br />
               hold in my hand only gives 25,000,000 Of 
               <br />
               acres alienated, namely, Alberta, 13,000,000;

               Mr. P. TALBOT. In addition to that a

               large amount was given to colonization 
               <br />
               companies, so that you may take 30,000,000 
               <br />
               acres as about correct. That will leave 
               <br />
               59,000,000 acres in the hands of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government for the two provinces. 
               <br />
               So that when we made that calculation of 
               <br />
               25,000,000 acres for each province. we were 
               <br />
               not very far astray. If hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite will look into this matter carefully,
