               taught us that desirable end can best

               be obtained by the union of a vigorous

               immigration policy with a system of free 
               <br />
               homestead grants of 160 acres of land. I 
               <br />
               think it can hardly be denied that one of 
               <br />
               the strongest features of our immigration 
               <br />
               policy is the free homestead grant of 160 
               <br />
               acres of land, and it is the part of our im- 
               <br />
               migration policy which has the greatest at- 
               <br />
               traction for the largest number of settlers. 
               <br />
               1f the provinces were to take over these

               lands, would the free homestead grant be 
               <br />
               done away with? Not necessarily. The

               <br />
               Borden) and the hon. member for Marquette 
               <br />
               (Mr. W. J. Roche) have suggested that these 
               <br />
               lands be handed over to the provinces with 
               <br />
               the provision attached that the provinces 
               <br />
               shall continue the tree homestead grants.

               But, Mr. Speaker, if the system of free 
               <br />
               homesteads is to be continued and these 
               <br />
               lands given away to the settlers, how would 
               <br />
               the provinces obtain the revenue necessary, 
               <br />
               not only to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁset</span> the amount which this 
               <br />
               Bill provides in lieu of lands, but also the 
               <br />
               amount necessary to cover the expense of 
               <br />
               administration. As has been forcibly point- 
               <br />
               ed out by the hon. member for Edmon- 
               <br />
               ton <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Oliver) the interest the provinces 
               <br />
               would have in these lands if they were 
               <br />
               handed over would be to obtain there- 
               <br />
               from a revenue, and this could not be 
               <br />
               done if the lands were given to the settlers 
               <br />
               free. If the lands were not given to the 
               <br />
               settlers free, but were reserved for sale, it 
               <br />
               cannot be doubted that a serious check to 
               <br />
               the rapid settlement of these lands would 
               <br />
               be administered. It has been suggested 
               <br />
               that the people of these provinces being on 
               <br />
               the ground are in as good a position, if not 
               <br />
               better, to manage these land-s than the fed- 
               <br />
               eral authorities, that they are just as much 
               <br />
               interested in having the lands settled, and 
               <br />
               that they are just as capable of handling 
               <br />
               them as is this government. I grant all 
               <br />
               that, Mr. Speaker. It is perfectly true 
               <br />
               that we in the Northwest Territories are 
               <br />
               more interested in the development of that 
               <br />
               country than anybody else can be; and 
               <br />
               rightly or wrongly, we believe that we are 
               <br />
               just as capable of managing our own lands 
               <br />
               as the other provinces are of managing their 
               <br />
               lands, or as this government is of managing 
               <br />
               its lands. But while that is true, we are 
               <br />
               not capable, neither is this government cap- 
               <br />
               able, nor is any other government capable, of 
               <br />
               obtaining from those lands the revenue ne- 
               <br />
               cessary to carry on the administration of 
               <br />
               the provinces and at the same time give the 
               <br />

               Now, Mr. Speaker, a few words as to the 
               <br />
               educational clauses contained in this Bill. 
               <br />
               These clauses make provision for conﬁrming 
               <br />
               and continuing the present school law in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. This law was 
               <br />
               passed by the legislature, if I recollect 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arigpht,</span> in 1892, and was subsequently con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed and consolidated in 1901; and all 
               <br />
               this Bill asks parliament to do is to conﬁrm 
               <br />
               and continue that school law which has 
               <br />
               been in force since 1892. We are asked to 
               <br />
               conﬁrm that law and make it part and 
               <br />
               parcel of the constitution of the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. Now, Sir, whether this parliament 
               <br />
               ought to conﬁrm and continue that school 
               <br />
               law and make it part and parcel of the con- 
               <br />
               stitution of the new provinces involves. it 
               <br />
               seems to me, the consideration of two very 
               <br />
               important questions; one is a question of 
               <br />
               law and the other is a question of policy. 
               <br />
               The one involves an examination of the 
               <br />
               constitutional and legal rights, both of the 
               <br />
               Dominion and of the provinces, as affected 
               <br />
               by this Bill; the other involves a consider— 
               <br />
               ation of the merits of the ordinances them— 
               <br />
               selves as the foundation of the future 
               <br />
               school system of the new provinces, includ- 
               <br />
               ing therein a consideration whether or not, 
               <br />
               under all the circumstances of the case, it is 
               <br />
               just and right and reasonable that provision 
               <br />
               should be made to preserve to the minority 
               <br />
               the rights and privileges which they have 
               <br />
               up to the present time enjoyed under the 
               <br />
               ordinances. Now, as to the constitutional 
               <br />
               and legal questions involved. It seems to 
               <br />
               me, these questions are very easy to ask, 
               <br />
               but not so easy to answer. The ﬁrst ques- 
               <br />
               tion is : Has this parliament a right to estab- 
               <br />
               lish new provinces out of that western 
               <br />
               territory and to give them such a con- 
               <br />
               stitution as it deems best? There is no 
               <br />
               question about our right to create provmces 
               <br />
               out of the Territories. But there does seem 
               <br />
               to be a great conﬂict of opinion as _to the 
               <br />
               constitution which this parliament is em~ 
               <br />
               powered to grant. If I understand aright 
               <br />
               the argument of the leader of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, his position is, that this parliament 
               <br />
               cannot create a new province and give to 
               <br />
