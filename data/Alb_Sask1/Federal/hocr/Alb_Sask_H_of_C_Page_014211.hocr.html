               make to the right hon. gentleman who leads 
               <br />
               the government, and it is this: I find in 
               <br />
               this clause of the Bill relating to the com- 
               <br />
               pensation for lands that such compensation 
               <br />
               is based upon an estimated acreage and 
               <br />
               upon a price, and the price put upon that 
               <br />
               estimated acreage is, I think, $1.50 an acre. 
               <br />
               I have no fault to ﬁnd with the amount 
               <br />
               which has been decided upon, and which the 
               <br />
               government proposes to give. I think it is 
               <br />
               reasonable and liberal, I think it is gen- 
               <br />
               erous, and 1 am quite prepared to agree 
               <br />
               with it. But I submit that the amount 
               <br />
               should be fixed arbitrarily, it should not be 
               <br />
               ﬁxed by a reference to the number of mil- 
               <br />
               lions of acres of land, nor the price per 
               <br />
               acre. The moment I laid my eyes upon that 
               <br />
               clause I felt it was a mistake, and I felt 
               <br />
               that just as soon as it was published the 
               <br />
               representatives of the Territories would 
               <br />
               say: You have by this clause admitted 
               <br />
               that we are entitled to the beneﬁcial owner- 
               <br />
               ship of these lands, you have admitted that 
               <br />
               we are the owners of these lands in fact, 
               <br />
               beneﬁcially at least if not in law, by the 
               <br />
               very fact that you are basing the compen- 
               <br />
               sation you give us upon the acreage of the 
               <br />
               provinces. And so within a few days after 
               <br />
               the Bill was published and before parlia- 
               <br />
               ment gave assent to it, our good friend Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain seized upon this phase of the Bill 
               <br />
               to present an objection to the right hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman</span> who leads the government. He 
               <br />
               immediately took the ground which it must 
               <br />
               be admitted he could take with some de- 
               <br />
               gree of force, that by that provision we ad- 
               <br />
               mitted, impliedly at least, the right of the 
               <br />
               Territories to claim that they are the bene- 
               <br />
               ﬁcial owners of the land. 
               <br />

               What would be the effect? The effect 
               <br />
               would be that if this passes into a statute 
               <br />
               it becomes an irrevocable Act because it 
               <br />

               question of the re-adjustment of the ﬁnan- 
               <br />
               cial arrangements and we will have a ques- 
               <br />

               rassment to succeeding governments in the

               <br />
               I believe we are making a mistake

               a matter of detail in future years and

               in the Northwest Territories, and -I must

               of the Bill that is before the House; that 
               <br />
               is to say, that the subject of irrigation for 
               <br />
               the present should be retained within the 
               <br />
               control of the federal government. The 
               <br />
               reasons can be given in a few words and to 
               <br />
               my mind they are absolutely conclusive.

               <br />
               subject of discussion between Canada and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’the</span> United States and international complica— 
               <br />
               tions have already arisen in regard to these 
               <br />
               streams. Obviously, if irrigation were un- 
               <br />
               der the administration of two provincial 
               <br />
               governments, it would be diﬂicult to adjust 
               <br />
               a question such as that. In addition to that 
               <br />
               questions are going to arise in a compara-

               tively short time between the ’residents

               <br />
               ﬂow from one into the other. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\It</span> would seem 
               <br />
               to me most desirable, until the diﬂiculties

               respecting international questions and the 
               <br />

               system is further developed and a body 
               <br />
               of law upon the subject is built up, that 
               <br />
               the control should remain in the hands of 
               <br />
               the federal government. When a few years 
               <br />
               have elapsed, when the system is more 
               <br />
               fully developed, when it becomes a matter 
               <br />
               merely of local administration then there 
               <br />
               seems to be no good reason why the subject 
               <br />
               should not be relegated to the provincial gov-
