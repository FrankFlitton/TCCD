               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«SPROU’L‘E.</span> That is the question I 
               <br />
               asked. This Bill proposes to hand it over 
               <br />
               to one church. My contention is that no 
               <br />
               church should be allowed to control it. In 
               <br />
               my opinion it is as improper to give the 
               <br />
               control of education to the Methodist church 
               <br />
               or the Presbyterian or the Baptist or the 
               <br />
               Luthern or the Mormon as it would be to 
               <br />
               give it to the Catholic Church—they are all 
               <br />
               ir. the same category according to my judg— 
               <br />
               ment. The state should provide the means 
               <br />
               of education and should control education. 
               <br />
               We should have a state system of educa- 
               <br />

               church has any improper control over them

               principle involved in taking away from the 
               <br />
