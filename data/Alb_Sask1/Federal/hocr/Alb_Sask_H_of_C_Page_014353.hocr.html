               troduced that Bill. I go further. Being 
               <br />
               convinced that the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) had had a great deal to do with 
               <br />
               .the framing of this clause 16, and recog- 
               <br />
               nizing in the manner in which that clause 
               <br />
               was drafted the high qualiﬁcations which 
               <br />
               we all know that hon. gentleman to possess, 
               <br />
               I thought that I recognized in it a kind of 
               <br />
               vindication of the position taken by the Lib- 
               <br />
               eral party in 1896 upon a similar question. 
               <br />
               To my mind it was the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thine</span> the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman could do. and I shall say 
               <br />
               why. In the discussion which is taking 
               <br />
               place, I was not here one evening when 
               <br />
               my hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) took some part in it and made 
               <br />
               some remarks, which of course do not give 
               <br />
               any idea of what he will say when he 
               <br />
               speaks at length on the measure. But some 
               <br />
               hon. members have said that clause 93 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act settles the 
               <br />
               case. I think that is pretty well the opin- 
               <br />
               ion expressed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by‘</span> my hon. friend from St. 
               <br />
               John and Iberville <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Demers). The mo- 
               <br />
               ment a territory becomes a province. they 
               <br />
               argue, it comes in with whatever system 
               <br />
               of education it enjoys at the time of the 
               <br />
               union. Others take the opposite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view</span> and 
               <br />
               say that clause 93 does not go so far. And 
               <br />
               I imagine that it was in order to dispel any 
               <br />
               doubt on that point. that the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice drafted this clause 16 as it appears 
               <br />
               in the original Bill.

               )Ir. BERGE‘RON. I contend that, in re- 
               <br />
               lation to the question before the House, 
               <br />
               this was the law and is the law. And, 
               <br />
               while I am prepared to rely upon my own 
               <br />
               opinion in that matter, I would refer to 
               <br />
               the Bill brought down by the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister (Sir “’ilfrid Laurier) in support of 
               <br />
               my position. What is clause 16 of the 
               <br />
               Bill now before 11s ? It is in effect a re- 
               <br />
               enactment of the section of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act. It was put in the Bill 
               <br />
               as originally presented by the Prime Min— 
               <br />
               ister as a matter of precaution—in case 
               <br />
               any person might otherwise carry the inat- 
               <br />
               for to the courts and plead that we had 
               <br />
               not made it apply to those new provinces 
               <br />
               by an Act of the parliament of Canada. 
               <br />
               Now, section 16 says:
