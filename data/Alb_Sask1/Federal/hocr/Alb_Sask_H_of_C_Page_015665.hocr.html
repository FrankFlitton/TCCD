               the Minister of Justice was counting all the

               shown in the geography published by the

               in the southern and central part of Alberta 
               <br />
               preferred to devote their time to what was

               more proﬁtable, the cattle industry, it was 
               <br />
               not a farming country, but if they would

               look to the records of the department they

               gary, for instance, that great improvements

               have occurred, that grain is being grown 
               <br />
               and perhaps larger yields per acre can be 
               <br />
               shown than in any other part of the North-

               ranches consist of a very great area, but I 
               <br />
               would point out to him that in Lethbridge 
               <br />
               and Cardston there is a huge irrigation

               or the Great Northwestern Irrigation scheme 
               <br />
               comprising 1,500,000 acres. The bulk of that 
               <br />
               land 'is all taken up. It is a thickly peopled 
               <br />
               portion of the country. Half a mile from the

               show nothing in regard to northern consti-

               Four hundred thousand acres of that have

               say that the argument which is made that
