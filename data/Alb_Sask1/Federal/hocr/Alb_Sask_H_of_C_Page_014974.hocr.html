               Now, an expression has been used in this de- 
               <br />
               bate which is very appropriate, namely, the 
               <br />
               opinion of the man on the street; I 
               <br />
               think that phrase was introduced by 
               <br />
               the ex—Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton), and I say that the man on the 
               <br />
               street looks upon this question which we are 
               <br />
               discussing here to-day in precisely the same 
               <br />
               light as the question which was discussed 
               <br />
               in 1896 was looked upon at that time—as a 
               <br />
               vexed question which should be kept out 
               <br />
               of Dominion politics, if possible. I am going 
               <br />
               to point out why the public are aroused in 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario and why they are 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">illsltiﬁed</span> in the stand they take. Some hon.

               gentlemen on the other side of the House 
               <br />
               have tried to minimize that agitation and to 
               <br />
               show that there is no public feeling on the 
               <br />
               subject; but I believe I shall better be able 
               <br />
               to retain the respect of my fellow members 
               <br />
               from other provinces by stating the exact 
               <br />
               position of the case rather than by attempt- 
               <br />
               ing to minimize the facts. In 1895 the ex- 
               <br />
               )iinis-ter of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) stumped 
               <br />
               in the province of Ontario on the Manitoba 
               <br />
               issue. The Remedial Bill was referred to, 
               <br />
               but the discussion at that time resolved it- 
               <br />
               self into one on the principle of separate 
               <br />
               schools in the province of Manitoba. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brandon came into federal 
               <br />
               politics and became a cabinet minister 
               <br />
               upon that question and upon no other. 
               <br />
               His views were known to the public and to 
               <br />
               his colleagues, and he took strong ground 
               <br />
               upon the question in the various speeches he 
               <br />
               made. The people of the province of On- 
               <br />
               tario believed at that time that the premier 
               <br />
               shared the views expressed by him in the 
               <br />
               county of Haldimand and other places where 
               <br />
               he spoke. The people of the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario and the people of other parts of this 
               <br />
               country—and I am borne out in this state- 
               <br />
               ment by what the ex-Minister of the Inter- 
               <br />
               ior said in this House a few days ago—be- 
               <br />
               lieved that the present Prime Minister pre- 
               <br />
               vented separate schools as they existed from 
               <br />

               who were against separate schools in Maui- 
               <br />
               toba. The ex-Minister ot‘ the Interior said 
               <br />
               in his speech that the Prime Minister stood
