               In the ﬁrst place the Act of 1875 could not 
               <br />
               be restricted by an ordinance. I take issue 
               <br />
               with him there, and I base my argument 
               <br />
               in that regard upon very good authority. 
               <br />
               namely, the authority in the ﬁrst place of 
               <br />
               Sir John Thompson himself, and in the 
               <br />
               second place that of the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />

               <br />
               dealing with this question in his report 
               <br />
               of the 10th January, 1890, said this :

               The ordinance respecting schools does not 
               <br />
               contain the provision that the statute requires 
               <br />
               it to contain. but merely contains the provision 
               <br />
               that the minority may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establish</span> a separate 
               <br />
               school in an organized public school district, 
               <br />

               necessary to point out that the provisions of
