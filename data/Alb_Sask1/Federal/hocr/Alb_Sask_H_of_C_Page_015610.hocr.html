               <br />
               such that if it is to be represented adequa- 
               <br />
               tely and intelligently. or in other words if 
               <br />
               it is to be represented at all in the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture of that new province, it must be re- 
               <br />
               presented by two members and therefore it 
               <br />
               should be divided into two constituencies. 
               <br />
               We do not expect our hon. friends to see 
               <br />
               the matter as we see it. We have had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> experience of the last three days of dis- 
               <br />
               cussion to inform us on that point. We 
               <br />
               canonly state and restate the position we 
               <br />
               have taken and hope that it will commend 
               <br />
               itself to the majority of the House. Though 
               <br />
               perhaps we are not able to bring our friends 
               <br />
               to view this matter as we view it from our 
               <br />
               statement of the case, perhaps we can in- 
               <br />
               duce them to view it in something the same 
               <br />
               light by comparison with other instances 
               <br />
               as for instance when the Redistribution Bill 
               <br />
               relating to the seats of this parliament was 
               <br />
               passed in 1903. In the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories at that time, according to the census 
               <br />
               there was a matter of a little over 150,000 
               <br />
               people, and according to the unit of popula- 
               <br />
               tion these 150,000 people were entitled to 
               <br />
               six members, but this House saw ﬁt in its 
               <br />
               wisdom—I thin-k properly taking into con- 
               <br />
               sideration all the different interests to be 
               <br />
               represented and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> probable increase in 
               <br />
               population—to grant ten members to the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories instead of only six 
               <br />
               which they would have been entitled to on 
               <br />
               the unit of population. The principle is 
               <br />
               exactly the same in regard to the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska. The hon. member may sug- 
               <br />
               gest that the conditions are more strained 
               <br />
               in regard to the district of Athabaska, but 
               <br />
               on that point he has not any better infor- 
               <br />
               mation than we have, and our information 
               <br />
               is that the conditions are not strained in 
               <br />
               the district of Atha-baska. We regret very 
               <br />
               much that we have not later census infor- 
               <br />
               mation than is available, but we have other 
               <br />
               information in regard to the increase of 
               <br />
               population, in regard to the increase of trade 
               <br />
               and in regard to development generally 
               <br />
               which leads us to believe that there is a 
               <br />
               comparatively large population in the west~ 
               <br />
               ern part of Athabaska to-day. The fact
