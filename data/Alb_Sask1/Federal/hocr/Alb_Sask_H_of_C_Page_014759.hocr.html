               educational clauses in this Bill have already 
               <br />

               <br />
               should not be further altered. If it is the

               intention of the government to change these 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               not put it 01f, allowing this bitterness to in-

               There is one gentleman to whom, I think.

               the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               will owe a deep apology in connection with 
               <br />
               this Autonomy Bill. I refer to his admirer— 
               <br />

               Prime Minister of Canada. It is a great 
               <br />
               misfortune for Mr. Willison that he had not 
               <br />
               a full knowledge of his subject before he 
               <br />
               wrote the right hon. gentleman’s biography. 
               <br />
               The man wrote the life of that strange dual 
               <br />
               character Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde knew 
               <br />
               from the very beginning of his writing the 
               <br />
               two sides of the man, and so was able to 
               <br />
               make his biography complete in every part. 
               <br />
               But Mr. Willison in his 864 pages, saw only 
               <br />
               one side of the character he was portraying. 
               <br />
               And now he has to undo all he has Written

               much of the time of the House in discussing 
               <br />
               the matter before the chair, but I would like 
               <br />
               to make a few observations with regard to 
               <br />
               the constitutional aspect of these Bills. The 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, as we know. were 
               <br />
               admitted into the Dominion in 1871, pur- 
               <br />
               suant to section 146 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. When these Territories were 
               <br />
               admitted into Canada, they did not come in 
               <br />
               in the same way as other provinces had 
               <br />
               done. They did not come in as the British 
               <br />
               North America Act of 1867 evidently as- 
               <br />
               sumed new territory would come in. They 
               <br />
               came in as Territories and not as provinces. 
               <br />
               and. coming in in that way, it became neces— 
               <br />
               sary to have an Imperial Act passed for the 
               <br />
               purpose of proyiding for the peace‘, order, 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good"</span> government of these new Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. Had they come in as provinces, the 
               <br />
               machinery of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act would have applied to them. The Act 
               <br />
               that was passed to meet this case is known 
               <br />
               as the British North America Act of 1871. 
               <br />
               By section 4 of that Act, it is expressly 
               <br />

               known as the Northwest Territories Act of 
               <br />
               1875. Powers of local self—government were 
               <br />
               given these Territories, so that they could 
               <br />

               uLet us consider for a moment the circum- 
               <br />
               stances surrounding the Act of 1875, the 
               <br />
               original Act granting local self—government 
               <br />
               to the Territories, so far as educational 
               <br />
               matters are concerned. We know that the 
               <br />
               Bill which. when passed. became the Act of 
               <br />
               187.3. was brought down by the then Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, Hon. Alexander Mackenzie. It 
               <br />
               had no educational clauses. However, Hon. 
               <br />
               Edward Blake, whom we all know to be a 
               <br />
               staunch Protestant, pointed out the fact that 
               <br />
               the Bill did not contain any provision in re- 
               <br />
               spect of separate schools. Accordingly the 
               <br />
               suggestion was made to introduce section 
               <br />
               11, giving to the minority, Protestant or 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic, the right to establish sep-
