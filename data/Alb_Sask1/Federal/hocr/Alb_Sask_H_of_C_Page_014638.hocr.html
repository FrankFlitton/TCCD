               from the public eye. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               now stands up as the defender of the 
               <br />
               episcopate of the province of Quebec; but 
               <br />
               what did we see this afternoon ? We saw 
               <br />
               him applauding the abuse that fell from! 
               <br />
               the lips of the hon. member for South York 
               <br />
               (Mr. W. F. Maclean). Thank God, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, the clergy and the episcopate of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec have not fallen so low 
               <br />
               as to require the defence of the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man. The clergy of Quebec stand to—day, 
               <br />
               as they have always stood, highly respected 
               <br />
               and loved by every French Canadian 
               <br />
               and even by every Protestant of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec and other provinces. 
               <br />
               What was the use of the hon. gentle— 
               <br />
               man going so far back into ancient history 
               <br />
               as to talk about the elections of 1896‘ '2 Is 
               <br />
               that the question before the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today?</span> 
               <br />
               He wanted to know what was the reason 
               <br />
               the Papal ablegate was sent to Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1.</span> 
               <br />
               No man knows the reason better than the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. He spoke of a certain? 
               <br />
               document to which the name of the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice was attached. He knows 
               <br />
               where that document was prepared. He 
               <br />
               knows that it was prepared in the city of 
               <br />
               Quebec by two leading Tories, Mr. Chapais 
               <br />
               and Mr. L. P. Pelletier, who imposed that 
               <br />
               document on the episcopate. I remember 
               <br />
               very well, in the election of 1896, when the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of this House was in the parish‘ 
               <br />
               of :St. Raphael in my county, when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.’</span> 
               <br />
               Landry, Mr. Pelletier and Mr. Chapais 
               <br />
               came with that document before a couple’ 
               <br />
               of thousand of my electors,_ and asked' 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman to sign it. What 
               <br />
               was his answer <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> He said: Go with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               document to your leaders and get their 
               <br />
               signatures to it, and come to me afterwards, 
               <br />
               and I will then tell you what I will do. What! 
               <br />
               was done to get some gentlemen to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sign‘</span> 
               <br />
               that document? I remember when Dr. 
               <br />
               Vaillancourt was ﬁghting the battles of 
               <br />
               the Liberal party in the county of Dorchester 
               <br />
               adjoining mine, Mr. Pelletier, the great 
               <br />
               friend of the hon. member for Beauharnois 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bergeron), went to Dr. Vallaincourt 
               <br />
               and said to him, ‘if you sign this docu- 
               <br />
               ment, we will allow you to be elected by 
               <br />
               acclamation.’ Dr. Vallaincourt signed it, 
               <br />
               and the next day or the day after he had- 
               <br />
               an opponent. What was the use of Liberals 
               <br />
               signing a document? Did we make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any-.</span> 
               <br />
               thing as a party by doing so? Was not 
               <br />
               the clergy against us from beginning to 
               <br />
               end in 1896 ? Did we gain any votes in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec by signing that 
               <br />
               document? On the contrary. What was 
               <br />
               the reason the people of Quebec as well 
               <br />
               as the people of every other province rose 
               <br />
               in their might on that occasion and carried 
               <br />
               the Liberals into power ? It was because 
               <br />
               homes were deserted and windows and 
               <br />
               doors barred up, and where there had been 
               <br />
               happiness before there was nothing but 
               <br />
               wilderness and desolation. It was because

               <br />
               that a change had to come. There was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               tress for the farmers everywhere, and the 
               <br />
               people could see no prospect under Con- 
               <br />
               servative rule except what had happened 
               <br />
               for eighteen or twenty years before—our 
               <br />
               people leaving Canada and going to the 
               <br />
               other side of the line for the bread which 
               <br />
               they were unable to earn on their own soil. 
               <br />
               That was the principal reason. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Beauharnois wants to involve 
               <br />
               the clergy of the province of Quebec again 
               <br />
               in political conﬂicts when we are leaving 
               <br />
               them alone. When he says there is no anal- 
               <br />
               ogy between the fact that Archbishop Taché 
               <br />
               was brought from Rome to Canada and the 
               <br />
               fact that of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{Papal</span> ablegate being 
               <br />
               brought from Rome to Canada, we all know 
               <br />
               that there is an analogy in one respect. 
               <br />
               Archbishop Taché, before he died, left a 
               <br />
               letter, which is a portion of his will, in 
               <br />
               which he said that he had come to Canada 
               <br />
               at the request of the leader of the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party; and he said: ‘Promises 
               <br />
               were made to me, and the cause of my pre- 
               <br />
               mature death at this moment is that those 
               <br />
               promises have never been fulﬁlled, and I 
               <br />
               have been deceived by the leaders of the 
               <br />
               Conservative party.’ That is where the 
               <br />
               difference is, and that is where there is no 
               <br />
               analogy between the two cases. The Pope 
               <br />
               was not deceived at the time we remon- 
               <br />
               strated against the straight, direct inter- 
               <br />
               vention of the clergy in political contests 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. Though we 
               <br />
               were Liberals, we were just as good Ca- 
               <br />
               tholics as my hon. friend, and why were 
               <br />
               we damned from some pulpits because we 
               <br />
               voted as Liberals '2 Why was it that in 
               <br />
               some of the pulpits some men went so far 
               <br />
               as to say: ‘Hell is red, and heaven is 
               <br />
               blue; vote for the blue, and you are all 
               <br />
               right, but if you vote for the rouge, you 
               <br />
               are damned, and damned for ever.’ Was it 
               <br />
               not time that the people of this country 
               <br />
               should have some protection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> this 
               <br />
               kind of thing, so that we might vote as free 
               <br />
               men for the party in whom we had con- 
               <br />
               fidence. I am sorry to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span> to refer to 
               <br />
               these matters, and I would not have done 
               <br />
               so if the hon. member for Beauharnois had 
               <br />
               not dragged them on to the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House. The hon. gentleman says he has 
               <br />
               been here for twenty-four years; but he 
               <br />
               forgot what happened between the twen-
