               to pay this money over to the Manitoba govern— 
               <br />
               ment is that in the crippled condition of the 
               <br />
               ﬁnances of the government, they are not in a 
               <br />
               position to give education all the assistance 
               <br />

               <br />
               the province, it ought to receive. My hon.

               friend, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) 
               <br />
               stated a moment ago. and stated very truly, 
               <br />
               that in future years, when the province of. 
               <br />
               Manitoba is more fully settled, it will be 
               <br />
               easier for it to dispense with this assistance 
               <br />
               than at the present time. But now, when the 
               <br />
               population is scattered over immense territor-

               <br />
               settlers have to struggle everywhere, now is 
               <br />
               the time when this assistance should be given. 
               <br />
               We believe it is better to take the money lying 
               <br />
               idle in the Dominion treasury to assist the

               <br />
               discovering that in years gone by, in 1878 
               <br />
               or 1879, the province had been loaned the

               but I may say that the province of Maui—
