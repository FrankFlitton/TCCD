               <br />

               in the exercise of the legislative privileges,

               a close examination of the British North 
               <br />

               <br />
               the belief that the British North America 
               <br />
               Act applies automatically and that the sev-

               this is their birthright, and that this par-

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belongs</span> to them. The same line of argu-

               <br />
               we ﬁnd eminent legal authorities differing 
               <br />
               very materially as to what are the powers 
               <br />
               which this parliament _may exercise in res-

               called upon to pass, and I must say that 
               <br />
               the fact that the government, in permitting 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada to be in such a 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing to my mind, been guilty of grave negli- 
               <br />
               gence. I feel that this parliament is in a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> peculiar position. Suppose We should 
               <br />
               pass legislation, and it should prove to be 
               <br />
               ultra vires, in what position would we rind 
               <br />
               ourselves ? This legislation will be immedi- 
               <br />
               ately contested in the courts and will even- 
               <br />
               tually go before the highest judicial au- 
               <br />
               thorities. Suppose it is declared that certain 
               <br />
               sections in this Bill, we have no power to 
               <br />
               pass ? Then where are we ? It will simply 
               <br />
               mean that this parliament will have at some 
               <br />
               future date to undertake to pass legislation 
               <br />
               and to petition the imperial parliament ask- 
               <br />
               ing that our own illegal Acts may be made 
               <br />
               legal, and once again shall we have this 
               <br />
               long, weary debate and this acrimonious 
               <br />
               discussion throughout the whole country; 
               <br />
               once again the whole question will be re- 
               <br />
               opened and reconsidered, I trust that time 
               <br />
               to a ﬁnality. The position, which this par- 
               <br />
               liament ﬁnds itself in, is that we are called 
               <br />
               upon to pass legislation of doubtful legality 
               <br />
               and the government may possibly eXpect 
               <br />
               to pass such legislation trusting that im- 
               <br />
               perial ratiﬁcation will be given to it ulti- 
               <br />
               mately. Why did not the government in 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place prepare for this contingency? 
               <br />
               Is this any new question? Has this question 
               <br />
               not been before this House and before this 
               <br />
               country for the past ﬁve years? In 1900 did 
               <br />
               not the legislature of the Northwest Terri— 
               <br />
               tories pass various resolutions asking 
               <br />
               to be created into provinces ? In 1902 did 
               <br />
               they not bring down and present to this gov- 
               <br />
