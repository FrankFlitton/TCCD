               <br />
               Minister has advanced for withholding from

               the new provinces the ownership and con~

               terfere with the policy of this government

               in reference to immigration. The section to

               vinces in the matter of immigration would 
               <br />
               be precisely the same as its relations to the 
               <br />
               other provinces of the Dominion; and if 
               <br />
               the other provinces are entitled to retain 
               <br />
               those lands. then surely there is no reason 
               <br />
               why this discrimination <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should'</span> be made 
               <br />
               against these provinces in the Northwest. 
               <br />
               It is the same, I submit, with reference to 
               <br />
               immigration as with reference to the ad— 
               <br />
               ministration of the public lands. It is the 
               <br />
               province. and the people of the province who 
               <br />
               are chieﬂy interested in immigration. If 
               <br />
               immigration ﬂows into the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. it is the people of those provinces 
               <br />
               who proﬁt by it ; and if there is an unwise 
               <br />
               policy in reference to immigration, it is the 
               <br />
               peopie of the province who suffer. So that 
               <br />
               I submit there is no reason or argument 
               <br />
               whatever in the only pretext which has been 
               <br />

               <br />
               would lend any colour to that pretext is that 
               <br />
               this government is to control absolutely the 
               <br />
               subject of immigration in the Northwest

               by the British North America Act to the
