               <br />
               long prior to any promise of legislation for 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, it was not made 
               <br />
               in the heat of debate but was made casual- 
               <br />
               ly and no doubt expressed the mind of that

               gentleman at that time and I have no doubt 
               <br />
               at this time. The hon. member for Bran—
