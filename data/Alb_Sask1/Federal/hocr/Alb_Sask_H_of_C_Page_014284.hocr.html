               Sir, as I said a minute ago, the ﬁrst im-

               portant Bill in relation to education in 
               <br />
               Great Britain was introduced in 1870. For 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst time parliament passed a measure 
               <br />
               making provision for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘suﬂicient.</span> efﬁcient

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hnd</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">puitable’</span> elemenuary education; but 
               <br />
               mark well, it was understood that the work 
               <br />
               of efﬁcient voluntary schools should not be 
               <br />
               hampered, but that their efforts should be 
               <br />
               supplemented. In those days there were 
               <br />
               men like my hon. friend from Grey who 
               <br />
               opposed denominational Schools. Here is 
               <br />
               the answer which Mr. Gladstone gave to 
               <br />
               their opposition: 
               <br />

               Can it be said that the prevalence of denom-

               inationalism in those schools at the present 
               <br />
               moment is generally felt to be a grievance ? 
               <br />
               On the contrary. is it not the case that every- 
               <br />
               body and every section are telling us con- 
               <br />
               tinually that the religious difﬁculty directly 
               <br />
               you came to practice becomes insigniﬁcant, 
               <br />
               and that it is a difﬁculty made for parlia-

               ment and for debate rather than on which 
               <br />
               would be felt within the walls of the schools 7 
               <br />
               Now I come to denominational, or as I shall 
               <br />
               call them, voluntary schools and if I am told 
               <br />
               that an overwhelming majority of voluntary 
               <br />
               schools are denominational, I think I can draw 
               <br />
               a lesson from that fact, which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it shows

               convinced as he is that with respect to these

               voluntary schools, the duty of the state is to 
               <br />
               make use of them for the purposes of secular 
               <br />
               instruction which they give, but to hold itself 
               <br />
               entirely and absolutely detached from all re-

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               This was, Sir, the opinion of Mr. Glad- 
               <br />
               stone with regard to denominational 
               <br />

               <br />
               though the voluntary schools were toler-

               <br />
               other schools were state aided. I shall not

               refer to the school legislation which since 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               cation Act of 1902, an Act passed by the 
               <br />
               Balfour government.

               Mr. Balfour has himself. in a few words 
               <br />
               described what reforms were brought about 
               <br />

               one authority for education, being, as it is,

               <br />
               In the 3rd place, I lay down that the voluntary

               schools must be placed in a position in which 
               <br />
