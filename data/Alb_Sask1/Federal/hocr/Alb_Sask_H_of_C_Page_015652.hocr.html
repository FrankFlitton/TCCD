               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I thought we might 
               <br />
               have the advantage of hearing from the 
               <br />
               right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Lanrier) in regard to the suggestion which 
               <br />
               I made in the afternoon, as to the ﬁgures 
               <br />
               which I then mentioned and which were ad- 
               <br />
               mitted by my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior (Mr. Oliver) this afternoon. I 
               <br />
               pointed out to the right hon. Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter at that time that out of an estimated 
               <br />
               population of 250,000 there are only 5,000 
               <br />
               in this part of the province to which two 
               <br />
               members are to be allotted under the Bill. 
               <br />
               I must confess that I do not see how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               position can be defended. The Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior made some rather lengthy re- 
               <br />
               marks. and if I may be permitted to say so, 
               <br />
               without intending any disrespect, he treated 
               <br />
               the subject from a very trivial and rather 
               <br />
               unworthy standpoint. It is idle for any 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman to assert that the welfare 
               <br />
               of the province of Alberta requires that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">245,000</span> people shall be represented by 23 
               <br />
               members in the legislative assembly, and 
               <br />
               that 5,000 at the outside, taking what I 
               <br />
               believe to be a very extravagant <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">estimate,</span> 
               <br />
               must be represented by two members. That 
               <br />
               is an argument which it is not necessary 
               <br />
               for us to meet or controvert. It answers 
               <br />
               itself. No possible reason can be suggested 
               <br />
               in support of that assertion. There are no 
               <br />
               physical difﬁculties. there are no difﬁculties 
               <br />
               or conditions of any kind, which make it 
               <br />
               necessary or expedient or proper, or right, 
               <br />
               or fair. or honest, to adopt any such 
               <br />
               measure of representation as that which. 
               <br />
               is proposed. If there be any such. surely 
               <br />
               we have the right to know What they 
               <br />
               are. I have not heard of any and cer- 
               <br />
               tainly the Minister of the Interior has not 
               <br />
               even suggested remotely any reason which 
               <br />
               would weigh in the slightest degree to that 
               <br />
               end. There is no expectation of greater de-

               <br />
               by us for the purpose of argument, although

               we conceive that the estimate of the minis-

               <br />
               absurdly extravagant; but, yet, taking it 
               <br />
               for the moment as being fair and reliable, 
               <br />
               it is an estimate which does not at all jus-

               tify any such distribution as that which has 
               <br />
               been proposed. Further, we could offset 
               <br />
               against the estimate of the hon. minister— 
               <br />
               an estimate based upon hearsay informa-
