               there is the practical question of the needs

               surely the same words may be repeated and

               we may say that this clause and the con-

               <br />
               province of Manitoba. It was proposed by 
               <br />
               the Remedial Bill of 1896 to override an Act 
               <br />
               of the legislature of Manitoba, passed by 
               <br />
               the voice of the people of that province, and, 
               <br />
               as subsequently was maintained, entirely 
               <br />
               within the legislative authority of that pro- 
               <br />
               vince. We do not propose to override any Act 
               <br />
               of any legislature. What we propose to-day 
               <br />
               is to conﬁrm and continue for all future time 
               <br />
               a measure which the free voice of the North- 
               <br />
               west legislature has placed upon the statute- 
               <br />
               book of the Territories. So that, on that 
               <br />
               point, there is a wide difference between the 
               <br />
               condition of affairs in respect to Manitoba 
               <br />

               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. Then again it 
               <br />
               was said and with some justice that an 
               <br />
               effort was made to coerce the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba, because it was proposed to pass 
               <br />
               an Act against which the government of 
               <br />
               Manitoba entered a solemn protest. There 
               <br />
               is no protest from the government of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories against this measure. 
               <br />
               I make that statement advisedly. The pre-

               has written a letter to the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               of Canada, but I am informed and believe 
               <br />
               that that letter expresses his individual

               the case of Manitoba I repeat that the propo-
