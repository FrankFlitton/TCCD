               Norfolk (Mr. Tisdale) said that we were

               anxious to get American capital and that

               <br />
               to contrast the liberality extended to 
               <br />
               Americans investing capital in Canada, 
               <br />
               with the liberality that the United States 
               <br />
               extends to Canadians who invest-in that 
               <br />
               country. Look at how they treated the

               Canadians who went to ﬁght for them dur— 
               <br />
               ing the Civil War; only a few years ago 
               <br />
               the United States federal government passed 
               <br />
               a law compelling the pensioners to live 
               <br />

               <br />
               would get no pension. That is not liber- 
               <br />
               aiity. These men having fought for the 
               <br />
               union were entitled to the gratitude of the 
               <br />
               nation, and the treatment accorded to them 
               <br />
               was not generous. There has been nothing

               Mr. W‘. F. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MAJCILEAN.</span> At six o'clock we 
               <br />
               were discussing the strange lack of com- 
               <br />
               patibility between the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               and the Minister of Finance on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion. As far as we can gather the fact has 
               <br />
               been established that the intention of the 
               <br />
               government is to incorporate in the new con- 
               <br />
               stitution of Alberta all the rights and all 
               <br />

               of Justice on the wily way he set his web 
               <br />
               to entrap most of his fellow members. He 
               <br />
               let them all commit themselves; he‘ allowed 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance to say that it was 
               <br />
               the whittled down proposition that was go- 
               <br />
               ing into the new law, he allowed the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Post»</span> 
               <br />
               master General to do the same thing, and 
               <br />
               he saw unmoved the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior leave the cabinet and take the mem- 
               <br />
               bers from the Northwest out of the party

               with him as a protest against the original 
               <br />

               gentlemen who read the Bill with great 
               <br />

               Minister of Justice, that this modiﬁed clause 
               <br />
               does give to the minority all the rights and 
               <br />

               <br />

               ened out the Minister of Finance as we did 
               <br />
               this afternoon and let him see exactly 
               <br />
               where he stands, we should now straighten 
               <br />
               out the member for Labelle. He told his 
               <br />
               audience in Montreal that he was coming 
               <br />
               to Ottawa to move an amendment which 
               <br />
               would secure the full rights and privileges 
               <br />
               of the minority in the Territories, but that 
               <br />
               is unnecessary, now that we have the as- 
               <br />
               surance of the Minister of Justice that the 
               <br />
               minority is to have the high water rights 
               <br />
               and privileges they claim. The member 
               <br />
               for .Labelle owes an apology to the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice. The member for Perth 
               <br />
               (Mr. McIntyre) intended to vote against the 
               <br />
               government but for some reason or other 
               <br />
               he did not—probably he was led to believe 
               <br />
               there was a great difference between the 
               <br />
               new clause and the old. What has he to 
               <br />
               say to the statement of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice? The member for Brandon (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton) must see that his speech was er- 
               <br />
               roneous, that there is more in the Bill than 
               <br />
               the half hour of religious instruction, and 
               <br />
               that he and his fellow members from the 
               <br />
               west were misled. If they went out be- 
               <br />
               fore on principle they should go out again 
               <br />
               on principle. The Minister of Finance has 
               <br />
               never denied that he threatened to leave 
               <br />
               the cabinet on account of the character of 
               <br />
               the original Bill which he thought went too 
               <br />
               far, and the revelation of this afternoon 
               <br />
               makes it his bounden duty to go out again. 
               <br />
               The announcement of the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice is not encouraging; it will strengthen 
               <br />
               the bad feeling that now exists throughout 
               <br />
               ‘Canada and the reason for opposition to 
               <br />
               this Bill is doubly strengthened in view of 
               <br />
               that statement. The government will not 
               <br />
               be able to justify the Bill before the coun- 
               <br />
               try, nor will they be able to justify the 
               <br />
               way they have juggled with this question, 
               <br />
               and have deceived their own colleagues 
               <br />
               and their own followers. Those gentle- 
               <br />
               men who threatened to leave the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">govern:</span> 
               <br />
               men-t on principle now have their eyes 
               <br />
               opened and they will be doubly stultiﬂed if 
               <br />
               they do not put on record that they have 
               <br />
               been deceived. I leave the question for 
               <br />
