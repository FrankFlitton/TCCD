               this section is an adaptation of section 
               <br />
               129 of the British North America Act and 
               <br />
               provides for tire continuance of existing 
               <br />
               counts, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">llaws,</span> ofﬁcials, &amp;c. The second para- 
               <br />
               graph which is a proviso, has reference to 
               <br />
               the oﬂicials that are now appointed for 
               <br />
               the purpose of carrying out the ordinances 
               <br />
               in force in the Territories; the ordinances 
               <br />
               of course are continued and provision is 
               <br />
               made that the new provinces will have the 
               <br />
               power to reappoint functionaries necessary 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> carry out these ordinances that are so 
               <br />
               continued. Clause 2 provides for the 
               <br />
               reorganization of the judicial system after 
               <br />
               the Territories are formed into provinces, 
               <br />
               and Clauses 3 and 4 provide for the 
               <br />
               continuation of incorporated societies. The 
               <br />
               p: ovision authorizing the courts to carry on 
               <br />
               the contestation of elections after the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are organized, will be made by an 
               <br />
               amendment to the Contested Elections Act 
               <br />
               which I will have prepared on Monday.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. That is a very dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁcult question. These societies are now 
               <br />
               organized under the Territorial ordinances 
               <br />

               <br />
               business in the whole of the Territories. We 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">novaroceediug</span> to divide the Terri— 
               <br />
               tories and create two new provinces, and 
               <br />
               the result will be that theSe corporations 
               <br />
               will be under Dominion control because they 
               <br />
               are operated beyond the limits of the pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               Clauses 3 and 4 make provision. Each 
               <br />
               joint stock company will continue to have 
               <br />
               its corporate existence Within the limits 
               <br />
               of that particular province in which the head 
               <br />
               oiﬁce is situated, and thus it falls under 
               <br />
               the control of the provincial legislature of 
               <br />
