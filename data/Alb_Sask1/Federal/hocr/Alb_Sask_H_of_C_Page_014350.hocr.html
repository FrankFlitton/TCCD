               rights. In 1875, parliament passed a law 
               <br />
               granting a temporary constitution to the 
               <br />

               rights granted to the minority would be 
               <br />
               for ever assured to them. The rights of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholic</span> minority were recognized by re- 
               <br />

               and it was Mr. Blake himself who brought 
               <br />
               up the question. That same policy was 
               <br />
               conﬁrmed, in 1880, by the Conservative gov- 
               <br />
               ernment of the time. It was enacted once 
               <br />
               more that the Catholic population would 
               <br />
               have their separate schools, and parliament

               is to-day bound in honour to continue that

               <br />
