               few moments ago I referred to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sugges‘</span>

               <br />
               brought into the House cut and dried, decid-

               <br />

               Bills. I confess that I am rather in fav-

               our of two provinces than one, but one 
               <br />
               province might have been created now and 
               <br />
               another some years hence. We need not 
               <br />
               talk about provincial autonomy, because 
               <br />
               we are not giving autonomy to these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. We ought to forget that term; 
               <br />
               we are only giving them partial autonomy ; 
               <br />
               we should call it provincial autonomy limit- 
               <br />
               ed, because at the best we are limiting the 
               <br />
               powers of these provinces. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">With-v</span> regard to

               ‘ber for South York, I am not sure that I 
               <br />
               apprehend it fully. I understand that he 
               <br />
               proposes to make two provinces out of the 
               <br />
               southern portion of the territory allotted for 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan and Alberta. I may Say 
               <br />
               that I do not approve of that. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Although</span> 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has, I dare say, made 
               <br />
               the motion in perfect good faith, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> say 
               <br />
               here and now that I am not able to support 
               <br />
               it, because I think the provinces would be 
               <br />
               entirely too small. We are over-governed at 
               <br />
               the present time. Complaint has been made

               <br />
               more small provinces. I would much rather 
               <br />
               see both of these provinces extended to the 
               <br />
               northern boundary of Athabaska than to 
               <br />
               have them cut off at the 55th parallel of 
               <br />
               latitude. I say this in order to put my-

               self right in case there should be a vote 
               <br />

               from the Minister of the Interior that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span>

               cess of obstruction has been proposed and 
               <br />
               is taking place. I am a new member, and 
               <br />
               do not know what obstruction means ; but 
               <br />

               ing the last two days is not obstruction,

               I would like to know what is obstruction. 
               <br />
               We have been discussing section 1 of this 
               <br />
               Bill, which simply deﬁnes the boundaries of 
               <br />
               the province of Alberta, and the only valid 
               <br />
               objection which 1 have heard is that the 
               <br />
               eastern boundary of that province should 
               <br />
               be placed about sixty miles farther east, so 
               <br />
               that the province of Alberta would take 
               <br />

               would not make any difference. The only

               told that the people in that part of the 
               <br />

               is the trouble with the opposition ? I am
