               <br />
               extraordinary state of affairs in this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> \Ve propose to put through an 
               <br />
               important measure affecting the destinies 
               <br />
               of practically half a continent under the 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               ment, as we understand it, and as it has 
               <br />
               been carried out, the cabinet is composed of 
               <br />
               heads who have received the endorsation ot‘ 
               <br />

               ing to the population or importance of those 
               <br />
               provinces. For instance, Ontario in the 
               <br />
               past has nearly always had ﬁve members 
               <br />
               in the cabinet, Quebec four, the maritime 
               <br />
               provinces at least three, one of whom was 
               <br />
               allowed for New Brunswick, another for

               <br />

               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Dominion was represented in the 
               <br />
               cabinet; and when important questions 
               <br />
               came up in which any portion of the coun-

               try was particularly interested, its repre-

               sentatives in the cabinet were supposed to 
               <br />
               have inﬂuence in swaying the government 
               <br />
               in regard to that matter. That has hitherto 
               <br />
               been the case with regard to Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec. and either of those provinces would

               <br />
               have practically half a continent without 
               <br />
