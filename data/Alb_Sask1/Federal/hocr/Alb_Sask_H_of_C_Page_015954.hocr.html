               February, referred to the debate raised by 
               <br />
               this Bill, and to the speech made by the 
               <br />
               Premier, but he did not say a single word 
               <br />
               regarding the omission concerning the use

               <br />
               it was only later on that, for the purpose

               a law passed in 1877. which provides for

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French</span> speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fellow‘countrymen</span> are so

               legislature will have 25 members, making 
               <br />
               50 in all. According to that ratio of 4 per

               <br />

               To my mind it is not a matter of senti-
