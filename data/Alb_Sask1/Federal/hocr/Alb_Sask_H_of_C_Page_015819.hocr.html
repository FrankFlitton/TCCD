               tleman is mistaken. If this amendment is

               put a concrete case before the House. Here

               is a school district, for instance, which is 
               <br />
               composed of Protestants, they have their

               own religious instruction. There are amongst 
               <br />
               them ﬁve or six Roman Catholics. While

               the school trustees, they can secede and 
               <br />
               organize a separate school. Let us take a

               <br />
               and they all go to the same sch001. If the

               <br />
