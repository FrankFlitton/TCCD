               Now, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Speaker,</span> When the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister introduced his ﬁrst Bill into this House 
               <br />
               that which is now known <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as.Autonomy</span> Bill 
               <br />
               No. 1—1 think that is a name that some 
               <br />
               one gave it, and it is a very good name— 
               <br />
               when he ﬁrst introduced that Bill into this 
               <br />
               House, he made a very eloquent speech. 
               <br />
               It was the ﬁrst time that I had had the 
               <br />
               pleasure of listening to the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman in an important speech and 
               <br />
               1 must say I was delighted with his elo- 
               <br />
               quence and his grand oratory. I was proud 
               <br />
               of the fact that Canada had a Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister with such great oratorical ability as 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman. If there was any 
               <br />
               part of his address that was more eloquent 
               <br />
               than another, it was that part in which he 
               <br />
               advocated the teaching of dogmas in our 
               <br />
               schools. When he reached that part of 
               <br />
               his address he seemed to throw his whole 
               <br />
               soul, his whole spirit into it. and he advo- 
               <br />
               cated the teaching of dogmas as earnestly 
               <br />
               as it was possible for him to do. I 
               <br />
               listened to him with the greatest admiration. 
               <br />
               When he was so earnest in advocating that 
               <br />
               Bill and when he was so eloquent in in- 
               <br />
               troducing it. I imagined that he consistently 
               <br />
               and honestly believed in the measures which 
               <br />
               were contained in the Bill and I little dream- 
               <br />
               ed that within a few hours, within a few 
               <br />
               days at the most, we would see in this 
               <br />
               House the humiliating spectacle of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) leading 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister into this House like a 
               <br />
               whipped child and making him stand up 
               <br />
               and withdraw the Bill that he had intro— 
               <br />
               duced or at least that portion of the Bill 
               <br />
               which gave separate schools in their entire- 
               <br />
               ty to the people of the west. But, such was 
               <br />
               the spectacle that we witnessed. Hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, especially those from 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec, applauded most 
               <br />
               vociferously when the right hon. Prime 
               <br />
               Minister did this. I wondered what it was 
               <br />
               they were applauding. I wondered if they 
               <br />
               were delighted with the fact that the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Brandon had coanered the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               and I may say that the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fielding) as well was associated with 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Brandon. I. wondered 
               <br />
               if they were pleased. It seemed so because 
               <br />
               they applauded and pounded their desks 
               <br />
               and if these desks had not been made of 
               <br />
               good strong Canadian timber they would

               hardly have withstood the blows. But there 
               <br />
               was the hon. member for Brandon ; he was 
               <br />
               looking the right hon. leader of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment in the face and saying that he had to- 
               <br />
               do just as he told him he must do. He 
               <br />
               was making him stand up there and with- 
               <br />
               draw that clause of the Bill that gave sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools and church endowment to 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholic people of these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. It reminded me of the old fable of 
               <br />
               Davy Crocket and the coon. You remem- 
               <br />
               ber that Davy said: If you do not come 
               <br />
               down I will shoot. and that the coon said: 
               <br />
               if you do not shoot I will come down. So, 
               <br />
               the right hon. leader of the government 
               <br />
               came down and the hon. member for Bran— 
               <br />
               don did not shoot. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brandon had a following in this House; 
               <br />
               he had behind him that contingent of hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen from the Northwest. Until this 
               <br />
               time there was no evidence that these 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen from the Northwest, or 
               <br />
               from Nova Scotia. or from any other part of 
               <br />
               this Dominion who were supporting the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman were not delighted 
               <br />
               with the Bill he had ﬁrst introduced. There 
               <br />
               was no division in the ranks. In private 
               <br />
               conversations that I had with some of them 
               <br />
               they were loud in their praises. It was 
               <br />
               just the Bill that was required, just the Bill 
               <br />
               that should be introduced. There was no 
               <br />
               division. This Bill was prepared by a sei- 
               <br />
               ect committee. The majority being Pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tt'stant</span> in this country they thought it 
               <br />
               wise to make the majority of the committee 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic so that there would be three 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics on the committee to one 
               <br />
               Protestant. They prepared this Bill. The 
               <br />
               one Protestant was the hon. Postmaster 
               <br />
               General (Sir William Mulockl and probably 
               <br />
               he was, like he generally is in the House, 
               <br />
               asleep when the Bill was prepared. Any— 
               <br />
               way when the hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />
               and the hon. Minister of Finance came home 
               <br />
               they objected and when they objected, these 
               <br />
               other hon. gentlemen. like a ﬁoek of sheep. 
               <br />
               objected too, but they never had objected 
               <br />
               up to this time and I was quite surprised 
               <br />
               the other night to hear the hon. member 
               <br />
               for South Renfrew (Mr. Wright) extol the 
               <br />
               virtues of this Bill. One would never have
