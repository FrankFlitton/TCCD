               Thus I do not see any reason for omitting the

               <br />
               with me that the present law is what we

               want continued when we become a province. 
               <br />
               and we would like this to be deﬁnite and 
               <br />
               so explicitly stated in the Act and in such 
               <br />
               simple and plain language that there could 
               <br />
               be no doubt as to the meaning and inter- 
               <br />
               pretation thereof. So many laws are framed 
               <br />
               in such ambiguous language that no ordinary 
               <br />
               man can understand them. and as an emi- 
               <br />
               nent judge once informed me in regard to 
               <br />
               the working of a certain law, that no per— 
               <br />
               son could tell anything about it, and that it 
               <br />
               would all depend upon what judge had 
               <br />
               the last guess at it. So I consider this case. 
               <br />
               If in the constitution that is being framed 
               <br />
               for us at the present time nothing deﬁnite 
               <br />
               is laid down in regard to this matter of

               education, we will be like a ship without 
               <br />
               a rudder and it will require a long period 
               <br />
               of unrest, agitation and legal proceedings 
               <br />
               before we will know where we are at, and 
               <br />
               I venture to say that no man living can at 
               <br />
               present predict where we would land, but 
               <br />

               One thing more, Mr. Speaker, it has been 
               <br />
               asserted over and over again, that this Bill 
               <br />
               is an interference with the provincial rights 
               <br />
               of the new province. So far as I can see, 
               <br />
               nobody is in favour of absolute provincial 
               <br />
               rights. In the Bill now under consideration. 
               <br />
               there is a more violent interference with 
               <br />
               provincial rights than is found in the edu- 
               <br />
               cational clauses. I mean the refusal to 
               <br />
               allow the provinces to tax the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway in violation of the exemption 
               <br />
               granted by the parliament of 1881. This 
               <br />
               is a violent interference with provincial 
               <br />
               rights, yet no one in this House or out of 
               <br />
               it, suggests that this parliament should not 
               <br />
               keep faith with the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. The granting of the exemption by the 
               <br />
               Conservative government of 1881 was a 
               <br />
               most unrighteous act as far as the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories were concerned, but no one desires 
               <br />
               to see parliament repudiate its obligations. 
               <br />
               and hon. gentlemen opposite have not 
               <br />
               raised a single howl about this interference 
               <br />
               with provincial rights. They recognize that 
               <br />

               ception to the doctrine of provincial rights, 
               <br />

               Railway exemption as one.
