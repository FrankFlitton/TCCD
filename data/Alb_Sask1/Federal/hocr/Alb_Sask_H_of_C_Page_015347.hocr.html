               <br />
               Let me draw attention to the fact that as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               cently as 1901 a joint debate took place at In- 
               <br />
               dian Head, in eastern Assiniboia, between Mr. 
               <br />
               Roblin and Mr. Haultain upon this very ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the Manitoba. boundary. Mr. Roblln put 
               <br />
               forth the reason why the people of that little 
               <br />
               place should declare themselves to be in favour 
               <br />
               of the extension of the boundaries of Manitoba, 
               <br />
               at the‘expense of the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain, on the other hand, arguing 
               <br />
               against the proposition and seeking to convince 
               <br />
               the people that it was to their interest to re— 
               <br />
               main in the Northwest Territories, and that 
               <br />
               the boundaries of Manitoba should not extend 
               <br />
               westward. And what, Sir, were the reasons 
               <br />
               given by Mr. Haultain to induce them to resist 
               <br />
               the blandishments of Mr. Roblin and oppose the 
               <br />
               extension of the Manitoba boundary? The joint 
               <br />
               debate is reported in the Regina ‘Leader ’ of 
               <br />
               January 20th, 1902, and Mr. Haultain’s argument 
               <br />
               is summed up in these words: Good roads, 
               <br />
               railways, schools, water. Referring to the school 
               <br />
               question he says : with the school system you 
               <br />
               are fairly well contented, so I need not dwell 
               <br />
               upon the subject. 
               <br />

               That was the quotation made by the 
               <br />
               hon. the Minister of Justice. Again he 
               <br />
               stated only half the truth. Had he gone on 
               <br />
               even to ﬁnish Mr. Haultain's sentences, he 
               <br />
               would have found that an entirely different 
               <br />
               construction would have been placed upon 
               <br />
               what he said. Unfortunately I have not 
               <br />
               been able to get the Regina ‘Leader’ in 
               <br />
               which the report of the original debate 
               <br />
               is given. The Minister of Justice says it' 
               <br />
               was on the 20th of January, 1902. I looked 
               <br />
               up the Regina ‘Lender' of that date and 
               <br />
               found that the report of the debate was not 
               <br />
               in it. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number.</span> of December, 1901. in 
               <br />
               which I believe the report was given, is 
               <br />
               missing from the library: and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> I 
               <br />
               have asked for it two or three times, I
