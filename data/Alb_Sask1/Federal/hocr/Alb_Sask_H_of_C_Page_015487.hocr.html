               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. It seems to 
               <br />
               me that a good deal of unnecessary con- 
               <br />
               fusion has been imported into this discus- 
               <br />
               sion simply because we have ignored the 
               <br />
               historic conditions under which this legisla- 
               <br />
               tion has been arrived at. If you take this 
               <br />
               law, the Act of 1875, or indeed any law 
               <br />
               that you have in the statutes whether of 
               <br />
               Quebec, of Ontario or Manitoba, if you 
               <br />
               take them by themselves, without having 
               <br />
               any reference Whatever to the historic 
               <br />
               conditions which have necessitated that 
               <br />
               legislation, you are at once confronted by 
               <br />
               a mystery which seems to be insoluble 
               <br />
               but if you take the histOIy, the conditions 
               <br />
               which have made this legislation necessary, 
               <br />
               or if not necessary advisable, then it seems 
               <br />
               to me that the conclusion is very simple, 
               <br />
               and that you have at once the explanation 
               <br />
               of the difﬁculty that was presented this

               Sir WILF‘RID LAURIER. Exactly. But 
               <br />
               the qualiﬁcation comes in and applies in the 
               <br />
               same way to the majority as well as to the 
               <br />
               minority in this matter. The privilege is 
               <br />
               given to the minority. to a certain minority, 
               <br />
               that is to say to the Protestant or Catholic 
               <br />
               minority. There must be some reason for 
               <br />
               the difference. In the discussion which is 
               <br />
               going on to-day in certain parts of the 
               <br />
               country you often hear: But if you give 
               <br />
               that privilege to the minority, Why not give 
               <br />
               it to the Jews. the Mormons and the Greek 
               <br />
               Church ? I am not concerned with these; 
               <br />
               that is a matter for the local legislature ? 
               <br />
               but so far as this parliament is concerned, 
               <br />
               we have only to deal with the law as we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd it, that is to say the privileges given to 
               <br />
               the Protestant 01' to the Catholic minority, 
               <br />
               not to any other. When this law was ﬁrst 
               <br />
               established in the province of Quebec and 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario. and subsequently 
               <br />
               in the province of Manitoba, the great body 
               <br />
               of the Canadian population was divided 
               <br />
               between Catholics and Protestants. There 
               <br />
               were very few people of other denomina- 
               <br />
               tions. There are more now, but at that time 
               <br />
               there were no denominations to be reckoned 
               <br />
               with except the great body of Protestants 
               <br />
               and the great body of Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               and the law was made for them. Now if 
               <br />
               you give the privilege to the minority whe- 
               <br />
               ther it be Protestant or whether it be Catho- 
               <br />
               lic to secede from a school which has been 
               <br />
               established by the majority since the pri- 
               <br />
               vilege is given to the Protestants or to the 
               <br />
               Catholics, it is because there must be in 
               <br />
               the school something offensive to the con- 
               <br />
               science of the Protestant or of the Catholic. 
               <br />
               You cannot conceive any reason for dis— 
               <br />
               tinction and separation except for that. If
