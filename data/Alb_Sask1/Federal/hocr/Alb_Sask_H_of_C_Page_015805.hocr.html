               <br />
               Catholics of this country have rights; they 
               <br />
               have moral rights because of their number 
               <br />
               and because of the necessity of living in 
               <br />
               harmony with them, that in any province 
               <br />
               where they have no legal rights they have 
               <br />
               received separate schools, but in the North-

               <br />
               rights, they will not receive separate schools; 
               <br />

               <br />
               this country, because, breaking its pledges, 
               <br />
               breaking its moral and constitutional obli- 
               <br />
               gations, the Liberal government has aban- 
               <br />
               doned the clause which secured separate 
               <br />
               schools, and is now enacting a new clause 
               <br />
               which gives separate schools in name and 
               <br />
               public schools in fact. I have asked the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the Conservative party if he 
               <br />
               thought that he was working for the good 
               <br />
               of the country by adopting the position 
               <br />
               which he has assumed, under some legal 
               <br />
               opinion which I respect, but which I think 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman would never have en- 
               <br />
               tertained if he had not been forced to adopt 
               <br />
               this attitude by the wing of the party—I 
               <br />
               will not say yellow dogs, in the words of 
               <br />
               the government organs to which I have re— 
               <br />
               ferred, but I will simply say, in demagogic 
               <br />
               language, by the members of the Orange 
               <br />
               wing of the Tory party. I have made my 
               <br />
               statement against the Conservative party, 
               <br />
               and now I make my statement against the 
               <br />
               Liberal party. I say that the Liberal party 
               <br />
               has not fulﬁlled its duty by bowing to that 
               <br />
               campaign which has been raised by the 
               <br />
               Tory party, or by apologizing for the posi— 
               <br />
               tion it has taken. The spectacle of one 
               <br />
               party apologizing to the other and trying 
               <br />
               to give the least possible measure of jus- 
               <br />
               tice to the minority because of its oppo- 
               <br />
               nents being able to take advantage of it, is 
               <br />
               not one which is apt to produce that con- 
               <br />
               ciliation and harmony which the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister sincerely has been trying to 
               <br />
               bring about in this country for the last 
               <br />
               thirty years. That was the only kind of. 
               <br />
               denunciation that I uttered against the 
               <br />
               Liberal party, and I still adhere to it. I 
               <br />
               admit it puts me in this strange position, 
               <br />
               that one day I am against one party and 
               <br />
               another day I am against the other party. 
               <br />
               I admit that it is a dangerous position, that 
               <br />
               it is a position which opens the door to the 
               <br />
               narrow and small argument, which has been 
               <br />
               used by the hon. Minister of. Inland Revenue, 
               <br />
               that I want to pose as a virtuous man. 
               <br />
               Last night my hon. friend the Solicitor 
               <br />
               General (Mr. Lemieux) was trying to build 
               <br />
               a pedestal of virtue to his party and the 
               <br />
               government. because he said it stood be— 
               <br />
               tween the hon. member or East Grey and 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Labelle. But a mo- 
               <br />
               ment later the government were voting with 
               <br />
               the hon. member for East Grey, and the 
               <br />
               Solicitor General and the member for East 
               <br />
               Grey were joining in a tender embrace. I 
               <br />
               might follow in the footsteps of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the Solicitor General and build a

               pedestal to myself between this demagogic 
               <br />
               government and those demagogic people 
               <br />
               who voted with them. I couldlstand in the

               <br />
               my hon. friends had spared their insinua— 
               <br />
               tions and their accusations—their false ac-

               themselves with proving the falsity of my

               <br />
               with trying to make my position as good as 
               <br />
               possible. But the Minister of Inland Rev-

               enue and the Solicitor General know what 
               <br />
               my position towards the government is. 
               <br />
               They know that I have been a Liberal as 
               <br />
               long as they have. They know that I have 
               <br />
               fought for the Liberal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party,</span> they know that 
               <br />
               I have never received—nor do I expect to

               receive—a favour from the Liberal party, 
               <br />
               they know that I have conducted all my 
               <br />
               elections at my own expense, and that I 
               <br />
               have not received a cent for making speeches 
               <br />
               in support of that party. While I am ready 
               <br />
               to stand for the principles of the Liberal 
               <br />
               party as long as the Liberal party is true 
               <br />
               to its principles, I am Liberal enough and 
               <br />
               attached enough to the traditions of my 
               <br />
               party not to sacriﬁce the views which com—

               <br />
               any small moh may try to frighten me. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the Solicitor General has 
               <br />
               gone back to past history. I will not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">follow</span> 
               <br />
               him in those steps. I will not trace him 
               <br />
               back to the history of his ancestors, I will 
               <br />
               not even trace him backin his own history, 
               <br />
               but why he should pose as a moderate man 
               <br />
               and charge me with being a French ex- 
               <br />

               <br />
               is something that I cannot understand. I 
               <br />
               have always been the same kind of a man. 
               <br />
               I have always stood for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"the</span> policy of con—

               <br />
               last night; I have always stood for the

               policy of maintaining British institutions, 
               <br />
               and While I have not been given to making

               <br />
