               <br />
               a question of right and justice. When we 
               <br />
               look back to the discussion in the House of 
               <br />
               Lords at the time the provinces of 
               <br />
               Canada were united into the confederation 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd there not only an expression of the 
               <br />
               sentiments of the fathers of confederation 
               <br />
               but we ﬁnd there especially an example of 
               <br />
               that greater generosity and justice which‘ 
               <br />
               have always been displayed in the parlia~ 
               <br />
               ment of Great Britain upon every occasion 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> proper treatment of a great ques— 
               <br />
               tion required it. We ﬁnd there the decla- 
               <br />
               ration that justice shall be given to the 
               <br />
               minority, not only to the Catholic minority 
               <br />
               but to the Protestant minority as well as 
               <br />
               the case may be. In this country where 
               <br />
               development is so rapid, where it is bound 
               <br />
               to be rapid in the future and which it is 
               <br />
               the duty of every Canadian to promote as 
               <br />

               possible and I need not go out of my own

               province to ﬁnd an illustration of the truth 
               <br />
               of what I say. It is known that in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of New Brunswick, for different rea- 
               <br />
               sons which I will not undertake to explain, 
               <br />
               the population has increased only, you might 
               <br />
               say, by the increased number of the Catho— 
               <br />
               lic people. Owing to different reasons the 
               <br />
               young men of English parentage, perhaps 
               <br />
               having more desire to see the greatness of 
               <br />
               the world and to seek advantages abroad, 
               <br />
               have gone in immense numbers to the New 
               <br />
               England States with the result that to-day 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd more of the English sons of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick in the States of New England 
               <br />
               than we ﬁnd in New Brunswick. 
               <br />
               The increase in population has been going 
               <br />
               on especially amongst the French and the 
               <br />
               Irish people who have kept their children 
               <br />
               at home. This, Sir, is a good lesson to the 
               <br />
               English people that the time is past when 
               <br />
               young Canadians require to go to a foreign 
               <br />
               country to seek fortune, because in the great 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories they now have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁeld</span> 
               <br />
               for their enterprise and energy. If, for the 
               <br />
               next ﬁfty years the conditions continue the 
               <br />
               same in New Brunswick as they have been 
               <br />
               for the past ﬁfty years, then the Catholic 
               <br />
               people will be in the majority in that pro- 
               <br />
               vince and should that come to pass, would 
               <br />
               It not be wise and generous that we the 
               <br />
               Catholic people being in the majority should 
               <br />
               extend to the Protestant minority the same 
               <br />
               generosity and the same charity that they 
               <br />
               for years extended to us ? The words of 
               <br />
               Lord Carnarvon in the British House of 
               <br />
               Lords have already been quoted to this 
               <br />
               House, but I may be allowed to quote them 
               <br />
               again with the explanation that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">An</span> New 
               <br />
               Brunswick have learned to draw from them 
               <br />
               lessons of charity and lessons of justice. 
               <br />
               Let me say that if there ever was an occa- 
               <br />
               sion for the display of charity and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justice,</span> 
               <br />
               it is required just now in the discussion of 
               <br />
               this question. The Minister of Finance (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fielding.) who has inherited the eloquent 
               <br />
               and noble sentiments of Joseph Howe, gave 
               <br />
               us the history of the settlement of religious 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dilferences</span> in the maritime provinces; 
               <br />
               although trouble did arise in Nova Scotia 
               <br />
               and New Brunswick it was soon allayed 
               <br />
               through the good sense and liberality ol‘ 
               <br />
               the people. When men of fortitude came 
               <br />
               to govern in New Brunswick the province 
               <br />
               was again clothed in its golden mantle of 
               <br />
               conciliation, and harmony has prevailed 
               <br />
               among the people ever since. To-day we 
               <br />
               see the Acadian children and the Irish Catho- 
               <br />
               lic children enjoying the advantages of a
