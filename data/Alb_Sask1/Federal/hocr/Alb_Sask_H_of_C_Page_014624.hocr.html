               yesterday and he was perfectly in order in 
               <br />
               making it without giving me notice, though 
               <br />
               I might have supposed that, if he in-

               tended to make the extended remarks he

               <br />

               by the statement of His Excellency the

               fulfilled the courtesy that was due to the

               right hon. gentleman, and which has always

               So far as the question at issue is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, the debate has wandered consider- 
               <br />
               ably from the point at which it started. 
               <br />
               I do not know that I could usefully add 
               <br />
               anything to what I said this afternoon. 1 
               <br />
               endeavoured to express the views that I 
               <br />
               hold in a temperate and moderate man- 
               <br />
               ner ; and, without any idea of fomenting re- 
               <br />
               ligious discord or race prejudice, I brought 
               <br />
               the subject to the attention of the House and 
               <br />
               drew certain inferences which, in my judg- 
               <br />
               ment were well founded, but which, are 
               <br />
               matters of judgment and opinion. These 
               <br />
               were very strongly controverted by my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend in the remarks he addressed to 
               <br />
               the House. I have no fault to ﬁnd with the 
               <br />
               tone of his remarks or with the challenge 
               <br />
               he threw out. It may be that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman’s prophesy will prove <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cer-</span> 
               <br />
               rect: If this question ever does come as 
               <br />
               a direct issue before the people, the course 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman has taken may be 
               <br />
               found, in the judgment of the people, to have 
               <br />
               been a wise, prudent, and constitutional 
               <br />
               course. I greatly doubt it. So far as I am 
               <br />
               concerned, if that verdict is given, I shall 
               <br />
               be perfectly willing to accept it. For the 
               <br />
               present, the only thing that remains for me 
               <br />
               to say is that whether the verdict of the 
               <br />
               people shall be as the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               prophesies or not, I shall have no word 
               <br />
               to withdraw from those which I have spoken 
               <br />
               on this subject to-day.
