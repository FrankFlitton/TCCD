               with every Word of it. Sir John Macdonald

               of the federal parliament and the provin~ 
               <br />
               cial parliament is something like the fol- 
               <br />
               lowing: At confederation each was assigned 
               <br />
               its rights; each was given the class of sub- 
               <br />
               jects upon which it had an exclusive right 
               <br />
               to legislate. There were subjects on which 
               <br />
               each had an exclusive right; there were 
               <br />
               other subjects on which they had a joint 
               <br />
               right, and there were other subjects not in- 
               <br />
               cluded in either 011 which both might pro- 
               <br />
               perly legislate. The British North America 
               <br />
               Act puts the rights belonging to the prov- 
               <br />
               inces in one schedule, and the rights belong- 
               <br />
               ing to the federal parliament in another. 
               <br />
               Everything concerning local government is 
               <br />
               given to the provincial parliament, and 
               <br />
               everything concerning trade and commerce 
               <br />
               and national undertakings is given to the 
               <br />
               federal parliament. But it was never in- 
               <br />
               tended that the federal parliament should 
               <br />
               infringe on any of the subjects which were 
               <br />
               assigned exclusively to the provincial par- 
               <br />
               liament. and education was one of these
