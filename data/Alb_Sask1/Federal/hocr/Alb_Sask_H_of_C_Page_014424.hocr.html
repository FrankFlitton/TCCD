               the Dominion will retain control of the Terri-

               cure the former, the inducement of free home-

               railway extension, lands, or the proceeds of lands 
               <br />
               are usually granted. Thus, we see, that if the

               new provinces owned the unallotted lands they 
               <br />

               the same time the cost of land administration

               equipped for these onerous duties. It took the

               a phase of the educational matter. The mat-

               ter of education is one of very prime import-

               ple of any province and the most important 
               <br />
               subject that could possibly be dealt with 
               <br />
               by any parliament or local legislature. But 
               <br />
               the matter that is being debated in the 
               <br />
               House is the narrowest kind of an issue as 
               <br />
               between the proposition of the government 
               <br />
               and the proposition, as it is explained by 
               <br />
               himself, of the hon. member for Carleton. 
               <br />
               However. before actually taking up the 
               <br />
               educational clause, let me make another 
               <br />
               brief reference. The year of confederation. 
               <br />
               1867, chances to be also the year in which I 
               <br />
               was ushered into this world and it will not 
               <br />
               be a matter of surprise, therefore, that some 
               <br />
               of the negotiations and some of the events 
               <br />
               that occurred prior to that time are not 
               <br />
               very deﬁnitely within my recollection. I 
               <br />
               was thrown into circumstances which did 
               <br />
               not conduce to a great deal of research or
