               Now, Mr. Speaker, in the province of

               title in the lands of this country does not 
               <br />
               vest in this government as a government

               <br />
               they vest in the King in the right of the

               <br />
               Council in the cases to which I have alluded. 
               <br />
               We have had quite a recent judgment of the 
               <br />
               Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in

               the liquidators of the Maritime Bank, in

               which it was laid down that the lieutenant 
               <br />
               governor in the province represented the 
               <br />
               Crown just as fully and eifectually as the 
               <br />
               Governor General does in the federal sphere. 
               <br />
               We have in these cases the authority 
               <br />
               that the title to these lands properly vests 
               <br />
               in the Lieutenant Governor representing 
               <br />
               the King in right of the provinces; but

               the title is in the province and not in the 
               <br />
               Dominion. We have in section 19 of this

               <br />
               are entitled to the lands. Section 19 says:

               the previncial authorities. In the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               the administration of these lands is directly 
               <br />
               a matter of local and provincial concern: 
               <br />
               it is the people of the provinces Who are 
               <br />
               chieﬂy interested in the administration of 
               <br />
               these lands; it is their interests that are 
               <br />
               chieﬂy affected. If the lands are wisely 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efﬁciently</span> administered it is they who 
               <br />
               proﬁt and beneﬁt ; if the lands are unwisely 
               <br />
               and ineﬂiciently administered it is they who 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">uﬁer.</span> That being the case, 1 submit that 
               <br />
               he administration of these lands should 
               <br />
               be in an authority responsible to the peo- 
               <br />
               ple who are interested. If these lands are 
               <br />
               retained by this government, as is proposed 
               <br />
               in the Bill, we may have the federal author- 
               <br />
               ity administering the lands in a most in- 
               <br />
               efficient and most unwise manner. It is 
               <br />
