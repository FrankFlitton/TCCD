               Mr. INGRAM. I have been in the House 
               <br />
               when the hon. gentleman has held forth on 
               <br />
               this subject very often. If there was any- 
               <br />
               thing in which the hon. gentleman really 
               <br />
               shone. it was in his denunciations of What he 
               <br />
               called the outrageous gerrymander of the 
               <br />
               Tory party. The hon. gentleman says I was 
               <br />
               not in the House. But it was not necessary 
               <br />
               to be in the House to hear him—I knew 
               <br />
               people in Montreal who heard him. when he 
               <br />
               was talking in this House. The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman remembers that quitewell. I heard 
               <br />
               him and heard of him in one rural <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consti»</span>

               tuenCy not very far away and not very 
               <br />
               long ago but he took very good care not to 
               <br />
               say anything about these schedules. He 
               <br />
               was not discussing the Autonomy Bill on 
               <br />
               that line but on another line altogether. He 
               <br />
               takes good care not to discuss the redistri- 
               <br />
               bution made by his own party in this House. 
               <br />
               The hon. gentleman has swallowed himself

               on provincial rights the same as he has on 
               <br />

               <br />
               will get up before this debate closes and

               give us his views.

               Mr. W. J. ROCHE. It is refreshing to 
               <br />
               hear the member for West Assiniboia and 
               <br />
               some of his colleagues when they cannot 
               <br />
               justify this redistribution on population, fall 
               <br />
               back on other grounds. The hon. member 
               <br />
               says that we should not allow that great 
               <br />
               Athabaska river to go unrepresented. that 
               <br />
               large area. Some other hon. gentlemen say 
               <br />
               we have so many grist mills, blacksmith 
               <br />
               shops, &amp;c., and although they have not the 
               <br />
               population they want these industries repre- 
               <br />
               sented and especially the great Athabaska 
               <br />
               river. They are willing to take population 
               <br />
               as a basis in the other parts, but in the 
               <br />
               north where they have not population they 
               <br />
               fall back on area, but if they are going to 
               <br />
               take area in the north and in the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska in the new province of Al- 
               <br />
               berta, why not apply the same principle in 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan? You are not giving any 
               <br />
               representation at all to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Athabaska</span> por- 
               <br />
               tion of the new province of Saskatchewan, 
               <br />
               but two representatives to the Atiiabasvka 
               <br />
               portion of Alberta. There is nothing 
               <br />
               fair about that. The minister states it has 
               <br />

               <br />
               ulation the basis of redistribution. The 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman surely has not discarded the 
               <br />
               old-time doctrines of the Liberal partv. I 
               <br />
               can recall three years ago when the Liberal 
               <br />
               party in Manitoba assembled in convention 
               <br />
               on the eve of a local election and passed 
               <br />
               a number of resolutions making their plat- 
               <br />

               the redistribution here in 1003 that was done 
               <br />
               in the committee on the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. I listened to a great deal of the 
               <br />
               evidence and never heard one suggestion 
               <br />
               to that effect. It is true they did not take 
               <br />
               the census of 1901, but they assumed an 
               <br />
               increase of population from the taking or 
               <br />
               the census to the making of the redistribu- 
               <br />
               tion and that is the way they reached the

               representation and not on the estimated

               <br />
               no reason to anticipate the population of 
               <br />
               that country. If we had we must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">apply</span> it 
               <br />
               all around. We are not supposing that the
