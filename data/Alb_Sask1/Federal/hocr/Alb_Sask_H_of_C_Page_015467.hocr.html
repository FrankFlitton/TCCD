               So, in view of these expressions of opinion

               hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitz—

               thing in the distinction which has been 
               <br />
               claimed by the Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) between section 16, No. 2, and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">section</span> 16, No. 1. And let this also be obser— 
               <br />
               ved in this connection—that in the report to 
               <br />
               council of Sir John Thompson from which I 
               <br />
               have just quoted he was not dealing in any 
               <br />
               way with the character of the schools. The 
               <br />
               only circumstance to which he was calling 
               <br />
               attention was this: That whereas the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 gave to the minority in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories the right to establish schools 
               <br />
               whether majority schools had been estab— 
               <br />
               lished or not, the ordinance to which he re- 
               <br />
               ferred cut down that right. in his opinion, 
               <br />
               not in respect of the character of the schools, 
               <br />
               but in respect of the locality in which they 
               <br />
               could be established. That is to say, the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875 provided that the minority any- 
               <br />
               where might establish a separate school; 
               <br />
               whereas, the ordinances passed by virtue of 
               <br />
               that Act declared that the minority might 
               <br />
               erect a school in any district where a ma- 
               <br />
               jority school had been established—in other 
               <br />
               words they might create a separate school 
               <br />

               That is a very important statement indeed 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice. I rely upon it 
               <br />
               because he was not speaking without pre- 
               <br />
               paration; he was not speaking in the heat 
               <br />
               of debate ; he was reading from a carefully 
               <br />
               prepared opinion. Therefore, I attach an im- 
               <br />
               portance to these words which I would not 
               <br />
               feel inclined to do if I were dealing with the 
               <br />
               words of the Minister of Justice in ordinary 
               <br />
               debate. Well, then, we are to get the mean- 
               <br />
               ing of the Act of 1875 by referring to the 
               <br />
               earlier school ordinances. Let us see what 
               <br />
               the earlier school ordinances were, because 
               <br />
               according to the deliberate opinion of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice they set forth the mean- 
               <br />
               ing of the Act of 1875. My hon. friend the 
               <br />
               member for Brandon has relieved me of the 
               <br />
               necessity of quoting the earlier school or- 
               <br />
               dinances, because he has set forth in his 
               <br />
               speech on the second reading of the Bill 
               <br />
               the effect of these earlier school ordinances, 
               <br />
               and I will read his words as a fair state- 
               <br />
               ment of what the earlier school ordinances 
               <br />
               accomplished. He said, referring to the 
               <br />
               Act of 1875:
