               say that to-day in the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               there are not a dozen Protestant families 
               <br />
               who are not in such a position that, if they 
               <br />
               choose, they can be within reach of a Pro- 
               <br />
               testant school and can have their taxes ap— 
               <br />
               plied to the support of a Protestant school. 
               <br />
               But all this may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> true of Catholics also 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. I have known 
               <br />
               cases. in days gone by when there were 
               <br />
               comparatively few Catholics in the eastern 
               <br />
               townships, when in certain municipalities 
               <br />
               there would be only one or two families 
               <br />
               of Catholics,——not enough to support a dis— 
               <br />
               sentient school. They had the opportunity 
               <br />
               to join with the Catholics in adjoining 
               <br />
               municipalities to support a school to which 
               <br />
               they could send their children, and, under 
               <br />
               the school law of Quebec, their taxes were 
               <br />
               applied to that scnool. If there were any 
               <br />
               cases where the Catholics were too few 
               <br />
               to support a school, they would have to sup- 
               <br />
               port a Protestant school. just as the Hunting- 
               <br />
               (lon ‘ Gleaner’ says Protestants where they 
               <br />
               are too few to have a school of their own 
               <br />
               must support a Catholic school. And if their 
               <br />
               children go to a Protestant school, they 
               <br />
               would have to hear the teaching of the Pro- 
               <br />
               testant religion, just as Protestants under 
               <br />
               similar circumstances would send their 
               <br />
               children to a Catholic school to hear the 
               <br />
               teaching of the Catholic religion. The law 
               <br />
               puts the Catholics and the Protestants on 
               <br />
               exactly the same footing and justice is given 
               <br />
               to all. I have stated that the Protestants 
               <br />
               constitute about one-eighth of the total popu— 
               <br />
               lation of the province of Quebec, and that 
               <br />
               the taxes collected for the schools are divid- 
               <br />
               ed proportionately among the Protestants 
               <br />
               and the Catholics. In the second place. the 
               <br />
               provincial government gives large grants in 
               <br />
               aid of primary or elementary education, and 
               <br />
               those funds are generally divided ‘according 
               <br />
               to population. That is the general principle, 
               <br />
               but I want to say further that there are a 
               <br />
               great many individual items in those funds 
               <br />
               which are not divided according to popula- 
               <br />
               tion, but of which the Protestants get a far 
               <br />
               larger share than they would have a right to 
               <br />
               expect on that basis. I have here a state- 
               <br />
               ment of last year’s estimates voted by the 
               <br />
               Quebec legislature. There is a vote of $80,- 
               <br />
               000 for superior education. Of this $4,000 
               <br />
               is specifically given to the Laval University 
               <br />
               and $2.000 is given as a compensation to 
               <br />
               Protestant higher education. That is to say 
               <br />
               of the $6,000 special vote the Protestants 
               <br />
               get one-third and the Roman Catholics get 
               <br />
               two-thirds; but if the division were made 
               <br />
               according to population. the Protestants 
               <br />
               would only get one-eighth, instead of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> 
               <br />
               third. The remaining $74,000 is divided 
               <br />
               strictly according to population between the 
               <br />
               two committees and distributed by them,
