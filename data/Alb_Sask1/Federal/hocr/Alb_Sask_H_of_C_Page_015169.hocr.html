               Speaker, we know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">What</span> it is. Our system

               comparison with that of several European 
               <br />
               countries, and is greatly superior to that 
               <br />
               which exists in any other province of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. I shall give evidence of that pre-

               <br />
               not be efﬁcient unless properly applied ; and 
               <br />

               <br />
               in Paris again in 1900. All: these expositions

               Canada was competing with the great coun-
