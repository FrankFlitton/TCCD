               when the ink was scarcely dry on the Act

               Sir John Coleridge; these were the men 
               <br />
               who in 1871 expressed the opinion that the

               <br />

               Let me draw your attention to the fact

               that when section 22 of this Manitoba Act

               <br />
               was no word of criticism in this House 
               <br />
               or in the great newspapers of those days— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Brown, no word raised against the action

               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> which at that time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>

               Manitoba the very guarantee with respect to

               to give to the minority of the Northwest

               <br />
               that there was no word of protest raised 
               <br />
               at that time because it was then thought 
               <br />
               that Manitoba was to be a French preserve.

               Council under the provisions of section 146 
               <br />
               was a right delegated by the imperial par- 
               <br />
               liament to Her Majesty, and once exercised 
               <br />
               that power was exhausted. Could we do it 
               <br />
               under the Order in Council of 1870 ? Un- 
               <br />
               doubtedly not, because there is another prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of law which is equally certain with 
               <br />
               the one to which I have just referred: dele- 
               <br />
               gatus delegare non potest. Therefore, it is 
               <br />
               necesary for us to ﬁnd authority for our 
               <br />
               action in the present instance within the 
               <br />
               four corners of the Act of 1871. That Act 
               <br />
               in section 4 provides:
