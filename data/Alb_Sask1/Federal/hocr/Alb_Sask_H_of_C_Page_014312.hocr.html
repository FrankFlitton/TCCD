               <br />
               Now. the only ground you have to stand 
               <br />
               upon in objecting to this system in Ontario, 
               <br />
               is that it is the very absence of dogniatical 
               <br />
               teaching that you object to. Then, if you 
               <br />
               object to that. but not to any direct 
               <br />
               teaching or persuasion, that is the limit of 
               <br />
               your plea. But you cannot say that the

               was made in 1864 by the representatives

               of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova 
               <br />

               representatives met together to form 
               <br />
               a confederation. They made what we 
               <br />

               ﬁnd anything in the list of powers given

               idea was that education was a local con-

               cern, and the Dominion must keep its 
               <br />

               <br />
               incidental with the essential. One is the 
               <br />
               powers themselves. The other comes from 
               <br />
               an after thought, viz: Granting those pow-
