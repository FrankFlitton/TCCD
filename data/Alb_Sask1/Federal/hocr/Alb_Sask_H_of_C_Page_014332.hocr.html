               master General done? He has occupied 
               <br />
               the time of this House from nine o’clock 
               <br />
               until twenty minutes to eleven. And evi- 
               <br />
               dently he has tried to say something. Sev- 
               <br />
               eral times he has said : ‘ What is the ques- 
               <br />
               tion before the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'3</span> ’ But he never told 
               <br />
               Us what that question was. I do not know 
               <br />
               whether he was'discussing the Manitoba 
               <br />
               remedial legislation of 1896—Whether he 
               <br />
               was dreaming that he was out in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario abusing Sir Charles Tup- 
               <br />
               per for granting that remedial legislation,— 
               <br />
               or whether he was trying to offer some plea 
               <br />
               for interfering with the autonomy of the 
               <br />
               Northwest. He did say at the opening of 
               <br />
               his speech, that there was a Bill before the 
               <br />
               House. But he did not read a single sec- 
               <br />
               tion of it. He evidently does not know the 
               <br />
               provisions of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. He has never read that Act or he would 
               <br />
               not have made the wrong statements about 
               <br />
               it that he has made. He has simply wasted 
               <br />
               the time of the House for an hour and forty 
               <br />
               minutes—I say this with all deference; but 
               <br />
               i have as much respect for the members of 
               <br />
               this House as I have for the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General, and I think that some one ought 
               <br />
               to apologize. So, as one of the members 
               <br />
               constituting this House, as the Postmaster 
               <br />
               General does not apologize for wasting our 
               <br />
               time, I can only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hope—‘ﬁiat</span> the House will 
               <br />
               accept the apology I offer. The House has 
               <br />
               asmuch right to accept my apology as the 
               <br />
               Postmaster General has to propose, in the 
               <br />
               name of autonomy, a throttling piece of legis- 
               <br />
               lation for the Northwest Territories. This 
               <br />
               House has as much and more right to say 
               <br />
               that the member for Lincoln and Niagara 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lancaster) should apologize for the 
               <br />
               Postmaster General as to say that the pro- 
               <br />
               vincial parliament of the Northwest shall 
               <br />
               not control its own affairs. At nine o’clock 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General began to address 
               <br />
               this House. I have kept track, as well as I 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that he has inﬂicted upon the House. He 
               <br />
               spent half an hour in abu’sing the hon. mem~

               posed to discuss this Bill, if you can call it

               talked about intolerant speeches in this

               hardly understand as coming from the Post- 
               <br />
               master General. He spoke once of brotherly 
               <br />
               love. He spoke also of inﬂammatory and im- 
               <br />
               passioned speeches—but he did not tell u.- 
               <br />
               at which side of the House he was direct- 
               <br />
               ing his lecture. I have been in this House 
               <br />
               throughout this debate, and I am not in the 
               <br />
               habit of sitting here and not listening. I 
               <br />
               have not heard one impassioned sentence in 
               <br />
               this debate coming from this side of the 
               <br />
               House, and neither has any other hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber. The Postmaster General seems to 
               <br />
               think he has heard that kind of thing from 
               <br />
               this side. I heard the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fitzpatrick), before the Bill was read 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Postmaster</span> General would call a speech of 
               <br />
               brotherly love. The Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               said in effect: If my brothers of the Do-

               forty-one per cent of our people demanded
