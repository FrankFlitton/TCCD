               deal with this question, at the beginning of 
               <br />
               the discussion. It is needless to recall to 
               <br />
               the House the explosion of fanaticism that 
               <br />
               greeted the attitude taken, in the ﬁrst place, 
               <br />
               by the government in connection with the 
               <br />
               educational clause. From the outset of the 
               <br />
               debate, the leader of the opposition laid 
               <br />
               down a proposition that narrowed the dis— 
               <br />
               cussion to the consideration of the principle 
               <br />
               of the interference of the federal power in 
               <br />
               educational matters. When I spoke during 
               <br />
               that debate, I squarely opposed the pro- 
               <br />
               position of the leader of the opposition and 
               <br />
               the policy of his party on that subject, and 
               <br />
               gave a loyal support to the position taken 
               <br />
               by the government. I did not then think it 
               <br />
               wise to introduce into the discussion the 
               <br />
               consideration of the subject which we are 
               <br />
               now dealing with. I had, however, decided

               to move an amendment similar to that of 
               <br />
               the member for Jacques Cartier, or rather 
               <br />

               to the House on Friday, and that in a
