               Now, Sir, when the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               Introduced this Bill he expressed some sur- 
               <br />
               prise at the references made by newspapers 
               <br />
               and by some distinguished gentlemen in 
               <br />
               this country. 01? course the people of Can- 
               <br />
               ada everywhere were very much interested 
               <br />
               in the introduction of these Bills. This 
               <br />
               question had been up for consideration in 
               <br />
               this parliament._ Indeed, the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition had moved a resolution in the 
               <br />
               session of 1903 and again in 1904 in favour 
               <br />
               of absolute provincial autonomy being given 
               <br />
               to these Territories, unrestricted right to 
               <br />
               deal with every thing of a provincial char- 
               <br />
               acter. That was the policy of the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion in this House in the sessions or 1903 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 1904. May I be permitted to tell the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman what was the chief reason 
               <br />
               for the adverse newspaper comment and 
               <br />
               criticism which he has read from distingu- 
               <br />
               ished men in this country ? It is because 
               <br />
               they had known the stand the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman had taken in 1896 on this educa- 
               <br />
               tional or religious question. The people did 
               <br />
               not dis-trust the right hon. gentleman, they 
               <br />
               never thought for a moment that he would 
               <br />
               go back on his record of 1896, and venture 
               <br />
               to introduce into this House certain clauses 
               <br />
               in the Autonomy Bills which would stir up 
               <br />
               religious strife in this country. Therefore, 
               <br />
               he had at his back the whole Canadian peo- 
               <br />
               ple; he had not only the,conﬁdence of the 
               <br />
               Liberal party, but the conﬁdence of a great 
               <br />
               number of Liberal-Conservatives in this 
               <br />
               country, many of whom voted for him in 
               <br />
               1896 on this very question. So, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, the right hon. gentleman would 
               <br />
               not have far to go to ﬁnd a reason why 
               <br />
               the newspapers and leading gentlemen 
               <br />
               who had supported him in 1896 were 
               <br />
               very much surprised to find that he had 
               <br />
               now changed his policy in regard to pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. Some hon. gentlemen who 
               <br />
               have spoken from the other side of the 
               <br />
               House ventured to say that those who 
               <br />
               have criticised this Bill are not well ac- 
               <br />
               quainted with the question. Well, that may 
               <br />
               be the case as to some of the criticisms, but 
               <br />
               I do not think the right hon. gentleman or 
               <br />
               any member Of his government would say 
               <br />
               this applies to all the criticisms that have 
               <br />
               been oifered to the educational clauses in 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               perpetual racial and sectarian discord, which

               Mr. BLAIN. Who says ‘no, no’ ? I say

               that the Presbyterian body in Canada and

               no,’ have sent in their protest with these

               facts before me. I have the right to say
