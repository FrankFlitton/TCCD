               to know when the Northwest Territories

               <br />
               making an attack upon proyincial rights. 
               <br />
               Well, Sir, my view is that the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories are not yet members of the con- 
               <br />
               federation of Canada. \Ve know that they 
               <br />
               have not the rights of a province in the 
               <br />
               matter of education, that we have absolute 
               <br />
               and unlimited jurisdiction as far as the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories go, and I think I can 
               <br />
               fairly say, Mr. Speaker. that the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories in the matter of education or in 
               <br />
               any other matter have not even the colour 
               <br />
               of a right. The question has arisen: \Vhen 
               <br />
               do they enter the union. or when do they 
               <br />
               become a party to the compact formed in 
               <br />

               tain. the premier of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories says that the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               entered the union on the 15th July, 1870. 
               <br />
               One might ask by virtue of what law did 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories become a party 
               <br />
               to the contract which implies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> possession 
               <br />
               of all the powers which were conceded to 
               <br />
               the other provinces by the imperial parlia-

               tional law. But, let us for the moment 
               <br />
               accept the argument of Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Haul-tail),</span> let us 
               <br />
               suppose that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territoriesentered</span> the 
               <br />
               union in 1870; by the terms of the British

               North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America</span> Act, separate schools having 
               <br />
               been established in the west since by the 
               <br />
               federal government which was the compe- 
               <br />
               tent authority, and that law having been 
               <br />
               ratiﬁed by the legislature of the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories, separate schools were established 
               <br />
               for ever and we cannot now abolish them. 
               <br />
               That, is not my opinion only. I would not 
               <br />
               give my own legal opinion on such an im- 
               <br />
               portant question, but in stating this. I give 
               <br />
               the opinion which was expressed by Sir 
               <br />
               Charles Hibbert Tupper in 1896. Speaking 
               <br />
               on the Manitoba school question in 1896. he 
               <br />
               quoted and endorsed what Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mills</span>
