               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884</span> as reported in ‘Hansard ’ and observe 
               <br />
               the explicit language that was used by 
               <br />
               Sir Leonard Tilley and also by Sir Richard 
               <br />

               that at this distant date <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3011</span> will ﬁnd

               an hon. gentleman interpreting that 
               <br />
               clause in language entirely different 
               <br />
               from what Sir Leonard Tilley and Sir 
               <br />
               Richard Cartwright used at that time. Sir 
               <br />
               Leonard Tilley was distinct in his declara— 
               <br />
               tion that the. capital sum should never be 
               <br />
               paid and Sir Richard Cartwright who was 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial critic at that time accepted 
               <br />
               that explanation and understood that only

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$142.41;</span> yearly which was called 
               <br />
               interest should be paid over. I would draw 
               <br />
               the attention of the minister to this item 
               <br />
               again and possibly if he still thinks there 
               <br />
               is any room for doubt, before the resolu- 
               <br />
               tion passes the ﬁnal stage he will give it 
               <br />
               his further valuable consideration and place 
               <br />
               the matter beyond all possible doubt by 
               <br />
               leaving out any reference at all to the 
               <br />
               matter of interest which would leave it 
               <br />
               clear that the sum on which this interest is 
               <br />
               calculated is not capital at all and that 
               <br />
               the province would have no claim on the 
               <br />
               capital sum.

               Mr. FIELDING. I think the language

               of the Ontario case and the language used 
               <br />

               Mr. HENDERSON. I would say this

               further that we are not bound. I think, 
               <br />
               exactly by the language Of this resolution. 
               <br />
               We must read it in connection with the Act 
               <br />
               of 1885, cap. 4. which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> additional powers

               when it is for the purpose of constructing

               tirely upon the wording of this resolu—

               ed in the light of the legislation of 1885. 
               <br />
               That is a matter which I would desire 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> look over very 
               <br />
               carefully indeed. I may say to the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance that I took good care to 
               <br />
               see the Minister of Justice. We were both 
               <br />
               in the city of Quebec and we. had quite 
               <br />
               a good understanding on that ques- 
               <br />
               tion in a jocular way. I would invite the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance to draw the attention 
               <br />
               of the Minister of Justice to that special 
               <br />
               Act of Parliament to which he referred 
               <br />
               on a former occasion and have that Act 
               <br />
               of Parliament read in connection with the 
               <br />
               present legislation and see whether or not 
               <br />
               it might throw some other light upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">113,</span>
