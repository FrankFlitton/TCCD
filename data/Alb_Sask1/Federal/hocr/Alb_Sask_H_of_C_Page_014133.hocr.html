               So far as the control of the lands is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, I adhere to the opinion I before ex-

               pressed in this House: that the people of the

               rights are fully capable of dealing with these 
               <br />
               lands; that they are entitled to the control 
               <br />
               of these lands just as much as the people 
               <br />
               of the eastern provinces of Canada are en-

               the Minister of Agriculture is supposed to

               <br />
               ance to a delightful piece of information 
               <br />
               with regard to this matter. It declares that 
               <br />
               these lands should not be handed over to the 
               <br />

               am inclined to think—looking at the history 
               <br />
               of the past and looking forward a. little to 
               <br />
               what may be expected in the future—that

               handed over to the people and become the

               <br />
               are under the control of the provinces. The

               <br />
               all business relating to public lands. Why

               referred to the example of the United States.
