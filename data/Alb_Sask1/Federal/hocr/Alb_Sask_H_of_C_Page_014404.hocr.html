               Now, a circumstance occurred not long 
               <br />
               ago which rather lends force to the argu- 
               <br />
               ment and which affects some men in 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman’s cabinet. What 
               <br />
               did we ﬁnd in October of last year ? We 
               <br />
               found the right hon. gentleman coming 
               <br />
               down to the province of Ontario, getting 
               <br />
               down upon bended knees before a luminary 
               <br />
               of the law and saying to him in so many 
               <br />
               English words: My dear Mr. Aylesworth I 
               <br />
               have colleagues and representatives in the 
               <br />
               government from the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               who have been with me for some time, but 
               <br />
               1 ﬁnd that in Ontario my hold is growing 
               <br />
               gradually weaker. I am not only not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               creasing the strength. but I see that 
               <br />
               strength diminishing. I do not want to 
               <br />
               turn these out to pasture, poor as they 
               <br />
               are, and so I must have you come in and 
               <br />
               save the remnant in the province of Onta- 
               <br />
               rio. The right hon. gentleman needed some 
               <br />
               strength, and if ever there was a practi- 
               <br />
               cal illustration of that need we have it 
               <br />
               this year. The lynx—eyed minister, the 
               <br />
               Postmaster General (Sir William Mulock), 
               <br />
               is not here, and I suppose I may venture 
               <br />
               to mention him to-day Without his inﬂicting 
               <br />
               upon this House that oft—repeated story 
               <br />
               repeated so well along the concessions and 
               <br />
               side lines of North Ontario, learned and 
               <br />
               conned and repeated so often up and down 
               <br />
               the province of Ontario, and repeated so 
               <br />
               often in this House, that it is becoming a 
               <br />
               tale oft-told, with the little interest that 
               <br />
               attaches to a tale oft-told. I suppose that 
               <br />
               I may refer to the fact that he slept at his 
               <br />
               post while the most important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> 
               <br />
               was being performed for these orphan ter- 
               <br />
               ritories in the Northwest. Is there not some 
               <br />
               reason why there should be a brave, bright, 
               <br />
               strong, wide-awake man brought in from 
               <br />
               the west who will not sleep at his post, 
               <br />
               but who will know What is going on and 
               <br />
               see that his geographical ministerial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re«</span> 
               <br />
               sponsibility is fully exercised in the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation of the people in the country from 
               <br />
               which he comes. If the right hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) can keep consti- 
               <br />
               tutionally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">portfolios</span> open for one month, 
               <br />
               he can keep them open for two, three or 
               <br />
               four months. He was the gentleman who, 
               <br />
               in opposition, pleaded always for a full 
               <br />
               cabinet, for the ministerial responsibility 
               <br />
               to be properly divided and distributed, and 
               <br />
               that there should be at the post of power 
               <br />
               in each department a responsible head. 
               <br />
               He knows as well as we all know that that 
               <br />
               is proper constitutional doctrine, and that 
               <br />
               it is necessary for the good government and 
               <br />
               good administration of the country. Yet he 
               <br />
               does not ﬁll the vacant position, and he does 
               <br />
               not give us any valid reason why.

               to the fact that after the death of the late 
               <br />
               Hon. Thomas White the portfolio of the 
               <br />
               Interior was vacant for some time. That 
               <br />
               is true, but he also knows that at that time 
               <br />
               a new principle in constitutional govern- 
               <br />
               ment, the principle that there must be a 
               <br />
               responsible minister for the district, had 
               <br />
               not been engrafted on the constitution of 
               <br />
               this country. The First Minister has given 
               <br />
               us that new line in the constitution. At 
               <br />
               that time also there was no great crisis in 
               <br />
               the Northwest, as there is on the present 
               <br />
               occasion, for it must be remembered that the 
               <br />
               vacancy in the portfolio of the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior to-day is caused owing to the 
               <br />
               fact that legislation is before this House 
               <br />
               which the responsible minister from the 
               <br />
               district refused to endorse and which he 
               <br />
               claims is not satisfactory to the people of 
               <br />
               that region. Therefore, the circumstances 
               <br />
               are entirely changed, and, as far as the 
               <br />
               parallel goes, the Prime Minister’s argu- 
               <br />
               ment will not hold godd. The custom in 
               <br />
               all these matters in the old country is that 
               <br />
               there shall be a responsible minister at 
               <br />
               each post. The leader of the opposition (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden) has referred to a case in 
               <br />
               point, where, in 1871, objection was simply 
               <br />
               taken in the House of Commons to the fact 
               <br />
               that Mr. Childers, First Lord of the Ad— 
               <br />
               lmiralty, was absent during <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">illness,</span> and 
               <br />
               within one month thereafter Mr. Childers 
               <br />
               resigned. This is even more important than 
               <br />
               the case of the absence of a minister 
               <br />
               through illness. We have before us an im~ 
               <br />
               portant measure which is going to affect 
               <br />
               that Northwest country for weal or woe. 
               <br />
               The minister refuses to sanction that mea- 
               <br />
               sure and retires from the cabinet, but owing 
               <br />
               to certain pressure, I do not know what 
               <br />
               the pressure or arrangement may have been, 
               <br />
