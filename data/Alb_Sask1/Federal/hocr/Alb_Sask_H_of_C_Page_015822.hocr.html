               given to the majority and to the minority

               Justice, because we want to deal frankly

               <br />
               he appreciates my contention; in the ﬁrst

               part of the section you deal only with se-

               <br />
               school only where they are in the minority. 
               <br />
               Now, so far as the Catholics are concerned 
               <br />
               you desire to go further and provide 
               <br />

               ority where that minority is a minority in 
               <br />
               a district all those things which the min- 
               <br />
               ority has at the present time. With this 
               <br />
               additional amendment we will ﬁnd ourselves 
               <br />
               in this position that under the Act as we 
               <br />
               now have it the majority, Whatever that 
               <br />
               majority may be, has also the same right 
               <br />
               in respect to religious instruction that the 
               <br />
               minority has got and what is intended, it 
               <br />
               seems to me is to conﬁrm to that majonity the 
               <br />
               same rights and privileges as the minority 
               <br />
               has in a school district, whether that ma- 
               <br />
               jority be Protestant or Catholic.
