               together in their provincial legislatures I

               am of the opinion that if the lands were 
               <br />
               given to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'the</span> provinces, these 25 men in

               minister them in the interests of the people: 
               <br />
               and if, aﬂter due consideration, they decided 
               <br />
               that the best policy was to give the lands 
               <br />
               free to the settlers, or it they adopted that 
               <br />
               policy and it was found after experience 
               <br />
               that a small charge should be placed upon 
               <br />
               the land. then it would be for them to

               do as they wish; and if these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">repre‘</span>

               entirely in their own hands, they would 
               <br />

               they considered best. Men can go'into those

               provinces now and receive free grant lands ; 
               <br />

               <br />
               sidered prudent that the new settler should 
               <br />
               contribute a small amount per acre for 
               <br />
               his land. I do not think that would 
               <br />
               be a very harsh provision. the proceeds 
               <br />
               would go towards helping the settlers. This 
               <br />
               would bring in a considerable amount 
               <br />
               of money to the provincial treasury. and 
               <br />
               if they'did not have the land they would 
               <br />
               have the money. I think it was stated the 
               <br />
               other day by the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               that the new provinces would require an 
               <br />
               enormous amount of money to build their 
               <br />
               roads and other purposes, and it would be 
               <br />
               for them to say whether it would not be 
               <br />
               good policy to derive some revenue from the 
               <br />
               lands. If these lands were given to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, as I think they should be, they would 
               <br />
               still form part and parcel of the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada, they would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> to the 
               <br />
               sons and daughters of the people who live 
               <br />
               in older Canada, men who are going from 
               <br />
               other parts to help develop that country. I 
               <br />
               do not think that the federal government 
               <br />
               at Ottawa is in the better position to admin- 
               <br />
               ister and control these lands, and to adopt 
               <br />
               the best policy for the settlement of that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> I am rather inclined to think that 
               <br />
               a provincial government would be in a bet- 
               <br />
               ter position to administer the lands for the 
               <br />
               best interests of the country. Therefore 
               <br />
               I am not in favour of claUSe 20 of this Bill. 
               <br />
               I submit that in my humble opinion the 
               <br />
               policy of giving the lands to the provinces 
               <br />
               as they were given in Ontario and Quebec, 
               <br />
               would olfer a stronger inducement to peo- 
               <br />
               ple to go out and settle there. I think it 
               <br />
               would be one of the very best policies that 
               <br />
               could be adopted by this government for the 
               <br />
               further settlement of that western country.
