               <br />
               to think not. In my humble opinion, the 
               <br />
               solution which the government has reached 
               <br />
               is an admirable one, and I ﬁrmly believe it 
               <br />
               would be considered good legislation if the 
               <br />
               Dominion government, provided they had 
               <br />
               the power, were to adopt a national school 
               <br />
               law to apply to all the provinces, which 
               <br />
               would be on the same lines as that under 
               <br />
               the existing legislation which it is sought to 
               <br />
               perpetuate——-a law which provides for the 
               <br />
               greatest eﬂicieucy, which provides for the 
               <br />
               same education to the children, whether of 
               <br />
               the minority or of the majority, and which 
               <br />
               provides for the teaching of the Christian 
               <br />
               religion in which the children have been 
               <br />
               born.——a law which appears to me to be the 
               <br />
               highest wisdom in respect of educational 
               <br />
               policy. Extremists might not be satisﬁed, 
               <br />
               but all reasonable men would be. If there 
               <br />
               is one thing which has retarded the progress 
               <br />
               of Canada more than another, it has been 
               <br />
               religious discord. In these enlightened 
               <br />
               days cannot we be big enough, and broad 
               <br />
               enough, and charitable enough, to take a 
               <br />
               larger view of things. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cannot</span> we bring 
               <br />
               ourselves closer in touch with the teachings

               <br />
               How utterly opposed to that true spirit of 
               <br />
               charity is the position taken to-day by the 
               <br />
               extremists and agitators in both of the great 
               <br />
               religious families. No good ever resulted 
               <br />
               from the discords of the past. No good can

               ever result from such agitations which are 
               <br />
               so foreign to the true spirit of Christianity.
