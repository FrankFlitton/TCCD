               parliament as the measure of a united 
               <br />

               <br />

               against it time and again? Was not that 
               <br />
               somewhat peculiar? One by one the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> 
               <br />
               tenses of the right hon. gentleman have 
               <br />
               been struck from him, and by this time he 
               <br />
               stands before this House and country 
               <br />
               pretty bare. He is no longer the some- 
               <br />
               what picturesque object he was a few 
               <br />
               months ago. Shorn of his feathers and 
               <br />
               his beautiful colours, he is coming to be 
               <br />
               known more and more for what he is and 
               <br />
               what he has proved himself. If in 1896, 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend secured any popu- 
               <br />
               larity among the staunch stalwart Lib- 
               <br />
               erals of this country, he secured it solely 
               <br />
               because he then made himself the cham- 
               <br />
               pion of provincial rights. And it today 
               <br />
               he has forfeited the respect, esteem and 
               <br />
               conﬁdence of thousands and tens of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thou»</span> 
               <br />
               sands in this country, as he has, it is be— 
               <br />
               cause he has at last come out in his true 
               <br />
               colours as being the opponent and not the 
               <br />
               champion of provincial rights. It is be- 
               <br />
               cause he has reversed his position. The 
               <br />
               position of 1896‘ was apparently a brave 
               <br />
               one. That of 1905 is an entirely dif- 
               <br />
               ferent one, and to it is due the loss 
               <br />
