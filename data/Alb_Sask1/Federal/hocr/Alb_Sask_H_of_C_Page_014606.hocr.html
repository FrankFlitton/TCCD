               people, and one of his friends said that the 
               <br />
               Reform party fought the church a few years 
               <br />
               ago, and that it even took the church to the 
               <br />
               courts and that this is an evidence that the 
               <br />
               Reform party is not in favour of a Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate. Perhaps not, but it was the Re- 
               <br />
               form party that brought him here. The 
               <br />
               member for Pictou told us that we on this 
               <br />
               side dislike the Catholics and the Catholic 
               <br />
               church. That is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:peculiar</span> assertion on 
               <br />
               his part; it has no foundation in fact, not 
               <br />
               the slightest in the world. So far as I know 
               <br />
               and I verily believe it, there is no senti- 
               <br />
               ment of dislike here either for a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic or the Roman Catholic church. We 
               <br />
               have the same respect and veneration for 
               <br />
               that church that we have for other churches 
               <br />
               and for its members as we have for other 
               <br />
               members of the community. That state- 
               <br />
               ment of his only exists in his imagination 
               <br />
               and I want to say so. What is the gist of 
               <br />
               all this discussion this afternoon ? The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Agriculture gave us a very learned 
               <br />
               disquisition but he never touched the sub- 
               <br />
               ject. He tried to draw a red herring across 
               <br />
               the track like the member for Pictou who 
               <br />
               never mentioned the issue from the moment 
               <br />
               he rose till he sat down. He tried to do like 
               <br />
               that little ﬁsh that spouts out an inky ﬂuid 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'water</span> so as to becloud everything—

               I see the hon. member for Pictou is leaving

               <br />
               the church with the state. I tell him that we

               accept the challenge, and that we are pre 
               <br />
               pared to meet him on every platform in the 
               <br />
               broad Dominion of Canada. He will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               us ready for the battle, and willing to take 
               <br />
               our share in it. The allegation is that a re-

               presentative of the church has improperly 
               <br />
               interfered with the duties of the state. Who 
               <br />
               is responsible for that ? Not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a’blegate.</span> 
               <br />
               He is trying to do his duty, and I do not 
               <br />
               blame him; he is representing his church. 
               <br />
               Who is responsible for it ? The men who 
               <br />
               brought him here—brought him under false 
               <br />
               pretenses if you can judge from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his«</span> 
               <br />
               tory of the ablegate since he has been here. 
               <br />
               What did he come for? To reconcile dif- 
               <br />
               ferences between them and their church 
               <br />

               <br />

               him; but we blame the men who brought 
               <br />
               him and who have employed him in that 
               <br />
               work. They are the parties who are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">res</span> 
               <br />
               ponsible, and they are the parties who will

               be brought to book for it as soon as the 
               <br />
               voice of the people of Canada has an op- 
               <br />
               portunity of being heard on the subject.

               <br />
               not so short that they will forget it. They 
               <br />
               will not forget it by any means. I ask 
               <br />
               again, who brought him here? I have an- 
               <br />
               swered that question, and can my answer 
               <br />
               be denied ? Is there any attempt to deny 
               <br />
               Not at all. There is and always has 
               <br />
               been in this country a dread of the interfer- 
               <br />
               ence of the church with the state, and there 
               <br />

               speaking of a principle which is inherent

               We have learned long since of the painful 
               <br />
               effects of the interference of the church 
               <br />
               with the rights of the state. That question 
               <br />
               was fought out. and the relative duties of 
               <br />
               each was assigned to it. But that question 
               <br />
               is cropping up to-day, and who are res- 
               <br />
               ponsible for it ? The present government; 
               <br />
               they are the parties who have introduced

               <br />
               there is excitement; that is why so many

               letters and petitions are coming to Ottawa ; 
               <br />
               that is why there is such an intense <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feelingl</span>
