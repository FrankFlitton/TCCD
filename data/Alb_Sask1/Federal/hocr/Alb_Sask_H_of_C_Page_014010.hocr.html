               Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, the object

               <br />
               That is the section which deﬁnes undue

               proposed amendment goes a little farther 
               <br />
               than the present section, and provides 
               <br />
               against the canvassing or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soliciting</span> of votes
