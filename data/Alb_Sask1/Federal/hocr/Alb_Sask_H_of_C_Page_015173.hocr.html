               national school system of that country. I

               take issue with the right hon. gentleman

               <br />
               school system of the United States, that 
               <br />
               country would never have been able to

               digest the great foreign element that has 
               <br />
               come into it. And I contend that if you im- 
               <br />
               pose separate schools, ecclesiastical schools, 
               <br />
               on these new provinces of he west, you

               gress upon which they have so hopefully 
               <br />
               entered. The public school system is the 
               <br />
               hope of the United States. If they have

               great problems, the men who are being

               trained in their public schools are the men 
               <br />
               who will solve them. I have often spoken
