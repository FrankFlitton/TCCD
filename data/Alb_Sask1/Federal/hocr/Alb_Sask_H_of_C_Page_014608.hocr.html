               "his, he says, is the sum and substance 
               <br />
               of the interview. Now, what was the memo- 
               <br />
               randum he gave? It was two carefully 
               <br />
               drawn clauses handed by the Papal delegate 
               <br />
               to Hon. Colin Campbell to enable him to 
               <br />
               facilitate the object he had in view—the 
               <br />
               extension of the boundaries of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               He proposed to this end the alteration of the 
               <br />
               statute of Manitoba relating to education, 
               <br />
               by adding to section 125 two subsections. 
               <br />
               One was as follows :—

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\(b)</span> And when in any city or town there shall 
               <br />
               be thirty or more Roman Catholic children and 
               <br />
               also thirty or more non-Roman Catholic chil- 
               <br />
               dren. or in any village more than ﬁfteen of 
               <br />
               each of such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">classes,</span> the trustees shall, if re— 
               <br />
               quested by a petition of parents or guardians of 
               <br />
               such number of such classes, provide separate 
               <br />
               accommodation for each of such classes and 
               <br />
               employ for them respectively Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               and non-Roman Catholic teachers. 
               <br />

               That was one of the amendments. The 
               <br />
               other was to provide for exactly the same 
               <br />
               in the country—two carefully drawn, well- 
               <br />
               worded subsections to put in a statute. And 
               <br />
               what conclusion did the Manitoba delegates 
               <br />
               reach with regard to the matter? I say 
               <br />
               the only conclusion they could come to was 
               <br />
               that these clauses were drawn up by the 
               <br />
               government here. And I think that they 
               <br />
               honestly believed that they were drawn up 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick). 
               <br />
               Does that hon. gentleman deny that he had 
               <br />
               anything to do with the drawing up of these 
               <br />
               subsections ?
