               while ago there was a return brought down

               to this House stating that there was only

               <br />
               in the area I have described. Moreover. it

               is the only section of the country where 
               <br />

               sequently, my contention is simply this, that 
               <br />
               if you'create north of the old Alberta line a

               you can include therein everything worth

               including in the southwestern part of the 
               <br />
               present territory of Athabaska. What would 
               <br />
               be left if you did that? There would be 
               <br />
               nothing left except a few scattered people. 
               <br />
               not suﬁiciently numerous to be organized.

               The right hon. Prime Minister the other

               day. when I referred as a precedent to the 
               <br />
               addition of Ashnanipi to the county of 
               <br />
               'Saguenay, stated that there were no people 
               <br />
               there. According to the last census. Ash— 
               <br />
               liaiiipi in 1901 had 161 whites. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">According</span> 
               <br />
               to the same census all Athabaska had only 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">243</span> whites. and yet we are only dealing with 
               <br />
               the half of Athabaska. The probability is 
               <br />
               that it contains no more whites than Ash~ 
               <br />
               nanipi. Yet there has never been a question 
               <br />
               of organizing Ashnanipi. and nobody has 
               <br />
               felt that there was any grievance in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conse</span>

               quence. My contention is that you can carve 
               <br />
               out one constituency in southwestern Atha— 
               <br />

               <br />
               give representation to all the interests con—

               the province of Alberta; it ﬁnds that it 
               <br />

               Sir WILFRID <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">LAFRIER.</span> I think the 
               <br />
               House is familiar with the ﬁgures and the 
               <br />
               arguments which the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Moir</span> 
               <br />
               treal (Mr. Allies) has just repeated, though 
               <br />
               I do not blame <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">him.</span> for repeating them 
               <br />
               again. But I do not think that his ﬁgures 
               <br />
               have anything to do with the contention 
               <br />
               he has advanced <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> The object of my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> 
               <br />
               hon. friend has been to show that there are 
               <br />
               more people in the 11 constituencies south 
               <br />
               of Red Deer than north of it. I do not dis- 
               <br />
               pute that fact, and I think I was the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to give the ﬁgures showing that 
               <br />
               according to the votes registered at the 
               <br />
               last election, there are more people in 
               <br />
               the south than in the north. But I have 
               <br />
               already stated to the House that these 
               <br />
               ﬁgures were not the only ﬁgures we had in 
               <br />
               our mind. There were other sources of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in»</span> 
               <br />
               formation which had also to be taken into
