               For my own part I do not, personally, look 
               <br />
               with favour upon separate schools. I would 
               <br />
               rather there should be no separate schools 
               <br />
               throughout the length and breadth of this 
               <br />
               great Dominion, but that every school in

               <br />
               offensive to pupils or parents of any deno-

               mination or church. It seems to me that it 
               <br />
               would be preferable that the Protestant and

               <br />

               <br />
               school together and grow up and associate 
               <br />
               together, for we invariably ﬁnd that where, 
               <br />
               in any part of this country there is the

               gieatest prejudice and suspicion upon the 
               <br />

               <br />
