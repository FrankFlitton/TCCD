               friend seems to be unable to understand 
               <br />
               that the giving away of a part of the land 
               <br />
               can increase the value of the remainder. 
               <br />
               If he is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">able</span> to understand that then 
               <br />
               I am unable to explain it to him. The fact 
               <br />
               is that the giving away of the lands in the 
               <br />
               Northwest and the policy under which these 
               <br />
               lands have been given away during the 
               <br />
               last few <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years.</span> have resulted in doubling 
               <br />
               and trebling the value of the lands still 
               <br />
               remaining in the hands of the government 
               <br />
               and the railway companies, and at the 
               <br />
               same time it has had the result of increas- 
               <br />
               ing by millions and milions of dollars the 
               <br />
               revenue of this Dominion and the trade of 
               <br />
               Canada. I am astonished beyond measure 
               <br />
               to hear the representative of a manufactur- 
               <br />
               ing constituency in the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               declare that he does not know that it makes 
               <br />
               any difference as to whether the west ls 
               <br />
               settled or not. If there is one thing the 
               <br />
               manufacturers of eastern Canada depend 
               <br />
               on more than another, it is on the securing 
               <br />
               of settlers upon these prairies. It is that 
               <br />
               increase of settlement that has given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> 
               <br />
               their increased business within the last 
               <br />
               few years, and it is to the further increase 
               <br />
               of that settlement they must look for 
               <br />
               still further increase of business. If the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brantford (Mr. Cook- 
               <br />
               shutt) does not know that, I am satisﬁed 
               <br />
               there is not another manufacturer in this 
               <br />
               great city who does not know it. As to 
               <br />
               the allegation that there is discrimination 
               <br />

               <br />

               knowledge goes there is no such discrimi- 
               <br />
               nation. I say that the administration of 
               <br />
               the lands in the Northwest has been on a 
               <br />
               fair basis and that the settler is not asked 
               <br />
               who he is or where he comes from. The 
               <br />
               policy of the government is to secure set- 
               <br />
               tlers for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theIIand.</span> and if it should happen 
               <br />
               that this or the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span> is in the 
               <br />
               way, the men we make settlers of in the 
               <br />
               Northwest are men who go there to over- 
               <br />
