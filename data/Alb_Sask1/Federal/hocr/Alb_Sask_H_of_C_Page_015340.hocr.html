               <br />
               as my hon. friend from North Toronto (Mr. 
               <br />
               Foster) said a while ago, we have to be 
               <br />
               patient. We are learning patience at the 
               <br />
               hands of the government, particularly these 
               <br />

               <br />
               into practical shape if it must pass. We are

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fliept</span> in the House day after day and

               evening after evening waiting for the

               long deferred explanation, and I think it 
               <br />
               is time that it came. I have a word 
               <br />
               to say, if the hon. gentleman will not 
               <br />
               get angry with me for saying it, in regard 
               <br />
               to the position of the hon. member for Sas— 
               <br />
               katchewan (Mr. Lamont). I would like him 
               <br />
               to tell me, if, when he voted for the secOnd 
               <br />
               . reading of the Bill, he voted for the original 
               <br />
               clause or for the clause that has been sub- 
               <br />
               stituted for section 16 ? I do not think that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman knows. I do not think 
               <br />
               that any hon. member in the House knows 
               <br />
               what he was voting for according to the 
               <br />
               statement of the hon. Minister of Justice. 
               <br />
               We are not supposed to know What we are 
               <br />
               voting for and yet we have carried the 
               <br />
               second reading of this Bill. We have now 
               <br />
               come to the discussion of the controversial 
               <br />
               clause of this Bill which caused the resign- 
               <br />
               nation of the late hon. Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior and very nearly caused the resignation 
               <br />
               of other members of the cabinet. and we 
               <br />
               have not yet been afforded that information 
               <br />

               <br />
               was made. Yet, week after week during

               the discussion in this House hon. members,
