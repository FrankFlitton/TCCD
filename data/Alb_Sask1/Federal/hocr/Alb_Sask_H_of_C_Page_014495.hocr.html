               <br />

               follow my right hon. friend on that occa- 
               <br />
               sion, there was such great divergence be- 
               <br />
               tween the position he took in Quebec and 
               <br />
               that which he took elsewhere that I was 
               <br />
               not prepared to give him the opportunity 
               <br />
               of coercing Manitoba and consequently 
               <br />
               voted against his resolution as I did against 
               <br />
               the Bill of my own leader. The stand I 
               <br />
               then took was that if the people of that pro- 
               <br />
               vince wanted separate schools, let them es- 
               <br />
               tablish that system themselves ; but if they 
               <br />
               did not. I was determined to defeat any at- 
               <br />
               tempt to place upon that province the bur- 
               <br />
               den of separate schools against its will. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> may very well ask whence comes this 
               <br />
               demand for this clause in the Bill. I have 
               <br />
               pointed out that the moment those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories become provinces. they have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> 
               <br />
               of 1875 011 their statutes. Supposing the 
               <br />
               educational clauses should be withdrawn en- 
               <br />
               tirely from this measure, the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               will still remain. Therefore if the conten- 
               <br />
               tion of the First Minister be right, if the 
               <br />
               Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1875</span> is the constitution in those Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories to-day and will be the constitution 
               <br />
               of those provinces when created, what has

               tention of my hon. friend the leader of the

               opposition is correct and it will be within 
               <br />
               the powers of those provinces to abrogate 
               <br />
               that law if they choose, why insist upon 
               <br />
               embodying it in this Bill. The Act of the 
               <br />

               <br />
