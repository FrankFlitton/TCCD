               that the most emphatic contradiction possi- 
               <br />
               ble. There is not a word of truth in the 
               <br />
               statement. I am not here to deny that peti- 
               <br />
               tions may have come in on the other side 
               <br />
               from the province of Quebec. About that 
               <br />
               I know nothing. The Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               endeavoured to lead this House to believe 
               <br />
               that these petitions were distributed among 
               <br />
               the Protestants of Ontario for the purpose 
               <br />
               of inﬂaming their passions, but that similar 
               <br />
               petitions were not distributed among the 
               <br />
               Protestants of Quebec. I said last night, 
               <br />
               and I repeat, that the very same peti- 
               <br />
               tions which were distributed in Ontario 
               <br />
               were distributed throughout Quebec, and 
               <br />
               many of them have come back since signed, 
               <br />
               not only by Conservatives, but by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Reform‘</span> 
               <br />
               ers as well. If petitions did come from the 
               <br />
               supporters of the one party for and against 
               <br />
               a certain measure, does it necessarily follow 
               <br />
               that the members of that party are working 
               <br />
               these petitions for the purpose of raising 
               <br />
               sectional strife? If it does, then let me 
               <br />
               refer the hon. gentleman to the fact that 
               <br />
               supporters of the government in Ontario are 
               <br />
               petitioning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> in hundreds of thousands 
               <br />
               against the very Bill the government has 
               <br />
               before the House. and from the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec as well, and likewise the maritime 
               <br />
               provinces. They are petitioning against 
               <br />
               this Bill, while, at the same time, supporters 
               <br />
               of the government are sending here peti- 
               <br />
               tions in favour of it—doing the very thing 
               <br />
               which the Minister of Justice tried to lead 
               <br />
               this House to believe is so very wrong. Be- 
               <br />
               cause petitions come against this Bill from 
               <br />
               Conservatives and also in favour of it, there- 
               <br />
               fore the Conservatives must be doing some- 
               <br />
               thing that is radically wrong. But the very 
               <br />
               same thing applies to the opposite side. And, 
               <br />
               as my hon. friend from East Elgin has said: 
               <br />
               is it not the right of every British subject to 
               <br />
               petition the Crown and parliament ? Have 
               <br />
               we not members supporting the Conservative 
               <br />
               party who are to-day supporting this Bill 
               <br />
               and others who are opposing it? Have we 
               <br />
               not among the members of the Reform party 
               <br />
               some who are petitioning for this Bill and 
               <br />
               others against it? If that argument is 
               <br />
               worth anything, it applies with equal force 
               <br />
               to the opposite side as well as to this side. 
               <br />
               But. with respect to the petitions that 
               <br />
               have been circulated, the hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice made the statement that they were 
               <br />
               deliberately and intentionally put in cir- 
               <br />
               culation to arouse religious strife and pas- 
               <br />
               sion. What justiﬁcation has he for mak- 
               <br />
               ing that statement? Who is responsible 
               <br />
               for raising the religious strife and passion 
               <br />
               that have been imparted into this debate 
               <br />
               during the present session? Was it the 
               <br />
               Conservative party ?—not by any means. 
               <br />
               Who introduced the Bill? 'Was it not the 
               <br />
               Reform party? Who made an impassion- 
               <br />
               ed appeal along religious lines? Was it 
               <br />
               not the right hon. Prime Minister on the 
               <br />

               House? It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inwited</span> reprisals from the 
               <br />
               other side of the House. I can tell the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice when he says that 
               <br />
               there will be no peace until it is fought out. 
               <br />
               and he added I throw down the gauntlet and 
               <br />
               I invite this ﬁght to come on. He has thrown 
               <br />
               down the gauntlet and I assure him that he 
               <br />
               will not be disappointed about the ﬁght. 
               <br />
               When it is over‘ he can congratulate himself 
               <br />
               upon what he has done for the purpose of 
               <br />
               promoting peace, harmony and good feeling 
               <br />
               amongst the citizens of this country. If 
               <br />
               he succeeds in doing it I will be very 
               <br />
               much mistaken. He has thrown down the 
               <br />
               gauntlet to a class of people who will 
               <br />
               stand up for their rights whether it pleases 
               <br />
               or displeases the Minister of Justice. There 
               <br />
               is no doubt that from the commencement 
               <br />
               of this discussion, from the ﬁrst word to 
               <br />
               the last which has been said on this sub- 
               <br />
               ject, there has not been displayed so much 
               <br />
               rancour as that which has been exhibited 
               <br />
               by the hon. Minister of Justice, and there 
               <br />
               has not been heard as strong language as 
               <br />
               that which has come from the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice who ought to be the last man in 
               <br />
               this House to set such an example to the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada. If this measure re- 
               <br />
               sults in arousing passions and creating 
               <br />
               hard feelings let me assure hon. gentlemen
