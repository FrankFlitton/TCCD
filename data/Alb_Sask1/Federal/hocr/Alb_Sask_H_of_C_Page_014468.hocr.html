               <br />
               importance in view of the discussion which 
               <br />
               is now taking place in this House. What 
               <br />
               seems to be worrying us now is whether or 
               <br />
               not we have jurisdiction to deal with this 
               <br />
               question, whether or not we have jurisdic— 
               <br />
               tion to give a constitution to these new 
               <br />
               provinces. That is where some of our friends 
               <br />
               seem to ﬁnd a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂiculty.</span> They say that the 
               <br />
               difﬁculty is not that they are not willing 
               <br />
               to extend these powers, but they question 
               <br />
               whether under the constitution they have 
               <br />
               the authority to do so. They would make 
               <br />
               us believe that they would be willing and 
               <br />
               pleased to extend these powers, but they 
               <br />
               say they cannot get away from the princi- 
               <br />
               ples of the constitution. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That seems to be the position they take. 
               <br />
               Very shortly after confederation it became 
               <br />
               apparent to those governing Canada, that 
               <br />
               they would have to create new provinces in 
               <br />
               the Territories, and Sir John Macdonald was 
               <br />
               clear enough in his judgment and sound 
               <br />
               enough in his constitutional law to see that 
               <br />
               it would be necessary for him to get certain 
               <br />
               additional powers for this purpose. We 
               <br />
               need not speculate as to what Sir John Mac- 
               <br />
               donald wanted, because he set forth his 
               <br />
               wish in a letter to Lord Kimberley, then 
               <br />
               Secretary of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">State</span> for the Colonies, in which 
               <br />
               he wrote that he wanted an Act conﬁrming 
               <br />
               the Act of the Canadian parliament 3-3 Vic- 
               <br />
               toria, chapter 3, as if it had been passed as 
               <br />
               an imperial statute. He further wrote that 
               <br />
               he wanted authority:

               <br />
