               Indeed, it must be accepted, and accepted as 
               <br />
               a truism, that under popular government the

               The majority of the people of Manitoba 
               <br />
               desired a certain thing and the Remedial

               Bill proposed to compel them to do some- 
               <br />
               thing that they did not desire to do, and 
               <br />
               therefore the right hon. gentleman held 
               <br />
               that the inajorlty must rule. It would be 
               <br />
               a doubly improper thing, I think, to adopt 
               <br />
               a measure which would not only interfere 
               <br />
