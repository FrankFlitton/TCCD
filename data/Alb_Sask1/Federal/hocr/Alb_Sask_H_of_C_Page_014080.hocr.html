               one of these matters was mentioned by

               the views of the Prime Minister of Canada 
               <br />
               and his colleagues as to this matter which 
               <br />
               was precipitated into the political arena by

               I have no authority whatever to say anything

               with regard to the subjects Mr. Haultain has 
               <br />
               mentioned, but we shall be in the position of 
               <br />
               having not four but ten members from the 
               <br />
               Territories in the next parliament, and we will 
               <br />
               get their views ; and while we do not say that. 
               <br />
               their views will prevail—for the entry of the 
               <br />
               Territories into confederation is a matter of 
               <br />
               contract with the other provinces—and while 
               <br />
               the terms we will be able to give you will be 
               <br />
               those we can get the other provinces to agree 
               <br />
               to. yet I can say for myself that I will do my 
               <br />
               best to get the most liberal term possible, and 
               <br />
               I will leave you to judge me by my past; record.
