               I propose to say a few words with regard 
               <br />
               to Athabaska. In the ﬁrst place, the sug- 
               <br />
               gestion of some hon. members on this side 
               <br />
               that Athabaska should be added to another

               <br />
               by hon. gentlemen opposite. There has been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> suggestion on this side that these people 
               <br />
               in Athabaska shomd have no representation 
               <br />
               We have gone beyond the time when we 
               <br />
               think people should be deprived of lepre- 
               <br />
               scuatio'n it that can possibly be avoided. 
               <br />
               But what hon. members on this side do say 
               <br />
               Is that Athabaska should not have two con— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stituencies</span> given it for comparatively t'ew

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lie</span> deprived of their rights. By being added 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> another constituency the people of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska would have their representation. but 
               <br />
               they would only have what is due them 
               <br />
               and not the extraordinary representation 
               <br />
               proposed by this Bill.

               sibly expect. The hon. Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terior</span> (Mr. Oliver) s1‘1oke in a slighting way 
               <br />
               yesterday in regard to the largebusiuess and 
               <br />
               wealth of the people in Southern Alberta. 
               <br />
               He says that money does not have votes, 
               <br />
               that it is the people who have votes. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IVell.</span> 
               <br />
               that is what we want them to have. We 
               <br />
               want the people to get votes, one vote for 
               <br />
               one man and no more, but if the govern- 
               <br />
               ment give to the unoccupied part of Atha— 
               <br />
               baska two constituencies to elect members 
               <br />
               it seems to me that the minister will have 
               <br />
               to register a lot of white ﬁsh and spruce 
               <br />
               trees up there to get the proper number of 
               <br />
               voters for these constituencies. The hon. 
               <br />
               minister has made a strong plea for the 
               <br />
               representation of the northern part of this 
               <br />
               new province 011 account of its great future. 
               <br />
               We will grant that it is going to have a 
               <br />
               great future. I do not think it was neces- 
               <br />
               sary for the hon. minister to set forth this 
               <br />
               argument about the future of the country 
               <br />
               because I do not think any one will say 
               <br />
               it is not going to be a great country. We 
               <br />
               all hope and expect it will and we will all 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> much disappointed if we are mis- 
               <br />
               taken. But. I submit that the future of 
               <br />
