               on a similar question. Mr. Gladstone lost

               For years, I might say for centuries, 
               <br />
               there had been in England a system of na- 
               <br />
               tional schools. But there were many sects, 
               <br />
               many creeds in England, and it was felt 
               <br />
               that it would be a violation of the principle 
               <br />
               of religious liberty if the dissenters were 
               <br />
               forced to send their children to schools, 
               <br />
               the religious teaching of which was not in 
               <br />
               conformity with their views. So, by the 
               <br />
               side of national schools, grew up a system 
               <br />
               of voluntary schools—that is to say, sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools—where the dissenters of all 
               <br />
               sects and denominations sent their child- 
               <br />
               ren. The secular teaching did not differ 
               <br />
               much from that of the national schools; but 
               <br />
               the religious teaching given the children 
               <br />
               was in accordance with the tenets of. the 
               <br />
               parents’ faith. Catholics, Wesleyans, Quak- 
               <br />
               ers established all over the realm voluntary 
               <br />
               schools. So much so, that a time came 
               <br />
               when more children frequented the volun- 
               <br />
               tary schools than the national schools. The 
               <br />
               board schools were state aided; the volun- 
               <br />
               tary schools were self-sustaining. There 
               <br />
               were in England, as there are in this coun- 
               <br />
               try, partisans of the neutral school. There 
               <br />
               were also men who thought that the child- 
               <br />
               ren had a right to a religious teaching ac-

               which has hitherto been maintained between 
               <br />
               them, even in times of doubt and dimculty, will 
               <br />
               continue, and, if possible, increase, but if I 
               <br />
               were driven utterly to abandon the voluntary, 
               <br />
               or to place exclusive reliance upon it, I would 
               <br />
               not hesitate a moment in making my choice. 
               <br />
               In such an emergency, I would say at once, 
               <br />
               give me the real education, the affection of the 
               <br />
               heart, the moral inﬂuence operating upon char- 
               <br />
               acter, the human love, that are obtained through 
               <br />
               the medium of the voluntary principle carried 
               <br />
               by men whose main motive is one of Christain 
               <br />
               philantropy rather than throw me upon a. sys- 
               <br />
               tem which, whatever the intentions of its 
               <br />
               mover may he, must sooner or later degenerate 
               <br />
               inte hard irreligion.
