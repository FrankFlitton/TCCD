               framed in the province of Manitoba within 
               <br />
               a year afterwards by the very men who 
               <br />
               were dealing with this Bill of Rights and 
               <br />
               who had received a report from these dele- 
               <br />
               gates; and that Act provided for separate 
               <br />
               schools in the province of Manitoba. It 
               <br />
               would be strange it both these points could 
               <br />
               have got by chance into the Manitoba Act, 
               <br />
               an Act which was the result of elaborate 
               <br />
               negotiations with the delegates. The other 
               <br />
               thing is this: This Bill of Rights No. 3 
               <br />
               asks that the province shall be styled and 
               <br />
               known as the province of Assiniboia. Bill 
               <br />
               of Rights No. 4 suggested no name, merely 
               <br />
               that the province was styled the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba. Just in passing, let me refer 
               <br />
               also to a letter written from the Secretary

               considered that the Manitoba Act gave to

               Liberal friends were taking away the rights 
               <br />
               from the minority in that province. This
