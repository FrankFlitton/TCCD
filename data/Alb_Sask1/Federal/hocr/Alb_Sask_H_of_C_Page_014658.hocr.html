               the only good thing that could be said

               of him was that he was the nephew of

               applies to the hon. gentleman. There was a

               part of his speech which was exceedingly 
               <br />
               good. It was the part in which he read

               long extracts from the speeches of his 
               <br />

               <br />
               of my hon. friend from North Toronto

               <br />
               struck me at the time was that if he had 
               <br />
               changed it more than he did it would have 
               <br />
               been a better speech. I do not exactly know

               seat in this House than the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               during the time he has been here. He re- 
               <br />
               minded me of a gentleman, who, speaking 
               <br />
               to another, was advancing the theory that 
               <br />
               men are the opposite of their fathers, that 
               <br />
               they have the opposite traits, the opposite 
               <br />
               tendencies. peculiarities, &amp;c., and after 
               <br />
               having enunciated that principle he said: 
               <br />
               You never met my father. He was 
               <br />
               a very clever. a very brilliant and a 
               <br />
               very ﬁne man. And. the other replied : No. 
               <br />
               I never met your father, but on the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of opposites, I can imagine that your 
               <br />
               father was all you describe. I am quite 
               <br />
               willing to concede to the late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dalton.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mc‘</span> 
               <br />
               Carthy all reasonable credit and I imagine 
               <br />
               that probably if the principle, of opposites, 
               <br />
               just referred to holds good, I need say 
               <br />
               nothing further in favour of the late Dalton 
               <br />
               McCarthy—hon. gentlemen will be prepared 
               <br />
               to imagine everything that is good of him.
