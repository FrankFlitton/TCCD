               of that prejudice to which in his speech he

               referred ; there has been the argument and

               the positive assertion that the clause has 
               <br />
               been introduced after mature deliberation; 
               <br />
               there has been the ﬁrst reading of the Bill,

               its printing and circulation, and then there 
               <br />
               were rumours with regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissentionvs</span> 
               <br />
               which exist in the cabinet to-day. The
