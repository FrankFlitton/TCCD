               Mr. BELCOURT. Yes, I have read it, I 
               <br />
               still hold the opinion that section 16 consti- 
               <br />
               tutes a modiﬁcation of the law of 1875. 
               <br />
               As I have said, I do not intend to discuss 
               <br />
               the extent of that modiﬁcation ; but, as was

               doubt. Obliged to do one of the three things 
               <br />
               to which I have referred. the government. 
               <br />
               did not dare, any more than the leader or 
               <br />
               the opposition would have dared, to repeal 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875. It chose to continue that 
               <br />
               Act in a modiﬁed form, thus doing one of 
               <br />
               the three things I have mentioned. But, in 
               <br />
               speaking as he has spoken in this House, 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               has virtually taken the position that the 
               <br />
               law of 1875 should be repealed. He 
               <br />
               has told us that this matter should be 
               <br />
               left entirely to the new provinces and 
               <br />
               that we should not interfere, and that 
               <br />
               there is absolutely no danger to the rights 
               <br />
               of the minority being in any way taken 
               <br />
               away or impaired, but that we must trust 
               <br />
               to the spirit of justice and fair-play of those 
               <br />
               who live in these new provinces. For my- 
               <br />
               self, I have conﬁdence in the spirit of jus- 
               <br />
               tice and fair-play among the inhabitants of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. But how long 
               <br />
               would that feeling exist and the spirit of 
               <br />
               justice remain if the agitation that hon.

               <br />
