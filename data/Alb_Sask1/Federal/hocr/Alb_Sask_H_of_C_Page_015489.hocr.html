               religious education. But a question now 
               <br />
               arises, which I will not discuss at this 
               <br />
               moment, but I will do so later on, whether 
               <br />
               or not the old law of 1875 is still in force, 
               <br />
               or whether the new ordinance, which has 
               <br />
               done away with the control by the minority 
               <br />
               of the secular part of education, is in 
               <br />
               force. Now, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are,</span> asked, what is the 
               <br />
               ditf‘erence between clause 16, No. 1, and 
               <br />
               clause 16, No. 2 ? The difference is simply 
               <br />
               this, that in clause 16, No. 1, the law of 
               <br />
               1875 was enacted. giving to the minority— 
               <br />
               I suppose the Roman Catholic minority—— 
               <br />
               the control over secular education as well 
               <br />
               as the control over religious education, 
               <br />
               Whereas the new clause brings into force 
               <br />
               the existing law of the territories, the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ordinance</span> of 1901, by which the state has 
               <br />
               absolute control over the secular part of 
               <br />
               education, and the people have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">icontrol</span> 
               <br />
               simply of the religious part of education 
               <br />
               from half-past three in the afternoon. This 
               <br />
               is the absolute difference which exists be- 
               <br />
               tween the old clause and the new clause. 
               <br />
               I have for my part agreed to the new clause 
               <br />
               16, and in so doing I know that I have 
               <br />
               restricted my fellow-religionists in regard 
               <br />
               to some of the rights which they think 
               <br />
               they have at this moment. I shall explain 
               <br />
               in due time why I agreed to do so. But 
               <br />
               my duty at present is to state what the 
               <br />
               difference is, and there it is in a few words. 
               <br />
               If this law passes, as we think it ought, the 
               <br />
               legislature will have full control over the 
               <br />
               secular part of education, and the people 
               <br />
               will have full control over the religious part. 
               <br />
               The legislature does not attempt to con- 
               <br />
               trol the religious part of education; but 
               <br />
               if the old law had remained in force, the 
               <br />
               legislature would have surrendered its call- 
               <br />
               trol over the secular part as well as over 
               <br />
               the religious part of education. Now, I 
               <br />
               think I have made very clear what is the 
               <br />
               difference between section 16, No. 1, and 
               <br />
               section 16, No. 2. The motives which have 
               <br />
               inﬂuenced us in agreeing to that change 
               <br />
               I shall explain at the proper time. I do 
               <br />
               not propose to do so to-day, for this reason. 
               <br />
               I look at the House before me. and I see it 
               <br />
               absolutely disorganized. There are few 
               <br />
               members from the Northwest Territories, if 
               <br />
               there are any, present ; and as they are most 
               <br />
               interested in this question, I want to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss it in their presence. At the present 
               <br />
               moment I merely explain the difference be- 
               <br />
               tween the two sections.

               can only emphasize what I said :1 moment

               ' Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I am not contro-

               vertlng anything the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               has said, but am merely endeavouring to 
               <br />
               understand his argument. He says there 
               <br />
               are some words in the Act of 1875 which 
               <br />
               give the minority an absolute right to the 
               <br />
               control of the education in their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> 
               <br />
               schools, and I have read him the only words 
               <br />
               in the Act of 1875 from which that right 
               <br />
               could be deduced: ‘The minority of the 
               <br />
               ratepayers therein, whether Protestants or 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics, may establish separate 
               <br />
               schools therein.’ It is upon those words the 
               <br />
               right hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman,</span> must depend.
