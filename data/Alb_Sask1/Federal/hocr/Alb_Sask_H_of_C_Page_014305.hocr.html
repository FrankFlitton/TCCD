               Mr. Bulyea has expressed his satisfaction

               <br />
               the mind of the Finance Minister to—day. 
               <br />
               That hon. gentleman thinks that when the

               Prime Minister ? But another member of 
               <br />
               the government had a still more ingenious 
               <br />
               excuse. He said that Mr. I-Iaultain was a 
               <br />
               very estimable gentleman but only a Tory 
               <br />
               gentleman and it was his duty and purpose 
               <br />
               to oppose this government. Delightful con- 
               <br />
               stitutional doctrine. that is, especially com—

               the First Minister of the Territories is still
