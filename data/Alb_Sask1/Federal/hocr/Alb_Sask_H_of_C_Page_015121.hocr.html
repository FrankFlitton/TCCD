               <br />
               fully as to one of the most important <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> 
               <br />
               Perhaps the most important—that could be 
               <br />
               conﬁded to the legislature—the question of 
               <br />
               education. This was a question in which in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada they must all feel the greatest 
               <br />
               interest, and in respect to which more appre- 
               <br />
               hension might be supposed to exist in the minds 
               <br />
               at any rate of the Protestant population than 
               <br />
               in regard to anything else connected with the 
               <br />
               whole scheme of federation. It must be clear 
               <br />
               that a measure would not be favourably en- 
               <br />
               tertained by the minority of Lower Canada 
               <br />
               which would place the education of their child- 
               <br />
               ren <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amid</span> the provision <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> their schools wholly 
               <br />
               in the hands of a majority of a different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faith.</span> 
               <br />
               It was clear that in conﬁding the general-sub- 
               <br />
               ject of education to the local legislature it 
               <br />
               was absolutely necessary it should be accom- 
               <br />
               panied with such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">restrictions</span> as would prevent 
               <br />
               injustice in any respect from being done to the 
               <br />
               minority. (Hear, hear.) Now, this applied to 
               <br />
               Lower Canada, but it also applied and with 
               <br />
               equal force to Upper Canada and the other pro- 
               <br />
               inces; for in Lower Canada there was a Pro- 
               <br />
               testant minority and in the other provinces a 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic minority. The same privileges 
               <br />
               belonged to the one of right here as belonged 
               <br />
               to the other of right elsewhere. There could 
               <br />
               be no greater injustice to a population than 
               <br />
               to compel them to have their children edu- 
               <br />
               cated in a manner contrary to their religious

               <br />

               Minister has since then experienced a com-

               not a fact that the first man to fall out 
               <br />
               of line was the ex-Minister of Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton). So serious was the matter that he 
               <br />
               resigned his portfolio. Then, what about 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding)? 
               <br />
               Was he not following immediately in the 
               <br />
               footsteps of the ex-Minister of the Interior ? 
               <br />
               Is it not a fact that for several days he 
               <br />
               was, as it were, walking the plank, or in- 
               <br />
               tending to follow the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tax-Minister</span> of the In-

               not appear from the remarks he is making

               in different parts of the country at the

               <br />
               not agree with the Prime Minister ? If the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister had given the members on 
               <br />
               his side of the House the same latitude 
               <br />
               that the hon. leader of the opposition gave 
               <br />
               to members on this side, and allowed every

               man to vote and act as his conscience

               dictated, this Bill would not go through 
               <br />
               the House in the form that I suppose 
               <br />
               it is now going. The hon. member for

               ‘ Gazette,’ and said that we should get them 
               <br />
               into line. He referred to Conservative

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> At the same time, I thought he 
               <br />

               ferred to the Toronto ‘ Globe,’ and explain-

               ed to us why it was not in unity with the 
               <br />
               Liberal party. I mention these facts to 
               <br />
               show that the Liberal party are not at all 
               <br />
               in unity on this Bill. The hon. gentleman

               also stated that the Conservative party were 
               <br />
               without a leader or a policy. I have been 
               <br />
               in this House since the year 1891, and have 
               <br />
               sat here with several leaders of the diﬂfer- 
               <br />
               ent parties since that time, and I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.do</span> not 
               <br />
               believe that we have ever had a leader of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party with greater ability 
               <br />
               or more respected throughout this country 
               <br />
               than the present leader of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party. I believe that the Conservative 
               <br />
               party under the leadership of the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Carleton would have been in 
               <br />
