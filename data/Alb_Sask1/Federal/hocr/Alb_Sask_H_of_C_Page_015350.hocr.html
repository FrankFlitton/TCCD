               the Minister of Finance is resting his case 
               <br />
               upon this magniﬁcent victory in the west, he 
               <br />
               is putting his faith in a false policy. I

               <br />
               stituencies now vacant; let him take a 
               <br />
               glance at ILondon and North Oxford. I will

               'be pleased to hear that the Minister of

               Finance has visited either of these consti—

               <br />
               had the hardihood to make in this House. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Finance in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1896,</span> made a 
               <br />
               speech on this question that has been read 
               <br />
               to him in this House; a speech in com- 
               <br />
               plete contradiction of the position he has 
               <br />
               assumed to-day.

               He has swallowed that down. He has 
               <br />
               said: the King’s government must go on, 
               <br />
               and we must have a solid phalanx at our

               <br />
               I think he will ﬁnd that he has gone back 
               <br />
               on his principles a little rtoo much this time, 
               <br />
               and that he will get a very cool reception 
               <br />
               in western Ontario to—day. I have the honour 
               <br />
               of belonging to a district in which there are 
               <br />
               two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try-elections</span> in sight, and I trust the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance will come there and 
               <br />
               deliver the speech which he. delivered in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1:590</span> 
               <br />
               and the speech which he delivered just now, 
               <br />
               and let the people compare them and judge 
               <br />
               how he has stood by the rights of the ma- 
               <br />
               jority of the people of this country. We 
               <br />
               hear a great deal about the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. Have the majority no rights? 
               <br />
               Have those rights been maintained or have 
               <br />
               they been bartered ‘2 I maintain that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance and the others who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hai</span> e

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'liberately</span> gone back on the rights of the 
               <br />
               majority in this country. It is due to them 
               <br />
               and to this House that the Minister of Jus- 
               <br />
               tice should give us a fair interpretation of 
               <br />
               the language contained in these two clauses. 
               <br />
               We are entitled to it. He said to the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Lincoln and Niagara (Mr. Lan- 
               <br />

               tion of hon. gentlemen on the other side of 
               <br />
               the House. They have given their votes on 
               <br />
               a question on which I venture to say not 
               <br />
               one in ten. though it has been debated for 
               <br />
               six weeks, will dare to raise up and explain 
               <br />
               the difference between the amended clause 
               <br />
               and the original clause. If any of them will 
               <br />
               do that. I shall be glad to give way to them ; 
               <br />
               for it is light that I want on this question. 
               <br />
               If they cannot do that. what did they vote 
               <br />
               on or why did they vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘1</span> They voted to

               us enjoy the great prosperity of the country, 
               <br />
               says the Minister of Finance; We cannot

               yet, while the Minister of Finance was 
               <br />
               making that statement, he had in his ears 
               <br />
               the wails of the cement men, the binder 
               <br />
               twine men and the woollen men, all of whom 
               <br />
               had been down here within two or three 
               <br />
               weeks telling him that these industries were 
               <br />
               in danger. Instead of giving his mind to the 
               <br />
               interpretation of these clauses, he says we 
               <br />
               should allow the King's government to go on, 
               <br />
               even it' it were costing us a few more dollars 
               <br />
               and we sacriﬁced principles that We hold 
               <br />
               most dear. I contend that is unworthy. I 
               <br />
               submit that it is the duty of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, as the chief exponent of law in this 
               <br />
               country to enlighten this House on these 
               <br />
               two clauses, and to do it forthwith. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can</span> 
               <br />
               not do it too soon. He has counted the votes 
               <br />
               of members of this House on resolutions 
               <br />
               which they do not comprehend, and which 
               <br />
               he fails to explain. I say, and I believe it 
               <br />
               to be true, that when this government ap- 
               <br />
               peals to western Ontario, they will get an 
               <br />
               eye—opener; I believe they will ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               though we are not great in numbers on this 
               <br />
               side of the House, we have a good many of 
               <br />
               the people of this country at our back. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance lays great unction to his 
               <br />
               soul that the united following of the govern— 
               <br />
               ment is at his back. That is just where the 
               <br />
               weakness of his case lies. I have a better 
               <br />
               opinion of this side of the House than of the 
               <br />
               other; but I do not believe that all the con- 
               <br />
               science belongs to this side. If the members 
               <br />
               on the other side had voted with the same 
               <br />
               conscientious desire to do their duty as the 
               <br />
               members on this side of the House have 
               <br />
               done, not thirteen, but three times thirteen 
               <br />
               of them, would have voted against the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment on this question. Though they join 
               <br />
               hand in hand—you know the rest, Mr. Chair- 
               <br />
               man; aud I tell you that hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite will not go unpunished. Their unity 
               <br />
               on this question will not save them. It has 
               <br />
               simply aggravated the situation. It informs 
               <br />
               the people of this country that there are a 
               <br />
               large number of men in the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons who are prepared to swallow their 
               <br />
               convictions for the sake of party. The Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Finance need not point his ﬁne ﬁnger 
               <br />

               <br />
               with the government on this occasion. 
               <br />
               Where were the consciences of a large ma- 
               <br />
               jority of the men on the other side ? Did 
               <br />
               their consciences not appeal to them and tell 
               <br />
               them that they were sacriﬁcing what they 
               <br />
