               developed in his speech was unnecessary to

               remind us of the weakness of his argument

               tence of his speech. His hon. friend the

               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden), 
               <br />
               he said, had not given him notice that he 
               <br />
               was going to bring this new and unheard-of 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unexpected</span> question before the House. 
               <br />
               And this great, strong man of battle for 
               <br />
               thirty years endeavoured to make a little 
               <br />
               cheap capital against my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition by imputing to him 
               <br />
               a want of courtesy. But, as he thinks it

               over the right hon. gentleman will remember 
               <br />
               that yesterday my hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition gave notice that he would 
               <br />
               again discuss this matter. And the reason 
               <br />
               he did not so fully discuss it yesterday was 
               <br />
               that there had been no word uttered by 
               <br />
               Monseigneur Sbarretti, and, for very good 
               <br />
               reasons and very prudent reasons, I think,

               there was very much in that matter of lack

               ask now what my right hon. friend took 
               <br />
               such pains to deny yesterday. He took 
               <br />
               great pains to deny absolutely and categori- 
               <br />

               <br />
               gether of secondary importance. For in- 
               <br />
               stance he made a point against the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers because he said that they had 
               <br />
               not been invited on the initiative of the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government to have a conference 
               <br />
               in Ottawa with reference to the extension 
               <br />
               or the boundaries. Neither (lid Mr. Rogers’ 
               <br />
               statement declare that the invitation was on 
               <br />
               the initiative of the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               It might have been implied from that letter 
               <br />
               that it was or it might not, but in all con- 
               <br />
               science what difference did it make whether 
               <br />
               the invitation went from my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend in reply to a request or whether it 
               <br />
               was on his own initiative. As far as the 
               <br />
               facts of the case go what difference did it 
               <br />
               make ? Butthere was a very authoritative, 
               <br />
               a very absolute and a very much cheered 
               <br />
               denial on the part of my right. hon. friend of 
               <br />
               that ﬁrst statement made by Mr. Rogers. 
               <br />
               He thought he had triumphantly ﬂoored his 
               <br />
               opponent when he contended that the 
               <br />
               interview had not taken place on his initia- 
               <br />
               tive. He made another strong point in con— 
               <br />
               nection with the interivew in that the Mani- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ary of this year made no step by way of 
               <br />
               initiative towards getting an extension of 
               <br />
               their boundaries. The Manitoba government

               i suppose is a fairly sensible government. 
               <br />
               They knew that their legislature had backed
