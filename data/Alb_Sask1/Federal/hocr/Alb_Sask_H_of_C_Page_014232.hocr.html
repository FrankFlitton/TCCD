               Interior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Sifton) from Ottawa. It will

               not be denied that the government suddenly 
               <br />
               decided to give provincial autonomy to the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories just at the commence-

               <br />
               should have been laid before the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories so that in pro-

               nouncing a verdict in the last election an 
               <br />
               opportunity would have been given them 
               <br />
               to pronounce upon that important matter.
