               it is to have a positive opinion upon such

               or the proposition of law which my hon.

               friend suggests and I have heard men who 
               <br />
               are pretty good lawyers ﬂout the opposite 
               <br />
               idea. In a question of that kind we who

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. 1 do not want my 
               <br />
               hon. friend to misunderstand me. He has 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst place only quoted part of my 
               <br />
               argument. He speaks of the provinces 
               <br />
               coming in. A large part of my argument 
               <br />
               was devoted not to the question of a pro- 
               <br />
               vince coming in but to that of a province 
               <br />
               being created which my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               not dealt with at all. But, apart from that 
               <br />
               and in answer to what he has just said 
               <br />
               my View is a very simple one. I say that 
               <br />
               we have the right and only the right to ap- 
               <br />
               ply the constitution as it exists at present 
               <br />
               in respect of the distribution of legislative 
               <br />
               power. My hon. friend seems to think that 
               <br />
               we can go on and do something more. If 
               <br />
               my view is correct we cannot go on and do 
               <br />
               anything more. and if we enact from now 
               <br />
               until this time next year it will not alter 
               <br />
               the result. because in the end our right to 
               <br />
               legislate must be determined in the courts. 
               <br />
               That is a very simple proposition. 
               <br />
