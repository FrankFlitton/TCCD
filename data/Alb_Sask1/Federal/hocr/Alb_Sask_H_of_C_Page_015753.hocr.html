               that I am an Orangeman, I may say that 
               <br />
               I am not, but I may add that I am equally 
               <br />
               charged. on just as good ground, with being 
               <br />
               a 'Roman Catholic. The other day I receiv- 
               <br />
               ed a letter written from my own constitu- 
               <br />
               ency by one of my own constituents, in 
               <br />
               which he said he did not know what my 
               <br />
               creed was. but that after reading my speech 
               <br />
               he supposed I was a Roman Catholic. Let 
               <br />
               me say that I am neither a Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               nor an Orangeman. I have no use myself 
               <br />
               for people who use extreme or abusive lan~ 
               <br />
               guage regarding Rom-an Catholics or Orange- 
               <br />
               men or any other class. and that is the reas— 
               <br />
               on I am at issue with the h0n. mentber for 
               <br />
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule). I do not like to- 
               <br />
               hear extreme or abusive language applied to 
               <br />
               any section of our Canadian people. I have 
               <br />
               nothing whatever against the Orangemen, 
               <br />
               but I do say again. after listening to the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight,</span> that 
               <br />
               I do not see in’ the article he read any re- 
               <br />
               ference whatever to the Orange society. The 
               <br />
               article refers to the people commanded by 
               <br />
               Dr. Sprouie. When you speak of the Orange- 
               <br />
               men of this country, however, you are speak- 
               <br />
               ing of a very large body of men, most of 
               <br />
               whom are very respectable and loyal citizens 
               <br />
               of this country. But when you refer to 
               <br />
               those commanded by Dr. Sproule, you are 
               <br />
               referring to a very small number.
