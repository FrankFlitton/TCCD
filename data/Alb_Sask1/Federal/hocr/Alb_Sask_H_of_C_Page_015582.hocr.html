               wish to make the statement again that a

               to that conference were invited, I under-

               province was debated at considerable length.

               I make the statement now deliberately that 
               <br />
               I discussed with the member for Calgary

               vince to make these divisions, and he gave 
               <br />
               me to understand he was not willing to go 
               <br />
               into the work with the other members for 
               <br />
               Alberta. He put it in this way: It will be 
               <br />
               two against two, myself and the member 
               <br />
               for Alberta (Mr. Herron) as against the

               two against two, there will be certainly a

               deadlock as the interests of Edmonton and 
               <br />
               Calgary are so diverse and distinct that we
