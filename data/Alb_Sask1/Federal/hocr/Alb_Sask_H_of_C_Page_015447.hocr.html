               on parliament and on the government the 
               <br />
               necessity of their doing something for the 
               <br />
               relief of the settlers of the Northwest in the 
               <br />
               matter of this exemption clause. The relief 
               <br />
               in regard to the lands is coming gradually

               by the sale of the lands after twenty years. 
               <br />
               But this other frightful exemption, which 
               <br />
               declares that the company shall be for ever

               free from taxation by the Dominion or any 
               <br />

               <br />
               ever put on the statute-book of Canada. 
               <br />
               There is no such exemption in any other con-

               clause 16 in the contract, which provides

               that the stations and station grounds, &amp;c.. of 
               <br />

               be exempt from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation.</span> by this parliament. 
               <br />
               To that extent that clause is a contract be-

               tween this parliament and the Canadian Pa—

               <br />
               than that. That clause is in effect a contract

               respect to the right of taxation. That is 
               <br />
               what this parliament agreed to; that is

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. And parliament con- 
               <br />
               ﬁrmed that opinion, and all we are doing 
               <br />
               now is to give eiTect to what parliament had 
               <br />
               in contemplation at that time. We are 
               <br />
               doing nothing more than that, and, so far as 
               <br />
               this load on the Northwest Territories which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend refers to is concerned, if par~ 
               <br />
               liament wants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> rid the Territories of that 
               <br />
               incubus, if I may use ‘the word, parliament 
               <br />
               is free to do it. Parliament has the means 
               <br />
               in its own hands, if the people of this coun- 
               <br />
               try want to assume additional burdens to 
               <br />
               those which they already assumed in connec- 
               <br />
               tion with that railway. But let us do one 
               <br />
               thing at a time. Let us give effect to what 
               <br />
               we contracted to do in 1881. When we have 
               <br />
               done that, the door is still wide open to us 
               <br />
               if we want to go further.

               laid before the present government some

               years ago. when the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               were asking for provincial autonomy, and I

               propose to put upon ' Hansard ’ the argument

               with reference to this particular subject
