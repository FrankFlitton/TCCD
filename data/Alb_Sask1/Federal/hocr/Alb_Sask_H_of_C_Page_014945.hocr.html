               want to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:ask</span> the hon. gentleman where is

               the badge of inferiority because they have

               separate schools ? I wish the hon. member

               for North Toronto were here, because I 
               <br />
               wanted to ask him what he had in his mind 
               <br />
               when he made that statement. The only

               two provinces in which we have separate 
               <br />
               schools are Ontario and Quebec, and surely 
               <br />
               he would not be so ungrateful as to tax 
               <br />
               Ontario with inferiority, because he owes 
               <br />
               too much to Ontario, the province which has 
               <br />
               launched again on the political sea his

               political canoe after it had been wrecked at 
               <br />
               several places. What must he have had in 
               <br />
               his mind ? He is a gentleman who chal- 
               <br />
               lenges the world with the statement that he 
               <br />
               has never in public, outside of this House 
               <br />

               <br />
               Catholics or the French, but he is one of 
               <br />
               those able actors who, when you look at 
               <br />
               them as they speak, convey one impression

               of a man with that ability ? I think he had 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the province of Quebec, and I can tell 
               <br />
               them that in this year of grace 1905 they 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd in this same hierarchy and amongst 
               <br />
               these same priests, that very devotion which 
               <br />
               existed 200 years ago, and which to-day 
               <br />

               <br />
               teach us how to promenade throughout the 
               <br />
