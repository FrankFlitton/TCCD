               gentleman how it was that after having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">des</span> 
               <br />
               layed some two years before taking up the 
               <br />
               question at all, the minister who, under 
               <br />
               the constitutional rule laid down by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment itself, was most to be consulted 
               <br />
               with regard to the terms of the measure, 
               <br />
               was not consulted at all, although the mea- 
               <br />
               sure was introduced within three days of 
               <br />
               his return to Ottawa. My right hon. friend 
               <br />
               has been a very strict stickler for constitu- 
               <br />
               tional usage in some of his dealings with 
               <br />
               his ministers in days gone by. I will ad- 
               <br />
               vert to only one case. We remember that 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman felt himself con- 
               <br />
               strained to ask for the portfolio of Public 
               <br />
               \Vorks at that time held by the Hon. J. I. 
               <br />
               Tarte, because Mr. Tarte had seen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Kit,</span> in 
               <br />
               the words of the Prime Minister, to advo- 
               <br />
               cate a policy which had not yet been adopt- 
               <br />
               ed by the government. Well, if that be a 
               <br />
               just reason, have not the colleagues of the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman a right to demand his 
               <br />
               portfolio at the present time, because he 
               <br />
               has seen tit not only to advocate, but to 
               <br />
               place before parliament and the country, 
               <br />
               a measure to which his colleagues have not 
               <br />
               all agreed. I do not know on what ground 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman can justify him- 
               <br />
               self in this regard, because it seems to me 
               <br />
               that it is not treating the House of Com- 
               <br />
               mons with due respect to bring down a 
               <br />

               consulted.

               <br />
               in the organs supposed to have the conﬁ- 
               <br />

               matters are being discussed within the cab-

               <br />
               opposite, but that certain conclusions have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">already</span> been arrived at and will be announc— 
               <br />

               friend only the other day that as soon as 
               <br />
               those changes—if any are contemplated—he 
               <br />
               agreed upon, they should be announced to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> House in order that we may have them 
               <br />
               under consideration before the time arrives 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> discussing them in parliament. I ven~ 
               <br />
               lure to bring this matter before the govern— 
               <br />
               ment to-day. The right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               told us some ten years ago, when matters of 
               <br />
               this kind were discussed in parliament 
               <br />
               and the country, that he was not in the bat- 
               <br />
               tle ‘No,’ he said: ‘The battle is there; 
               <br />
               there is the. seat of contest; there is the 
               <br />
               raging conﬁict.’ I do not want to make 
               <br />
               any special application of those words to- 
               <br />
               day; but I do think that as soon as the 
               <br />
               differences are amicably adjusted, we should 
               <br />
               have a statement from the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               as to the form this measure will eventually 
               <br />
               take when it comes before parliament.
