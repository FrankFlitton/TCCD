               ﬁrst 11 constituencies south of Red Deer 
               <br />
               recorded a vote in the last election, accord-

               <br />
               troverted, of 10,566. I think the ﬁgures quo:e:l 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend from Argenteuil (Mr. Per- 
               <br />
               ley) are a little different, but the difference 
               <br />
               is so minute as not to count. On the other 
               <br />
               hand, the 11 constituencies north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer only cast 9.555 votes. That is one 
               <br />
               source of information, and if we were to be 
               <br />
               guided alone by that the argument of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend would be unanswerable, he 
               <br />
               would have the best of it, and we would 
               <br />
               have to bow. But, as another source of in- 
               <br />
               formation we take the census. The 11 con- 
               <br />
               stituencies to the south which recorded a 
               <br />
               larger vote than the north in the last elec- 
               <br />
               tion have a population of 31,000, whereas 
               <br />
               the 11 constituencies in the north have a 
               <br />
               population of 36,000. Therefore, if there 
               <br />
               is on one side a preponderance in favour of 
               <br />
               the south in the vote recorded, there is a 
               <br />
               preponderance in favour of the north in 
               <br />
               the number of the population in 1901.

               <br />
               these constituencies in regard to proportion 
               <br />
               of numbers. I do not think it is possible 
               <br />
               to apply the principle which it is sought to 
               <br />
               apply in the Transvaal of having the same

               number in every constituency, allowing a 
               <br />
               margin of only ten per cent. In order to

               attention of my hon. friends opposite to con-

               ditions which have existed at all times in 
               <br />
               this country. I have here the Parliamentary 
               <br />
               Companion for 1874 containing a record of 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst parliament elected after British 
               <br />
               Columbia came into the confederation. 
               <br />
               There were ﬁve or six members represent- 
               <br />
               ing four or ﬁve constituencies. The record 
               <br />
               shows a great variety of conditions prevail- 
               <br />
               ing in British Columbia at that time. For 
               <br />
               instance. the city of Victoria. with a popu- 
               <br />
               lation of 4.540 and 2,925 voters, was given 
               <br />
               two members. There was the constituency 
               <br />
               of Yale with a population of 1,316 and 148 
               <br />
               votes. That is all it had. The constituency 
               <br />
               of Cariboo had a population of 1.955 and‘ 
               <br />
               359 voters. New Westminster had a popula- 
               <br />
               tion of 1,356 and it had 460 voters. Well, 
               <br />
               some one may tell me that Yale which had 
               <br />
               only 148 voters should have been united with 
               <br />
               some other constituency, just as it is sug- 
               <br />
               gested that Athabaska and Peace River 
               <br />
               should have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> united with some other 
               <br />
               constituencies. But, it would not have been 
               <br />
               fair to have united it to another constitu- 
               <br />
               ency and we say that you must give repre- 
               <br />
               sentation to these constituencies in the north 
               <br />
               and that the only way you can do it is in 
               <br />
               the way we have suggested.

               Mr. PERLEY. I would like to call the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman’s attention to the fact 
               <br />
               that in discussing the 11 constituencies 
               <br />
               above Red Deer. I do not think he is taking 
               <br />
               a fair view of the case. There are 13 con- 
               <br />
               stituencies above Red Deer and the 13 con- 
               <br />
               stituencies ought to be taken and not the 
               <br />
               11 which are above Red Deer. To my mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               the whole crux of this matter is these two 
               <br />
               constituencies of Peace River and Atha- 
               <br />
               baska. The right hon. gentleman compares 
               <br />
               the north 11 with the south 11 and absolute- 
               <br />
               ly ignores these two sections which have so 
               <br />
               few voters. He has left out Nos. 24 and 
               <br />
               25 which really make 13 constituencies 
               <br />
               above Red Deer with practically no more 
               <br />
               voters, or only 300 more, than there are. 
               <br />
               from his statement, in the 11 constituencies.

               sion. For these 11 constituencies north and 
               <br />
               South of Red Deer we had recourse to the

               recorded votes, the registered votes and the

               <br />
               we could not have the recorded votes or the 
               <br />
               registered votes because there were none. 
               <br />
               It is impossible to treat Athabaska and
