               The hon. member does not need to take

               my ﬁgures as the latter two items are re—

               turns to an order of this House. Therefore 
               <br />
               I say that there is not the slightest doubt as 
               <br />
               to where the centre of population is as I can 
               <br />
               prove from the map of the Department of 
               <br />
               the Interior showing the rural population. 
               <br />
               I have given the ﬁgures of the population of 
               <br />
               the two cities and there is not the slightest 
               <br />
               doubt as to where the centre of railway con— 
               <br />

               <br />
               accessible place. We must again trouble 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior to show why the 
               <br />
               capital, the seat of government has been 
               <br />
               taken away from the centre of population 
               <br />
               and trade and the most accessible point. If 
               <br />
               you look up the constituencies of the local 
               <br />
               House you will ﬁnd that eight of the mem- 
               <br />
               bers would have to pass through Calgary to 
               <br />
               get to Edmonton, one other lives much closer
