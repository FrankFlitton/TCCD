               His Excellency further added that our failure

               Well, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sir.</span> I cannot conceive how the Papal

               that the failure of the province of Manitoba

               if such had been done it would have facilitated

               possible that such a. statement could have 
               <br />
