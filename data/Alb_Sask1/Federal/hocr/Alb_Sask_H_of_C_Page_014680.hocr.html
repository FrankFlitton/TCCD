               was administered under an enactment of 
               <br />
               18-38 called the Parish School Act, which 
               <br />
               was superseded in 1871 by an Act called 
               <br />
               the Common Schools Act. It was against 
               <br />
               this new law that the Catholics appealed 
               <br />
               to the Supreme Court. Let <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.me</span> say also 
               <br />
               that it had been the expectation of the 
               <br />
               fathers of confederation and of the British 
               <br />
               parliament that the ﬁrst clause upon edu~ 
               <br />
               cation applied to all the schools, or classes 
               <br />
               of schools in New Brunswick, so strong, so 
               <br />
               general, was the prevailing opinon that the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority enjoyed denominational 
               <br />
               schools in every respect, an opinion created 
               <br />
               by the prevalent harmonious relations of 
               <br />
               the people of different races and creeds in 
               <br />
               the maritime provinces. But upon investiga- 
               <br />
               tion by the courts it was found that the 
               <br />
               liberties enjoyed by the Catholics of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick were not granted by the said 
               <br />
               Parish School Act of 1858, but had come 
               <br />
               into existence owing to what may legally 
               <br />
               be termed irregularities, or laxities in the 
               <br />
               administration of the law. The decisions 
               <br />
               of the Privy Council and of the Supreme 
               <br />
               Court of New Brunswick maintained that 
               <br />
               the Parish School Act, 1858, did not refer to 
               <br />
               denominational schools, and therefore this 
               <br />
               Act being superseded by the Public Schools 
               <br />
               Act of 1871, no denominational rights could 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂected</span> so long as there were none in 
               <br />
               existence by law. These judgments were 
               <br />
               based on the assumption that denomination— 
               <br />
               al privileges or rights in existence 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the union were inalienable. These 
               <br />
               tribunals searched in the Parish School Act 
               <br />
               of 1858 for the existence of such rights as 
               <br />
               claimed by the Catholics which might have 
               <br />
               been affected by the new Act of 1871, but 
               <br />
               failed to ﬁnd them.

               I wish to lay stress on this point that

               evidently the judges of the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick before writing their de-

               <br />
               tion that the 1st section of clause 93 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act did apply 
               <br />

               such rights be found to exist, the court 
               <br />
               was bound by the terms of the section to

               of the Roman Catholic inhabitants of this

               <br />
               prejudicially affected by the Common Schools
