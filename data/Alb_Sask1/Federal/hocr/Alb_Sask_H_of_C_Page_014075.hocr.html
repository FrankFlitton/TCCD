               Mr. EMMERSON. The commission is

               constituted under the Act of this parliament 
               <br />

               nothing to report. For instance, the pre—

               sumption is that in the ﬁrst instance it will

               have a road surveyed over the whole route. 
               <br />
               It will be taken for granted that that will

               take a certain time, and it will be taken for

               something to report. until it has the work 
               <br />

               the Governor in Council a statement of the

               The information cannot be in existence. It 
               <br />
               is true that the general statement may be 
               <br />
               published in the press that the surveyors 
               <br />
               are meeting with success in ﬁnding a route, 
               <br />

               become somewhat involved as to the ques-

               tween the commission and this House. 
               <br />
               There is no question as to the medium of 
               <br />
               communication. There was a question how- 
               <br />
               ever as to the medium of communication 
               <br />
               between the Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commission,</span> another 
               <br />
               and an entirely different commission, and 
               <br />
               this House. The question was as to Whether 
               <br />
               the Department of Railways and Canals 
               <br />
               had any connection with that commission 
               <br />
               or any control over it. On this the terms 
               <br />
               of the Act seem to be silent. There is 
               <br />
               an implication in certain of the sections as
