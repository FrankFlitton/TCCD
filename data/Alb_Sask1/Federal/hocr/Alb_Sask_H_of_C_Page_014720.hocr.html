               resolution came before the legislative as— 
               <br />
               sembly at Regina, one of the members

               It has already been pointed out, Mr.

               Speaker, that to establish but one province 
               <br />
               out of the western Territories would be to 
               <br />
               establish a province which, in its area and 
               <br />
               in its capacity to sustain population, would 
               <br />
               so far exceed that possessed by any other 
               <br />

               <br />
               shown that to establish a province in each

               of the districts now comprising the North-

               people, particularly in the district of Sas-

               tice of this House as likely to result from a 
               <br />
               division of the ranching country would have 
               <br />
               been avoided. Of course, Mr. Speaker. there 
               <br />
               are two main objections to the establishment 
               <br />
               of a northern and a southern province. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, that division would not give 
               <br />
               nearly as equitable a division of the natural 
               <br />
               resources of the Territories between the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces as the present one, and the other 
               <br />
               objection is that it would not have made 
               <br />
               provision for the administration of Atha- 
               <br />
               baska, the western portion of which will 
               <br />
               very shortly be settled. As to the question 
               <br />
               of the boundary line, if we are to have an 
               <br />
               eastern and a western province, I do not 
               <br />
               think any fault can be found with the 
               <br />
               placing of the boundary line at the fourth 
               <br />
               meridian. That division leaves the area 
               <br />
               of the two provinces almost the same and 
               <br />
               besides it leaves the agricultural lands al- 
               <br />
               most equal in each. It has been estimated 
               <br />
               by the surveyor general that according to 
               <br />
               the present division, the agricultural lands 
               <br />
               in the new province of Saskatchewan will 
               <br />
               amount to 86,000 square miles, while in the 
               <br />
               new province of Alberta they will amount 
               <br />
               to 80,000 square miles, so that there will 
               <br />
               be in each province practically the same 
               <br />
               quantity of agricultural land.

               <br />
               of the House on several occasions, and has 
               <br />
               been exhaustively dealt with by the hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen who preceded me. I refer 
               <br />
               to the extension of the boundaries of Mani— 
               <br />
               toba. With regard to the extension west-

               test the like of which the country has
