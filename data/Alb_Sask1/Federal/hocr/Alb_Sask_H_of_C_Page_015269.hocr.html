               which took place between members from 
               <br />
               Manitoba and members from Ontario had 
               <br />
               not been brought to the attention of the 
               <br />
               government. This was altogether something 
               <br />
               inform-a1 which took place between mem- 
               <br />
               bers, as stated by my hon. friend from Sel- 
               <br />
               kirk (Mr. Jackson) in the speech to which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend (Mr. R. L. Borden) has just 
               <br />
               made allusion. We have had no cognizance 
               <br />
               of this conference. We were not parties to 
               <br />
               it, but so far as I know suggestions were 
               <br />
               made which would be acceptable to the 
               <br />
               gentlemen who took part in that conference. 
               <br />
               Nothing oiﬁcial took <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place‘,</span> it was simply 
               <br />
               a friendly interview between members in- 
               <br />
               terested in the same question. I could not 
               <br />
               say anything further than what I have al- 
               <br />
               ready stated, that it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> intention at some 
               <br />
               early day, as soon as the provinces are 
               <br />
               organized, to have a conference of repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of the provinces of Ontario, Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and Saskatchewan, with the view of 
               <br />
               disposing especially of that section of terri- 
               <br />
               tory which is now held in reserve, which is 
               <br />
               part of the present territory of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan, but which was not included in the 
               <br />
               new province of Saskatchewan, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land-further</span> 
               <br />
               also in regard to the territory of Keewatin. 
               <br />
               As is well known .by my hon. friend and by 
               <br />
               members of the House generally, the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba claims that they should 
               <br />
               have the whole of the territory of Keewatin 
               <br />
               added to their own province. The province

               of Ontario have, through Mr. Whitney, made
