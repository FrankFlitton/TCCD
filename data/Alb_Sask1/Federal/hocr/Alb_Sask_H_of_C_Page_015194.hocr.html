               works there than it does in the eastern

               provinces, and also because the cost of liv-

               <br />
               than they are in the east. We should not 
               <br />
               be unmindful, in dealing with these two 
               <br />
               new provinces, of two considerations, one 
               <br />
               of which is that probably it will cost more 
               <br />
               there to carry out public works—as it does 
               <br />
               now in British Columbia—than it costs in 
               <br />
               the eastern provinces; in addition to that, 
               <br />
               we have to remember the sparse popula- 
               <br />
               tion and the necessity of spreading out 
               <br />
               public works over a large area. These 
               <br />
               are considerations which We ought to take 
               <br />
               into account. But what I want to come 
               <br />
               down to is, after all, the practical ques- 
               <br />
               tion, that is, the entire absence of any prin- 
               <br />
               ciple which, apparently, has been found 
               <br />
               to guide the government in ﬁxing the sub- 
               <br />
               sidies 'for these provinces. Along what 
               <br />
               lines have they proceeded, upon what prin- 
               <br />
               ciple have they acted in selecting the ﬁg- 
               <br />
               ures of 800,000 of a population as the limit 
               <br />
               upon which they ﬁx the allowance ? There 
               <br />
               may- possibly have been considerations 
               <br />
               which would have induced them to ﬁx 
               <br />
               that at a larger amount, such as the higher 
               <br />
               cost of public works and the sparse popu— 
               <br />
               lation spread over a great area. They have 
               <br />
               departed from the limit of population ﬁxed 
               <br />
               for the maritime provinces, and they have 
               <br />
               departed also from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">limit</span> of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation ﬁxed for Ontario and Quebec, and 
               <br />
               they have adopted a somewhat middle 
               <br />
               course. But I cannot see upon what prin- 
               <br />
               ciple they ﬁx that particular limit of 800,- 
               <br />
               000 population for the new provinces. Is 
               <br />
               it based on any principle whatever, or is 
               <br />
               it simply arbitrary, as was the limit ﬁxed 
               <br />
               for Nova lScotia, New Brunswick, Quebec 
               <br />
               and Ontario, in the ﬁrst instance? How 
               <br />
               is it arrived at? Is it simply a guess at

               Sir W1LFRID L‘AURIER. That is a 
               <br />
               fair question. When we came to discuss 
               <br />
               this clause we would have been glad to 
               <br />
               know what principle the population limit 
               <br />
               had been ﬁxed for Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rScotia</span> and New 
               <br />
               Brunswick at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">400,000,</span> and for Manitoba at 
               <br />
               400,000. The record shows us nothing at 
               <br />
               all about that. But looking at the history 
               <br />
               of the case, we found that this sum was 
               <br />
               given, as has been stated already, to start 
               <br />
               the provinces with, to give them some 
               <br />
               compensation for what they were losing 
               <br />
               in entering confederation. The ﬁrst thought 
               <br />
               evidently of those who framed the Quebec 
               <br />
               resolutions was to take the basis of the 
               <br />
               population as it was in the census of 1861. 
               <br />
               They did that for Quebec and Ontario. But 
               <br />
               at that time the population of the maritime 
               <br />
               provinces, Nova Scotia and New Bruns-

               the case is absolutely hopeless. Every-

               a larger per capita allowance in the ﬁrst

               it would be possible—to carry that out here 
               <br />
