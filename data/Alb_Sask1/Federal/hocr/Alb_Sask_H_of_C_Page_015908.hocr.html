               plan—because the greater pa1t applies to 
               <br />
               Assiniboia—is perfection too. I would ask 
               <br />
               the committee, fairly looking at the sub- 
               <br />
               jeet, looking at the maps and at the facts 
               <br />

               and the south country 'two of these seats '3 
               <br />
               The fact is admitted by the committee that 
               <br />
               we cannot afford to go on the census of 
               <br />
               1901, that the changes since that time have 
               <br />
               been too great, and I say it is not fair to 
               <br />
               go exactly upon the vote of last fall, be- 
               <br />
               cause there were in some parts of the coun- 
               <br />
               try lalge blocks of men who. although al— 
               <br />
               ready in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> country, had not been there 
               <br />
               long enough to enable them to be natu1aliz— 
               <br />
               ed. and were therefore not permitted to 
               <br />
               vote. We must go to some extent upon 
               <br />
               estimate, and the best estimate that can be 
               <br />
               made in regard to that part of the country 
               <br />
               will be somewhat speculative. I would not 
               <br />
               take the responsibility of saying that the 
               <br />
               government plan will work out absolutely 
               <br />
               fairly. If we may be permitted in two, or 
               <br />
               three, or four years hence to get the actual 
               <br />
               population within these lines, it may be 
               <br />
               found in some surprising ways that the plan 
               <br />
               the government asks the House to adopt at 
               <br />
               the present moment is not an absolutely 
               <br />
               fair plan. I would not say that if we had 
               <br />
               given Saskatchewan four of these addi- 
               <br />
               tional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members,</span> as was proposed in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               government plan, that would be found in 
               <br />
               the end to work out unfairly, or if we turn- 
               <br />
               ed the proposition around and gave the three 
               <br />
               additions to the south and only two to the 
               <br />
               north. it might be that in two or three 
               <br />
               years hence that would be found to be a 
               <br />
               perfectly fair distribution. It must be re- 
               <br />
               membered that we are providing for the 
               <br />
               next four years. It must be expected that 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst legislature of the province of Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan will live out its life of four years, 
               <br />
               and keeping in mind the trend of immigra- 
               <br />
               tion as we have had it in the past, as we 
               <br />
               have it at the present time, and as we may 
               <br />
               expect to have it, and remembering the new 
               <br />
               railway construction in the northern part 
               <br />
               of the country, I may say, as a southern 
               <br />
               man, as a man who lives in and represents 
               <br />
               a southern constituency, that I am prepar- 
               <br />
               ed to agree to the giving of nine of the 
               <br />
               seats under this redistribution to the north 
               <br />
               as against sixteen to the south. The

               <br />
               opposite and hen. members on this side of 
               <br />
               the House has come down to whether three 
               <br />
               of the additional seats should go to the north 
               <br />
               country or whether only two of them should 
               <br />
               go to the north country, and it may not be 
               <br />
               uninteresting for the committee to look at 
               <br />
               the history of the Northwest Territories in 
               <br />
               so far as representation is concerned. Some 
               <br />
               of these ﬁgures that I am going to give to 
               <br />
               the committee I would call the particular

               attention of the hon. leader of the opposition

               plan for representation in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories was based purely and entirely 
               <br />
               upon population. That was for the election 
               <br />
               of members to the old Northwest Council 
               <br />
               prior to the creation of the legislature. It

               <br />
               should be made a constituency and elect a 
               <br />
               member. Under that plan I ﬁnd upon look— 
               <br />
               ing at the records that in the year 1885 
               <br />
               Assiniboia had eight members in the North- 
               <br />
               west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councii,</span> Alberta had four and Saskat- 
               <br />
               chewan had only one. In 1887 [_ ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               Assiniboia had eight members, Alberta ﬁve 
               <br />
               and Saskatchewan one. The population of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan only entitled it to one member 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Council. In 1888 this par- 
               <br />
               liament created the ﬁrst legislative assembly 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. A Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive government was in power then. and, 
               <br />
               strange to say, they made a redistribution 
               <br />
               for that legislature. They did not refer the 
               <br />
               matter to the courts. That redistribution 
               <br />
               was made 011 this ﬂoor. Twenty-two elect- 
               <br />
               ed members were provided for the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture, and of these eleven were given to As- 
               <br />
               siniboia, six to Alberta and no less than 
               <br />
               ﬁve to Saskatchewan. What was the popu- 
               <br />
               lation? The previous census showed that 
               <br />
               Assiniboia had 16,408, Alberta <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4,871</span> and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan 1,792, exclusive of Indians. 
               <br />
               Those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,792</span> people were given ﬁve members 
               <br />
               as against only six members for the 4,871 
               <br />
               people in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Alberta</span> and the eleven members 
               <br />
               for the 16,408 in Assiniboia. Surely .a ter- 
               <br />
               rible outrage was committed there. But 
               <br />
               nobody seemed to think it. Nobody said 
               <br />
               anything about it. Saskatchewan, in 1888, 
               <br />
               was given ﬁve members in a house of 
               <br />
               twenty-two members 011 a census population 
               <br />
               of 1,792, or an average unit of 358 souls for 
               <br />
               each seat; Alberta was given six members 
               <br />
               on a population of 4,871, an average of 812 
               <br />
               per seat. or more than 100 per cent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁer-</span> 
               <br />
               ence; while Assiniboia, with eleven mem- 
               <br />
               bers, had a population of 16, 408, with a unit 
               <br />
               of roundly 1,500 as against a little more 
               <br />
               than 300 for Saskatchewan. On previous 
               <br />
               days we have been asked to point to a 
               <br />
