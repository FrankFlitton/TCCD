               received the swamp lands. The swamp 
               <br />
               lands are perhaps the most valuable lands 
               <br />
               in the province of Manitoba. They require 
               <br />
               some preliminary work for drainage, but 
               <br />
               when drained there are no better lands in 
               <br />
               the Whole province. When the late govern- 
               <br />
               ment gave to the province of Manitoba the 
               <br />
               swamp lands, they made her a valuable 
               <br />
               gift, and it has proved to her a most im- 
               <br />
               portant asset. But the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories have no swamp lands, we could not 
               <br />

               Thus it. happens that in 1881 the then par- 
               <br />
               liament deliberately gave to the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway Company, which it was in- 
               <br />
               corporating, an absolute exemption from

               federal, provincial and municipal taxation. 
               <br />
               It was an extraordinary contract, but the 
               <br />
               fact stares us in the face, and it is in accord-

               ance with British precedent and British 
               <br />
               policy that contracts have to be executed

               <br />
               are advantageous or disadvantageous. In 
               <br />
               .1884 or 1885, when the limits of the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba were extended westward, a 
               <br />
               similar provision was introduced into the

               <br />

               <br />
