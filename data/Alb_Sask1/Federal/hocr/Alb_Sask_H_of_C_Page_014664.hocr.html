               Mr. EMMERSON. I expect to be able to 
               <br />
               introduce a Bill on Monday. I was unable 
               <br />
               to do so before, owing to a press of other 
               <br />

               <br />

               not be in any way affected by that course,

               few words what I said. I said that it had'

               <br />

               that three years ago, I think, in this House,

               other prominent members of his party have 
               <br />
               done the same thing, and we have advocated 
               <br />
               it on this side of the House. I pointed out 
               <br />
               to the hon. member for Pictou (Mr. Mac- 
               <br />
               douald) that the government might yet con- 
               <br />
               clude that it is the best policy. and that 
               <br />
               it would be meaningless, absurd, and an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in‘</span> 
               <br />
               conceivable thing that they should pass this 
               <br />
               legislation and then in the same session and 
               <br />
               in the next breath pass an Act authorizing 
               <br />
               us to take over this railway, to acquire it 
               <br />
               absolutely as the property of the govern-

               Mr. HAUGH-TON LENNOX {South Sim- 
               <br />
               com. Mr. Speaker, when you left the chair 
               <br />
               at six o‘clock I was directing the attention of 
               <br />
               the House to an important statement made 
               <br />
               by the Hon. Colin Campbell, the attorney 
               <br />
               general of the province of Manitoba, and 
               <br />
               I was pointing out that an unfortunate 
               <br />
               state of things had arisen, namely, that the 
               <br />
               memory of the right hon. leader of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment conﬂicted with the memory of the 
               <br />
               two members of the cabinet of the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba on several important matters. 
               <br />
               I was intending to pursue the matter a 
               <br />
               little further and to point out some other 
               <br />
               circumstances in the same line. But I have 
               <br />
               probably said enough to direct the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">atteu‘</span> 
               <br />
               tion of the House to the 'fact that it 
               <br />
               is not after all so much a question 
               <br />
               of defective memory, as of the fact 
               <br />
               that the government has so conducted 
               <br />
               this business, both in the House and 
               <br />
               out of it, that we have the spectacle to-day 
               <br />
               of a serious conﬂict, not only between the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman and the premier of the 
               <br />
