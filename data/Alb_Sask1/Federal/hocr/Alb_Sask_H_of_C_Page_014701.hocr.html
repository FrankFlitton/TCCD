               myself competent to discuss this matter

               <br />
               nor will I attempt to do so. I am perfectly

               content to leave that discussion to those

               superior knowledge and a greater experience

               along those lines. But, Sir, after reading 
               <br />
               the newspapers of both political parties, 
               <br />
               after reading letters I have received, after 
               <br />
               listening to many speeches delivered in this

               House, many of them from legal gentlemen 
               <br />
               on both sides, andafter having personally 
               <br />
               conversed with members of the legal pro- 
               <br />
               fession, I feel inclined to say with Sheri- 
               <br />
               dan: ‘Egad, I think the interpreter is the 
               <br />
               harder to be understood of the two.’ It 
               <br />
               does appear to me that the most our best 
               <br />

               <br />
               will be able to do in this matter will be, in 
               <br />
               learned legal phraseology, to build up con- 
               <br />
               trary arguments, to quote antagonistic 
               <br />
               authorities and to express opinions diame- 
               <br />
               trically opposed. It seems to me, Sir, that 
               <br />
               whatever course this parliament may adopt 
               <br />
               in this matter, litigation may possibly fol- 
               <br />
               low. But it does not by any means follow 
               <br />
               that litigation must ensue, or that it will 
               <br />
               ensue if the parties more immediately con-

               in this House that have been calculated to 
               <br />
               stir up strife and kindle passion have come

               their simplicity and for their courage. I 
               <br />
               will not say that every Conservative member 
               <br />
               who has spoken has made that kind of a 
               <br />
               speech, forl do not think that would be 
               <br />
               right or true. I will go further and say
