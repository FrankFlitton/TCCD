               adian citizens who have been deprived of 
               <br />
               their rights in connection with large mining 
               <br />
               interests in South Africa. The facts as re- 
               <br />
               presented to me are shortly these: prior to 
               <br />
               the year 1897, a gentleman named R. E. 
               <br />
               Brown. an American citizen, secured for 
               <br />
               himself and certain other persons associated 
               <br />
               with him (some of them being Canadians) 
               <br />
               about 1,200 valuable mining claims on what 
               <br />
               is known as the farm <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Witfonteiln</span> in the 
               <br />
               district of Potchefstroom in the South 
               <br />
               African Republic. These claims were pegged 
               <br />
               out and rightfully owned by Mr. Brown, 
               <br />
               but the president <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01'</span> that republic, Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Krue</span> 
               <br />
               ger, denied the right of Mr. Brown and his 
               <br />
               associates to these claims and refused to 
               <br />
               issue licenses or leases. Mr. Brown, repre- 
               <br />
               senting himself and his associates, applied to 
               <br />
               the courts of the South African Republic 
               <br />
               and on their behalf brought an action 
               <br />
               against Dr. Leyds, the secretary of the exe- 
               <br />
               cutive of Mr. Kruger; and also against the 
               <br />
               clerk of the district in which these mining 
               <br />
               lands were situated—asking that licenses 
               <br />
               should issue to him in accordance with the 
               <br />
               law. In that action Mr. Brown recovered a 
               <br />
               judgment as prayed for by him. The full 
               <br />
               court determined that he was entitled to 
               <br />
               have issued to him licenses for these lands, 
               <br />
               and in default he was awarded damages 
               <br />
               commensurate with the estimated value of 
               <br />
               the claims. These damages were assessed at 
               <br />
               £720,400, so that it will be seen that the 
               <br />
               amount involved is very large. That judg- 
               <br />
               ment was rendered by the High Court of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Reipublic</span> of South Africa on the 22nd 
               <br />
               of January. 1897. Immediately after this 
               <br />
               judgment. Mr. Kruger sought to thwart its 
               <br />
               execution in order to deprive Mr. Brown 
               <br />
               and his associates (some of whom were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadians)</span> of the beneﬁts thereof. Mr. 
               <br />
