               <br />
               the government to open a constituency there, 
               <br />
               a constituency was chosen which I think the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) 
               <br />
               in some remarks that he made, suggested 
               <br />
               would be a very good district, that the repre-

               <br />
               sure in endorsing such a move. Having 
               <br />
               met his views in that, after a constituency 
               <br />
               was opened, the very constituency that they 
               <br />
               wanted opened in the very part of the coun-

               <br />
               position why they did not run a candidate. 
               <br />
               Now the point I want to make out is that 
               <br />
               the gentleman who addressed the House last 
               <br />
               (Mr. Ingram) who denies that he said any- 
               <br />
               thing abusive with reference to settlers in 
               <br />

               <br />
               immunity from the charge of abusing gentle-

               <br />
               credit to the 13 members usually acting with

               the Conservative party for voting conscient— 
               <br />
               iously on this point. I think one gentleman 
               <br />
               either that hon. gentleman or the hon. gen— 
               <br />

               <br />
               quote him and I think I am quite correct— 
               <br />
               said that if the gentlemen on this side of 
               <br />

               know how it has seemed to hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite, but it seems to me clear as was 
               <br />
               stated that to state that gentlemen on this

               dictates of their consciences cannot at any 
               <br />
               rate be taken in the light of a compliment. 
               <br />
               I do not think you could say anything that 
               <br />
               one would be much more inclined to resent

               In our own province, as the hon. gentleman
