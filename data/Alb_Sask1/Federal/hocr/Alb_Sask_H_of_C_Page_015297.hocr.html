               Sir WIILFRID L-AURIER. The constitu-

               tion of the United States provides for two 
               <br />
               senators to each state, whether the state 
               <br />
               is large or small. The idea was that there 
               <br />
               should be uniformity of representation in 
               <br />
               respect to states, not in respect to popu- 
               <br />
               lation. In our case, Ontario to-day has 
               <br />
               twenty-four senators and a population of 
               <br />
               over 2.000.000; the maritime provinces have 
               <br />
               twenty-four senators and about 1,000,000 
               <br />
               of a population. The province of Prince

               icel that parliament should do so, be-

               cause I think it would be only reasonable

               that that part of Canada which lies west

               would be the case if this scheme is carried

               Minister that the west will ultimately be

               senators, like the three eastern groups at

               west of the great lakes should ultimately 
               <br />
