               There may have, been preliminary surveys,

               still under Dominion administration. It

               <br />
               some trouble, but they looked at the map 
               <br />
               and selected the centre. Well, if that is the 
               <br />
               principle that governed and they are select- 
               <br />
               ing the centre. why did they not select Ath- 
               <br />
               abaska Landing, for that is the centre and 
               <br />
               it would be more convenient for the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of Athabaska to whom I referred a 
               <br />
               few moments ago. If he wishes to consider 
               <br />
               the convenience of the people let him take 
               <br />
               a point half way between Edmonton and 
               <br />
               any point. on the main line of the Canadian 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Paciﬁc</span> Railway. and he will ﬁnd in the 
               <br />
               southern portion there are constructed 980 
               <br />
               miles of railway. and in the northern only 
               <br />
               130 miles. I introduced the deputation 
               <br />
               from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Calgary</span> who interviewed the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the government and asked 
               <br />
               them to select a non-competitive point as 
               <br />
               the provisional capital. _ They suggested 
               <br />
               the selection of Medicine Hat, Banﬁ, 
               <br />
               Lethbridge, Macleod, Red Deer or any 
               <br />
               other point that would be near the 
               <br />
               centre of trade and the centre of popula- 
               <br />
               tion, and that would meet the convenience 
               <br />
               of the people Whose business called them 
               <br />
               to the capital and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">convenience</span> of the 
               <br />
               members of the ﬁrst legislature. But, for 
               <br />
               some reason, I cannot say what, the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment has seen ﬁt to select the point at 
               <br />
               the end of railway construction and away 
               <br />
               from what I hope to be able to show when 
               <br />
               the clause comes up in committee is the 
               <br />
               centre of trade and the centre of population. 
               <br />
               If it is the convenience of the people that 
               <br />
               is being considered, I would ask the First 
               <br />
               Minister to look at the map again and to 
               <br />
               look at the distribution in the local House 
               <br />
