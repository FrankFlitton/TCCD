               <br />
               province of Ontario, for that matter? Why 
               <br />
               both of these have had large additions to 
               <br />
               their territories since Manitoba was made 
               <br />
               a province and Manitoba was not consulted? 
               <br />
               There is the less cause for consulting them, 
               <br />
               when we take into consideration the fact 
               <br />
               that the district of Keewatin has been un- 
               <br />
               der the jurisdiction of Manitoba the past 
               <br />
               thirty years. The administration of justice 
               <br />
               in that district has all taken place under the 
               <br />
               jurisdiction of the lieutenant governor of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. and the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               can be extended to the Hudson bay without 
               <br />
               encroaching on one foot of territory pro- 
               <br />
               perlv belonging to Ontario or Quebec. In 
               <br />
               my opinion therefore the refusal of the 
               <br />
               request of Manitoba was entirely unjust 
               <br />
               and will meet with the condemnation of 
               <br />
               every citizen of that province irrespective 
               <br />
               of party. This has not been a party ques-

               have brought it up in the Manitoba legisla- 
               <br />
               ture. Hon. gentlemen on the opposite side 
               <br />
               have brought it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up.</span> and it has been treated 
               <br />
               as a non-party question. It is also being 
               <br />
               treated in that light by the press of both 
               <br />
               political parties. It has even received the

               And in view of this general expression of 
               <br />
               approval, it seems to me that the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba has been treated in a most 
               <br />
               cavalier and unjust manner.

               I was somewhat surprised to ﬁnd that

               of the government no doubt, when this and 
               <br />
               similar requests were made in the past. 
               <br />
               He was, in Ottawa <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vwhen</span> the delegation 
               <br />
               from that province came here to press its

               claim. He was also in the city when the 
               <br />
               delegation from the board of trade of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               the claim of that province. Still he has 
               <br />
               never uttered a protest against the action 
               <br />
               of this government in turning down the rea-

               Laying aside the question of the extension

               <br />
               features in this Bill which deserve special

               condemnation by the people of the

               <br />
               educational clauses and the land clauses.

               a precedent in connection with the school 
               <br />
               policy. On the contrary he went out of his

               way to offer a gratuitous insult to the Amer- 
               <br />

               <br />
               have found that imperial statesmen in days 
               <br />
               gone by took the same position as the one 
               <br />
               he takes now regarding the ownersi-p of 
               <br />
               those lands. He would have found that 
               <br />
               they urged that those lands should be held 
               <br />
               by the empire for the beneﬁt of the people 
               <br />
               of the empire. But better counsels pre- 
               <br />
               vailed, and it was recognized that these
