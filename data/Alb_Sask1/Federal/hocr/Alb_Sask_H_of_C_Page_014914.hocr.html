               kept, so to speak, under a surveillance which 
               <br />
               is painful to them as it is insulting, naturally

               It is certainly not in the public interest that

               so undesirable a state of things as this should

               many ways of sending money through the post

               <br />
               been so greatly reduced that they are within 
               <br />
               every one’s reach, and the money, it lost, can
