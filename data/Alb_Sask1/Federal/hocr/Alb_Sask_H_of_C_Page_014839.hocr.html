               Now, Mr. Speaker. I wish to say plainly, 
               <br />
               so that there may be no question where I 
               <br />
               stand, that according to my reading of Can- 
               <br />
               adian history and of the constitution under 
               <br />
               which we are united as one Dominion—and 
               <br />
               I :believe what is the opinion of a vast ma- 
               <br />
               jority of those who live in the section from 
               <br />
               which I come—when separate schools were 
               <br />
               introduced into this country, so far back I 
               <br />
               think as 1840, they were introduced only in 
               <br />
               the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. So 
               <br />
               far as I have been able to gather from the 
               <br />
               history of this subject, and so far as I have 
               <br />
               been . able to understand the meaning 
               <br />
               of the various Acts that have been 
               <br />
               passed, I ﬁnd that Ontario undertook to 
               <br />
               bear this disability for the sake of Que— 
               <br />
               bec, and Quebec. undertook to bear this 
               <br />
               disability for the sake of Ontario. There 
               <br />
               was a mutual understanding and a 
               <br />
               friendly arrangement entered into between 
               <br />
               the two provinces and neither of which has 
               <br />
               shown a disposition up to the present time 
               <br />
               to go back upon it. It was understood to 
               <br />
               be a settlement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,for</span> all time. It was said 
               <br />
               that if separate schools were introduced into 
               <br />
               Quebec and Ontario it would be a settlement 
               <br />
               of the question for all time. That settlement 
               <br />
               was made, those provinces entered into that 
               <br />
               arrangement. the Catholics of Quebec agree- 
               <br />
               ing to give the Protestant minority separate 
               <br />
               schools, and the Protestants of Ontario to 
               <br />
               give in like manner separate schools to the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of that province. That 
               <br />
               I believe was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> agreement and arrange-
