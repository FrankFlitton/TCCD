               tions to show how public feeling has been 
               <br />
               aroused in this country, a result largely 
               <br />
               due I think to the course .pursued by the 
               <br />
               Conservative party. I have recently seen 
               <br />
               two letters addressed to hon. members of 
               <br />
               this House both from residents of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Ontario. The writer of one letter 
               <br />
               inquired if it were not true that the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics of Canada serving in our militia 
               <br />
               got bigger pay per day than the Protes- 
               <br />
               tants. I saw another letter inquiring as to 
               <br />
               whether it was not true that all through 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec there were being 
               <br />

               <br />
               ments of the Catholic churches. These gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen scented danger, and they may have 
               <br />
               been quite honest in their fear: but I say 
               <br />
               they were aroused to this particular <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">form</span> of 
               <br />
               excitement largely by the position taken by

               the Conservative party.

               tion Which he took in 1896 by reason of 
               <br />
               the fact that the Conservative party was 
               <br />
               defeated in that year, and had been de- 
               <br />
               feated twice since. Now, Sir. no declar- 
               <br />
               ation has been quoted more frequently in

               who said that he would rather be right 
               <br />
               than be president. But the declaration 
               <br />
               made by the hon. member for North To- 
               <br />
               ronto is that he will follow the people, 
               <br />
               whether they are right or whether they 
               <br />
               are wrong. He is like the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immortal.</span> Flan- 
               <br />
               nignn from Texas, who, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01051111;</span> :1 
               <br />
               speech, addressed his audience saying: 
               <br />
               ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">zentlemen,</span> them’s my sentiments, and if 
               <br />
               they don’t suit you they can be changed.’ 
               <br />
               Now certainly these are not high ideals to 
               <br />
               put before the youth of this country. There 
               <br />
               is a distinction between right and wrong, 
               <br />
               and there is surely no reason in this coun- 
               <br />
               try why a person should desert what he 
               <br />
               considers to be the true position merely 
               <br />
               because his party meets with a political re- 
               <br />
               verse, and possibly upon some other issue 
               <br />
               altogether. But I do not for a moment 
               <br />
               admit that the Conservative party were de- 
               <br />
               feated in 1896 upon the school question. _I 
               <br />
               may not agree with some of my own politi- 
               <br />
               cal friends on that point. The Conserva-

               <br />
               a bad state, they could not get along With 
               <br />
               themselves, and certainly they could not 
               <br />
               get along with the country. The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman who leads the opposition in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and good will towards man, he made a call 
               <br />
               upon one of the ministers, and he tells us

               the ladies, this-minister was trying to 
               <br />
               seduce one of his other ministers away 
               <br />
               from the cabinet. Now if such conduct 
               <br />
               prevailed on New Year’s Day among cabinet 
               <br />
               ministers. surely we could expect almost 
               <br />
               anything to occur in the ranks of the Con- 
               <br />
               servative party. But I notice that the prin- 
               <br />
               ciples of the hon. member for North Toronto. 
               <br />
               his political ethics, were not of a much 
               <br />
               higher standard in the past than they are 
               <br />
               to-day. He addressed this parliament in 
               <br />
               1896 upon the Manitoba school question and 
               <br />
               I think he was the last speaker on the 
               <br />
               government side. I must admit that he made 
               <br />
               a speech which was an exceedingly able 
               <br />
               and admirable one, notwithstanding that 
               <br />
               there are portions of it with which I do 
               <br />
               not agree. I Wish to read just a short 
               <br />
               quotation from that speech to show what 
               <br />
               was the standard of political ethics of that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman then and when I read that 
               <br />
               I am sure hon. gentlemen will not be sur- 
               <br />
               prised at the position taken by him the 
               <br />
               other day. He was then addressmg the 
               <br />
               Conservative party. He knew that- there 
               <br />
               were to be many desertions from the ranks 
               <br />
