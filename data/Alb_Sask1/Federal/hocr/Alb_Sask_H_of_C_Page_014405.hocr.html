               I want to say a word about the position of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Public Works. The acting 
               <br />

               <br />
               just gone out. No man regrets the illness 
               <br />
               of the present minister—I refer to the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. James Sutherland—more than I do my- 
               <br />
               self. He is a gentleman for whom I have 
               <br />
               always _had and always shall have the very 
               <br />
               highest personal regard, and no one will 
               <br />
               more heartily welcome him back to health 
               <br />
               and to this House than I. But what are 
               <br />
               the facts of the case ? It is generally un- 
               <br />
               derstood, in fact a gentleman whom the 
               <br />
               minister himself has consulted, has stated 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Public Works has asked 
               <br />
               the First Minister to accept his resignation, 
               <br />
               but for some reason or other this resigna- 
               <br />
               tion has not been accepted. That respon- 
               <br />
               sible position, which the constitution requires 
               <br />
               shall be held by a member having a seat in

               the parliament directly responsible to the

               people, has not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> ﬁlled, and one of the

               largest spending departments of the public

               <br />
               House to-day. I am not saying one word 
               <br />
               about the hon. member for London, the min- 
               <br />
               ister without portfolio (Mr. Hyman). a 
               <br />
               gentleman who I believe undoubtedly stands 
               <br />
               head and shoulders over his colleagues from 
               <br />
               that province. I am not saying one word 
               <br />
               about his ﬁtness, and that is all the more 
               <br />
               reason Why he should be made the re- 
               <br />
               sponsible minister. He occupies a peculiar 
               <br />
               position. His position in the cabinet is 
               <br />
               simply that of a minister without portfolio. 
               <br />
               He is not responsible for any department, 
               <br />
               and has not appealed to the people for re— 
               <br />
               election after his appointment as minister. 
               <br />
               I am sure the First Minister will hear me 
               <br />
               out when I say that the position he now 
               <br />
               occupies is entirely unconstitutional. It is

               ing whether or not the present cabinet has

               icn, not only in regard to the Public Works 
               <br />
               Department, but in regard to their general 
               <br />
               conduct of other matters. The custom of the 
               <br />
               English constitution is that all important 
               <br />
               measures involving important.pninciples. 
               <br />
               such as that involved in the Bill before the 
               <br />
               House, should be pronounced upon by the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> before becoming law. The First Min- 
               <br />
               ister knows that this measure was not at all 
               <br />
               discussed before the electorate. No one 
               <br />
               dreamed that there were going to be the con- 
               <br />
               tentious matters in this Bill that have been 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span> in it. Therefore I maintain that the 
               <br />
               duty of the Prime Minister is to hold this 
               <br />
               Bill off until the feeling of the country in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to it can be tested in a general elec-

               tion. I maintain that there is only one of 
               <br />
               two courses open to him at the present time. 
               <br />
               One is to go to the country and test the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ft</span> eling of the electors in a general election; 
               <br />
               another is to appoint a new Minister of the

               interior and put him in the ﬁeld in some 
               <br />
               iiding in the Northwest and test the feeling 
               <br />
               of the country in that way. The portfolio of
