               ——and I may say that I think his views are 
               <br />
               far more correct than those of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment—although he presented his case as 
               <br />
               ably, as eloquently and as persuasively as 
               <br />
               he has this afternoon spoken to the House, 
               <br />
               still, on that point too, the government re- 
               <br />
               fused to listen, and so the land and ﬁscal

               questions are complicated by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduc.</span> 
               <br />
               ‘tion of a principle which, as pointed out by 
               <br />
               the minister this afternoon, shows that the 
               <br />
               government, by admitting to the provinces 
               <br />
               that we should pay for the land, have ad- 
               <br />
               mitted that the provinces have a right to 
               <br />
               the land. Again I say that, although he 
               <br />
               was right in his representations, the gov-- 
               <br />
               ernment treated them with contemptuous 
               <br />
               indifference. Then, after making these pro- 
               <br />
               testations and after being badly treated, 
               <br />
               treated with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indifference</span> in this way, could 
               <br />
               one imagine that there was no irony conceal- 
               <br />
               ed in his remarks when he said in this 
               <br />
               House that there was no pique when he re- 
               <br />
               signed after this Bill was brought down 
               <br />
               two days before his arrival? We have 
               <br />
               heard many details of the hon. gentleman’s 
               <br />
               exploits in the west; many rumours 'have

               drifted 'down to us during the past ten

               <br />
               them will be received with less credulity 
               <br />
               by the country than the statement he 
               <br />
               made this afternoon as to the causes 
               <br />
               of his resignation. Just think for a 
               <br />
               moment the position that he put his 
               <br />
               colleagues in. Had the ex—miuister come 
               <br />
               out ﬂatly, and bravely said: ‘ I resign 
               <br />
               because I refuse to occupy a seat in ’a cabi-

               <br />
               the country would have understood. But 
               <br />

               <br />
               and advocating it in spite of such tremend—

               ous objections to it as those which the ex- 
               <br />
               minister pointed out, and the existence of 
               <br />
               which they admitted by changing the Bill, 
               <br />
               what are we to think of the capacity of a 
               <br />
               cabinet that would plunge the country into

               given so little attention as they have given

               agree with every word he uttered on that

               point, but let me add one or two words to 
               <br />
               what he said. It is perfectly true that when 
               <br />
               confederation was about to be formed it 
               <br />
               was agreed between the politicians of Upper 
               <br />
               and Lower Canada that two Bills should be 
               <br />
               introduced to this House. one giving educa- 
               <br />
               tional privileges to the Catholic minority in 
               <br />
               Upper Canada, the other giving educational 
               <br />
               privileges to the Protestant minority in 
               <br />
               Lower Canada. These Bills were introduced 
               <br />
               but for reasons which we need not now dis— 
               <br />
               cuss. they were uot passed, and those Bills. 
               <br />
               not having been passed. and confederation 
               <br />
               being about to be effected. the whole scheme 
               <br />
               would have fallen through. because the 
               <br />
               Protestants of the province of Quebec re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               educational rights were secured. Then Sir
