               ment to subsection 1 it is practically a new

               instead of ‘at the union.’ It is provided, 
               <br />
               however, that section 93 of the British

               North America Act shall apply and the 
               <br />
               ﬁrst subsection of that section deals with 
               <br />
               questions of this kind, and thus we 
               <br />
               have introduced by the Act now before the 
               <br />
               House substantially all of section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act with a rider such 
               <br />
               as I have just quoted. If it is correct, 
               <br />
               as the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sif- 
               <br />
               ton) argues that the ordinances have no 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ettect</span> and that the law of 1875 is stillin 
               <br />
               force in the Territories the result will be 
               <br />
               that by this Act and we will be im- 
               <br />
               posing upon the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               separate schools to the most extreme type to 
               <br />
               which they have attained at any time since 
               <br />
               1875. The people of the Northwest Territor- 
               <br />
               ies will have to accept this position at the in— 
               <br />
               stance of the minority whether they like it 
               <br />
               or not. We had yesterday produced in this 
               <br />
               House a statement made by the Hon. Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers in reference to an interview with the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegatc. Yesterday we had also 
               <br />
               read in the House the statement which the 
               <br />
               Papal ablegate gave to the press. In that 
               <br />
               statement we are told by the ablegate 
               <br />
               that the reason for the interview with Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell—was that he had a previous ac- 
               <br />
               quaintance with Mr. Campbell. Now. no one 
               <br />
               pretends for an instant that there was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any;</span> 
               <br />
               thing wrong in the Papal ablegate having 
               <br />
               interviews with either of these gentlemen. 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers or Mr. Campbell, if he sees ﬁt. 
               <br />
               The question of signiﬁcance yesterday was. 
               <br />
               and the question to-day is whether or not the 
               <br />
               representative of the Holy See was inter- 
               <br />
               fering unduly with the affairs of Canada 
               <br />
               and was endeavouring by means of certain 
               <br />
               propositions which he made to those repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of Manitoba to bring about a 
               <br />
               state of things which he desired. Hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen of the government yesterday sought 
               <br />
               to convey the impression that the Papal 
               <br />
               ablegate had no ulterior design of any kind 
               <br />
               and that it was only a private interview 
               <br />
               which the Papal ablegate had sought be- 
               <br />
               cause he had had a previous acquaintance 
               <br />
               with Mr. Colin Campbell. I propose to read 
               <br />
               what Mr. Colin Campbell says in reference 
               <br />
               to that matter, and hon. gentlemen will re 
               <br />
               call how much credence was placed upon the 
               <br />
               word of Mr. Colin Campbell, everybody 
               <br />
               certiﬁed for him and everybody sneered at 
               <br />
               Hon. Mr. Rogers. I shall now quote from 
               <br />

               Now there are other aspects of the case 
               <br />
               which require attention to-day. We have

               this fact brought very painfully to our

               minds that not only has the First <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> 
               <br />
               developed lately a peculiarly tyrannical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               position, a desire for more power and a de-

               of memory, an unfortunate lack of memory,
