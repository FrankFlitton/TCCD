               <br />

               Well, if you take the actual votes polled, 
               <br />
               what does it show ? Take even the govern— 
               <br />

               the constituency of Red Deer, which is 
               <br />
               partly in the north and partly in the south. 
               <br />
               So, taking the basis proposed by the Minis-
