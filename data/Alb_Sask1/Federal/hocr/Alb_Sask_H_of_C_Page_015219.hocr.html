               tional boundary, a deduction of 300 miles. 
               <br />
               Another deduction of 10 per cent must be 
               <br />
               made for lands alienated—and it is to be

               <br />
               15,462 square miles, and multiplying this by

               <br />
               we get an acreage of 9,895,680, to which we 
               <br />
               must add 3,000,000 acres given in Peace

               or, for convenience, say 13,000,000 acres. 
               <br />
               It will be noticed that no deductions are 
               <br />
               made for water areas, nor have any been 
               <br />
               taken out of area of Alberta, which is 100,- 
               <br />

               British Columbia $100,000 was paid annual- 
               <br />
               ly to the provincial government, and this 
               <br />
               land is in the Rocky mountain belt. 
               <br />
               is no comparison of the treatment and 
               <br />
               there is discrimination against the neW 
               <br />
               provinces. Thus, I desire some information 
               <br />
               as to why the government should only esti- 
               <br />
               mate the lands in that country at 25,000,000 
               <br />
               acres if there are no waste lands, and no 
               <br />
               explanation has been given as to that. Un- 
               <br />
               til these ﬁgures are brought down and some 
               <br />
               information or knowledge given the House 
               <br />
               as to how the government arrived at the

               amount, it is practically impossible for us 
               <br />
               to discuss the matter on an intelligent basis.

               Another objection is we may have. by the 
               <br />
               retention of these lands here, a check on 
               <br />
               local enterprises. What is there to be

               gained by these provinces in assisting the

               <br />

               <br />
               the very year the release was taken from 
               <br />

               Carthy) is looking at the basis on which 
               <br />
               this legislation was introduced in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               instance. That basis is this. Inasmuch as 
               <br />
               the public lands in the said provinces are 
               <br />
               to remain the property of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> there 
               <br />
               shall be paid by Canada to the said pro~ 
               <br />
               vinces, by way of compensation therefor, 
               <br />
               a sum based on the estimated value of such 
               <br />
               lands. That is very simple and plain. 
               <br />
               Then it goes on to state What that sum 
               <br />
               is. My hon. friend from Calgary is argu- 
               <br />
               ing that that sum is not a fair value, if 
               <br />
               you take the lands as a basis: and not- 
               <br />
               withstanding the statement of the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior (Mr. Oliver), I have not yet 
               <br />
               heard from the Prime Minister any annun- 
               <br />
               ciation of policy different from that con-
