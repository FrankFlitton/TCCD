               Monk) is now bringing this question before 
               <br />
               this parliament. I do not say that his object 
               <br />
               is to raise another agitation similar to that 
               <br />
               which has been going on for some time. but 
               <br />
               I do say that his policy is calculated to be 
               <br />
               detrimental to the interests of those whom 
               <br />
               he seeks to protect. The hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Mr. Monk), representing a constituency 
               <br />
               miles away from the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               asks that the people of the Northwest should 
               <br />
               have the right to use the French language 
               <br />
               in the proceedings before the courts of the 
               <br />
               Northwest. when the people of the North- 
               <br />
               west have not asked for that themselves. 
               <br />
               That is not fair to the minority in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North»</span> 
               <br />
               west Territories. and it may bring upon 
               <br />
               them serious results for which the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman (Mr. Monk) will be responsible. 
               <br />
               Everything is now going on there in peace 
               <br />
               and harmony, and why cause a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disturbv</span> 
               <br />
               ance? Last night we heard an hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man from the Northwest Territories state 
               <br />
               in this House that if the law as proposed 
               <br />
               did not absolutely protect the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. he would vote to make the law 
               <br />
               clear on that point. I believe that such a 
               <br />
               noble sentiment will in future guide those 
               <br />

               colony <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to‘day</span> had been conquered by the 
               <br />
               French and was a French colony and that 
               <br />
               there was an English group in that colony, 
               <br />
               there is not an English member in this 
               <br />
               House who would rise to support a motion 
               <br />
               for the abolition of the English language. 
               <br />
               To my hon. friend the member for East 
               <br />
               Grey (Mr. Sproule) I may say this much: 
               <br />
               that if any man in the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               would declare that because of the expense 
               <br />
               of publishing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁcial</span> documents in the two 
               <br />
               languages, and as there was no practical use 
               <br />
               for their publication in the English langu- 
               <br />
               age it should cease, the ﬁrst men in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec to stand up in defiance 
               <br />
               of such an unjust proposition would he the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) 
               <br />
               and the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bourassa) who have been denounced in this 
               <br />
               House as French demagogues. 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I heard the hon. member for Labelle say 
               <br />
               in Montreal that if the French Canadians 
               <br />
               were treated with injustice in any part of 
               <br />
               Canada, that was no reason why we should 
               <br />
               visit reprisals on our English speaking com- 
               <br />
               patriots in the province of Quebec. We are 
               <br />
               told that we should be satisﬁed because 
               <br />
               Ihere are a considerable number of French 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ianadians</span> who have public positions in this 
               <br />
               country. The hon. gentleman who advanced 
               <br />
               that argument reminded me very much of 
               <br />
               the Polish king who when he was drunk 
               <br />
               thought all Poland was drunk too. I do 
               <br />
               not think it is a soothing balm on the 
               <br />
               wounds of the French Canadian people to 
               <br />
               know that some of their number have ob- 
               <br />
               tained public positions in this country. 
               <br />
               What does this fact do for the people who 
               <br />
               claim their rights? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wha</span> we want are not 
               <br />
               positions, but the rights that are guaran- 
               <br />
               teed to us by the constitution. I have 
               <br />
               heard the objection made in private conver- 
               <br />
               sation—and I suppose it will be made by 
               <br />
