               can add very little to the subject. Being a 
               <br />
               Western man, this Bill appeals to me, and 
               <br />
               were it not for that fact I think I would 
               <br />
               be satisﬁed to give a silent vote. A great 
               <br />
               deal has been said about the importance of 
               <br />
               this so-called Autonomy Bill; some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mean-</span> 
               <br />
               bers have gone so far as to say that it is the 
               <br />
               most important Bill that has been intro- 
               <br />
               duced into this House since confederation. 
               <br />
               Well, I acknowledge its importance, and I 
               <br />
               think that members on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House have failed to understand how im- 
               <br />
               portant it is to that great Northwest. I 
               <br />
               am glad to know that while the members 
               <br />
               of this House may differ on details in con- 
               <br />
               nection with this Bill, they are unanimous 
               <br />
               in the opinion that the time is ripe for 
               <br />
               autonomy. I believe that that great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">west»</span> 
               <br />
               ern country has reached its majority. I 
               <br />
               believe, in view of the position that country 
               <br />
               holds to—day in the eyes of the world, in 
               <br />
               view of the large number of people who are 
               <br />
               going in there to settle, that the time has 
               <br />
               come when we should give to those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories a full measure of home rule. I 
               <br />
               readily admit the government was inspired 
               <br />
               with a very popular sentiment when it gave 
               <br />
               this question its attention.

               Now, I am glad to follow in this discus- 
               <br />
               sion my hon. friend from Portage la Prairie 
               <br />
               (Mr. Crawford). I have known that hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman for a great many years, we have 
               <br />
               always been great friends, and he is a won— 
               <br />
               derfully great friend of my father-in-law, 
               <br />
               who always takes a great deal of pains to 
               <br />
               vote for him. I agree with him on a good 
               <br />
               many points, but I must disagree with him 
               <br />
               on others. I agree with him in his satisfac- 
               <br />
               tion in hearing that Sir Charles Tupper 
               <br />
               has received the blessing of the Pope. I 
               <br />
               can only say that it adds one more honour 
               <br />
               to the many honours that have been given 
               <br />
               to that great man, and I only wish that 
               <br />
               we could all receive the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> honour. In 
               <br />
               rising to address the House on this question, 
               <br />
               I would like to be brief, but feeling so 
               <br />
               strongly as I do on this question, 1 shall 
               <br />
               have to ask the patience of the House for 
               <br />
               a considerable length of time. I am sorry 
               <br />
               to take up so much time of the House at 
               <br />
               this late hour, being a new member, but 
               <br />
               it seems to me customary to put on the new 
               <br />
               members late in the evening. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now, I intend to deal with this question 
               <br />
               from a national standpoint. I would like 
               <br />
               to say here that I represent a constitu— 
               <br />
               ency containing about twenty towns. in 
               <br />
               every one. of which there are a number 
               <br />
               of Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics,</span> and I am glad to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> able to say that up to this moment 
               <br />
               there has been absolutely no demand for 
               <br />
               two sets of schools. I like the expres- 
               <br />
               sion ‘two systems’ of schools better than 
               <br />
               that of ‘separate schools,’ because I think 
               <br />
               it is more applicable to the west. The term 
               <br />
               ‘separate schooi’ always seems to convey 
               <br />
               the idea either of a Protestant school or of 
               <br />
               a Roman Catholic school. I do not like to 
               <br />
               look at the subject in that way. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Perhaps</span> I

               two systems of schools rather than of a 
               <br />

               <br />
               members on this side of the House were 
               <br />
               taking up too much time. Well, we have 
               <br />
               only put up one man to every one of their 
               <br />
               men; we will not be able to keep that up, 
               <br />
               however, though I wish we could. But 
               <br />
               when he talks so much about justice to 
               <br />
               minorities, he does not seem to be so well 
               <br />
               disposed to do justice to the minority on this 
               <br />
               side of the House. Now, this Autonomy 
               <br />
               Bill contains twenty—ﬁve clauses, which 
               <br />
               may be divided into four groups, namely, 
               <br />
               the number of provinces, the ﬁnancial terms, 
               <br />
               the school question, and the ownership of the 
               <br />
               lands. As concerns the number of pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, I cannot at all agree with the hon. 
               <br />
               member for Portage la Prairie. If Manito— 
               <br />
               ba was not to be extended, then I would be 
               <br />
               in favour of two provinces to the west. and 
               <br />
               I think that would meet the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> of a 
               <br />
               large majority of the people in the western 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> But. Sir. we are settling the status 
               <br />
               of that great country for the last time, at 
               <br />
               least in so far as the country adjoining the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> boundary is concerned. And 1 can 
               <br />
               see. no reason why there should not have 
               <br />
               been two great provinces. He says he is 
               <br />
               satisﬁed that Manitoba cannot be extended 
               <br />
               westward. he is quite willing that it should 
               <br />
               be extended northward. He says these. 
               <br />
               lands are not much good. that they would 
               <br />
               be expensive to administer. 1 think that 
               <br />
               it is in the power of this government 
               <br />
               to make the division up there just where 
               <br />
               they see ﬁt. As regards the sentiment of 
               <br />
               the residents in the Territories, it has 
               <br />
               been said that they are strongly opposed 
               <br />
               to coming into the province of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. Now. I want to say to my hon. 
               <br />
               friends opposite that there is another senti- 
               <br />
               ment. There was a time when Manitoba 
               <br />
               took in Port Arthur and Fort William. “‘e 
               <br />
               then had a territory of 150,000 square miles. 
               <br />
               If we had an area like that, we would have 
               <br />
               something like our reasonable rights. I 
               <br />
               know the other provinces are fair enough 
               <br />
               to treat us justly. in order that we may 
               <br />
               compare favourably in regard to size with 
               <br />
               the, other provinces. I cannot accept the 
               <br />
               statement of the Prime Minister that before 
               <br />
               Manitoba boundaries could be extended he 
               <br />
               must consult Ontario and Quebec.
