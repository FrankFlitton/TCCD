               <br />
               going to do when you get to that point? 
               <br />
               There is only one of two things that you 
               <br />
               must do; you must either come to direct

               only $1.50 per acre on it to set up housekeep-

               <br />
               say it was unfair; we want our full birth- 
               <br />
               right. So much for that. I listened with 
               <br />
               a great deal of attention to the Premier’s 
               <br />
               criticism of 'the old confederation methods 
               <br />
               of settling the ﬁnances of the provinces. He 
               <br />
               criticised them. He always does criticise 
               <br />
               whatever the fathers of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation</span> have 
               <br />
               done. He leaves it to be inferred that if 
               <br />
               he had been a father of confederation 
               <br />
               and had lived at that time, he would have 
               <br />
               done differently. He entered into a some- 
               <br />
               what elaborate criticism of the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               methods on which the old provinces were 
               <br />
               framed. He said: You make one set of 
               <br />
               authorities the gatherers of the money, and 
               <br />
               you make another set, the provinces, the 
               <br />
               spenders, and the spenders who do not 
               <br />
               gather it do not feel any responsibility, and 
               <br />
               consequently they are not held in check. 
               <br />
               And today, if there is 'one menace that 
               <br />
               fronts this Dominion of Canada, it is the 
               <br />
               menace of ﬁnancial terms which seemingly 
               <br />
               can never be ﬁnally settled; which arises 
               <br />
               from the fact that every province has gone 
               <br />
               into competition with the Dominion in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mat‘</span> 
               <br />
               ters which it never should have taken up.

               run into debt and lavishly expended; 
               <br />

               opened up again. They have been opened 
               <br />
               up again and again. That is what the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister inveighed against; that is what 
               <br />
               he characterized ; that is what he deplored. 
               <br />
               Well, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">511',</span> he had a brand new slate—there 
               <br />
               was not a mark upon it.‘ He was making 
               <br />
               too great provinces, the greatest that evel‘ 
               <br />
               were made in this Dominion. He had only 
               <br />
               one responsibility, and no ties or bonds in 
               <br />

               <br />

               has done two things; he has violated the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Dominion with these provinces. He has, 
               <br />
               on the other hand, laid down no principle 
               <br />

               should have been left by the fathers of con- 
               <br />
               federation. Where has he been consistent 
               <br />
               with the old terms in the matter of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">16318-</span>

               <br />
               into account, the legislative allowance is 
               <br />
               not on the same level with the legislative al- 
               <br />
               lowance given to the older provinces. If 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> take the debt allowance, there is no 
               <br />
               parity between them. If you take the sub- 
               <br />
               sidy based on the population allowance, the 
               <br />
               others stopped at, a population of 400,000. 
               <br />
               On what principle should these have a popu- 
               <br />
               lation allowance of 800,000? And so, all 
               <br />
               through, he has not improved upon the prin- 
               <br />
               ciple, but he has violated the spirit and the 
               <br />
               letter of each of the arrangements with the 
               <br />
               old provinces. What has happened ? Two 
               <br />
               things have happened. The ﬁrst is that all 
               <br />
               the older provinces have already commenced 
               <br />
               their march towards Ottawa to ask for a 
               <br />
               revision of the ﬁnancial terms. They say: 
               <br />
               Our expenses are increasing; we have ex- 
               <br />
               ploited all we well can for the purpose of 
               <br />
               revenue ; we want more money ; you have 
               <br />
               been lavish with these new provinces. and 
               <br />
               we want you to revise our terms and give 
               <br />
               us at least the equal of what you give to 
               <br />
               them. How can the Premier after this say 
               <br />
               to the province of New Brunswick and the 
               <br />
               province of Nova Scotia. your eighty 
               <br />
               cents per head stops when you reach 
               <br />
               400,000, when you say to Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan your eighty cents per head 
               <br />
               does not stop until you reach <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">800,000.</span> 
               <br />
               'Why should not the limit be placed at 
               <br />
               800,000 for the other provinces as well as 
               <br />
               for the these two ? That is the kind of reas— 
               <br />
               oning which will be relied upon ; and when 
               <br />
               all the provinces join together and march 
               <br />
               upon Ottawa and demand a revision, who 
               <br />
               is to withstand that demand ? Not the gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen who are in power tO-day. Of that I 
               <br />
               feel quite certain. They will make terms at 
               <br />
               once, for party and political reasons it for 
               <br />
               no other. and there will be a vast increase 
               <br />
               in the expenditures of this Dominion in the 
               <br />
               way of subsidies to the older provinces, 
               <br />
               while on the other hand there will be no 
               <br />
               ﬁnality with regard to the west. It is as 
               <br />
               impossible as it would be to make water 
               <br />
               run up hill, to limit those two great pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, after having kept all their land, 
               <br />
               to a million a year of revenue ; if a million 
               <br />
               dollars per year, compared with their needs 
               <br />
