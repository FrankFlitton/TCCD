               <br />
               Would not the federal parliament to-day 
               <br />
               have the right to establish the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage in the Northwest if it saw ﬁt to do 
               <br />
               so?

               Mr. LEMIEUX. Undoubtedly, and so can 
               <br />
               my hon. friend agitate the country and ask 
               <br />
               that the 200,000 French Canadians in the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario shall have the right to 
               <br />
               the oﬂicial use of the French language in 
               <br />
               the legislature. But as there is not one 
               <br />
               word in the British North America Act 
               <br />

               nobody would dare agitate for such a

               thing. Would not my hon. friend from

               Jacques Cartier and Beauharnois be more
