               <br />
               out, our knowledge of that country as the 
               <br />
               result of experience has undergone during 
               <br />
               the last half dozen years a very material 
               <br />
               change. A very large part of the country 
               <br />
               east of the 4th meridian was looked upon 
               <br />
               until very recent years as exclusively ranch- 
               <br />

               <br />
               meridian for 200 miles east there is a con- 
               <br />
               t;nu0us range country on which horses and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cattle</span> run all the year round just as they 
               <br />
               do in the district of Pincher Creek. And 
               <br />
               the Pincher Creek country has undergone a 
               <br />
               remarkable change. Whereas a few years 
               <br />
               ago the people there were doing business 
               <br />
               entirely in cattle and horses, they are now 
               <br />
               doing business in wheat. and the same thing 
               <br />
               applies to a large part of the country east 
               <br />
               of the 4th meridian—not only to sections of 
               <br />
               the country in the neighbourhood of Moose- 
               <br />
               jaw and Wood mountain. but far east of

               recent years (and even yet there were and

               <br />
               as partially, or largely ranching districts. 
               <br />
               For instance, the Yellow Grass district, on 
               <br />
               the Soo line 60 or 70 miles south—east of 
               <br />

               <br />
               until recent years treated as an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exclusiveli~</span> 
               <br />
               ranching country; but the character of 
               <br />
               that country has undergone a certain change 
               <br />
               just like the Pincher Creek country. With
