               admirable one. and one with which the 
               <br />
               people are satisﬁed. We are not only doing 
               <br />
               that. but we are giving them the power 
               <br />
               to amend, alter, or change the law as time 
               <br />
               goes on ; so that for all time to come they 
               <br />
               will have in the new provinces an up-to-date 
               <br />
               school system, the very best that can be 
               <br />
               found; and surely that is what every one 
               <br />
               desires. A great number of petitions have 
               <br />
               been presented to this House with regard 
               <br />
               to this measure, and a great many resolu- 
               <br />
               tions and memorials have been passed by 
               <br />
               different bodies throughout the country. A 
               <br />
               great many of our clergy throughout On— 
               <br />
               tario have take exception to this Bill. At 
               <br />
               first their objections were largely to the 
               <br />
               school system that we were forcing on the 
               <br />
               Northwest; but as they have read'the 
               <br />
               amended clause and the discussions that 
               <br />
               have taken place in the House, they have 
               <br />
               largely abandoned that position, and now 
               <br />
               they say it is not a question of separate 
               <br />
               schools at all, but it is a question of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. Well, when we are simply 
               <br />
               legalizing a school system that the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest themselves passed, and 
               <br />
               giving them the power to amend or alter 
               <br />
               that school system from time to time, I 
               <br />
               would like to know how we are interfering 
               <br />
               with provincial rights. In this Bill we are 
               <br />
               saying there shall be two provinces instead 
               <br />
               of one; we are interfering with provincial 
               <br />
               rights in that respect; but in my opinion 
               <br />
               it is a wise departure to make. So far as 
               <br />
               the educational clauses are concerned, I 
               <br />
               cannot see how we are interfering with 
               <br />
               provincial rights at all, when we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">simply.</span> 
               <br />
               adopt the school system which the people 
               <br />
               have themselves passed, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> them 
               <br />
               the power to amend or alter it if they desire. 
               <br />
               Now, in reference to these petitions. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey has been more 
               <br />
               diligent than any other member in present-

               <br />
               of Canada have signed those petitions? In

               <br />

               <br />
               and in all the petitions sent to this House 
               <br />
               there have not been 200 names from that

               Some meetings have been held. There

               was a meeting in the city of Toronto, the

               ple. The great Massey hall was hired, an

               army of speakers was announced, whose

               invitations and notices and tickets were 
               <br />
               sent out broadcast by the thousand, and you

               <br />
               own county, in the town of Mimico. Two 
               <br />
               very distinguished gentlemen from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Toronto</span> 
               <br />
               went out there to set the heather on ﬁre; 
               <br />
               they were going to discuss this Autonomy 
               <br />
               Bill, men of ability, men well versed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> 
               <br />
               the details of the Bill, and eloquent gentle- 
               <br />
               men. They advertised the meeting all over, 
               <br />
               sent invitations allaround, but when that 
               <br />
               meeting was called to order there were pre- 
               <br />
               sent forty persons and six boys all told. 
               <br />
               Another meeting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> held in Toronto J unc- 
               <br />
               tion, my own town, represented now by the 
               <br />
               hon. member for South York (Mr. W. F. 
               <br />
               Maclean). A requisition was presented <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               the mayor asking him to call a meeting to 
               <br />
               discuss this outrageous Autonomy Bill. The 
               <br />
               requisition was largely signed. All the min-

               isters of the town and other distinguished 
               <br />
               men were asked to address the meeting. In 
               <br />
               that town of 9,000 people, when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meeting</span> 
               <br />
               was opened at eight o’clock, there were only 
               <br />
               twenty-eight persons, by actual count, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre-</span> 
               <br />
               sent, and at no time during the whole meet-

               ing were there more than seventy-ﬁve or 
               <br />
               eighty persons in the hall. Then a few days 
               <br />
               ago we had a meeting called in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Stouﬁville,</span>

               in the adjoining constituency represented

               <br />
               stituency. I took a good deal of interest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:2</span> 
               <br />
               that meeting ; I was anxious to know what 
               <br />
               the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Stouﬂville</span> felt over this Bill. 
               <br />
               The meeting was widely advertised and was 
               <br />
               called by a number of the most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representa-</span>
