               that the argument brought forward for the

               the people in these new provinces, except

               <br />
               see on any ground why this distinction 
               <br />
               should be made. I fail to see why the new 
               <br />
               provinces should be deprived of the control 
               <br />
               of their own Crown lands. They have been 
               <br />
               given a sum of money in excess of what 
               <br />
               they would be entitled to according to popu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lation,</span> and they have been given this as a

               <br />
               lands and treating them as in that respect 
               <br />
               interior to the other provinces. Had we 
               <br />
               had a splendid administration by the De- 
               <br />
               partment of the Interior, had there been no

               <br />
               might be some argument why these new pro— 
               <br />
               vinces should not be allowed to administer 
               <br />
               their own lands, but in view of these scan— 
               <br />

               <br />
               out in favour of the government policy. 
               <br />
               Not only have the lands of this country 
               <br />
               been frittered away in the manner I have 
               <br />
               mentioned, but the timber has also been 
               <br />
               squandered in the same way, by being 
               <br />
               given largely to friends of the government 
               <br />

               charged. These lands are being retained 
               <br />
               for the purpose of being exploited by the 
               <br />
               friends of the hon. gentleman opposite. I 
               <br />
               ask again what is the policy of the govern- 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. I can tell the hon. gentle-

               say to the minister that if he makes the

               statement in this House with the idea of
