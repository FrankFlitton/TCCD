               Protestants and Catholics in this country,

               constitution of this country guaranteed sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools to the minority, there is no

               man in this House who would hold up his

               hands more readily than myself to support 
               <br />

               gressed, after the First Minister had taken 
               <br />

               <br />
               tion had made his address, I noticed that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance in his speech, took an 
               <br />

               <br />
               the First Minister said he was standing on 
               <br />
               the rock of the constitution, and took the

               ground that separate schools were guaran- 
               <br />
               teed to the minority of this country. If that 
               <br />
               were true, I would be prepared to support 
               <br />

               Mr. GUNN. I feel conﬁdent that the hon.

               gentleman would have made a ﬁrst-class 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior; but I have not a 
               <br />
               word to say against the hon. gentleman who 
               <br />
               at present occupies that position. I have 
               <br />
               every conﬁdence that he will administer the 
               <br />
               department satisfactorily, if the other min- 
               <br />
               isters allow him to. I have made these 
               <br />
               few remarks because I think that the pro-

               <br />

               would avail myself of that opportunity to

               let some of the people know what I have

               Mr. D. D. MCKENZIE. I regret that I

               When the hon. member for Leeds (Mr. Tay-

               lor) was addressing the House I thought that 
               <br />
               if he were aware of everything the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice said he would not have quoted 
               <br />
               him in any but a fair way; and I stated, 
               <br />
               when he had the ﬂoor, that I presumed he 
               <br />
               did not want to be unfair. Instead Of taking

               my interruption in the spirit in which it 
               <br />
