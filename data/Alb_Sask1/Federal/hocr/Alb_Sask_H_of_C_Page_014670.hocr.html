               legal aspect of the case, but I think this is 
               <br />
               not the best time for that, and besides that 
               <br />
               phase of it has been so well discussed by my 
               <br />

               <br />
               on that phase of the matter. I say that, if 
               <br />
               the minority are free to discuss this matter, 
               <br />
               then, the majority certainly have a right to

               present their views without being denounced

               say anything extravagant. But look at the

               not been accustomed to a system of separate

               schools and who will not willingly submit 
               <br />
               to separate schools. We have people com-

               I cannot forget at this moment that the policy 
               <br />
               which I have advocated and maintained all 
               <br />
               along has not been favourably received in all 
               <br />
               quarters. Not many weeks ago I was told from 
               <br />
               high quarters in the church to which I belong. 
               <br />
               that unless I supported the School Bill which 
               <br />
               was then being prepared by the government, 
               <br />
               and which we have now before us, I would in-

               cur the hostility ot a great and powerful body. 
               <br />
               Sir, this is too grave a phase or this question 
               <br />
               for me to pass <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘by</span> in silence. I have only this 
               <br />
               to say: even though I have threats held over 
               <br />
               me coming, as I am told, from high dignitaries 
               <br />
               in the church to which I belong, no word of 
               <br />
               bitterness shall ever pass my lips as against 
               <br />
               that church. 
               <br />

               Now, I will take the liberty, because it

               involves another point as well, of referring
