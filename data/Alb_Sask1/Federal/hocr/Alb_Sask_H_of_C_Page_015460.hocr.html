               This is a statement over the signature of 
               <br />
               the premier of Ontario that the government 
               <br />
               of Ontario had deposited with the govern- 
               <br />
               ment at Ottawa $2,848,000, and they so 
               <br />
               stated in their ﬁnancial statement to the 
               <br />
               people of Ontario at that time. Thus they 
               <br />
               were enabled, by the placing of that amount 
               <br />
               to the credit of Ontario, held by the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government in trust, to put before 
               <br />
               the electors of Ontario the statement that 
               <br />
               they had a surplus of money when the fact 
               <br />
               is they had no surplus. And then it was 
               <br />
               the great question of debate in the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture of Ontario for many years, and was a 
               <br />
               great question before the electors in that 
               <br />
               province. I believe that the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance, and particularly the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice, should be very careful now when 
               <br />
               they are legislating for the new provinces 
               <br />
               to remove altogether the word ‘interest,’ 
               <br />
               and make it so plain that the people of west— 
               <br />
               ern Canada will not be confronted with that 
               <br />
               question as the people of Ontario have been 
               <br />
               confronted with it for so many years.

               is simply a repetition of a calculation made 
               <br />
               by the Hon. Mr. Ross, in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario. He contended that he had a right 
               <br />
               to capitalize his interest at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3%</span> per cent 
               <br />
               when money was worth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3?;</span> per cent and 
               <br />
               showed a very much larger amount of cap- 
               <br />
               ital in the hands of the Dominion than he 
               <br />
               was actually entitled to in the ﬁrst instance, 
               <br />
               when in fact there was practically no 
               <br />
               capital. But in this instance we admit 
               <br />
               there is capital because there is interest and 
               <br />
               where there is smoke there is generally ﬁre, 
               <br />
               according to the old saying: where there 
               <br />
               is interest we consider there must be capital, 
               <br />
               there must be something behind it, what I

               will refer to the debates in this House to 
               <br />
               ascertain its meaning. We must make it 
               <br />
               clear and if we have not done so let us do 
               <br />
               so. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> since the hon. member from Peel 
               <br />
               (Mr. Blain) has also read the letter which 
               <br />
               I addressed to the Hon. Mr. Ross, whether 
               <br />
               that letter was wise or unwise, right or 
               <br />
               wrong, it was based on the language of 
               <br />
               the statute as it then existed. That is 
               <br />
               not the same language as we have here, and 
               <br />
               therefore we do not get any assistance by 
               <br />
               importng into the discussion that letter 
               <br />
               giving an opinion, possibly an erroneous one, 
               <br />
               based on the statute as it then existed. The 
               <br />
               statute here is in different terms and is 
               <br />
               designed for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dviﬂerent</span> purpose. If my 
               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. Henderson) ﬁnds, after 
               <br />
               he consults his legal friends, that this lan- 
               <br />
               guage fails to express the intention of the 
               <br />
               committee I have no desire to adhere to 
               <br />
               the words used.
