               <br />

               <br />

               Minister of Justice about. It would seem 
               <br />
               that ‘separate schools’ under the Act of 
               <br />
               1875 meant a very different thing from 
               <br />
               what we understand to—day by separate 
               <br />
               schools. At that time what was understood 
               <br />
               was a separate system of schools for the 
               <br />
               minority, whether Protestant or Catholic. 
               <br />
               What we understand by ‘ separate schools ’ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> is simply that the minority in a 
               <br />
               school district, whether Catholic or Protest- 
               <br />
               ant may establish a separate school, but, 
               <br />
               as a matter of fact, the teaching is all the 
               <br />
               same, whether in the public or in the sepa- 
               <br />
               rate school. 15 not that the case ? It seems 
               <br />
               to me that it is only by putting questions 
               <br />
               in this ‘way that we can properly discuss 
               <br />
               this question. When a question is put and 
               <br />
               answered, we hit the nail squarely on the 
               <br />
               head. It is far better than long discussions 
               <br />
               in which the members try each for him— 
               <br />
               self, to bring out all the points involved 
               <br />
               in this measure. My hon. friend from St. 
               <br />
               John city and county (IMr. Stockton) does 
               <br />
               not see any difference between section 16. 
               <br />
               No. 1. and section 16. No. 2. For my part 
               <br />
               I believe there is a difference, but it seems 
               <br />
               to me that the Minister of Justice has not 
               <br />
               stated the differenc plainly. I would like 
               <br />
               to get it from him, because, in this discus- 
               <br />
               sion it is to him we naturally look for light.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. My recollection is 
               <br />
               that the Act of 1875 was passed as a result 
               <br />
               of the agitation that grew up in Canada as 
               <br />
               a result of the New Brunswick school ques-

               <br />
               ﬁnitely, but that is my impression. I have 
               <br />
               endeavoured once or twice to make my 
               <br />
               meaning clear about the difference in these 
               <br />

               clude all the provisions of the Act of. 1875,
