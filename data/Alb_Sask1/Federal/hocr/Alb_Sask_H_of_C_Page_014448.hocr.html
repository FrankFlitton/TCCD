               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) admits that he has adopt-

               ed this policy simply as a matter of policy. 
               <br />
               But the only colour of reason he has assigned 
               <br />
               for it is that he fears lest, in the future, 
               <br />
               these new provinces may, through stress of 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial stringency, due to incurring debts

               <br />
               do away with the policy of free homesteads 
               <br />
               which, up to this time, has done so much 
               <br />
               to attract immigrants to our shores, and to 
               <br />
               place settlers on our western prairies. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, surely the people making their homes 
               <br />
               in the western part of the Dominion, and 
               <br />
               those whom they select to administer their 
               <br />
               affairs, would be at least as anxious to bring 
               <br />
               people to settle on these lands as would the 
               <br />
               government here at Ottawa ; and how much 
               <br />
               more careful are they likely to be of the

               government has shown itself to be in the

               and his colleagues have not conﬁdence in 
               <br />
               the ability of the western people to legislate 
               <br />
               for themselves. When the question of grant-

               ing autonomy to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> was up for 
               <br />
               discussion in parliament two or three years 
               <br />
               ago the Prime Minister and his then col- 
               <br />
               league, the ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sifton), took the ground that the people of 
               <br />
               the Territories were already in possession 
               <br />
               of practically complete powers of self-gov- 
               <br />
               ernment save the power to incur debt ; and 
               <br />
               they doubted the wisdom of granting them 
               <br />
               this power lest it might be utilized for un- 
               <br />
               wise and unnecessary purposes. Apparent- 
               <br />
               ly, that feeling has never entirely been 
               <br />
               overcome by these gentlemen, even to this 
               <br />
               day ; otherwise they would have proposed 
               <br />
               the granting of a full measure of autonomy 
               <br />
               to the people of the Territories, including 
               <br />
               the power to manage their own lands and 
               <br />
               control their educational system. TWO years 
               <br />
               ago, the Prime Minister expressed his dis- 
               <br />
               sent from the policy of granting autonomy 
               <br />
               for many years to come. But political 
               <br />
               exigencies forced him to abandon that 
               <br />
               position. In the midst of the last elec-

               tion campaign, it was suddenly brought 
               <br />
               to his memory—even in the turmoil 
               <br />
               and cares and worries of the occasion. 
               <br />
