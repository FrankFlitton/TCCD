               <br />
               clearly indicating that the legislators had in

               <br />
               autonomy. But the words are extremely 
               <br />
               general. They speak of the rights with res- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               rive at the conclusion that the moment a 
               <br />
               province is erected in the Northwest and 
               <br />
               that within the territorial limits of that pro- 
               <br />
               vince there exists a law passed by compe- 
               <br />
               tent authority securing certain rights to any 
               <br />
               class of persons with regard to denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools, those rights are preserved 
               <br />
               by the mere fact of that territory coming 
               <br />
               as a province within the limits of the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion. That is the opinion I have, and much 
               <br />
               of the conclusions at which I have arrived 
               <br />
               in respect of this question is the result of 
               <br />
               that opinion. My hon. friend from East 
               <br />
               Grey (Mr. Sproule) asks me if I consider 
               <br />
               the words ‘establish, constitute, coming in,’ 
               <br />
               to be all synonymous. My interpretation of 
               <br />
               section 2 of the Imperial Act of 1871 is that 
               <br />
               that Act clearly gives us the creative power. 
               <br />
               it enables us to d9cree the establishment of 
               <br />
               a province, to constitute it by deﬁning its 
               <br />
               limits and entering into other details which 
               <br />
               are absolutely necessary for the purpose of 
               <br />
               such creation, but the moment that act has 
               <br />
               been performed our power is exhausted and 
               <br />
               the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">province</span> comes under the control 
               <br />
               of the different clauses of the Act of 1867, 
               <br />
               and these clauses apply in their entirety to 
               <br />
               it. Will the House permit me to give an 
               <br />

               <br />
               the new Bill now submitted for second read- 
               <br />
               ing, we have gone entirely beyond our power 
               <br />
               as regards the lands. Why? Because 
               <br />
               under section 109 of the Confederation Act 
               <br />
               all lands, minerals, and royalties of every

               the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               upon section 199, to which I have referred, 
               <br />
               has always been favourable to the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. and has gone very far in the direc- 
               <br />
               tion of maintaining that all public lands, 
               <br />
               whatever may be the source of the owner- 
               <br />
               ship of the public lands, once the province 
               <br />
               is created. fall under provincial control. 
               <br />
               A case arose in the province of Quebec, the 
               <br />
               case of Fraser who died without leaving 
               <br />
               a will. and without heirs. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ollr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Belcourtl</span> is familiar with that case.
