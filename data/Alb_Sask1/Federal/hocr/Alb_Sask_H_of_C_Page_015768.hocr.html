               I am here supposed to be speaking before 
               <br />
               men of broad-mindedness, of men who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re«</span>

               perous, and these men are generally the

               best. When I mention these different pro-

               <br />
               the constitution as by the spirit of the men

               who wanted to create a great empire in this

               Promises were also made in the province

               for the Northwest Territories. Let us read

               some of the promises made in Manitoba. 
               <br />
               They call that a kind of compact which was 
               <br />
               made in 1870. There was at that time a 
               <br />
               legislative council in Manitoba and there 
               <br />
               was a strong rivalry between the French 
               <br />
               Canadians and the English Canadians. The 
               <br />
               ﬁght was carried on for a long time. As 
               <br />
               long as the Manitoba government was under

               justice were respected. The Liberal party 
               <br />
               wanted to get into power; they could not

               do it on their policy. they had none. any

               more there than anywhere else. They

               thought they would gain something by rais-
