               I have read that judgment and what I 
               <br />
               found i thought was this. that the Supreme

               <br />

               <br />

               provided for under clause 93 of the British

               North America Act. They decided secondly 
               <br />
               that denominational schools, as provided <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-</span> 
               <br />
               under subsection 1 of section 93 meant the

               cerned and as provided for by subsections 
               <br />
               2, 3 and 4, they meant Catholic schools on

               <br />
               I quote from the judgment:
