               If it be true as he said, that we have public 
               <br />
               schools in Canada, in which no religion is 
               <br />
               taught and separate schools where the tenets 
               <br />
               of the Roman Catholic church are taught, 
               <br />
               and that in the United States they have 
               <br />
               only public schools wherein no religion is 
               <br />
               taught; therefore the murders lynchings, 
               <br />
               and the divorces in the United States must 
               <br />
               be attributable to the Catholics of the United 
               <br />
               States, according to his logic. It could not 
               <br />
               be attributed to the Protestants because the 
               <br />
               system of education is the same for them 
               <br />
               in Canada as in the United States and the 
               <br />
               only possible argument that can be advanced 
               <br />
               is: Give us separate schools here because 
               <br />
               the tone of morals will then be so much 
               <br />
               higher that we will shine in comparison with 
               <br />
               our less blessed neighbours to the south. 
               <br />
               This logical conclusion is irresistible, yet 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen opposite showed their 
               <br />
               approval of this as one of the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister’s strongest arguments. The non. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman spoke of the obligation resting on us 
               <br />
               to maintain separate schools in the west <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be‘</span>

               cause they were given by legislation and 
               <br />
               pointed out that we here had given the Can- , 
               <br />
               adian Paciﬁc Railway a certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exemption!</span> 
               <br />
               from taxation and that nobody would think‘ 
               <br />
               of revoking that Act passed by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par-lite,</span> 
               <br />
               merit. I thought at the time the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman could hardly be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speaking"</span> 
               <br />
               seriously. Surely he must admit that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therel</span> 
               <br />
               is all the difference in the world between an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> 
               <br />
               ordinance passed by a legislature that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can‘</span> 
               <br />
               give one day and recall the next a solemn 
               <br />
               bargain between a country and a railway' 
               <br />
               company whereby in consideration of certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1</span> 
               <br />
               things done and promised by the country 
               <br />
               the company agrees to build a railroad. In 
               <br />
               one case there is a bargain and in the other 
               <br />
               there is no bargain. If these were a 
               <br />
               parallel—I do not think there is an 
               <br />
               exact one, but. if I were looking for 
               <br />
               one—I would ﬁnd it in the case of the Land 
               <br />
               Act of the Northwest Territories, whereby 
               <br />
               land was set aside for purposes of education 
               <br />
               and subsequently this House deliberately 
               <br />
               changed that to reserve the lands for the 
               <br />
               public schools, and from that day to this 
               <br />
               thousands and thousands of acres of land 
               <br />
               have been held in trust for the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               public schools. If any settlers went in 
               <br />
               under any inducement what would be a 
               <br />
               greater inducement than to come to a land 
               <br />
               where hundreds and thousands of acres were 
               <br />
               set aside solemnly by the Dominion parlia- 
               <br />
               ment for the aid of public schools? And 
               <br />
               yet the hon. gentleman does not hesitate 
               <br />
               to break that law and that trust by this 
               <br />
               Act ruthlessly to lay hands on the public 
               <br />
               lands and divide the proceeds between the 
               <br />
               public and the so-called separate schools. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Finance gave us an as- 
               <br />
               surance the other night that was certainly 
               <br />
               very gratifying when he told us there was 
               <br />
               no legal or binding obligation to re—enact the 
               <br />
               law of 1875. If there is no legal or binding 
               <br />
               obligation to re-enact that law, then we on

               described the absolute bliss that reigned 
               <br />
               there among those religious classes which

               a similarly happy condition of affairs pre-

               which we can admire without attempting to 
               <br />
               imitate, in one of the most glorious oratori-

               cal efforts ever given in this House while he 
               <br />
               proved that inasmuch as Nova Scotia and

               and free and prosperous without separate

               schools, therefore we ought to impose on the

               times wonder if there is not more in the Act 
               <br />
               than is stated by hon. gentlemen opposite? 
               <br />

               <br />
               Minister of Finance said—and far be it from 
               <br />

               <br />
               outside of the House, to doubt his word, 
               <br />

               <br />
               the paltry half-hour for religious instruction 
               <br />
