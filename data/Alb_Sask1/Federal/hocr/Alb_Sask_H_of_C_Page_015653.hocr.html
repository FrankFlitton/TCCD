               demands grave consideration at his hands-

               I have not heard and I cannot conceive of

               any reasons which would enable one to say 
               <br />
               that a distribution of that kind has even 
               <br />
               the most remote semblance of fairness— 
               <br />
               245.000 people to elect 23 representatives; 
               <br />
               5,000 to elect 2. The Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior has referred to the development of 
               <br />
               industries. Surely no one who knows any- 
               <br />
               thing of the province of Alberta will 
               <br />

               or any more industries in this district than 
               <br />
               in other districts. I am not suggesting that 
               <br />
               these things should be very much taken into 
               <br />
               consideration, but they were suggested this 
               <br />
               afternoon by the Minister of the Interior in 
               <br />
               his remarks. The basis of population must 
               <br />
               be the ultimate basis upon which to 
               <br />
               proceed. having, regard, of course to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cer‘</span>

               ing to give weight if necessary. He speaks 
               <br />
               of community of interest. Even assuming 
               <br />
               that the district referred to has a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comma-</span>

               <br />
               any way seeking to invade the principle 
               <br />
               which he invokes because our only sug— 
               <br />
               gestion is that this particular district in 
               <br />
               Alberta shall be entitled to one member, 
               <br />
               although, according to the information as 
               <br />
               to the population of the province that is 
               <br />

               <br />
               lation which would entitle it to a member—

               <br />

               <br />
               10,000. The government suggest that 5,000 
               <br />
               people in this district shall have two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem-</span> 
               <br />
               bers. We suggest one member, which is 
               <br />
               just double the representation which the 
               <br />
               population of that district would be entitled 
               <br />

               <br />
               sented to this House by the government. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Under</span> these conditions, how is it possible 
               <br />

               which I have arrived is that the only point

               whether the district of Athabaska should 
               <br />

               <br />
               that that would not prevent us from giving 
               <br />
               a fair and impartial judgment in a matter of 
               <br />
               this kind. I have heard the word geri -

               mander applied to this distribution, but in 
               <br />
               the sense of grouping sections of the popu-

               vantage to one political party, I am glad to 
               <br />
               say that after four days discussion that has 
               <br />
               not even been suggested. Unfortunately a 
               <br />
               quarrel has arisen out of the fact that there 
               <br />
               are two rival cities in the new province of 
               <br />
               Alberta and I take it that this extraneous 
               <br />
               circumstance has led to the discussion on 
               <br />
               this distribution. Unless I am greatly mis— 
               <br />
               taken, and I am in the judgment of those 
               <br />
               who have listened to the debate, if we had 
               <br />
               only Calgary and no Edmonton or Edmonton 
               <br />
               and no Calgary, no man in this House would 
               <br />
               grudge giving tw0 members to the district 
               <br />
               of Athabaska. This House has never re— 
               <br />
               fused representation to constituencies which 
               <br />
               were much smaller than others, when these 
               <br />
               constituencies were separated by distance, 
               <br />
               when they were new communities, or when 
               <br />

               ed the attention of the House to the fact 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> in 1871 Cariboo in British Columbia 
               <br />
               had a total population of 1.955, the number 
               <br />
               of voters being 359. and these 359 men in
