               <br />
               wanted to make the western province wide 
               <br />
               enough to take in all the ranches, he would 
               <br />
               have had to bring it down to the borders of

               Manitoba. In addition, let me say that, 
               <br />
               from my knowledge of the country, gained in 
               <br />
               the course of twenty-seven years’ residence 
               <br />
               there, during six years of which I was Com- 
               <br />
               missioner of Dominion Lands, the two new 
               <br />
               provinces are about as nearly equal as any 
               <br />
               one could wish, not only in area. but in their 
               <br />
               capacity for supporting population. To 
               <br />
               prove that, all I need say is this, that the 
               <br />
               different railway companies which had the 
               <br />
               right to select railway lands all over that 
               <br />
               country, have selected 13,000,000 of acres in 
               <br />
               the proposed province of Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               12,000,000 in the proposed province of Al— 
               <br />
               berta; and, from my own knowledge, I 
               <br />
               know they would have selected a good deal 
               <br />
               less in Saskatchewan and more in Alberta. 
               <br />
               were it not for the fact that there are more 
               <br />
               railways under construction in the new pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Saskatchewan than in its twin sister 
               <br />
               Alberta, so that the lands in the former, 
               <br />
               though in some respects not as good as in 
               <br />
               the latter, are on that account more saleable. 
               <br />
               In the two provinces. therefore, the area of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">graiirgrowing</span> land is about equal. In ad- 
               <br />
               dition. we must not lose sight of the fact 
               <br />
               that the province of Alberta has the greatest 
               <br />
               deposit of coal of any country in the world. 
               <br />
               I do not think that even British Columbia 
               <br />
               has as great coal deposits as are to be found 
               <br />
               in Alberta. Wherever you go into the Rocky 
               <br />
               mountains, from the American boundary 
               <br />
               right up to the Peace river pass, vast de- 
               <br />
               posits of coal have been discovered. Right 
               <br />
               in the Crow’s Nest pass there are seams of 
               <br />
               from ten to seventy feet in thickness of 
               <br />
               bituminous coal, and for hundreds of miles 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd large deposits of coal right up to 
               <br />
               Edmonton, the Peace river pass. so that out- 
               <br />
               side the agricultural wealth of that country, 
               <br />
               you will have in the years to come large 
               <br />
               settlements growing up all along the Rockies 
               <br />
               owing to the coal industries there. All 
               <br />
               along the Rockies, especially north of the 
               <br />
               main line of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, 
               <br />
               there are also thousands of miles of valuable 
               <br />
               spruce and ﬁr now beginning to be exploit-

               made up by its coal deposits and timber 
               <br />

               <br />
               not taking into consideration the great 
               <br />
               Peace river country. I do not know per- 
               <br />
               sonally what that country may be. I have 
               <br />
               heard reports good and bad about it ; but I 
               <br />
               want to say this, that after an experience 
               <br />
               of twenty-seven years, I have come to the 
               <br />
               conclusion that there is no one part of the 
               <br />
               Northwest, from the boundaries of Manitoba 
               <br />
               to the Rocky mountains, which does not turn 
               <br />
               out better than expected the more we learn 
               <br />
               about it. I have found that to be the invari- 
               <br />
               able result. In that district where I have 
               <br />
               lived many years, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«Moose</span> mountain coun- 
               <br />
               try, I remember ﬁfteen years ago the people 
               <br />
               of Manitoba said you could not grow any 
               <br />
               wheat, because it was too dry, yet there is 
               <br />
               no liner wheat-growing country in the Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories to-day. Why, in the ﬁrst few years 
               <br />
               of grain-growing around Regina, there was 
               <br />
               more wheat sown than was reaped, and yet 
               <br />
               there is to-day no ﬁner wheat country than 
               <br />
               the immense plain around that city. Only 
               <br />
               ten years ago, if I were asked myself if 
               <br />
               wheat could be grown in southern Alberta, 
               <br />
               I would have said no ; but what is the case 
               <br />
               to-day ? We have thousands and thousands 
               <br />
               of acres of the ﬁnest wheat-growing there 
               <br />
               every year. In fact, all over the country 
               <br />
               you will ﬁnd that the more you learn about 
               <br />
               it the better it turns out. There are vast 
               <br />
               stretches in the new province of Alberta 
               <br />
               which, a few years ago, were looked upon 
               <br />
               as suitable only for ranching, but which 
               <br />
               will be producing good crops of wheat every 
               <br />
               year within a very short period. In that 
               <br />
               whole country of Saskatchewan and Al- 
               <br />
               berta there is not an acre, generally speak- 
               <br />
               ing, which, if not adapted for wheat—grow- 
               <br />
               ing, is not good for cattle or the grazing of 
               <br />
               horses, so that there is practically not a 
               <br />
               waste acre in all that country. 
               <br />

               I should like to say a few‘words on the 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial question. That, I notice, is a mat- 
               <br />
               ter which has scarcely been touched by hon. 
               <br />
               members opposite, but which is neverthe- 
               <br />
               less of great importance to us in the Terri— 
               <br />
               tories. In my opinion, the government has 
               <br />
               started us out very fairly. In fact, the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Toronto (Mr. Foster) said 
               <br />
               that all the other provinces would be knock- 
               <br />
               ing at the door of the federal administration 
               <br />
               because of the good terms we had received. 
               <br />
               On that point I do not agree with him, be- 
               <br />
               cause, in my judgment, we are being given 
               <br />
               pretty much the same terms as were granted 
               <br />
               the other provinces. Each of our new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces is to get $50,000 for civil government. 
               <br />
               The province of Ontario gets $80,000, Quebec 
               <br />
               $70,000 and the lower provinces, with the 
               <br />
               exception of Prince Edward Island, get 
               <br />
               $50,000 each. So that I do not see any
