               Let me ask another question of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend. If there is one thing which ought 
               <br />
               to be held to be a right of the people of the 
               <br />
               province, it is that the French language 
               <br />
               should be used in the debates of the legis- 
               <br />
               lature and in the courts of justice. This 
               <br />
               proposition will not be denied, and in that 
               <br />
               respect the contention of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Monk) cannot be maintained unless he 
               <br />
               can base his claim upon the ground 01' con- 
               <br />
               stitutional right. True, he has attempted 
               <br />
               to do so, but he has failed in his attempt 
               <br />
               to show that the French people in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories can claim the right of the 
               <br />
               use of their language upon any authority 
               <br />
               in the British North America Act or upon 
               <br />
               any reasons which are to be found in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               history to which allusion has been made. 
               <br />
               If the French people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> can— 
               <br />
               not claim this right upon any constitutional 
               <br />
               ground, upon what ground can they claim 
               <br />
               it? It is perhaps worthy of remark <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               although the French language exists to—day 
               <br />
               as an ofﬁcial language in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories in the courts of law, if I am cor- 
               <br />
               rectly informed there has not been a single 
               <br />
               document in the French language entered in 
               <br />
               a court of justice there for the last ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               years. nor a single word of French spoken 
               <br />
               in the courts. That is not to be wondered 
               <br />
               at when we remember that to-day the popu- 
               <br />
               lation of French origin in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories is almost inﬁnitely small, not more 
               <br />
               than 4 per cent. If the French people in the 
               <br />
               Territories were in the same position to-day 
               <br />
               as they were in 1877 : if there were as many 
               <br />
               who speak the French language as there are 
               <br />
               who speak the English language, then I 
               <br />
               could understand my hon. friend arguing 
               <br />
               from the point of view of utility and senti- 
               <br />
               ment. But, if it be true that according to 
               <br />
               the last census there were altogether 200,000 
               <br />
               people in the Northwest Territories. and 
               <br />
               only 8,000 of them who spoke the French 
               <br />
               language. then I say it cannot be argued in 
               <br />
               the name of justice that they have the right 
               <br />
               to the ofﬁcial use of that language. For my 
               <br />
               part, proud as I am of my French origin, I 
               <br />
               could not claim in the name of justice and 
               <br />
               fair-play that right. in view of the fact that 
               <br />
               there is such a small proportion of French— 
               <br />
               speaking people in those Territories. In- 
               <br />
               deed. if we look at the statistics. there 
               <br />
               would be more justice for the French Qan- 
               <br />
               adians in the state of Massachusetts to 
               <br />
               claim the right to use their language in the 
               <br />
               legislature at Boston, because the number of 
               <br />
               French Canadians in Massachusetts is 
               <br />
               greater in proportion to the total population, 
               <br />
               than is the number of French-speaking peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the Northwest Territories to the total 
               <br />
               population there. In 1877 it was said that 
               <br />
               there were as many who spoke the French 
               <br />
               language as there were who spoke the 
               <br />
               English language in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. Thirty years after, in 1890, Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy proposed to abolish the
