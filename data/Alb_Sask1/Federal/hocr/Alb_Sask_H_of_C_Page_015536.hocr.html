               member knows and we all know that that 
               <br />
               district to-day is the home of a very large 
               <br />
               population, and that the vote actually cast 
               <br />
               is not a fair index of the total number of 
               <br />
               people. What has occurred there has oc- 
               <br />
               curred in other parts of the country; be- 
               <br />
               cause the hon. member has not seen it, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> 
               <br />
               cause he has not been told it, it does not 
               <br />
               follow that it is not so. It is a fact that 
               <br />
               our country has been growing in all its parts 
               <br />
               and not only in this or that part. In refer- 
               <br />
               ence to the southern part of the country I 
               <br />
               have some ﬁgures here that I think may 
               <br />
               bear upon the.question. One part of the 
               <br />
               country is valuable for one reason and an- 
               <br />
               other part for another reason. The south- 
               <br />
               ern country is valuable primarily as a ranch- 
               <br />
               ing country, and secondarily as a farm- 
               <br />
               ing country. A ranching country, in 
               <br />
               the nature of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things,</span> is not suited 
               <br />
               to dense settlement as is a farming 
               <br />
               country; that goes without saying and I 
               <br />
               suppose my hon. friend will not contend to 
               <br />
               the contrary. Since my 11011. friend has been 
               <br />
               digging into the records of the department 
               <br />
               I may also, and I notice that south of Red 
               <br />
               Dee1 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> me under grazing lands in that 
               <br />
               country one and a half million acres of land 
               <br />
               and that tl1e1e <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">haxe</span> been applied for in the 
               <br />
               department ﬁve and a half million acres of 
               <br />
               land suitable for grazing and thereby not 
               <br />
               supposedly suitable for farming.
