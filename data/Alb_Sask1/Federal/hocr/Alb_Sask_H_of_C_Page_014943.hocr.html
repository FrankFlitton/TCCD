               <br />
               stitution. I must apoligize right here. I 
               <br />
               have read law in the University of Laval,

               <br />
               course, my opinion may not amount to much,

               and see whether there might not be some

               good in it. The constitution says:

               fer by the Protestants. How is it that Mr. 
               <br />
               McGee asked that these exceptions should 
               <br />
               apply only to the two L‘anadas? How were 
               <br />
               the words left out of the ﬁrst subsec- 
               <br />
               tion? It at that time the intention had been 
               <br />
               that the effect of this clause should 
               <br />
               only apply to the two Canadas it was 
               <br />
               not necessary to leave it in that way. 
               <br />
               But let us take the constitution. In 
               <br />
               1867 what were the conditions in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba? Outside of Kildouan and Springﬁeld, 
               <br />
               north of the railway track to-day, they were 
               <br />
               all French and Roman Catholics. You had 
               <br />
               the settlement of Scotch half-breeds on this 
               <br />
               side of the Assipiboine river and you had 
               <br />
               on the other side of the river the parishes 
               <br />
               of St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vital,</span> St. Norbert, Ste. Agathe and St. 
               <br />
               John Baptiste; up the Seine river, Lorette 
               <br />
               and Ste. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anne;</span> up the Assiniboine, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">b‘t.</span> 
               <br />
               Charles, St. Francois Xavier and St. Eus- 
               <br />
               tache, all French Canadians, French half- 
               <br />
               breeds and Roman Catholics. Then, the 
               <br />
               limit 01' civilization seemed to be Portage 
               <br />
               la Prairie. The same conditions existed in 
               <br />
               the Northwest. You had Prince Albert, St. 
               <br />
               Albert and Battleford where the majority 
               <br />
               were French Canadians, French half-breeds 
               <br />
               and Roman Catholics. Is it not reasonable 
               <br />
               to suppose that these people who were so 
               <br />
               anxious to protect the rights of the Protest- 
               <br />
               ant minority iu the province of Quebec had 
               <br />
               the words dropped (two Canadas) so that 
               <br />
               the section might apply also to these ter- 
               <br />
               ritories which are coming into the union ? 
               <br />
               I think .it is only a fair supposition to make.

               Now, Sir, I am one of those who believe.
