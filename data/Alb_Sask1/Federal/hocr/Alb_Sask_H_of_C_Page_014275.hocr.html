               one deeply regret the defection of the 
               <br />
               ‘Globe’ on this question. I regret that it

               forgets what the policy of George Brown did 
               <br />
               for the Liberal party. The Toronto ‘Globe‘ 
               <br />
               should remember that the policy of George 
               <br />
               Brown on certain questions, kept the Liberal

               <br />
               tury. But I must say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> to the credit of 
               <br />
               the Toronto ‘Globe’: Though it fought the

               ment on the educational clauses of this Bill, 
               <br />
               it has made no wild appeals such as those 
               <br />
               made by my hon. friend from South York 
               <br />
               (Mr. W. F. Maclean) in his paper. The 
               <br />
               Toronto ‘Globe’ has discussed fairly the 
               <br />
               question from its own point of view. It 
               <br />
               has appealed to its own readers who belong 
               <br />
               to the school of George Brown, and it has 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loyally</span> severed its connection with the gov-

               Mr. SPROULE. If the hon. member will 
               <br />
               allow me to explain, I say I believe lt—not 
               <br />
               that they are driving them away offensively, 
               <br />
               by any means ; but here is the system that 
               <br />
               was represented to us: that whenever a 
               <br />
               farm was offered for sale, or a farmer was 
               <br />
               at all willing to sell, a French Canadian was 
               <br />
               prepared to buy.

               extend to me that courtesy which I always

               <br />
               dians were desirous of getting the farms 
               <br />
               at less than their value; but it was said

               that they were always ready to buy, and 
               <br />
