               These last words are sufﬁcient evidence of 
               <br />
               the fact that the .Catholic minority of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick might have appealed to the 
               <br />

               <br />
               were not true to their principles. I have 
               <br />
               the greatest respect for my dear, very dear

               are entitled to' by the constitution, refrain-

               favours which an appeal to judicial authori- 
               <br />
               ties would at once eliminate after a useless 
               <br />
               excitement of feelings. As a member of 
               <br />
               the minority in New Brunswick, I must 
               <br />
               say that we have had to make a ﬁght

               to gain and hold the position that we 
               <br />
               now have. We made that ﬁght paciﬁ- 
               <br />
               cally, but we made it advantageously. I 
               <br />
               feel deeply grieved that the French and 
               <br />
               Catholic minority in the Northwest, which 
               <br />
               is as dear to _me as to any one. will not be 
               <br />
               given by the constitution all the privileges 
               <br />
               that I would like to see them enjoy. But, 
               <br />
               Mr. Chairman, I do not despair for all that 
               <br />
               of the Catholic minority and the French 
               <br />
               population in the Northwest. It is no more 
               <br />
               necessary for them to despair than it was

               for us of the New Brunswick minority to

               Brunswick are an example and should be 
               <br />
               an inspiration for the minority in Manitoba

               of the minority in New Brunswick have had 
               <br />
               to work our own case. We are working it 
               <br />
               out, slowly perhaps, but surely, and during 
               <br />
               the last twenty years the French Acadian

               As I have said, we have occasionally had 
               <br />
               statesmen in our province who understood 
               <br />
               the rights of minorities, and who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span>

               stood that it was the duty of the rulers of

               a country so to legislate that every child in

               <br />

               sure that it is with great regret that the

               <br />

               <br />
               triots in the west a greater measure of pri-

               vileges, which might place them on a better 
               <br />
               footing. But we are to-day compelled to 
               <br />
               take the position—I would not call it a hu- 
               <br />
               miliating position, but a constitutional p0- 
               <br />
               sition—that we cannot grant to our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">c0&lt;reli-</span> 
               <br />
               gionists all the privileges that we would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               sire to give them. In the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick we enjoy certain privileges which 
               <br />
               the judges of the Supreme Court of our 
               <br />
               province considered not to have been granted 
               <br />
               by the law of the province and said privi- 
               <br />
               leges were maintained by the court. The 
               <br />
               constitution today can only grant such rights 
               <br />
               and privileges as are possessed by minori- 
               <br />
               ties, Oatholic or Protestant, by the law of 
               <br />
               the country. That was the consideration 
               <br />
               upon which the judges of the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               of New Brunswick based their judgment.
