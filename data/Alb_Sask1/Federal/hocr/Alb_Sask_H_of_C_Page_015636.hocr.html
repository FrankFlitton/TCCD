               the population shown by the census of 1901,

               he has placed before the House show that 
               <br />
               there are more people in the south than in

               <br />
               The ﬁgures show that in 23 constituencies 
               <br />
               in the old district of Athabaska there were, 
               <br />
               in 1901, 09,441 people. Now, take off the

               constituency of Red Deer which, for the pur— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Dividing that population by 22 constituen-
