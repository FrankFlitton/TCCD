               It is contended that immigrants coming 
               <br />
               to settle in the Northwest Territories have 
               <br />
               been inﬂuenced in favour of this country 
               <br />
               by the knowledge that there were separate

               <br />

               <br />

               to look up the immigration literature issued 
               <br />

               <br />
               there was anything to justify that state-
