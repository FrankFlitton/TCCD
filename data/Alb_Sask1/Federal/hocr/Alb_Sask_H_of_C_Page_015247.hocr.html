               Great Britain to seek freedom and the 
               <br />
               privilege of worshipping God in their own 
               <br />
               way. These people came out and 
               <br />
               laid the foundation of that great republic. 
               <br />
               To-day we are growing faster in the North- 
               <br />
               west than we have been doing in the past, 
               <br />
               I question very much if the Department 
               <br />
               of the interior, of whose wise adminis- 
               <br />
               tration we have heard so much, is exercis- 
               <br />
               ing the care and wisdom which it should 
               <br />
               exercise in the settlement of that coun- 
               <br />
               try. I think it would be better if we 
               <br />
               selected our settlers a little more carefully. 
               <br />
               I think these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.lands</span> should be worth some- 
               <br />
               thing to the settler coming in. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Muskoka (Mr. W'right) has 
               <br />
               stated that a Canadian has not the same 
               <br />
               advantages going in there as a man com- 
               <br />
               ing from a foreign country. ‘If that is 
               <br />
               so it is a condition which should be recti— 
               <br />
               ﬁed. Why should not the son of the Can- 
               <br />
               adian farmer receive as good treatment 
               <br />
               as the man coming from the old country? 
               <br />
               I cannot understand that. It strikes me 
               <br />
               as a strange thing that a Canadian is not 
               <br />
               receiving as good treatment as one'who 
               <br />
               comes from a foreign land. Many of On- 
               <br />
               tario’s best sons have gone to the North- 
               <br />
               west. Thousands and thousands have gene 
               <br />
               from Ontario and those are the kind of 
               <br />
               men we want in the Northwest. I com- 
               <br />
               mend to my hon. friend the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior this matter and I would ask 
               <br />
               him to see to it that the right kind of set- 
               <br />
               tlers go into that country. Do not be in 
               <br />
               too great a hurry to giVe away these lands. 
               <br />
               I understand that he says that we can make 
               <br />
               money out of giving them away, but I 
               <br />
               think it will he very ditﬁcult for him to 
               <br />
               prove that we can make more by giving 
               <br />
               away these lands. I understand his argu- 
               <br />
               ment is that we can make more money by 
               <br />
               giving away these lands than by oﬂ'ering 
               <br />
               them for sale. He tells us that the coal 
               <br />
               lands are no good because there is no 
               <br />
               market for the coal. The same argument 
               <br />
               might apply to Wheat, or to any other pro- 
               <br />
               duct of the Northwest. It'is a matter of 
               <br />
               transportation. That coal is worth money 
               <br />
               if we can ﬁnd a market. It is only a mat- 
               <br />
               ter of transportation. If we could not

               <br />
               I think it is their part to succeed to that

               minister these lands as well as they are 
               <br />

               <br />
               are well administered. From the remarks

               that have been made by the Minister of

               as much to this country as they should

               5,000 to-day. Settlers are going in there 
               <br />
               in large numbers and if these Crown lands

               <br />

               a large settlement. If there was anything 
               <br />
               wrong about the administration of these 
               <br />
               lands the ﬁfty representatives that are 
               <br />
               going to represent the people of these two 
               <br />
               new provinces in their local assembly, being 
               <br />
               the people on the spot, could deal wisely 
               <br />
               and promptly with the conditions arising 
               <br />
               in connection with these lands if they were 
               <br />
               placed under their control. II was not 
               <br />
               in the House this afternoon when the hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance introduced some am- 
               <br />
               endments. I have just had an opportunity 
               <br />
               of seeing them casually. They may be in 
               <br />
               the right direction and I think that per- 
               <br />
               haps some of them are, but it did occur 
               <br />
               to me that the administration of these 
               <br />
               lands should be placed in the hands of the 
               <br />
               provinces and that the cash subsidy, not 
               <br />
               only in justice to the rights of the other 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> but in the best interests of these 
               <br />
               new provinces themselves, should be cut 
               <br />
               down to about the same ﬁgure as that 
               <br />
               which the older provinces are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receiving.</span> 
               <br />
               I do not see any good reason why that 
               <br />
               should not be done and I think that would 
               <br />
               be approved of by the country as a whole, 
               <br />
               because the cash subsidy is to be paid out 
               <br />
               of the pockets of the people of the whole 
               <br />
               Dominion. I think it would be advisable 
               <br />
               to revise the language of this clause and 
               <br />
               give the public lands to the provinces to 
               <br />
               which they really belong, thus pursuing the 
               <br />
               policy that has prevailed in this country 
               <br />
               ever since it was a country that the Crowu 
               <br />
               lands shall belong to the various provinces 
               <br />
               of the Dominion and that the cash subsidy 
               <br />
               should be the‘ same to these new provinces 
               <br />
               as it is to the provinces of the older parts 
               <br />
               of the Dominion.
