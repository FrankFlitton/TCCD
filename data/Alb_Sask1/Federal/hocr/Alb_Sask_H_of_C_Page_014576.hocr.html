               personally. and to dispute a statement which

               had appeared in the newspapers on a pre-

               finds himself attacked in a newspaper in a

               general rule that when a member of the

               <br />

               hon. friend to dispute that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rule.</span> But to- 
               <br />
               day my hon. friend has thought it advis-

               able. for reasons of his own. to bring up a 
               <br />
               matter which is essentially controversial, 
               <br />
               because it implies a censure by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> 
               <br />
               and. therefore, I would have expected that

               the usual courtesy would have been extend-

               last we had no information, no ofﬁcial in- 
               <br />
               formation, of the intention of Manitoba to 
               <br />
               make an application for an extension of her 
               <br />
               boundaries. Why did I do that ? My hon. 
               <br />
               friend, for a reason, explained the alleged 
               <br />
               interview which was said to have taken 
               <br />
               place between Mr. Rogers, Mr. Campbell 
               <br />
               and the Apostolic delegate. In that inter— 
               <br />
               view Monseigneur Sbarretti was reported 
               <br />
               to have said that it would facilitate matters 
               <br />
               if these gentlemen would consent to the res- 
               <br />
               toration of separate schools in Manitoba, 
               <br />
               and that if that had been done before it 
               <br />
               would have. facilitated the extension of their 
               <br />
               boundaries towards the west. \Vell, Sir, I 
               <br />
               stated that 1 could hardly believe that His 
               <br />
               Excellency could have used such language, 
               <br />
               because then and there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.’Rogers</span> would 
               <br />
               have answered. and could have answered to 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Apostolic</span> delegate that there never had 
               <br />
               been by the government of Manitoba any

               <br />

               <br />
               such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">language</span> in the presence of Mr. Rogers. 
               <br />
               Now to-day we have the conﬁrmation of my 
               <br />
               opinion that Monseigneur Sbarretti had 
               <br />
               never spoken in that way to Mr. Rogers. for 
               <br />
               the very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> and obvious reason that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mons</span> 
               <br />
               eigneur Sbarretti never saw Mr. Rogers. 
               <br />
               There are many things in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interview</span> 
               <br />
               published by Mr. Rogers which turn out 
               <br />
               to be not altogether according to the facts. 
               <br />
               You have the impression from the interview 
               <br />
               which was published yesterday, that the 
               <br />
               Apostolic delegate had sent an invitation to 
               <br />
               the delegates of the Manitoba government 
               <br />
               who were in Ottawa. to discuss with him 
               <br />
               this question of the extension of the boun- 
               <br />
               daries of the province of Manitoba. Is that 
               <br />
               according to the facts as we know them 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today?</span> No, Sir, we find that the invita-

               <br />
               all extended to the delegates of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment of Manitoba, he says he never knew 
               <br />
               Mr. Rogers; but the invitation was ex- 
               <br />
               tended, not to the delegates. but to Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell whom he know before, and whom 
               <br />
               he treated as a friend. It is a very differ-
