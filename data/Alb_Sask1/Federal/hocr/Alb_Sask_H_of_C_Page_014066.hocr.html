               from past experience, my hon. friend will 
               <br />
               think it important to know in advance what

               <br />
               when it shall come to the second reading. 
               <br />
               I presume—and in so presuming, I think I 
               <br />
               do not state anything that is not in accord-

               <br />
               rue—and I have reason to believe, that he 
               <br />
               is preparing some batteries to attack this 
               <br />
               Bill; and, perhaps it is important for him 
               <br />
               to know at this time whether he should 
               <br />
               place his batteries on a certain hill or place 
               <br />
               them on another hill. I can understand 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend is anxious to know whe- 
               <br />
               ther or not the Bill is to be as it is. If there 
               <br />
               are to be other provisions, as a matter of 
               <br />
               tactics he would like to be in a position to

               judge whether his batteries should be placed 
               <br />
               in one place or in another. But I can hardly

               give myself the pleasure of coming to the

               at all answered the question which I put to 
               <br />
               him, namely: Why did he so far violate

               constitutional usage as to bring down a Bill 
               <br />

               <br />
               had not been consulted in regard to it. That

               <br />
               only has he got rid of one minister, but he

               intends to go on with this question without 
               <br />
               calling to his cabinet a new Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior. Apparently, he does not care to 
               <br />
               consult the opinion of the west in regard to 
               <br />
               these things. But surely the west is worth 
               <br />
               consulting. Surely the new provinces of 
               <br />
               the west are just as well entitled to be 
               <br />
               consulted in this matter as are some other 
               <br />
               provinces. But every stage of the right

               hon. gentleman’s conduct is on unconstitu- 
               <br />
               tional lines. I think the Prime Minister is 
               <br />
               constitutionally bound to tell us whether 
               <br />
               one of his colleagues had not objections to 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial phase of the Bill that has been 
               <br />
               brought before the House. We are sup- 
               <br />
               posed to have a Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               especially charged with the affairs of the 
               <br />
               west. We have a Minister of Finance who 
               <br />
               is especially responsible for the ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               program of the government. Yet we have 
               <br />
               this autonomy measure involving grave 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial charges, and giving reason to all 
               <br />
               the other provinces for demanding better 
               <br />
               terms, and the Finance Minister (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fielding) so far as we can gather, has not 
               <br />
               even been consulted. as the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior was not consulted. Where are we 
               <br />
               to end. if these things continue ? And let 
               <br />
               us refer to another minister. I spoke of this 
               <br />
               matter the other day, but it should be men- 
               <br />
               tion-ed in this connection also. We have a 
               <br />
               gentleman acting as Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works who is putting through estimates 
               <br />
               for $10,000,000, and will probably have sup- 
               <br />
               plementary estimates for $3,000,000 more. 
               <br />
               The amount will depend on the political ex— 
               <br />
               igencies of hon. gentlemen opposite. Last 
               <br />
               session this gentleman was in the same 
               <br />
               unconstitutional position, and then put 
               <br />
               through estimates of about $10,000,000. And 
               <br />
               yet this unconstitutional method is to be 
               <br />
               continued, and when explanations are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">askv</span> 
               <br />
               ed none are forthcoming. There are more 
               <br />
               governments in trouble than this one. If 
               <br />
               you read the papers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> you see that 
               <br />
               nearly every government in Europe is in 
               <br />
               trouble for some reason. But there is a 
               <br />
               cure; there is a solvent for these difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties; and that is to consult the people. If 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Lau- 
               <br />
               rier) believes in the principle professed by 
               <br />
               his party, he will not carry on the nego- 
               <br />
               tiations that are now going on in the way 
               <br />
               of ﬁghts and bickerings in his own cabinet, 
               <br />
               but he will do the constitutional thing and 
               <br />
               go back to the country and submit this ques— 
               <br />
               tion to the people. He has confessed to-day 
               <br />
               that he is afraid to open the constituency 
               <br />
               of London, in Ontario ; he is afraid to open 
               <br />
               a constituency in Manitoba, and bring in a
