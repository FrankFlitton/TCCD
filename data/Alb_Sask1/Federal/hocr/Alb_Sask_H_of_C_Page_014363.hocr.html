               impress the House with the idea that we 
               <br />
               have virtually national schools in the North-

               word. I need not read what he said be 
               <br />
               cause what he said has been repeated in 
               <br />
               some other places and it is already in ‘Han-

               sard.’ My hon. friend the Minister of Fi- 
               <br />
               nance said one thing which I commend to

               <br />
               that in keeping that national school system 
               <br />
               we have to allow a half hour for religious 
               <br />
               instruction because we have moral obliga-

               tions towards the minority. That is right. 
               <br />
               I believe that to be the case but in such a 
               <br />
               matter as that I would go a great deal 
               <br />
               farther than the law. In a country like

               this we cannot have too much tolerance
