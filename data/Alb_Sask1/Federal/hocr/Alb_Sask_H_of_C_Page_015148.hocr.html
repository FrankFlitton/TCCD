               <br />
               taken that line in this debate, but there are

               some gentlemen who have seemed unable

               -to make allowance for honest difference of

               has been some relief to us. that of those

               Perhaps we might naturally have expected 
               <br />
               to ﬁnd them. If we had heard some such 
               <br />
               remarks from hon. gentlemen from that 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">excuse</span> for them treating the matter 
               <br />
               somewhat hotly from their point of View. 
               <br />
               But these remarks have been rather from 
               <br />
               the members from other provinces, and I 
               <br />
               have noticed that they have come from some 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the other side of the House 
               <br />

               we might have expected that they would

               have been inclined to be silent on such a 
               <br />

               I do not propose, Mr. Speaker, to discuss 
               <br />
               the question of religious education. If I 
               <br />
               did so I should be disposed to deal with it 
               <br />
               not as a question of creed or race. I do not 
               <br />
               see why it should be a question of creed. 
               <br />
               The feeling in favour of religious education 
               <br />
               in the schools is not conﬁned to any one 
               <br />
               church. In the Church of England, espe- 
               <br />
               cially in the old land, there is a very strong 
               <br />
               feeling in favour of religious education; I 
               <br />
               venture to say there is quite as earnest and 
               <br />
               strong a feeling on that subject among the 
               <br />
               clergy of the Church of England as there 
               <br />
               is on the part of the clergy of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic Church. There is surely a great 
               <br />
               deal to he said in favour of it. Is there 
               <br />
               anybody who will deny that even in this 
               <br />
               prosperous land and in perhaps every pro- 
               <br />
               vince of it. there are thousands upon thou- 
               <br />
               sands of parents utterly incompetent and 
               <br />
               unﬁt to give to their children teaching in 
               <br />
               the most rudimentary elements of Christ- 
               <br />
               ianity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'9</span> There are many parents who 
               <br />
               are utterly indifferent to religion, and 
               <br />
               there are others whose <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unfortunate</span> 
               <br />
               circumstances prevent them doing what 
               <br />
               otherwise they might be willing to 
               <br />
               do. Well, Sir. sometimes we hear 
               <br />
               as regards the children of these parents, 
               <br />
               the rather light remark: Why not send 
               <br />
               them to the Sunday schools. But the 
               <br />

               In my opinion the question of religious 
               <br />
               education or separate schools is not at all 
               <br />
               for this parliament: the question lies, in my 
               <br />
               judgment, solely with the people of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces who are immediately concerned. 
               <br />
               Moreover. I agree fully with the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for South Toronto, when he said that 
               <br />
               it is in the true and lasting interests of the 
               <br />
               minority that the matter should be left to 
               <br />
               the people of the new provinces. I believe 
               <br />
               that separate schools should exist by force 
               <br />
               of law only when that law emanates from 
               <br />
               the people among whom it is to be enforced. 
               <br />
               If the people themselves grant the right, 
               <br />
               let it be so and let the privilege be main- 
               <br />
               tained. But if this parliament should im- 
               <br />
               pose such schools on the provinces, it is 
               <br />
               in human nature to resist and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obstruct.</span> 
               <br />
               and you will ﬁnd that that which a free

               man will give of his own accord he will
