               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Very good. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">111911</span> I understand that the position taken 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> R. L. Borden) is 
               <br />
               that the provinces come in with their legis- 
               <br />
               lative authority, with their school legisla- 
               <br />
               tion, and that we are bound by the consti- 
               <br />
               tution to apply that school system. That is 
               <br />
               all my theory; I never went further than 
               <br />
               that. We are bound to apply the system 
               <br />
               which is now in force, the only difﬁculty 
               <br />
               that there is now will be to ascertain what 
               <br />
               is the system in force in the Territories 
               <br />
               which we are going to make into provinces. 
               <br />
               But. Sir, although my hon. friend to-day 
               <br />
               takes a position which is somewhat ambi- 
               <br />
               guous, for my part I take the grouud that 
               <br />
               we are bound constitutionally at this table 
               <br />
               to insert <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leeislative</span> provisions which will 
               <br />
               make the system of schools which exists in 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories to—day absolute 
               <br />
               and beyond the purview and the powers of 
               <br />
               the legislature. That is to say, we are 
               <br />
               bound to apply the principles of the consti— 
               <br />

               <br />
               a school law for the Territories, it did not
