               <br />

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. There have

               to say that one is highly preferable to an-

               Mr. Haultain. were of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinion—an</span>

               boundary line should be about seventy miles 
               <br />
               east of the fourth meridian. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">evainister</span> of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) 
               <br />
               was of opinion that the boundary should be 
               <br />
               one or two townships further east. I do not 
               <br />
               know that that hon. gentleman had any par- 
               <br />
               ticular reason for wishing it one way or the 
               <br />
               other, he was not much concerned whether it 
               <br />
               was the fourth meridan or a little eastward 
               <br />
               of that. The great bone of contenrtion was 
               <br />
               the boundary which was suggested by Mr. 
               <br />
               Haultain. and, I think, by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Alberta (Mr. Herron). The argument 
               <br />
               was that if the boundary were ﬁxed seventy 
               <br />
               miles eastward of the fourthmeridan. all 
               <br />
               the ranching country would be in Alberta.

               <br />
               satisfy myself that this was the case. I 
               <br />
               think that if the boundary were so ﬁxed 
               <br />

               <br />
               reason which led to the adoption of the 
               <br />
               fourth meridian as the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boundxaray</span> was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it 
               <br />
               would be a line much more easily identiﬁed.

               Sifton) and the fourth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meridian</span> line there 
               <br />
               would not be much difference. We chose 
               <br />
               the meridan because it is far easier to 
               <br />
               identify, as I imagine, and' because, as i 
               <br />

               amongst members from the Northwest Ter-

               out that the division of the country at the

               have read to the House on two occasions.

               a very little further east, practically all the

               he does not give all the facts, the statement 
               <br />
               is apt to lead to a wrong conclusion. We 
               <br />
               were told by the hon. member for East 
               <br />
               Assiniboia (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">TurriﬁE)—I</span> think it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wasithat</span> 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman—that the ranching country 
               <br />
               extended right down to Manitoba. If he 
               <br />
               will look, or if hon. gentlemen who are inter- 
               <br />
               ested -in the question, would look, at a map 
               <br />
               published by the Department of the Interior 
               <br />
               a few years ago, they will ﬁnd the ranching 
               <br />
               country outlined. If the boundary line were 
               <br />
               moved east say as far as the eighth range 
               <br />
               west of the third meridian, it would practi- 
               <br />
               cally take in all the ranching country. If 
               <br />
               the following of the line would make a 
               <br />
               noticeable diiference in the area of the two 
               <br />
               provinces that could be easily avoided by 
               <br />
               following that line north to the South Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan river and along the South Sas- 
               <br />
               katchewan west to range 20, and then north 
               <br />
               as originally proposed. If that were done 
               <br />
               the difﬁculty of dividing the ranching coun- 
               <br />
               try in two would be practically overcome, if 
               <br />
               the map issued by the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior. to which I have reference, is cor-
