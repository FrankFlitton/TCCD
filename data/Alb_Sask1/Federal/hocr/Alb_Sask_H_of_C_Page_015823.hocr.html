               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. If the government 
               <br />
               intend that, well and good; but I thought 
               <br />
               the intention was to limit the powers of 
               <br />
               the provincial legislature so far as the 
               <br />
               minority is concerned. If you are going 
               <br />
               further, limiting the power of the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture so far as the Protestant majority in 
               <br />
               any particular district is concerned, then 
               <br />
               I think you are going beyond any argument 
               <br />
               advanced by the government in support of 
               <br />
               this resolution. You started in the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place by protecting the minority. whether 
               <br />
               Protestant or Catholic, in every school dis- 
               <br />
               trict. You go beyond that now for the pur- 
               <br />
               pose of protecting, as I understand, the 
               <br />
               Catholic majority in any particular school 
               <br />
               district, but you do not, by any argument 
               <br />
               hitherto advanced, have any reason for 
               <br />
               limiting the power of the provincial legis- 
               <br />
               lature beyond that. You do limit it beyond 
               <br />
               that. because you prevent the provincial 
               <br />
               legislature from dealing with religious in-

               <br />
               are in the majority. That power must for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever</span> be in the trustees, although it may be

               the opinion of the vast majority of the

               people of that province that that power 
               <br />

               Mr. LAMONT. So far as the amend- 
               <br />
               ment I had the honour to move is concerned, 
               <br />
               my object is to continue the present law to 
               <br />
               the public schools, Protestant as well as 
               <br />
               Catholic. I want the school law of the new 
               <br />
               provinces to contain a provision that for all 
               <br />
               time to come there shall be granted to each 
               <br />
               school district the right to have religious 
               <br />
               instruction in that school district if they 
               <br />
               think tit, and that applies to Protestants as 
               <br />
               well as to Catholics. There are some 150 
               <br />
               Catholic schools to some 1,050 Protestant 
               <br />
               public schools, and that provision I believe 
               <br />
               to be a wise one to apply to all schools 
               <br />
               and not only to one class of schools. I 
               <br />
               am satisﬁed that at the present time the 
               <br />
               legislature would not change it, but the 250,- 
               <br />
               000 people who now constitute the estima— 
               <br />
               ted population of each of these two pro- 
               <br />
               vinces will be but a small percentage of the 
               <br />
               millions who will ﬁnd homes on our prairies, 
               <br />
               and it may be that future legislatures, elect— 
               <br />
               ed by the immigrants from all quarters of the 
               <br />
               world may not be of the opinion that the 
               <br />
               inculcatiou of 1eligious and moral plin- 
               <br />
               ciples in the schools is necessary to the wel- 
               <br />
               fare of the state, and if not this amend— 
               <br />
               ment is desirable. I am satisﬁed that it 
               <br />
               is a wise provision to leave in the hands of 
               <br />
               the trustees. Protestant or Catholic, I do not 
               <br />
               care which they are. the right to give the 
               <br />
               children of that school section religious in- 
               <br />
               struction if they desire from 3.30 o’clock to 
               <br />
               4 o’clock. That is all the amendment 
               <br />
               covers. That is what it was intended to 
               <br />
               cover; if it does not cover that, I hope it 
               <br />
               will be made to do so.

               Mr. INGRAM. I want to understand this, 
               <br />
               too. As I gather, our hon. friends from the 
               <br />
               Northwest are opposed to any interference 
               <br />
               With the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$611001</span> system 0f the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories. and they desire the matter of 
               <br />
               education to be left entirely in the hands 
               <br />
               of the local legislature. I understood the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman from Saskatchewan (Mr. La- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mont)</span> to say that he is in favour of the 
               <br />
               present school system in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. He is in favour of perpetuating 
               <br />
               public and separate schools for all time to 
               <br />
               That is his position, and he also
