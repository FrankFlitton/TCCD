               It is impossible for an Ontario man to 
               <br />
               understand the condition of things perhaps 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. We ﬁnd there a

               very large majority voting for the First 
               <br />

               <br />
               turned his own compatriots down in the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba. Here are three 
               <br />
               ﬁngers. The ﬁrst represents religion, the 
               <br />
               second language and the third nationality. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman ﬁnds that the two 
               <br />
               representing language and nationality are 
               <br />
               more sacred than the other one. But where

               <br />
               just got the little ﬁnger, religion, and the 
               <br />
               others have the other two. We ﬁnd right 
               <br />
               here in Hintonburg that the English Catholic 
               <br />
               has diﬁiculty in getting his full rights in the 
               <br />
               minority schools. Why ? Because the French 
               <br />
               majority say : You must learn in the French 
               <br />
               tongue. We ﬁnd the same difﬁculty in Mon— 
               <br />
               treal. and it is high time that somebody 
               <br />
               should speak up for the Irishman, who I 
               <br />
               think has as good a right as anybody to have 
               <br />
               his views <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respected,</span> But his rights are 
               <br />
               overlooked in the great cry of religion.

               nationality and language in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. I say that the man in that prov-

               ince who has only his religion ought to 
               <br />
               have some consideration as well as the man 
               <br />
               who has besides the other two ﬁngers, 
               <br />
               language and nationality. Give this man 
               <br />

               <br />
               every man. Whether he thinks as I do or 
               <br />
               not is his own business, not mine. All I

               <br />
               be careful about making mistakes that will 
               <br />
               affect the future. In 1896, I said to my peo- 
               <br />
               ple : There is a grievance, because an agree- 
               <br />
               ment with the Manitoba people has been 
               <br />
               broken. And I took the responsibility of 
               <br />
               that issue. I met the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) speaking against me, I 
               <br />
               met Mr. Dalton McCarthy, I met Mr. N. 
               <br />
               Clarke Wallace. I met Sir Richard Cart- 
               <br />
               wright, all speaking against me. And you 
               <br />
               talk about the tolerance of Ontario. But let 
               <br />
               me tell you that, in that strong Protestant 
               <br />
               riding I was elected on that issue in spite 
               <br />
               of the opposition of all these gentlemen. 
               <br />
               But one thing I thought I might have been 
               <br />
               spared. When-I was willing to take my 
               <br />
               political life in my hand, in defence of the 
               <br />
               minority of Manitoba, I thought I might 
               <br />
               have been spared the active, personal oppo- 
               <br />
               sition in my county of the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               who is now Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier). But, the hon. gentleman’s visit 
               <br />
               did no harm. This question is one in which 
               <br />
               the people have a living interest. It is a 
               <br />
               great pity that any question of religion 
               <br />
               should intervene in political affairs. But 
               <br />
               sincere men on either side can respect their 
               <br />
               sincere opponents. I will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">never'lind</span> fault 
               <br />
               with any Roman Catholic for supporting his 
               <br />
               religion; all I ask is that whether a man is 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic or whatever may be in his 
               <br />
               religion. he shall be sincere. The man who 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">net</span> sincere is not of much use. I regret 
               <br />
               deeply that these questions should be again 
               <br />
               forced to the front of our political discussion. 
               <br />
               If you ask a man who is advocating separ-

               ate schools whether a school trustee is an 
               <br />

               <br />
               he tell you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2'</span> Some will tell you that he is 
               <br />
               an ofﬁcer of the church, others that he is an 
               <br />
               oﬂicer of the state. It has come to the point 
               <br />
               where the people resent the encroachments 
               <br />
               of the church, whether Protestant or Catho- 
               <br />
               lic. This question of separate schools was a 
               <br />
               burning one in Ontario for years. When the 
               <br />
               question of the clergy reserves was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">settled,</span> 
               <br />
               in the very Bill in which that settlement 
               <br />
               was embodied, was a clause declaring that 
               <br />
               this Bill was to do away with all possibility 
               <br />
               of connection between church and state. 
               <br />
               And the people thought they were done with 
               <br />
               these questions. And who stood up and
