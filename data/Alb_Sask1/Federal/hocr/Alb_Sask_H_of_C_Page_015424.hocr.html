               that I have all the wisdom in the world, and 
               <br />
               whilst I have outlined these few suggestions 
               <br />
               as to what I think might have been done. 
               <br />
               I dare say there are gentlemen on each

               side of the House who will ﬁnd weak spots 
               <br />
               in them: but there is a way by which the 
               <br />
               early years of these provinces could be tided 
               <br />

               vision for their yearly expenditures than 
               <br />
               they now get under these Bills. and that is 
               <br />
               by endowing them with the lands. With 
               <br />
               reference to immigration I was sorry to hear 
               <br />
               'the Minister of the Interior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mir.</span> Oliver)—

               as a settler to the Northwest was really a

               that out loud. You may think it in your

               own heart, but keep it behind doors, because 
               <br />
               it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> politic to say to these settlers: 
               <br />
               Every one of you is a burden to us; you 
               <br />
               make us pay out $20 a year. and we would 
               <br />
               not have to pay that if you had not come.

               Mr. FOSTER. Yes I have, and I have

               listened to my hon. friend reading the

               <br />
               pose he has any great reverence for the 
               <br />
               authorities he read. These are all nice 
               <br />
               things for an argument; they may be use- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ed at an opponent so as to give warrant for 
               <br />
               saying to him: I have ﬂoored you, But 
               <br />
               after all can we not come down to the-prin- 
               <br />
               ciple which should guide us. I have not 
               <br />
               argued this question from a party point of 
               <br />
               view. There is nothing in my argument 
               <br />
               which I intended to be taken in that spirit. 
               <br />
               What I want is that we should do the very 
               <br />
               best we can by these great provinces. I 
               <br />
               want them to have for all the years of their 
               <br />
               future the best provisions we can give them. 
               <br />
               With regard to that immigrant, I think he 
               <br />
               is of inﬁnitely more use to your new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces than to the Dominion. True he pays 
               <br />
               his customs tax; and if he be liberal in his 
               <br />
               eating and drinking and smoking, he pays 
               <br />
               some excise taxes too. But how small a 
               <br />
               proportion that is to the yearly toil he is 
               <br />
               putting into his land as a citizen of your 
               <br />
               province, adding to it two-fold, four-fold, 
               <br />
               twenty-fold, becoming a citizen who is a 
               <br />
               member of your society, who keeps up your 
               <br />
               schools and your churches, who does for him-

               family and rears citizens for the state. So 
               <br />
               we must not look at the question merely 
               <br />
               from the point of view of dollars and cents. 
               <br />
               But there is enough in it in dollars and 
               <br />
               cents to make the Dominion government 
               <br />
               still do its duty in the matter of immigra-

               tion, even though these lands are given over 
               <br />

               <br />
               its immigration work in a reasonable and 
               <br />
               moderate way. I believe that every year 
               <br />
               from this out less will have to be spent to

               expenditure may all be stopped. The men 
               <br />
               and women who will be your immigration 
               <br />
               agents will be those who have gone out to 
               <br />
               that country, who have made themselves 
               <br />
               homes there and who have spread the news 
               <br />
               of what they have done to the great outside 
               <br />
               portions of the world from which they 
               <br />
               came. Every year there will be less neces- 
               <br />
               sity for this immense expenditure until 
               <br />
               within a comparatively short period we will 
               <br />
               be where the United States is today, and 
               <br />
               instead of spending a dollar to get people to 
               <br />
               come to the country we will have to- 
               <br />
               spend money to regulate the stream of im- 
               <br />
               migration. There is no reason vtor the 
               <br />
               Dominion government giving up its efforts 
               <br />
               in the way of immigraton; and the argu- 
               <br />
               ment of the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) has not affected me in the least, 
               <br />
               regarding the likelihood of the local govern- 
               <br />
               ments not encouraging immigration. Why 
               <br />
               should not the local governments want to 
               <br />
               get settlers into that country ? In order to 
               <br />
               build up the country you must have settlers. 
               <br />
               And these provinces propose to go ahead 
               <br />
               and therefore will be in sympathy with all 
               <br />
               well ordered immigration. Surely the people 
               <br />
               living in the atmosphere of the Northwest, 
               <br />
               who have been born and brought up there, or 
               <br />
               have lived there a number of years and are 
               <br />
               right on the spot, will know better what 
               <br />
               kind of immigrants they want, Where to 
               <br />
               place them, and how ‘to deal with them, 
               <br />
               than we who come here from all ends of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, and the majority of whom 
               <br />
               have never lived in the Northwest. It is 
               <br />
               impossible for a man born and brought up 
               <br />
               in Nova Scotia, and who has never seen 
               <br />
               the western prairies, to form any adequate 
               <br />
               idea of that country. A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man</span> requires to 
               <br />
               have visited it often or to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lived.</span> there, 
               <br />
               or to have been born and have grown up 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there,</span> to appreciate it properly. Why should 
               <br />
               there be any clash between the Dominion 
               <br />
               and a well ordered province, in directing 
               <br />
               the stream of immigration. There could 
               <br />
               not be, because men are sensible and reas-
