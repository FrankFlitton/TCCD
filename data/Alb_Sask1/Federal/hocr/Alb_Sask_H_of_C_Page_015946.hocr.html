               the Minister of Justice has put upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sec</span> 
               <br />
               tion 93 of the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               Now, Mr. Speaker. I will very brieﬂy show 
               <br />
               in what respect the Bill as now before the 
               <br />
               House is a departure from the Bill as ori- 
               <br />
               ginally presented by the Prime Minister, 
               <br />
               and as afterwards amended by him. Sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools, under section 41 of the ordi- 
               <br />
               nance 29, can only be established by a 
               <br />
               minority of the ratepayers. Under the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875, section 11, the majority of the 
               <br />
               ratepayers can establish a school district 
               <br />
               and provide for education. After the 
               <br />
               school district is established then the mino- 
               <br />
               rity can ask for and have separate schools. 
               <br />
               The question was asked the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice by the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Bourassa), under what circumstances 
               <br />
               could a school he established if there were 
               <br />
               neither Catholics or Protestants in the dis- 
               <br />
               trict. Now if you put a construction upon 
               <br />
               section 11 of the Act of 1875, that rate- 
               <br />
               payers mean only Catholics or Protestants, 
               <br />
               then a diﬁiculty might arise. But under 
               <br />
               section 2 of the ordinance 29, a meaning is 
               <br />
               given to the word ‘ratepayer,’ such as 
               <br />
               you would expect to be given it, that is, 
               <br />
               a person who pays rates, with the limita- 
               <br />
               tion of a certain residence within the dis- 
               <br />
               trict before he casts his vote for the election 
               <br />
               of a trustee. Now, the First Minister pro- 
               <br />
               vided in his Bill for the minority but not 
               <br />
               for the majority. The amendment of the 
               <br />
               member for Saskatchewan, following the 
               <br />
               amendment moved by the member for 
               <br />
               Labelle, and following to a certain extent 
               <br />
               the amendment moved by the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron), sought 
               <br />
               to cure this defect, with the exception that 
               <br />
               the amendments of the member for La- 
               <br />
               belle and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> member for Beauharnois were 
               <br />
               summarily voted down at the instance of 
               <br />
               the government and afterwards, when the 
               <br />
               member for Saskatchewan, under the inspi- 
               <br />
               ration I imagine of the First Minister, or 
               <br />
               some member of the government, moved 
               <br />
               his amendment, it was accepted by the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment and adopted by the House, under 
               <br />
               the authority of the First Minister. What 
               <br />
               is the effect of that amendment? I think, 
               <br />
               Sir. that many members of this House do 
               <br />
