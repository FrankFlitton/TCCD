               <br />
               ritories, what of the French language ? By 
               <br />
               an Act passed in 1876 or 1877 the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage was imposed upon the Territories. 
               <br />
               That was an Act passed by Mr. Mackenzie, 
               <br />
               but by an Act passed by Sir John Macdonald 
               <br />
               in 1890 the restriction put upon the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture by the former Act was removed. There- 
               <br />
               fore, so far as the question of language is 
               <br />
               concerned, the Territories enjoy provincial 
               <br />
               autonomy. The power of the local legisla- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">swer'is</span> simply this. There is a provision 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing separate schools, and there is no such 
               <br />
               provision with regard to the French langu- 
               <br />

               want to make this debate very long. But

               the right hon. Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid

               Lau-rier) must have found himself in straits, 
               <br />
               when, after two months’ debate on this

               subject he has found it necessary to speak

               <br />
               has not been said a number of times before. 
               <br />
               I think there is nothing in his present

               speech which he himself has not said be- 
               <br />
               fore. And some things he has said now for 
               <br />
               the third time—I think I have heard the

               The right hon. gentleman has said there 
               <br />
               is no such thing as absolute provincial 
               <br />
               rights in matters of education because there 
               <br />
               are certain qualiﬁcations in section 93 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act. which he 
               <br />
               himself admits to be the sole clause govern- 
               <br />
               ing the distribution of powers as between 
               <br />
               the Dominion and the provinces in regard 
               <br />
               to education. Suppose that there is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ab-</span> 
               <br />
               solute power in the provinces. is that a 
               <br />
               reason why he should seek to invade, as 
               <br />
               he does by this legislation, those provincial 
               <br />
               powers as they are? Suppose that a man 
               <br />
               has the lease of a farm for ninety-nine years. 
               <br />
               That is not an absolute title, as the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, being a lawyer, knows. 
               <br />
               But does that justify any one in going in 
               <br />
               and breaking down the man’s fences and 
               <br />
               taking possession of a portion of his land. 
               <br />
               The provinces have certain powers conferred 
               <br />
               upon them by section 93, subject to certain 
               <br />
               qualiﬁcation-s. If the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               is true to the spirit of his speech of this 
               <br />
               afternoon, he will vote for the application 
               <br />
               of section 03 with nothing more and no- 
               <br />
               thing less than that section contains. The 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman declares that he de- 
               <br />
               sires that the constitution shall be ap- 
               <br />
               plied. Yet he begins his speech by taking 
               <br />
               for granted that which it was necessary
