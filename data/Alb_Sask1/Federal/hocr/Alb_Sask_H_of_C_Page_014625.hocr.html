               with what has been said. Sir_ I was some- 
               <br />
               what at a loss to apprehend the meaning 
               <br />
               of this discussion, somewhat at a loss to 
               <br />
               understand the cause of it. I must admit 
               <br />
               that, I could scarcely see the reason for 
               <br />
               resurrecting a debate that had practically 
               <br />
               ended yesterday. But when a distinguished 
               <br />
               politician from the province of Quebec, one 
               <br />
               who is prominent in the local legislature, 
               <br />
               appeared on the ﬂoor of this House this 
               <br />
               afternoon, and when I witnessed the en— 
               <br />
               thusiasm of the hon. member for Beauhar- 
               <br />
               nois (Mr. Bergeron), when my hon. friend 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition was speaking, 
               <br />
               I realized what it all meant. And what 
               <br />
               does it all mean ? It means neither more 
               <br />
               nor less than an attack upon the Papal dele— 
               <br />
               gate, not for anything he has done in con- 
               <br />
               nection with the particular question now in

               issue before this House, but because of 
               <br />
               the political conditions which have existed 
               <br />
               in Quebec since his coming here. Now, 
               <br />
               the events of 1896 are fresh in the minds of 
               <br />
               all of us. I have no desire to go over the 
               <br />
               old story of our troubles and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misfortunes</span> 
               <br />
               at that time. Every one here knows what 
               <br />
               took place in the province of Quebec, and 
               <br />
               knows the circumstances under which it 
               <br />
               was necessary for a certain number of 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic gentlemen in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec to appeal to the Pope; and 
               <br />
               every one knows who has followed the cur- 
               <br />
               rent of political events that the result of 
               <br />
               that appeal was the coming to this country 
               <br />
               of the delegate. And since his coming in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec we have had peace, 
               <br />
               and since his coming political liberty has 
               <br />
               reigned in the province of Quebec. And 
               <br />
               that peace and that political liberty are 
               <br />
               What our friends on the other side from the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec do not want, and the 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen are now endeavouring to 
               <br />
               obtain the recall of this gentleman who has 
               <br />
               become a burden to them, because that peace 
               <br />
               of which I have spoken a moment ago has 
               <br />
               become irksome to these gentlemen who 
               <br />
               have fed and thrived on discord during their 
               <br />
               years of power. The leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition (Mr. R. L. Borden) has in the per- 
               <br />
               formance of what he believed to be his duty 
               <br />
               to his party brought this matter up in a 
               <br />
               half-hearted way. He has brought it up be-' 
               <br />
               cause he has thought it necesary to do it 
               <br />
               and I cannot say that with any word he 
               <br />
               littered I can ﬁnd fault. I do not ﬁnd fault 
               <br />
               with the leader of the opposition; those 
               <br />
               with whom I ﬁnd fault are the gentlemen 
               <br />
               Who are hiding behind all this agitation and 
               <br />
               who are not courageous enough to come 
               <br />
               out and say: We want to take up this 
               <br />
               fight with the delegate and to get rid of 
               <br />
               him. It has been made a matter of reproach 
               <br />
               to us that the delegate was brought to this 
               <br />
               country and it is- now said that he has 
               <br />
               been interfering with this political question 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. Why, is the 
               <br />
               memory of our friends so short that they 
               <br />
               cannot go back to 1870 when the leader of

               The leader of the opposition (Mr. R. 
               <br />
               L. Borden) was somewhat indignant at 
               <br />
               the Minister of Customs quoting from 
               <br />
               the Hamilton ‘Spectator’ and he im— 
               <br />
               puted motives to my hon. friend be- 
               <br />
               cause of that quotation. What about the 
               <br />
               motives of the man who wrote the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">para</span> 
               <br />
               graph quoted ? What about the men who 
               <br />
               sat silently by and derived beneﬁt from it? 
               <br />
               What about these motives <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> Where is the 
               <br />
               difference between the action of the man 
               <br />
               who wrote that article for some sinister 
               <br />
               motive and the action of the gentleman 
               <br />
               who brought the attention of the House 
               <br />
               to it? Does the hon. gentleman expect 
               <br />
               that 'we are to allow these things to 
               <br />
               go by? Does the hon. gentleman expect 
               <br />
