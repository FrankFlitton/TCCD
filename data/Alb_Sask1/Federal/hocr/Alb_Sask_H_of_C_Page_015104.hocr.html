               this government and their supporters for 
               <br />
               the next thirty days. There was another

               only handed to Mr. Haultain an hour before 
               <br />
               it was ready to be presented to the House, 
               <br />

               in regard to its provisions. This lack of 
               <br />
               consideration is on a par with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treat</span>

               ment that was accorded him afterwards by 
               <br />
               the government, because, when the second 
               <br />
               Bill was brought down, the right hon. leader 
               <br />
               of the government stated in a cavalier way 
               <br />
               that he did not allow Mr. Haultain to see 
               <br />
               the Bill at all. That statement is on record. 
               <br />
               Did the right hon. gentleman think that the 
               <br />
               proper way to reconcile people, to conciliate 
               <br />
               the people, was to tell their premier who 
               <br />
               came here as the accredited representative 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories that he would 
               <br />
               not condescend to show him the legislation 
               <br />
               that the government proposed to submit? 
               <br />
               Well, then we had these terrible thirty days 
               <br />
               of suspense and agony. We saw the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment marching and counter-marching, 
               <br />
               we saw hon. members lobbying around the 
               <br />
               corridors wondering what Was to be the 
               <br />
               next move, and then we heard the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">state‘</span> 
               <br />
               ment made by the hon. member for Bran-

               don as to the stand he took. That hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman came back, and within three or 
               <br />
               four days after his entrance into the city 
               <br />
               we know what happened. The right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister rose up in his place and 
               <br />
               announced that he had received the resigna- 
               <br />
               tion of the Minister of the Interior, and the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior made a speech on 
               <br />
               that occasion which showed a determina- 
               <br />
               tion upon his part to oppose this Bill and 
               <br />
               to oppose any legislation to this end, if the 
               <br />
               English language meant anything. But, Sir, 
               <br />
               no sooner had the hon. ex-Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior announced his intention to defeat 
               <br />
               this Bill, if it were possible, than all the 
               <br />
               force and power of government press were 
               <br />
               turned upon the hon. member for Brandon. 
               <br />
               Insinuations were made as to his conduct 
               <br />
               while in the discharge of his duties as Min-

               ister of the Interior. One of the Quebec 
               <br />
               papers, and a strong supporter of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, came out with a cartoon. Did

               <br />
               the government by reason of the strong 
               <br />

               and the pistol was put at his head by

               reason of scandals connected with his de- 
               <br />
               partment. Hon. gentlemen opposite cannot 
               <br />
               gainsay this. It was in the public press, 
               <br />
               and no member of the government has risen 
               <br />

               <br />
               connection with these ideas which have 
               <br />
               been disseminated by the press friendly to 
               <br />
               the government. But if this legislation is

               <br />
               Minister of the Interior come back into the 
               <br />

               tion that must suggest itself to the people. 
               <br />
               If the legislation was to his mind, he should 
               <br />
               have come back as a hero and have said 
               <br />
               that he had stemmed the whole tide of this 
               <br />
               policy, and forced them to come into accord 
               <br />
               with his views on this question; but this 
               <br />
               has not been done, and the public must draw 
               <br />
               their own deductions that the threats held 
               <br />
               out by the ministerial press and the insinu- 
               <br />
               ations made against that hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               were the inﬂuences that brought him back. 
               <br />
               Now, we have heard a great deal about the 
               <br />
               constitutional triumph of the hon. ex-Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior. But we have not heard 
               <br />
               a word about the terrible downfall that his 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">party</span> got in. Manitoba the other day—not 
               <br />
               a word. Hon. gentlemen opposite went to a 
               <br />
               riding of their own selection and they won. 
               <br />
               But there was the riding of Mountain in 
               <br />
               Manitoba, and the hon. gentleman who re- 
               <br />
               presents Lisgar (Mr. Greenway) was dele- 
               <br />
               gated to go up there. He was accompanied 
               <br />
               by a number of hon. gentlemen from the pro- 
               <br />
               Vince of Manitoba; but, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Sir,</span> there is no 
               <br />
               acclaim for them, there is no applause. 
               <br />
               These hon. gentlemen have found that in 
               <br />
               the west, in any riding of strong Liberal 
               <br />
               proclivities, where the population is not 
               <br />
               strongly foreign, they can only court one 
               <br />
               thing, and that is disaster, such as they met 
               <br />
               with in Manitoba. 
               <br />

               Now, this question has been discussed 
               <br />
               from both sides. I shall not repeat the 
               <br />

               <br />
               from the lawyer’s standpoint and from the 
               <br />
               statesman’s standpoint. I shall use the 
               <br />
               words that are commonly used—from the 
               <br />
               legal point of view and from what may be 
               <br />
               termed the sentimental point of view. What 
               <br />
               is the legal point of view? First and fore- 
               <br />
               most. lt is a matter of comment, and it must 
               <br />
               be a matter of comment, that although this 
               <br />
               debate has gone on week after week, no hon.
