               head of the organization of the Tory party 
               <br />
               in Quebec. This petition which I hold in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my</span> 
               <br />
               hand was sent to the various Catholic 
               <br />
               organizations in Quebec, or at least in the 
               <br />
               constituency of Three Rivers, but luckily 
               <br />
               in my district they were not taken up as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen expected. Some of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> 
               <br />
               have been sent here to be presented to this 
               <br />
               Ilouse, and I am credibly informed, and have 
               <br />
               reason to believe, that it is a continuation of 
               <br />
               the game started by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey. In Ontario and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">western</span> 
               <br />
               provinces the cry is : Let us Tories take the 
               <br />
               lead and not permit this legislation to be 
               <br />
               carried, it is against provincial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">autonomy</span> ; 
               <br />
               but in Quebec we will present the other 
               <br />
               side of the medal, and we will tell the peo- 
               <br />
               ple to present petitions to the Prime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minis</span> 
               <br />
               ter and the House. I notice that these peti- 
               <br />
               tions were taken to the Prime Minister and
