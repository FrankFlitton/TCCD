               Speaker, the speech made this afternoon-by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice was in many res- 
               <br />
               pects a very able one. It was a speech 
               <br />
               worthy of his'high position; was a speech 
               <br />
               worthy of his party : but in his prologue and 
               <br />
               in his peroration, he had evidently culled a 
               <br />
               number of gems from some of his lSt. Jean 
               <br />
               Baptiste Day addresses, and he delivered 
               <br />
               them with all the fervor of some of his St. 
               <br />
               Patrick’s Day orations. That speech, in so 
               <br />
               far as it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> argumentative, was a very 
               <br />
               able and very creditable speech to himself 
               <br />
               and to his party; but as I listened to it I 
               <br />
               came to the conclusion that it was delivered 
               <br />
               in the interest of a lost cause—that it was 
               <br />
               the last argument which was to be made in 
               <br />
               this country in favour of the ecclesiastical 
               <br />
               school that we know in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario—of that school which the late Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior condemned in former 
               <br />
               and recent times; that school which the

               Quebec has set out to reform. and which 
               <br />
               the late Minister Of Public Works, the Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Tax-t9. has made special mention of in 
               <br />
               demanding reform in

               public instruction in the province of Que-

               And that speech was marked by some- 
               <br />
               thing else : it was characterized by the fact 
               <br />
               that the Minister of Justice demolished the 
               <br />
               whole argument of his leader. The argu- 
               <br />
               ment of his leader was that the constitution 
               <br />
               was imperative, that it was categorical, that 
               <br />
               it devolved on parliament the duty of intro- 
               <br />
               ducing separate school clauses into this Bill. 
               <br />
               if I gather anything from the argument of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice. it was that there 
               <br />
               was nothing categorical or imperative in 
               <br />
               the constitution in that respect. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> John (Mr. Stockton) chal- 
               <br />
               lenged the government to show where the

               it imperative that 
               <br />
               such a clause should be introduced into this 
               <br />
               And he referred to something on 
               <br />
               which we are entitledto an explanation this 
               <br />
               he referred to the changes- that 
               <br />
               lmd been made in section 16 of the Bill. 
               <br />
               That amended clause was made a part of 
               <br />
               this measure on the proposal for its second 
               <br />
               \Vhat was more to the point, it 
               <br />
               was on the original section 16 that the late 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">@er.</span> Sifton) with- 
               <br />
               drew his support from the government, 
               <br />
               and we are told that he was followed by 
               <br />
               all the members from the west. Some ex- 
               <br />
               planation was made to the late minister and 
               <br />
               to the members from the west as a reason 
               <br />
               for the change that was made in that 
               <br />
               clause; why was that reason not given to 
               <br />
               the House to-night ‘3 Why was it held back 
               <br />
               at a time when we were entitled to it? 
               <br />
               The Minister of Justice this afternoon ar— 
               <br />
               gued that the question was one of expedien- 
               <br />
               cy, that we were free to do as we liked, ‘but 
               <br />
               that we were in honour bound to carry out 
               <br />
               our engagements to the minority. That may 
               <br />
               ‘be; but we were in honour bound to do 
               <br />
               something more ; we were in honour bound 
               <br />
               to do justice to all the people of the west 
               <br />
               rather than to the minority. That point also 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'as</span> made very clear in the speech made 
               <br />
               this evening by the hon. member from St.

               The Minister of Justice rested his whole

               to take my stand and make an appeal to 
               <br />
               my supporters in my own constituency and 
               <br />
               in my owu province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\from</span> one end of it to 
               <br />
               the other : he said that as he read the corn- 
               <br />
               stitution there was no province that was 
               <br />
               not restricted in the matter of education. 
               <br />
               That in a measure is true, but if the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces restricted, if a condition was 
               <br />
               imposed on Ontario and the other original 
               <br />
               contracting provinces, it was imposed upon 
               <br />
               them by themselves. In this case, however, 
               <br />
               the restriction is imposed on the people Of 
               <br />
               the west, not by themselves, but by an 
               <br />
               almost solid Quebec. These people in the 
               <br />
               west are just as much entitled to be con- 
               <br />
               sidered in the matter of schools as were 
               <br />
