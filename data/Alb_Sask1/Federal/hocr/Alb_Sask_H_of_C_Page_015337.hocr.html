               going to say, contempt. We are not given

               the explanation this House was entitled to 
               <br />
               ask before disposing of the second reading. 
               <br />
               It is treating parliament with contempt, I 
               <br />
               say. to leave it in the dark for such a length 
               <br />
               of time upon so important a matter. And 
               <br />
               now we are told the Minister of Justice is 
               <br />
               not ready to give an explanation because he 
               <br />
               has not his papers with him. For my part 
               <br />
               I am disposed to give him every opportunity 
               <br />
               to make his explanation. But, if the min- 
               <br />
               ister cannot explain, I feel like calling upon 
               <br />
               the hon. member of Centre York (Mr. Camp- 
               <br />

               <br />
               stituents, he has explained it even to the 
               <br />
               ministers of the Gospel in this constituency. 
               <br />
               He ought to explain it to the House.
