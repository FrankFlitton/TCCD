               <br />
               that the Roman Catholics are not in the 
               <br />
               minority but are larger. stronger and more

               <br />
               and therefore they are not entitled to come 
               <br />

               <br />
               for full consideration to minorities. They 
               <br />

               the House is that in carving out these two 
               <br />
               new provinces in the Northwest, we should 
               <br />
               be careful to give them a clean bill of 
               <br />
               rights. We should keep back nothing 
               <br />
               which is due to them. We should rather 
               <br />
               be inclined to be generous, and I am not 
               <br />
               aware that the ﬁnancial terms have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been.</span> 
               <br />
               found fault with. But I would like the new 
               <br />
               provinces- to get more land and less cash. 
               <br />
               I would treat these provinces with gener- 
               <br />
               osity. I would give them a clean bill 
               <br />
               of rights and not withhold from them one 
               <br />
               jot or tittle of what they are entitled to. 
               <br />
               They are young provinces, just starting on 
               <br />
               their career, and are entitled to the very best 
               <br />

               <br />
               can give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.»</span> Let us send them off with 
               <br />
               a clean bill of rights. Let us give them 
               <br />
               the right to place on their statute-books any 
               <br />
               laws with regard to education which they 
               <br />
               may judge proper. Let them go out into 
               <br />
               the world with that charter of right and 
               <br />
               that freedom which belongs to the great 
               <br />
               western plains of which they are the young 
               <br />
               offspring. If we do that, we shall have no 
               <br />
               cause for regret, but if we attach a string 
               <br />
               to the right to which they are entitled. we 
               <br />
               will be creating a constant source of fric-

               <br />
               great question, but will make of it a thorn 
               <br />
               in their side just as it has been in the side 
               <br />
               of some of the older provinces. I ask that 
               <br />
               the same mistake which was made in Mani- 
               <br />
               toba should not be made with regard to 
               <br />
               these great provinces in the west. We are 
               <br />
               all striving for the best advantage of Can—

               ada according to our best light and 
               <br />
               knowledge. I give hon. gentlemen oppo-

               site that same freedom to express their 
               <br />
               views which I ask for myself, and I believe 
               <br />
               they are expressing their convictions just 
               <br />
               as I am giving expression to mine. We are 
               <br />
               striving to start out those new provinces on 
               <br />
               their race for life in a way which we will 
               <br />
               never have to regret, and we are endeavour— 
               <br />
               ing to set up there a citizenship that 
               <br />
               throughout all time will enjoy the full rights 
               <br />
               and privileges which are enjoyed by any 
               <br />
               or all of the older provinces. I believe that
