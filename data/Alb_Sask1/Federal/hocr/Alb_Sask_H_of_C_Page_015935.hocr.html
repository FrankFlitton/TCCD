               <br />
               my hon. friend on this matter. I do not see

               that this right of the Canadian parliament 
               <br />

               <br />
               applying to it a declaration of this kind. 
               <br />
               It would simply amount to a declaration, 
               <br />
               and nothing else; it would have no more 
               <br />
               effect than the passing of the section in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">silence.“</span> It would simply complicate this 
               <br />
               Bill and put a blemish on it, and the people 
               <br />
               on whose behalf my hon. friend has spoken 
               <br />
               with great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬂiect</span> and warmth, would not be 
               <br />
               beneﬁted in the least. I said on a previous 
               <br />
               occasion that in this matter we are part- 
               <br />
               ners with the new provinces of Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan; we are in the same boat 
               <br />
               with them. The exemptions from which 
               <br />
               they suffer this parliament also suffers 
               <br />
               from ; and our interests being common, the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest Territories can rely 
               <br />
               that the Canadian government, in protect— 
               <br />
               ing its own interests, must likewise protect 
               <br />
               those of the new provinces which We are 
               <br />
               creating. I have only to repeat that in my 
               <br />
               opinion this is a blemish which has been 
               <br />
               placed, not only on the people of the new 
               <br />
               provinces, but on the people of Canada 
               <br />
               generally, and that the time has come, I 
               <br />
               am not prepared to say when, when the par- 
               <br />
               liament of Canada must address itself to 
               <br />
               this question. Therefore I do not see that

               we can accept this amendment.

               First Minister the hon. gentleman referred 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               only heard some rather vague prophecy as 
               <br />
               to what parliament might or might not be 
               <br />
               obliged to do at some time in the remote 
               <br />
               future. So far as the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way exemption from taxation is concerned, 
               <br />
               the question remains to be determined

               <br />
               full jurisdiction to deal with provincial tax- 
               <br />
               ation. In good faith that jurisdiction must 
               <br />
               be exercised subject to the terms of the con- 
               <br />
               tract, just as this parliament, if it saw ﬁt 
               <br />
               to attempt the expropriation referred to by 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman, would be obliged in good 
               <br />
               faith to have regard to the terms of the con-

               tract. As I gave my views in committee,

               the justices of the Supreme Court of Canada,
