               study of this question. Several members

               <br />

               selves behind legal technicalities in order to 
               <br />
               refuse the minorities the right of having 
               <br />
               schools of their choice. I have often heard, 
               <br />
               and with surprise I -must say, members of 
               <br />

               country there should be only one school and 
               <br />
               one language. I have no fear to assert 
               <br />
               that the French Canadians are not only 
               <br />
               necessary, but essential, to the mainten- 
               <br />

               The day on which the French Canadians 
               <br />
               would have lost their nationality, their 
               <br />
               faith,'their aspirations, they would cease to 
               <br />
               look on Canada as their country, they would 
               <br />
               no longer possess that love of the land which 
               <br />
               is the strength of patriotic sentiment, they 
               <br />
               would take. no more interest in the destinies 
               <br />
               of this country, nor would they have any 
               <br />
               ambition to see it continue along the high- 
               <br />
               way of progress. I do not hesitate to say 
               <br />
               here that in Canada there do not exist more 
               <br />
               devoted subjects to the British Crown than 
               <br />
               are those who were raised and whose minds 
               <br />
               were formed by that very Catholic hierarchy 
               <br />

               <br />

               very schools of the province of Quebec, that 
               <br />
               these same newspapers have viliﬁed to such 
               <br />
               a great extent. All we desire—we French 
               <br />
               Canadians—and I close with this, is that 
               <br />
               every minority, no matter which it he, 
               <br />
               should have the right to follow its own faith 
               <br />
               and to have its children brought up accord-

               ing to the natural rights that belong to the 
               <br />
               parent. The majority need fear nothing
