               With respect to public schools. Now with

               reference to the dili'erence of meaning be- 
               <br />
               tween section 16, No. 1, and section 16, 
               <br />
               No. 2, I agree with my hon. friend the

               leader of the opposition as to the legal elrect 
               <br />
               of the language used in these two sections. 
               <br />
               No. 2 goes as far as No. 1, as originally 
               <br />
               introduced by the right hon. First Minister ; 
               <br />
               and if we attempt to Whittle down the 
               <br />
               meaning of No. 2 by saying that it does not 
               <br />
               go as far as No. 1, then the duty is cast 
               <br />
               upon those who argue in that direction to 
               <br />
               show where there is a limitation. I can 
               <br />
               ﬁnd none in the section itself, and I have 
               <br />
               not understood the Minister of JustiCe to

               make the statement on the ﬂoor of the 
               <br />

               1. I did not understand the Minister of Jus-

               him to say so when he made his explanation 
               <br />
               the other day. I think section 16, No. 2, 
               <br />
               is as full and ample to give separate schools 
               <br />

               Minister of Justice as to whether he is of

               <br />
               all. I will just read it in order to make

               my meaning perfectly clear:
