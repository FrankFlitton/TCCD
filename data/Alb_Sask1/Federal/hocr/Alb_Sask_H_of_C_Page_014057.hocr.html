               <br />
               debates of this House on a former occasion 
               <br />
               or: the question of separate schools. I was

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> aware until this moment that this pam—

               phlet had been distributed, and I shall make

               inquiry and ascertain who is responsible 
               <br />
               for it. I do not mean any discourtesy to 
               <br />
               the House, on the contrary; the House is 
               <br />
               entitled to the amplest information, and 
               <br />
               that it shall have at all times, and I hope

               before this matter is settled. But many 0f 
               <br />
               the matters which have been introduced to— 
               <br />
               day are absolutely foreign to the question 
               <br />
               which I was forced to bring before the 
               <br />
               House, that is to say the resignation of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Brandon. The other ques- 
               <br />
               tions will come up at a later date. Some 
               <br />
               remarks have been made, for instance, by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> hon. member for South Wellington (Mr. 
               <br />
               Guthrie) when he said that this Bill had 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lieen</span> before the House for two sessions. 
               <br />
               That was evidently a slip of the tongue. 
               <br />
               and was easily answered. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               meant only to say that the question of an- 
               <br />
               tonomy had been discussed for two sessions. 
               <br />
               Everybody knows, especially the members 
               <br />
               who were in the old parliament, that for 
               <br />
               the last two sessions the question of auton— 
               <br />
               omy for the Territories has been under dis- 
               <br />
               cussion; I presume that is what my hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> had in his mind when he spoke on 
               <br />
               this Bill. But the only object I had in ris- 
               <br />
               ing was to refer to a statement—not a state- 
               <br />
               ment but an insinuation, made, 1 think, by 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> hon. member for South York. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman insinuated that in bringing for- 
               <br />
               ward this measure there was an intention 
               <br />
               on my part in some way to get rid of the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. I simply notice 
               <br />
               the statement to give it the most emphatic 
               <br />
               denial that I can. Whatever may be the 
               <br />
               differences of opinion between myself and 
               <br />
               my late colleague, I am sure he will acquit 
               <br />
               me of having had any idea of acting deceit- 
               <br />
               i'ully towards him. I am sure that no one 
               <br />
               knows better than himself that it is with 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extreme</span> regret that I have to lose his valu- 
               <br />
               able services, and if :I could have retained 
               <br />
               them 1 would have done so with great 
               <br />
               pleasure. When the hon. member for South 
               <br />
               York insinuates that I was conspiring 
               <br />
               in some way to get rid of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Brandon he makes an insinuation 
               <br />
               which is absolutely without the shadow of 
               <br />
               foundation.

               We have taken exception to various clauses

               Mr. COCKSHUTT. I am not making an 
               <br />
               amendment to the Bill. This is a motion 
               <br />
               asking that it shall be sent to a special com- 
               <br />
               mittee, and that it shall not go to the third 
               <br />
               reading at all. I have consulted an authori- 
               <br />
               ty on the point. I am quite willing to abide 
               <br />
               by the ruling of Mr. Speaker. This is an 
               <br />
               amendment moved that the Bill shall not 
               <br />
               go to the third reading now, but that it 
               <br />
               shall be referred to a special committee, not 
               <br />
               a committee of the House, but a special com- 
               <br />
               mittee to be named by the right hon. First 
               <br />
               Minister. I shall wait until Mr. Speaker de- 
               <br />
               cides the point.
