               <br />
               Although I do not agree, IMr. Speaker. with 
               <br />
               many of the arguments which the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Colchester (Mr. Laurence), who 
               <br />
               has just taken his seat, presented to 
               <br />
               the House, yet I cannot help but re- 
               <br />
               cognize the able manner in which he 
               <br />
               placed those arguments before us. I can- 
               <br />
               not agree with the hon. gentleman when he 
               <br />
               tells us that this Bill will settle the question 
               <br />
               of education in the new provinces. In my 
               <br />
               opinion, the best way to settle that question 
               <br />
               would be for my hon. friend to advocate 
               <br />
               and vote for the amendment moved by the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition. I cannot agree 
               <br />
               with him When he says that if a province 
               <br />
               has a sectarian system of education estab- 
               <br />
               lished when it enters the union, under which 
               <br />
               the rights of the minority are secured by 
               <br />
               law, that system can never be altered under 
               <br />
               our constitution. According to that conten-

               <br />
               establishing a law such as the Act of 1875, 
               <br />
               would be compelled to abide by that law

               ooks at the time it entered the union. I 
               <br />
               do not think that any such doctrine would 
               <br />
               be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair</span> or reasonable or consistent with pro-

               us that an attempt is being made to stir 
               <br />

               <br />
               the responsibility, but he insinuated as 
               <br />
               much. Let me, however, call his attention 
               <br />
               to the fact that it is the government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which,</span> 
               <br />

               <br />
               ing on in the country. I was sorry to hear 
               <br />
               the reﬂection which the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               made on the worthy leader of the opposition. 
               <br />
               I-Ie charged that hon. gentleman with lack- 
               <br />
               iug courage on this question. I cannot be- 
               <br />
               lieve that my hon. friend is well acquainted 
               <br />
               with the leader of the opposition or he 
               <br />
               would not have ventured any such state- 
               <br />
               ment. The leader of the opposition, Sir, has 
               <br />
               submitted his case to this House and the peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the strongest possible language, and 
               <br />
               there has not been a man on the government 
               <br />
               side, even the hon. gentleman himself, who 
               <br />
               has dared to attempt to refute the arguments 
               <br />
               which my hon. leader submitted. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman tells us he is not surprised that 
               <br />
               hon. members should disagree on this ques- 
               <br />
               tion, and yet he would lead us to believe 
               <br />
               that our leader has not the courage of his 
               <br />

               cally the only place Where there is agitation 
               <br />
               over this question. Evidently he has not
