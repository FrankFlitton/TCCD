               tleman has gone on record on page 3102 of 
               <br />
               ‘ Hansard’ where he says : This parliament 
               <br />
               has no power to alter section 93. If his amend- 
               <br />
               ment does not mean exactly what section 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act means 
               <br />
               he is in the position of, upon the one hand, 
               <br />
               arguing that parliament has no right to 
               <br />
               alter section 93, and, on the other hand, put— 
               <br />
               ting up an amendment which does alter this 
               <br />
               section. In my opinion this amendment and 
               <br />
               section 93 are exactly the same. and the ob- 
               <br />
               jections I have to the amendment are exactly 
               <br />
               the objections I have to the application of 
               <br />
               section 93 of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               without variation or limitation. These ob- 
               <br />
               jections are twofold: first, that under the 
               <br />
               amendment or under section 93 of the Bri- 
               <br />
               tish North America Act it would require a 
               <br />
               judicial decision after expensive litigation to 
               <br />
               enable us to ﬁnd out what sort of a school 
               <br />
               system we are entitled to in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories, and, secondly, it all depends on 
               <br />
               the interpretation of the words ‘at the union’ 
               <br />
               in subsection 1 of section 93 whether or not 
               <br />
               the provinces are in a position to exclusi- 
               <br />
               vely make laws in relation to education or 
               <br />
               whether we shall have fastened on us for 
               <br />
               all time to come an absolute dual system of 
               <br />
               sectarian schools. If the amendment were 
               <br />
               adopted. or if section 93. without variation, 
               <br />
               were adopted and the court held that the 
               <br />
               Words ‘at the union ’ in subsection 1 of sec- 
               <br />
               tion 93 meant the year 1870, as contended by 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite, then the provinces 
               <br />
               would have, in my opinion. the exclusive 
               <br />
               right to deal with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> subject of education. 
               <br />
               it, however, the court held that the words 
               <br />
               " at the union’ meant the present time, or 
               <br />
               the date of the coming «into force of this Bill, 
               <br />
               as I think they undoubtedly would hold, 
               <br />
               then if we adopted the amendment, the 
               <br />
               minority in the new provinces would have 
               <br />
               all the rights and privileges to which they 
               <br />
               would be entitled by any law in force to- 
               <br />
               day in the Northwest Territories, including 
               <br />
               the law of 1875 under which an absolute 
               <br />
               dual system of sectarian schools was estab- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               that there is not in Canada to-day a school
