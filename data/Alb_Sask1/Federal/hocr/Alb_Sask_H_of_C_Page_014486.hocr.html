               The hon. member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) said it was his own business whe- 
               <br />
               ther he thought religious teaching in the 
               <br />
               schools was right or wrong. I am proud 
               <br />
               to say that I am in favour of religious in- 
               <br />
               struction in schools. Very different from 
               <br />
               the attitude of the hon. member for East 
               <br />

               <br />

               This is what he said of Dr. Ryerson :
