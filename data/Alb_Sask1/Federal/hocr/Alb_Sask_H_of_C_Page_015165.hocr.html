               own advice to the members of this House 
               <br />
               at this particular time. Now then let me 
               <br />
               come back to the Minister of Justice. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice referred to section 2, 22 
               <br />
               and 30 of the Manitoba Act. Why, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, there is no relevancy—my hon. 
               <br />
               friend will pardom me for saying it—there 
               <br />
               is no relevancy in citing that Act with 
               <br />
               respect to the case before the House. The 
               <br />
               Manitoba Act received the sanction of the 
               <br />
               imperial parliament, and was to all intents 
               <br />
               and purposes an imperial Act, and there— 
               <br />
               fore it was the constitution given to the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba by the imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pair-</span>

               the realms of the British empire. Then my 
               <br />
               hon. friend referred to the law ofﬁcers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span>

               application that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was'made</span> to validate that 
               <br />

               <br />
               tice this afternoon, there was a provision 
               <br />
               and statement that no authority should be 
               <br />

               <br />
               of Canada at that time. But my hon. friend 
               <br />
               puts that proposition to a strange use; he 
               <br />
               says that while that may be so, you can 
               <br />
               clip the sovereignty out of the provinces, 
               <br />
               because it does not say that no less shall 
               <br />
               be given. Is there any necessity for any 
               <br />
               less to be given after a statement of that 
               <br />
               kind? Did any man ever suppose there 
               <br />
               would be an attempt in this parliament to 
               <br />
               create a province, and to give it autonomy 
               <br />
               and bring it into the sisterhood of provinces 
               <br />
               under the constitution of Canada, and not 
               <br />
               put it on a footing of equality with the 
               <br />
               other provinces ? Why, Sir, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion</span> 
               <br />
               is something remarkable to my mind, at all

               events, and I do not think the minister can 
               <br />
               reasonably suppose that there is much 
               <br />
               strength in an argument like that.

               Sir, he need not have gone quite so far back 
               <br />
               in history, he need not have gone further 
               <br />
               back than 1896, and have said: Explain 
               <br />
               the difference between the position of my 
               <br />
               own leader in 1896 and his position in 1905. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend referred to the Riel case, 
               <br />
               he referred to the words ‘ Peace, order and 
               <br />
               good government of Canada.’ That was 
               <br />
               under a criminal law, and that is essen- 
               <br />
               tially within the jurisdiction of the parlia- 
               <br />
               ment of Canada. I have not lately read the 
               <br />
               report of that case which was referred to 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               this afternoon, but I shall take an early 
               <br />
               opportunity of reading it.
