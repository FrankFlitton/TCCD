               simply suggesting a plan that would give

               <br />
               Now. the government proposes to give seven

               seats in the extreme north each of which 
               <br />
               has an average of 892 names on the voters‘ 
               <br />
               lists. while they put seven seats in the 
               <br />
               south each of which has an average of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1.540</span> names on the list. As against that 
               <br />
               the leader <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> the opposition’s plan is to 
               <br />
               have 12 seats-south of township <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34</span> with an

               These ﬁgures ought to show the justice of 
               <br />
               our plan to any independent man. I have 
               <br />
               endeavoured to make these calculations as 
               <br />
               carefully as possible from the ﬁgures given 
               <br />
               by the government. and I have shown that 
               <br />
               the plan proposed by the leader of the oppo- 
               <br />
               sition can in no sense be said to favour the 
               <br />
               south. but on the contrary it is partial to 
               <br />
               the north to a slight extent because it 
               <br />
               gives one seat to Athabaska with an ex-

               the Northwest Territories were given repre-

               not. The Territories got four members in

               <br />
               its own business, and it could do what it 
               <br />
               liked. It' Alberta were a province and she 
               <br />
               wished to give undue proportionate repre— 
               <br />
               sentation to any part of that province, it 
               <br />
               would be her own business. But this is not

               a matter for ourselves, it is matter that

               Mr. SCOTT. What is the main question 
               <br />
               in this discussion; is it the question of the 
               <br />
               capital of Alberta ? 
               <br />

               Mr. PERLEY. That is not the main ques-

               <br />
               and make fair divisions. I am told there 
               <br />
               is a dispute as to whether the capital shall 
               <br />
               be north or south——

               Mr. SCOTT. What other contentions could 
               <br />

               that is not a question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which.</span> we should take 
               <br />
               sides on. It the province of Alberta had 
               <br />
               her own legislature and she chose to divide 
               <br />
               and give undue proportion to the northern 
               <br />
               area that is her own business exactly as it 
               <br />
               was our business, when in distributing the 
               <br />
               constituencies for the Dominion we chose 
               <br />
               to give the Northwest an undue proportion.
