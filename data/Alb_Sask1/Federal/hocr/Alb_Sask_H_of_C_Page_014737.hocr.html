               Mr. Haultain claims that the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories came into 'the union in 1870, 
               <br />

               <br />
               separate schools by law in the Territories. 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain argues that section 93 of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act applies as at 
               <br />
               the time when the territory was annexed 
               <br />
               to the Dominion. In other words. he says 
               <br />
               the new provinces are entitled under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act to full and ex- 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               dition—there being no separate schools prior

               meaning of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               was. as contended by some, the time when 
               <br />
               the Territories were annexed to Canada, 
               <br />
               namely, in 1870, and section 93 of the Bri-

               tish North America Act then applied auto- 
               <br />
               matically. as is contended, it would seem 
               <br />
               that the Dominion government had no right 
               <br />

               1'0 that time, but nevertheless, they did so, 
               <br />
               and the records of parliament show that both 
               <br />
               parties practically agreed to the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion. They were almost unanimous. The 
               <br />
               records also show that the leading states- 
               <br />
               men on both sides of the House at that time 
               <br />
               were of the opinion that the legislation was 
               <br />
               intended to be in the nature of a settlement 
               <br />
               of the much vexed question for all time 
               <br />
               to come. Some hon. gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side of the House have rather attempted 
               <br />
               to discredit the loyalty of the French Can-

               has not been done so much in this House, 
               <br />
               probably, as in newspaper articles. I want 
               <br />
               to say right here that had it not been for
