               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. If my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice had had this argument in 
               <br />
               his mind, if he had held this opinion which 
               <br />
               he has put forward to—day, at the time he 
               <br />
               drafted section 16, No. 1. he could not have 
               <br />
               stated in this House, as he did state, that 
               <br />
               section 16, No. 1 was designed to preserve 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lthe</span> rights of the minority as they exist in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> the Northwest Territories to-day. Those two 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lthings</span> would be absolutely inconsistent; 
               <br />
               therefore I am within my right in insisting 
               <br />
               that the interpretation now relied upon is 
               <br />
               not the one that occurred to the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice when he was drafting that clause. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[It</span> did not occur to him for the very good 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[reason</span> that an interpretation of this kind 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lis</span> one to which the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               ‘would only resort when he found no other 
               <br />
               one would meet the case. To say that you 
               <br />
               must interpret this clause in that way is 
               <br />
               going very far indeed, much beyond any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘canon</span> of legal interpretation with which i
