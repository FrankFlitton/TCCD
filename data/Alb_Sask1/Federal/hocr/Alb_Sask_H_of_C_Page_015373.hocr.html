               the intelligent electors of that city will 
               <br />
               be given an opportunity to announce them~ 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selves</span> without being shackled. They will 
               <br />
               not be shackled. but they will have a voters’ 
               <br />
               list and will have British fair-play, and 
               <br />
               we will see what the result will be, though 
               <br />
               the government candidate will he favour- 
               <br />
               ably handicapped as against the other man. 
               <br />
               by having a portfolio, the government at 
               <br />
               his back, and a private car and its equip- 
               <br />
               ment. Then we will know what the public 
               <br />
               feeling of this country on this question is. 
               <br />
               So far as North Oxford is concerned, there 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> bound to be a contest there. Everybody 
               <br />
               knows that that constituency has a majority 
               <br />
               of at least 1.500 Liberals. and should the 
               <br />
               government candidate be elected by a small 
               <br />
               majority. I have no doubt that the govern- 
               <br />
               ment will claim that as an endorsation of its 
               <br />
               policy.
