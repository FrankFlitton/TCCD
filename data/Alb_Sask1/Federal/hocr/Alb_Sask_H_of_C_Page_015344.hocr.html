               <br />
               the Interior (Mr. Sifton) tells us that the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> amendment will entirely change 
               <br />
               the principle of the 'Bill, and so, while he 
               <br />
               dissented upon the principle of clause 16 as 
               <br />
               originally proposed, he supported it because

               others who have spoken upon this Bill, de— 
               <br />
               clared that it does not contain the principle 
               <br />
               of separate schools and therefore is satis- 
               <br />
               factory to their people and they will sup- 
               <br />
               port it. They admit that if this Bill con- 
               <br />
               tained the principle of separate schools as 
               <br />
               the Manitoba <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">School</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> contained it, they 
               <br />
               would not support it. Now, it either con- 
               <br />
               tains that principle or it does not. In my 
               <br />
               judgment the only question before the House 
               <br />
               was the question of clause 2 and clause 16, 
               <br />
               which did give separate schools as fully 
               <br />
               and comprehensively as the separate schools 
               <br />

               these clauses as ﬁrst proposed, the people of

               the province of Quebec sent in 65 petitions In 
               <br />
               support of the Bill. Would they have sent 
               <br />
               those petitions if the Bill had not contained 
               <br />
               the principle of separate schools ‘2 Did

               province of Quebec or the province 
               <br />
               of Ontario, or did they not? The member 
               <br />
               for Colchester (Mr. Laurence) declares that 
               <br />
               they do not contain that principle, and so 
               <br />
               his people are satisﬁed, and he fails to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               a single individual who was dissatisﬁed. 
               <br />
               And he declares that the voice of opp )s1tion 
               <br />
               to the Bill which is heard from the west is 
               <br />
               due to misapprehension of the real pro- 
               <br />
               visions of the Bill. But when the Bill was 
               <br />
               explained, how was it explained?

               It was explained in two ways, ﬁrst by 
               <br />
               sending copies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Bill to the people in

               <br />
               best they could on their own judgment, and 
               <br />
               they reached the conclusion that the Bill 
               <br />
               contained the elements of separate schools 
               <br />
               as they are found in the provinces of Que- 
               <br />
               bec and Ontario; and because they found 
               <br />
               that principle in it, they pronounced against 
               <br />
               it by sending in memorials, resolutions and 
               <br />
               petitions opposing it. If .they have been mis-
