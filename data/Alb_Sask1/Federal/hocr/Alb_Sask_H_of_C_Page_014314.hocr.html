               That is the argument, that is the reason-

               <br />

               was when a man who held a principle 
               <br />
               as strong as that on so grave an

               <br />
               does he do it? Why? I am not going to 
               <br />
               search for any reasons at all, I am going to 
               <br />
               give the reason that he gives—the King’s 
               <br />
               government must go on. The Finance Min- 
               <br />
               ister says, the King’s government must go 
               <br />
               on. Do they not mean in their heart of 
               <br />
               hearts that the Liberal government must 
               <br />
               go on ? It is the Liberal government which 
               <br />
               must go on, and principle, consistency, con- 
               <br />
               stitution, everything must be sacriﬁced, but 
               <br />
               the King’s—to wit, the Liberal—government 
               <br />
               must go on. The Minister of Finance used 
               <br />
               it as a threat_—I never heard a more un- 
               <br />
               worthy argument in this House, and hope 
               <br />
               never to hear such an argument again. If 
               <br />
               that principle and that method is adopted 
               <br />
               what government can be pure and well con- 
               <br />
               ducted; for never, if not in this case, will 
               <br />
               men go out because they do not agree in 
               <br />
               principle with the legislation which is pro- 
               <br />
               posed. Yet the King’s government must go 
               <br />
               on, that is to say, the party must be kept in 
               <br />
               power, principle and constitution may be 
               <br />
               thrown to the winds.

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exMinister</span> of the Interior says that the 
               <br />

               <br />
               stitution, but wants to know what you are 
               <br />
               going to enact. But there are men on the 
               <br />
               street and men on the street. I can con- 
               <br />
               ceive of a man on the street who cultivates 
               <br />
               a very valuable farm out in Carleton county. 
               <br />
               I go to him and say : My good friend, you

               think I own it. Let us sit down now and 
               <br />
               let us discuSs what is the best method of 
               <br />
               cultivating that farm. What does the man 
               <br />
               on the street say to me ? The ﬁrst thing 
               <br />
               he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span> is, Sir, don’t you think I had better 
               <br />
               know ﬁrst how the title reads ‘3 If the title 
               <br />

               <br />
               not take your domination : if the title is in

               you, I may give you advice, but I will not
