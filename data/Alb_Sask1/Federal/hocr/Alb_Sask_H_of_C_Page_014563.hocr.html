               <br />
               courts to interpret them, and whether we

               Council. And as that court is composed of 
               <br />
               human beings who are also lawyers, the 
               <br />
               probability is that they will give a decision 
               <br />
               according to the temper in which they are 
               <br />
               and according as their digestion is good 
               <br />
               or had. We shall therefore have to wait 
               <br />
               for their decision to decide whether this 
               <br />
               Bill is legal or not. But I venture to say 
               <br />
               that the free and independent elector, the 
               <br />
               ordinary man, as he reads the 92nd clause 
               <br />
               of the British North America Act, will have 
               <br />
               no hesitation in concluding that so far as 
               <br />
               education is concerned, that is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question;</span> 
               <br />
               which ‘has to be left to the province, with 
               <br />
               the exception that this parliament has the 
               <br />
               right to pass a remedial law in the event 
               <br />
               of any province not carrying out the law as 
               <br />
               it is in the statute-books.

               My hon. friend has said we should live 
               <br />
               in peace and harmony. We all agree with 
               <br />
               that, we would like to live in peace and 
               <br />
               harmony with all men in all parts of this 
               <br />
               fair Dominion of ours, but in order to do 
               <br />
               that we have rights and we have privileges 
               <br />
               which we must guard and guard safely. 
               <br />
               We must remember that the majority have 
               <br />
               rights which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> should exercise just as 
               <br />
               freely as do the minority. My hon. friend

               attempted to make a point against the lead—
