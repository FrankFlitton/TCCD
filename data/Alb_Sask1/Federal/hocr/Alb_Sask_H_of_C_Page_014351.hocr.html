               dress the House in the beautiful language 
               <br />
               in which he has done, I crave the in- 
               <br />
               dulgence of my colleagues if I speak the 
               <br />
               language of the majority. In listening to 
               <br />
               my hon. friend I have been astonished to 
               <br />
               observe the conclusions at which he has 
               <br />
               arrived. My hon. friend has discussed only 
               <br />
               one phase of the measure now before the 
               <br />
               House, which indicates, I suppose, the great 
               <br />
               interest that is taken in the clause respect- 
               <br />
               ing the schools, while as a matter of fact 
               <br />
               there are other things to be considered. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend commenced his remarks by cast- 
               <br />
               ing reﬂections upon those who preceded 
               <br />
               lum.' He endeavoured to make political 
               <br />
               party capital of the question which is now 
               <br />
               being debated in parliament. It is true, 
               <br />
               it is a political question; but we were 
               <br />
               told, at the commencement of the discussion 
               <br />
               of this measure, that we had to stand upon 
               <br />
               very high ground, because it was a very 
               <br />
               important and very dangerous question to 
               <br />
               discuss. My hon. friend, in the beginning 
               <br />
               of his remarks referred to the educational 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> in the republic to the south of us; 
               <br />
               he then spoke about the Educational Act 
               <br />
               of Manitoba; he went 011 to say that this 
               <br />
               was a question of justice ; and, after speak- 
               <br />
               ing on the interpretation of our constitution, 
               <br />
               he concluded by saying that he would not 
               <br />
               be able, by the vote which he intends to 
               <br />
               give, to render to those who are interested 
               <br />
               in this measure, all that he would like to 
               <br />
               give them, but that he would do the best 
               <br />
               he could. My hon. friend, in speaking about 
               <br />
               the constitution, reminded me of an old 
               <br />
               saying of an American politician, that pat- 
               <br />
               riotism is the refuge of scoundrels. Here I 
               <br />
               am afraid we have been playing a great 
               <br />
               . deal with the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               Although my right hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the government stood upon the rock of the 
               <br />
               constitution when he spoke on the 21st of 
               <br />
               February, and although my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition also stands on 
               <br />
               the rock of the constitution, to my mind that 
               <br />
               rock is not very solid; and since 1896, the 
               <br />
               less <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘we</span> speak about the British North 
               <br />
               America Act the better. To show how little 
               <br />
               we can depend upon the rules which were 
               <br />
               laid down at the time the British North Am- 
               <br />
               erica Act was passed, my hon. friend from 
               <br />
               St. John and Iberville (Mr. Demers) said 
               <br />
               a few moments ago that you would ﬁnd 
               <br />
               in that Act that in the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               there must for ever be twelve counties re- 
               <br />
               presented by Protestants. 
               <br />

               <br />
               did not say that. I said that so long as 
               <br />
               the majority of those twelve counties did 
               <br />

               <br />
               Now, Sir, there are other questions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> 
               <br />
               volved in the Bill before the House. Many 
               <br />
               speeches have been made and many things 
               <br />
               have been written since it was introduced 
               <br />
               into this House, and I would have been 
               <br />
               very glad to have heard my hon. friend 
               <br />
               speak on some of these matters. There are 
               <br />
               the creation of the two provinces, the deli- 
               <br />
               mitation of the provinces, the question of the 
               <br />
               lands, and the school question. It is most 
               <br />
               extraordinary that since this Bill was 
               <br />
               brought before parliament we have heard 
               <br />
               very little of the other matters; we have 
               <br />
               heard more of the school question than of 
               <br />
               anything else. Well, Sir, I intend to say 
               <br />
               just a word or two on the other points. 
               <br />
               With regard to the delimitation of the 
               <br />
               provinces, I would prefer to leave that 
               <br />
               to the members who are most interested. 
               <br />
               I admit at once that I do not know enough 
               <br />
               of the geography of those two provinces to 
               <br />
               say whether the delimitation made by the 
               <br />
               right hon. leader of the government is a 
               <br />
               good one or not. I may say, however, that 
               <br />
               I was satisﬁed to have the territory made 
               <br />
               into two provinces instead of one, although 
               <br />
               personally I would have been gratiﬁed to 
               <br />
               see the province of Manitoba enlarged. 
               <br />
               With regard to the lands, if we were 
               <br />
               following the constitution to the letter, ac- 
               <br />
               cording to clause 109 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, we would have to give to the 
               <br />
               provinces the control of their public lands; 
               <br />
               but since we do not intend to follow the 
               <br />
               British North America Act all through, I am 
               <br />
               prepared to let it go by so far as the lands 
               <br />
               are concerned, and to say that I approve of 
               <br />
               the position taken y the government. At 
               <br />
               ﬁrst I was not in favour of that. My 
               <br />
               view is conﬁrmed, not so much by the 
               <br />
               British North America Act as by the fact 
               <br />
               that we have paid a very large sum of 
               <br />
               money for those lands, and that we are 
               <br />
               spending a great deal of money every year 
               <br />
               to bring in immigrants to settle upon them, 
               <br />
               and neglecting the vacant lands in the older 
               <br />
               provinces—I refer especially to the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec. But having thought the matter 
               <br />
               over, and, I may say without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> false- 
               <br />
               modesty, inﬂuenced by some of the speeches 
               <br />
               made in this House, I concluded that it 
               <br />
               would be in the best interest of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> 
               <br />
               for this parliament to hold its hands upon 
               <br />
               those lands in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               We expect to have in that country a very 
               <br />
