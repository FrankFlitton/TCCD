               Mr. FOSTER. But it certainly is pertinent 
               <br />
               to the present question. The right hon. gen- 
               <br />

               <br />
               contends. a fair distribution can be made. 
               <br />
               That basis, presumably, applies to both pro-

               vinces ;—certainly a basis of general princi-

               ple cannot be wrong for Saskatchewan and 
               <br />
               right for Alberta. But, when the principle is 
               <br />
               worked out in the case of Saskatchewan, it 
               <br />
               produces the most enormous disparity, as 
               <br />
               Ihown by my hon. friend from Qu’Appelle 
               <br />

               ments there has been no answer. I think

               there ought to be an answer.

               <br />
               (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) why the unit of repre- 
               <br />
               sentation is so greatly departed from ? 
               <br />
               Whether we deal with the number of votes 
               <br />
               cast or the number of names on the list there 
               <br />
               are remarkable discrepancies. For instance, 
               <br />
               at Rosebud, there are 749 votes cast and 
               <br />
               1,189 on the list. At High River, there were 
               <br />
               971 votes cast and 1,528 on the list. Why 
               <br />
               does the right hon. gentleman make some 
               <br />
               constituencies so much below the unit of 
               <br />
               population and others so much above it ? We 
               <br />
               go upon the basis of population. As there 
               <br />
               are no municipal divisions, you are at liberty 
               <br />
               to make the ridings approximately the same, 
               <br />
               one would think. I have not heard or read 
               <br />
               anything in this debate which would indicate 
               <br />
               a reason for these disparities.

               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. I assume that in 
               <br />
               dealing with the conditions, you deal with 
               <br />
               them as you did with the provinces in 1903. 
               <br />
               You think that you have some evidence as 
               <br />
               to what the population is, although my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. Turriff) seems to think that 
               <br />
               these ﬁgures are not a sufﬁcient guide, and 
               <br />
               in that I agree with him. But assuming, 
               <br />
               for the purpose of argument, that they are, 
               <br />
               you must, I suppose adopt a unit of popu- 
               <br />
               lation. When we redistributed for the 
               <br />
               Dominion we adopted a unit, I think, of 
               <br />
               about 25,000. When you are ﬁxing the 
               <br />
               divisions of the province of Alberta, you 
               <br />
               likewise adopt a unit of population, if you 
               <br />
               are proceeding on the basis of population. 
               <br />
               as I understand you are. What is the 
               <br />
               unit of populatiOn which the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has adopted and why is it you 
               <br />
               depart so largely from it ?

               ﬁve or six different sources, but unfortun- 
               <br />
               ately we can only get an approximate ﬁgure. 
               <br />
               If we were dealing with any of the eastern 
               <br />
               provinces, we could take the census of 1901, 
               <br />
               and no one would seriously object to that. 
               <br />
               But we know that in the Northwest the 
               <br />
               conditions are not at all to-day what they 
               <br />
               were then, and we have had to take recourse 
               <br />
               to other sources of information, such as the
