               Hon. GEORGE E. FOSTER. I would 
               <br />
               like to call the attention of the ministers 
               <br />
               to the delay in bringing down returns. The 
               <br />
               delay seems a little inordinate; may be 
               <br />
               it is not, but I would like to draw the 
               <br />
               attention of the Premier to the following: 
               <br />
               There are the returns from the Minister 
               <br />
               of Railways with reference to the hay 
               <br />
               transport question. We think that by this 
               <br />
               time they should be ready and we would 
               <br />
               like to get them as soon as possible. Then 
               <br />
               there is one with reference to the Royal 
               <br />
               Mint and another, of which I cannot com- 
               <br />
               plain, because it has not been passed so 
               <br />
               long, with reference to public buildings in 
               <br />
               towns of 5,000 population, or less. That is 
               <br />
               a return which should take a very short 
               <br />
               time to prepare and I would be glad to 
               <br />
               have it as soon as possible.
