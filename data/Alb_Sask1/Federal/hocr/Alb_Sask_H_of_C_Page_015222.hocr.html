               <br />
               Paciﬁc Bill a couple of years ago. Let me 
               <br />
               say to my hon. friend from Calgary (Mr. 
               <br />
               M. S. McCarthy) who made a comparison 
               <br />
               with British Columbia, that if we allow 
               <br />
               ourselves to drift into comparisons of de- 
               <br />
               tails with respect to the several provinces, 
               <br />
               we shall ﬁnd between every province in 
               <br />
               Canada just as acute differences as he 
               <br />
               ﬁnds between the way British Columbia 
               <br />
               was treated with regard to a strip along

               the new provinces are being treated in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legard‘to</span> their lands. In fact, the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman overlooked the most striking case 
               <br />
               of all, that of Prince Edward Island. That 
               <br />
               province is allowed $45,000 a year, as I 
               <br />
               understand. not exactly in lieu of lands, 
               <br />
               but on account of the fact that she had not 
               <br />
               any lands. Now see what scope there is in 
               <br />
               that citation for the purpose of comparison. 
               <br />
               Take the case of Manitoba. I recollect read- 
               <br />
               ing a statement made by the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Manitoba a couple of weeks ago, in 
               <br />
               which he pointed out that the maximum 
               <br />
               revenue provided under the arrangement 
               <br />
               made by a Conservative government of 
               <br />
               this Dominion with that province, would be 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$648,000,</span> that would be the maximum re- 
               <br />
               venue they would receive under the existing 
               <br />
               arrangement when that province reached 
               <br />
               the maximum population provided for. He 
               <br />
               then pointed out, with every appearance of 
               <br />
               a deep sense of grievance, that these new 
               <br />
               provinces will have a maximum revenue of 
               <br />
               $2,207,000.

               of the new provinces. Now let me say to the 
               <br />
               hon. member for North Toronto and the hon. 
               <br />
               member for North Lanark (Mr. Haggart), or 
               <br />
               to any one else who may think that too much 
               <br />
               money is being granted by these resolutions 
               <br />

               <br />
               minds at rest in that regard. While we have 
               <br />
               not perhaps the actual measurement in acres 
               <br />
               of the quantity of land. while perhaps we 
               <br />
               are not able to arrive at an absolute esti- 
               <br />
               mate of the value of these lands, I think no 
               <br />
               person has any doubt about the fact that we 
               <br />
               have an enormous public domain out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there.</span> 
               <br />
               and that if a private corporation had that 
               <br />
               domain in its possession and treated it en- 
               <br />
               tirely from the point of view of revenue, 
               <br />
               they would consider it worth a great deal 
               <br />
               more than the $75.000,000 which is specified 
               <br />
               in these resolutions for both provinces. If 
               <br />
               this government decided to treat that public 
               <br />
               domain strictly from the point of view of 
               <br />
               revenue, I venture to think they would be 
               <br />
               able to dispose of it for a considerably larger 
               <br />
               amount than $75,000,000. Even if we knew 
               <br />
               the exact number of acres of wheat lands, 
               <br />
               the exact number of acres of grazing lands. 
               <br />
               the exact area of timber lands, and of 
               <br />
               mineral lands, we could not be much 
               <br />
               further ahead than we are at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time. I do not suppose there are 
               <br />
               any two individuals who would agree 
               <br />
               as to the value to be put upon this enormous 
               <br />
               public domain. I might say, as the ex-Min- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">letter</span> of the Interior said with regard to these 
               <br />
               50,000,000 acres, that in a short time they 
               <br />
               may bring $3 an acre. Probably he was 
               <br />
               right. Or I might be disposed to think 
               <br />
               that they may be worth even $5 an acre; 
               <br />
               and by stretching the time a little, that in 
               <br />
               twenty—ﬁve or thirty years hence, if some of 
               <br />
               these lands still remain in possession of the 
               <br />
               Dominion government, they may be worth 
               <br />
               $30, $40 or $50 an acre. As I say, it is im- 
               <br />
               possible to agree upon an estimate with re- 
               <br />
               gard to their value. When we were in con- 
               <br />
               sultation about this matter we had the ad— 
               <br />
               vantage of the presence with us of the hon.
