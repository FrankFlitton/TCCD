               Now, from the statement which was made 
               <br />
               to all Canada the other day, we must infer 
               <br />
               that the Dominion Lands Act is to be chang- 
               <br />
               ed, and that in the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               these school lands, which are now conse- 
               <br />
               crated to public schools, not to separate 
               <br />
               schools, are to be sold, and the proceeds dis- 
               <br />
               tributed in an entirely different way. That 
               <br />
               follows from the statement made here the 
               <br />
               other day, and on behalf of Manitoba I pro- 
               <br />
               test to-day against any such change in the 
               <br />
               law, or any such chastisement being meted 
               <br />
               out to that province as is proposed by this 
               <br />
               organ of the government. That organ 
               <br />
               wants Manitoba chastised because of cer- 
               <br />
               tain laws which that province has passed 
               <br />
               in connection with the school lands, and yet 
               <br />
               this same organ is the mouthpiece of this 
               <br />
               government, of which the Minister of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               because the proposal about to be made here 
               <br />
               is of a most far reaching character. Not 
               <br />
               only the school lands of Manitoba, but the 
               <br />
               whole educational fund of that province, is 
               <br />
               to be changed by a general Act, which must 
               <br />
               follow from what was said here the other 
               <br />

               legislation is in order as concerns Mani-

               toba. The argument is an a fortiori one. 
               <br />
               Remedial legislation must follow, and it 
               <br />
               will be introduced in this House by the

               <br />
               There is this prospect for Manitoba, that all 
               <br />
               her schools lands are, in every probability,

               <br />
               these very so called grievances are due to

               I am told, isto be his immediate successorin

               bility the absence of the hon. the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior from this House ever since the

               of the hon. member for Lisgar, (Mr. Green- 
               <br />

               their manifest duty in connection with this 
               <br />
               matter. The hon. the Minister of the In-

               terior was here only for a moment the other 
               <br />
               day, and his absence no doubt is due, as 
               <br />
               well as that of the other hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               to what is in the immediate future in store 
               <br />

               those school lands are to be diverted from 
               <br />
               their present purpose and a Remedial Bill 
               <br />

               <br />
               claims to be the defender of provincial rights 
               <br />

               <br />
               toâ€”day doing nothing to prevent the shackles

               being put on the provinces of this great and 
               <br />
               free Dominion. These provinces are to-day

               free, and my-right hon. friend must know 
               <br />
               that if there is one thing which the people 
               <br />
               who breathe the free air of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prairies,</span> the

               people of the great west, value, it is their 
               <br />
               political liberty ; and if the right hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">genÂ«</span> 
               <br />
               tleman insists on shackling these people 
               <br />
               in connection with the dispossession of their 
               <br />
               school lands, he will make a great mistake. 
               <br />
               He apparently does not understand the 
               <br />
               genius of. the western people if he thinks 
               <br />
               that by aid of any constitutional argument, 
               <br />
               he can interfere with the school lands of the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba. I leave the case for 
               <br />
               the present but may have to return to it.

               Mr. W. F. MACLEAX. But I shall wait

               until the Minister of the interior is in his

               <br />
