               <br />
               think there are substantial reasons why 
               <br />
               we should not do that. Any man who 
               <br />
               is familiar with the history of this ques- 
               <br />
               tion in this country would, I think, pause 
               <br />
               before permitting this troublesome ques-

               made too stable and enduring. Permanency

               manency removes an irritating and danger—

               a different song being sung by the persons 
               <br />
               who are clamouring against this legislation 
               <br />

               <br />
               minority existing to-day in that country 
               <br />
               should change, the one taking the place of 
               <br />
               the other, better is it I say, a thousand times

               that this educational system should be

               crystallized into an Act of parliament which 
               <br />
               will give it the element of permanency and 
               <br />

               cry is echoed among the minority in Quebec. 
               <br />
               which has everything to lose by it. The decla-

               ple who would not submit for a moment to

               such a system of schools as the majority in

               <br />
               surprise, ‘Why, that is a totally different 
               <br />
               thing, the Quebec system would be sectarian, 
               <br />

               <br />
               carried on as to offend no religion.’ They do 
               <br />
               not see that this is begging the question. 0! 
               <br />
               course the two ideals are very different. If it 
               <br />
               were not so, there would be none of this trouble. 
               <br />
               But just as strong as is our objection to the 
               <br />
               clerical sch-001 for our children,.so strong is' 
               <br />
               the objection of the Roman Catholic for the 
               <br />
               non-clerical school. People may say they do 
               <br />
               not believe this; that many Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               in their hearts prefer the non—sectarian school. 
               <br />
               This is not to the purpose; they say they do 
               <br />
               not hold these conscientious objections, and.

               When they cease to prefer separate schools 
               <br />
               they will presumably have none. We may say 
               <br />
               it is only the priests who want the separate 
               <br />
               schools. but our system of government is based 
               <br />
               on persuasion, and, if they can persuade the 
               <br />
               people more than we can, we have to accept 
               <br />
               the declarations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> our fellow citizens as to 
               <br />
               what they really do want.
