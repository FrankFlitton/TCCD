               the revenue from the lands has been inﬂated 
               <br />
               and shows well in our revenue returns. from 
               <br />
               the fact that they take credit for having 
               <br />
               paid off a lot of scrip to satisfy some senti-

               <br />
               posed to have in that country. Well, we 
               <br />
               know there was far more land handed over 
               <br />
               to the half—breeds than they had any right 
               <br />
               to. In many sections all that was necessary 
               <br />
               to get <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hralfebreed</span> scrip in the Northwest was

               between the lands of the company; and 
               <br />
               when the intending settler comes in and 
               <br />

               think our position has been made fairly

               plain. Our claim is that the Northwest

               people should manage their own educational

               nizes only two classes of people, namely, 
               <br />
               Protestants and Catholics. Now it would 
               <br />
               be interesting to know what is meant by 
               <br />
               Protestants. I had always understood that 
               <br />
               the term ‘Protestant’ meant Christians

               which we can use the term. it means any

               there to-day who are neither Protestants 
               <br />
               1101' Roman Catholics. I would like to know

               what, under the provisions of this Bill. is

               control of their own education, and they 
               <br />
               have just as good a claim for their separate 
               <br />
               schools as have our Roman Catholic friends, 
               <br />
               sentimentally, legally or in any other way 
               <br />
               we may look at it. Why should we adopt 
               <br />
               a system and force it on the Territories 
               <br />
               which they might ﬁnd it necessary to extend 
               <br />
               in a few years. Because I hold that to give 
               <br />
               to any one branch of the Christian religion 
               <br />
