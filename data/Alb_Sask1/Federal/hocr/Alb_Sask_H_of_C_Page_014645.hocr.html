               I had thought that such statements as 
               <br />
               those were things of the past and would 
               <br />
               not be repeated. I had thought that the 
               <br />
               action of this country in 1896 had well 
               <br />

               own position is concerned I feel that no

               hon. gentleman to place the charge at my 
               <br />
               door that I am seeking political preterment 
               <br />
               from the leader of either political party, 
               <br />
               because, Sir, I am forced to the conclusion—— 
               <br />
               and I speak most diiiidently and respect- 
               <br />
               fully, because I recognize tile posi- 
               <br />
               tion of these two hon. gentlemen in the 
               <br />
               country—but I am forced to diﬂfer from 
               <br />
               them both in the conclusion to which I 
               <br />
               have come. The reason why I differ from 
               <br />
               them both is that I make hold to say that 
               <br />
               the policy of the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               (Mr. R. L. Borden) it carried to its ultimate 
               <br />
               conclusion will be found to be practically 
               <br />
               in accord with the policy of the leader of 
               <br />
               the government. It is perhaps difﬁcult at 
               <br />
               present to realize that, but I hope before I 
               <br />
               conclude to be able to demonstrate it. I 
               <br />
               do hope, and I say it with all sincerity, 
               <br />
               that no remarks which I make on this 
               <br />
               occasion will have the effect of inﬂaming 
               <br />
               an already too much inﬂamed country upon 
               <br />
               this question which can surely be discussed 
               <br />
               without a display of passion, and without a 
               <br />
               raising of sectarian cries. It ought to be, 
               <br />
               in my humble judgment, a question of 
               <br />
               policy; policies should be enunciated by 
               <br />
               the two parties in this House, but appar- 
               <br />
               ently it is being dealt with in quite a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diiferent</span> way. Charges are thrown across 
               <br />

               <br />
               raising cries of race and religion. It is 
               <br />
               impossible to prevent that so long as hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen behave as they are doing and 
               <br />
               as they have done in the past.
