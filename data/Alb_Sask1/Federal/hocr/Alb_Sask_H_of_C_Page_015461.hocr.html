               as I should in important matters from the 
               <br />
               Department of Justice. The only reasons 
               <br />
               for inserting a capital sum and the interest 
               <br />
               thereon is this that in all past negotiations 
               <br />
               or arrangements between the Dominion and 
               <br />
               the provinces, you make a certain allowance 
               <br />
               in connection with What is known as the 
               <br />
               debit account and in order that you may 
               <br />
               deal fairly with a province it is necessary 
               <br />
               to know the basis on which such arrange- 
               <br />
               ments are made. It is a convenience in 
               <br />
               comparisons hereafter, to have thematter 
               <br />
               thus stated, but the amount allowed is not 
               <br />
               interest; it is a sum equivalent to the in- 
               <br />
               terest and I believe that legal gentlemen

               a capital advance, and I think I recollect 
               <br />
               the statement made in the House at that 
               <br />
               time that it was possible for the other 
               <br />
               provincial governments to draw from their 
               <br />
               capital if they wished to do so. For in- 
               <br />
               stance there was a certain number of mil~ 
               <br />
               liOn dollars standing as capital account to 
               <br />
               the credit of New Brunswick or Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, and it was open to those provincial 
               <br />
               governments to draw that capital although 
               <br />
               of course afterwards they would draw less 
               <br />
               interest and certainly, speaking on behalf

               Mr. FOSTER. If my hon. friend were 
               <br />
               Wise and were looking after the interests 
               <br />
               of the Northwest provinces, I think he 
               <br />
               would rather have the matter arranged so 
               <br />
               that they could not withdraw and dissipate 
               <br />
               their capital. If they had the sum of $8,- 
               <br />
               000,000 which they felt they could with- 
               <br />
               draw by the million or half million each 
               <br />
               year, it would be an additional temptation 
               <br />
               to them to dissipate for present needs what 
               <br />
               should be kept for the future. I would 
               <br />
               have it understood that while they could 
               <br />
               draw the percentage of that from year to 
               <br />
               year, it should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘kept</span> as a never-failing 
               <br />
               source of income. I think it is a questlon 
               <br />
               whether the maritime provinces have done 
               <br />
               the best for themselves by dissipating their 
               <br />
               capital and drawing upon it for present 
               <br />
               necessities and coming to the point of ﬁnd- 
               <br />
               ing a diminishing revenue because they 
               <br />
               have eaten up their capital. It I were 
               <br />
               from the Northwest, I should want to have 
               <br />
               it ﬁxed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the capital from which the 
               <br />

               diminished, or liable to be taken for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dre”</span> '

               would be better for the province.
