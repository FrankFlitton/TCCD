               <br />
               these circumstances justice cannot be done. 
               <br />
               There are in that country hundreds and 
               <br />
               thousands of this class of men who are be- 
               <br />
               coming rich year after year at the expense 
               <br />
               of the country. Large tracts of land are 
               <br />
               sold to speculators for very small sums. 
               <br />
               There is a condition that they have to set- 
               <br />
               tle so much land, but this is not always 
               <br />
               carried out. Different arrangements are 
               <br />
               made and the result is that the country is 
               <br />
               suffering because they are not settling the 
               <br />
               land to the extent that it should be settled, 
               <br />
               and that it would be if the land were in 
               <br />
               the hands of the provinces. I venture to 
               <br />
               say that there is to-day a state of corrup- 
               <br />
               tion in that country that could not exist 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               this I speak whereof I know, that if a com-

               mission was issued and if an examination 
               <br />
               were made, it would be found that the 
               <br />
               state of aifairs is much worse up there 
               <br />
               than I have described it. It is preventing

               settlement, it is preventing people from 
               <br />
               going in there, it is preventing men who

               <br />
               that we have heard pilt forward by hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite is that they should hold 
               <br />
               these lands in order that they may control 
               <br />
               the immigration policy. I submit that if 
               <br />
               there is one branch of the administration 
               <br />
               which these provinces should have in their 
               <br />
               own hands. it is immigration. We know 
               <br />
               that immigration may prove a curse or a 
               <br />
               blessing. If we have immigrants coming 
               <br />

               <br />
               if we have a great many immigrants who 
               <br />
               will not make good citizens, who are phy~

               I say these immigrants will prove a curse 
               <br />
               rather than a blessing. It is a regrettable

               circumstance that we have had so many

               markable fact that a large class of these

               immigrants have been brought into this 
               <br />

               a state of affairs, which, I submit, should 
               <br />
               not exist. According to the returns of the 
               <br />
               last year, we brought into this country 
               <br />
               134,223 immigrants, of whom 17,055 were 
               <br />
               under twelve years of age. We paid for 
               <br />
               the inspection of these immigrants to medi- 
               <br />
               cal men, a total of $542,126, or $3.57 for the 
               <br />
               inspection of each immigrant. Yet, we all 
               <br />
               know that to-day there are hundreds and 
               <br />
               thousands physically unﬁt to make their 
               <br />

               charge upon the Dominion or the province 
               <br />
               where they are, and we hear from the chari- 
               <br />
               table institutions all over this Dominion 
               <br />
               that the greater number of those for whom 
               <br />
               they have to provide are the immigrants 
               <br />
               that are brought into the country. We 
               <br />
               know that many of them are affected with 
               <br />
               contagious diseases, that many are affected 
               <br />
               with eye diseases, that they have had 
               <br />
               from infancy, and that if the medical ex- 
               <br />
               amination had been as thorough as it should 
               <br />
               have been, the state of affairs that we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               in regard to immigration could not exist. 
               <br />
               Only a few were deported last year, prov- 
               <br />
               ing beyond a doubt that whilst we have 
               <br />
               paid large sums for the services of these 
               <br />
               medical inspectors, the examinations were 
               <br />
               not such as should have been made, and 
               <br />
               that those who to-day are imposing the 
               <br />
               greatest burden upon the charitable institu- 
               <br />
               tions are these immigrants. Under these 
               <br />
               circumstances, I submit We have a state 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alfairs</span> which could not exist if the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces had supervision over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> lands 
               <br />
               and of immigrant work, the provinces hav— 
               <br />
               ing much more interest in this work than 
               <br />
               the Dominion has. Under these circum- 
               <br />
               stances, I submit that it would be much 
               <br />
               better that they should have the lands. 
               <br />
               They could make more out of them and 
               <br />
               they could have settlers of a desirable class 
               <br />
               coming in under their supervision. Then, 
               <br />
               again, I submit that the land belongs to 
               <br />
               the provinces. It is true that the Dominion 
               <br />
               of Canada paid £300,000 for that country, 
               <br />
               not for the land, but for the right of the 
               <br />
               Hudson Bay Company to hunt. There— 
               <br />
               fore, I say that the land, as I read the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, should and does 
               <br />
               belong to the provinces. If the other pro- 
               <br />
               vinces require all the land they can get in 
               <br />
               order to make ends meet, if they require 
               <br />
               money, and if they run in debt year after 
               <br />
               year, how is it that these new provinCes 
               <br />
               with the amount of money which is to be 
               <br />
               placed at their disposal, will be able to im- 
               <br />
               prove that country as they should ? They 
               <br />
               have to provide charitable institutions for 
               <br />
               that unfortunate class that is rapidly in- 
               <br />
               creasing in all countries, the insane. They
