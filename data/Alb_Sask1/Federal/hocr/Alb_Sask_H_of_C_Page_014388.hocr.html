               the federated provinces. It was to open up 
               <br />
               channels for the trade of the east. That was 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst reason for the building of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. The later and 
               <br />
               perhaps the most cogent reason was that 
               <br />
               it was absolutely imperative. if faith was 
               <br />
               to be kept with British Columbia, that a rail- 
               <br />
               way should be built across the continent. 
               <br />
               A contract was made by the Dominion gov— 
               <br />
               ernment with the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               and the consideration on the part of Canada 
               <br />
               included a grant of money, a grant of land 
               <br />
               and exemption from taxation. The North- 
               <br />
               west Territories are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> paying their 
               <br />
               share of the interest on that money grant 
               <br />
               so we will wipe that question away. How- 
               <br />
               ever in addition to that which is imposed on 
               <br />
               them in common with the rest of Canada 
               <br />
               they are contributing a land grant not only 
               <br />
               for that portion of the line which was built 
               <br />
               in the Territories, but also for that portion 
               <br />
               which was built in British Columbia and 
               <br />
               for a part of the line which was built in 
               <br />
               Ontario and in Manitoba. Now, Sir, that is 
               <br />
               a great burden upon the country. The 
               <br />
               result of it is that millions of money which 
               <br />
               have been made in that country and which 
               <br />
               should be kept in the country to develop its 
               <br />
               resources are being sent out in payment for 
               <br />
               the lands. \Ve have claimed compensation 
               <br />
               in the draft Bill for such lands as were 
               <br />
               alienated by the Dominion_g0vernment for 
               <br />
               purely Dominion purposes. Our demand in 
               <br />
               that respect has apparently not received 
               <br />
               consideration and all I desire at this mo- 
               <br />
               ment is simply to mention the fact and to 
               <br />
               enter my protest because it has not been 
               <br />
               considered. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               To turn to the third consideration for 
               <br />
               the building of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. The exemption from taxation is a 
               <br />
               very unjust burden and it falls entirely on 
               <br />
               the shoulders of the new provinces. It is 
               <br />
               an unjust burden which was incurred for 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of the whole of Canada, and 
               <br />
               the Dominion should relieve us from it. The 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament made the contract and 
               <br />
               incurred the obligation. There was no pro- 
               <br />
               vinclal legislature at the time ; if there had 
               <br />
               been one in existence I do not suppose it 
               <br />
               would have been possible that such a con- 
               <br />
               tract would have been made. A very 
               <br />
               strong point was made in the argu- 
               <br />
               ment which accompanied the draft Bill in 
               <br />
               this respect. It was urged in the strongest 
               <br />
               terms that this unjust burden should be 
               <br />
               removed from the shoulders of the new 
               <br />
               provinces. In the teeth of this protest we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that it is actually proposed in this Bill 
               <br />
               to rivet the burden on the new provinces 
               <br />
               as part of their constitution. I can see no 
               <br />
               possible reason for such action as that, 
               <br />
               and I enter against it my strongest protest. 
               <br />
               I hope that when this Bill comes to the 
               <br />
               committee stage the government will see 
               <br />
               ﬁt to withdraw that particular clause.

               <br />
               we claim that we have just as much 
               <br />
               right as any other province in the Do-
