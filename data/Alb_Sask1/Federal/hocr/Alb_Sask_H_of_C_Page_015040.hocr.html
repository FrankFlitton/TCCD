               past these racial and religious quarrels. 
               <br />
               We are too near grown-up people to go on

               in the way that the old provinces went many

               years ago. I think the time is past for 
               <br />
               these things. I am of opinion, Sir, 
               <br />
               that Canada is destined to expand and
