               Sir 'WILFRID LAURIER. I have given 
               <br />
               my opinion for what it is worth and I 
               <br />
               have said that although I have been 9: 
               <br />
               lawyer it was many, many years ago and 
               <br />
               I do not pretend to give a legal opinion. 
               <br />
               I have given my opinion for what it is 
               <br />
               worth and if my hon. friend reads the Act, 
               <br />
               not section 137 alone, but the whole con- 
               <br />
               text, I think you will ﬁnd there is a pre- 
               <br />
               vious section which gives the power to have 
               <br />
               separate schools and that power is given to 
               <br />
               Protestants and Catholics. Therefore the 
               <br />
               Act deals with Protestants and Catholics 
               <br />
               and when this class of legislation was 
               <br />
               introduced into this country there were 
               <br />
               practically the only two classes although 
               <br />
               it is different now. and therefore my con- 
               <br />
               tention would be that all the sections in- 
               <br />
               tended to preserve the rights must be con- 
               <br />
               strued with the general tenor of the Act.
