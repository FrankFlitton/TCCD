               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I suppose. so fa' as 
               <br />
               that is concerned, if you apply the constitu— 
               <br />
               tion of Canada it depends on whether sub- 
               <br />
               section 4 would apply. If my hon. friend 
               <br />
               had been careful enough to read my speech 
               <br />
               he would have seen that I had already pro- 
               <br />
               nounced an opinion on that and he need 
               <br />
               not have asked me the question. I said that 
               <br />
               in my opinion, the application of subsection 
               <br />
               1 might give the answer as to the applica- 
               <br />
               tion of subsection 4, and I thought subsec- 
               <br />
               tion 1 would not apply to conditions existing 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories.</span> Some hon. gentlemen on 
               <br />
               this side of the House have not taken that 
               <br />
               view, and most hon. gentlemen on the other 
               <br />
               side have taken precisely the opposite view. 
               <br />
               That is a point on which I do not pretend to 
               <br />
               have a very strong opinion. I have not con- 
               <br />
               sidered it very carefully. My proposition 
               <br />
               was simply to apply the constitution of Can- 
               <br />
               ada as contained in the Acts of 1867, 1871 
               <br />
               and 1886 to these new provinces. I was pre- 
               <br />
               pared and am prepared to abide by the re— 
               <br />
               sult of the application of that constitution. 
               <br />
               But in any event. I would point out to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend that the question of remedial 
               <br />
               legislation could not be one of very great 
               <br />
               importance in his opinion, because, if the 
               <br />
               minority in the provinces would apply for 
               <br />
               remedial legislation, undoubtedly my hon. 
               <br />
               friend and his leader would oppose it in the 
               <br />
               future just as they did in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1896.</span>
