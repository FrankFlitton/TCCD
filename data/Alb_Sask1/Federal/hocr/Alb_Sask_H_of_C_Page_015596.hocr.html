               You see, therefore, that the work entrust- 
               <br />
               ed to the commissioners was simply to carry 
               <br />
               out the intentions of parliament. They 
               <br />
               were asked to look at old charts and old 
               <br />
               maps, to ﬁnd out the grouping of the popu- 
               <br />
               lation and so on, in order to get the best 
               <br />
               division that could be made. They were 
               <br />
               to have so many constituencies within a 
               <br />
               certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">area,</span> and to divide so many boroughs 
               <br />
               and so many counties in order to produce so 
               <br />
               many electoral divisions. It was found that 
               <br />
               could not be done by parliament in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng‘</span> 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land,</span> because information was needed which 
               <br />
               parliament could not possibly ascertain of 
               <br />
               itself. There are no such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculties</span> confront-

               ing us in the present case as were experi- 
               <br />
               enced in England. We have a very sparse 
               <br />
               population in the Northwest Territories: 
               <br />
               there are no ranges of mountains to divide 
               <br />
               population on one side or the other; there 
               <br />
               are no large rivers, except those which are 
               <br />
               well known to us; there are not many 
               <br />
               streams, and therefore we are cognizant of 
               <br />
               all the conditions which enable us to do the 
               <br />
               mechanical work which, in England, was 
               <br />
               entrusted to commissioners. The leader of 
               <br />
               the (opposition asks what principles we 
               <br />
               have followed in‘ order to arrive at this con- 
               <br />
               clusion. Well, we have endeavoured to be 
               <br />
               guided by two p1'incip1es—-geographical con- 
               <br />
               ditions and population. These are the only 
               <br />
               two principles which we think should guide 
               <br />
               us under existing circumstances, and 
               <br />
               whether we have this matter settled here 
               <br />
               and now or whether we appoint a commis- 
               <br />
               sion of judges or of any other body, they 
               <br />
               will always have to come back in the last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span>

               resort, to those two guiding principles—geo-

               graphical position and distribution of popu-
