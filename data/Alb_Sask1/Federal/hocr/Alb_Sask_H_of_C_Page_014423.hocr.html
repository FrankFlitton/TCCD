               in the far future years, ﬁfty or one hundred 
               <br />
               years hence, as long as this confederation 
               <br />
               lasts whereas, on the other hand, and in 
               <br />
               the case of some of the other provinces 
               <br />
               ﬁfty or one hundred years hence, the Crown 
               <br />
               domain cannot be worth very much to 
               <br />
               those provinces so far as concerns their re- 
               <br />
               venues. The principle of the provincial 
               <br />
               right to a beneﬁcial interest in the 
               <br />
               land is recognized in the most substantial 
               <br />
               manner, and I am pleased to be able to 
               <br />
               say, because I believe it to be the truth, 
               <br />
               that the people of the Northwest are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emie</span> 
               <br />
               nently satisﬁed. I venture to say that there 
               <br />
               is scarcely a man in the Northwest. who is 
               <br />
               not actuated by partisan sentiment, but has 
               <br />
               stated. either to himself 01' to his neighbours, 
               <br />
               that this is a better proposition than would 
               <br />
               be the proposition to turn over the lands to 
               <br />
               local management. I may be permitted to 
               <br />
               give to the House some actual expressions 
               <br />
               of opinion on this point. So far as possible, 
               <br />
               I will not give partisan opinions. The
