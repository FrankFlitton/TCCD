               self alone, but both drafted the letter and 
               <br />
               sent it. The letter was referred to by the

               right hon. gentleman with something of a

               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman. The ﬁrst was 
               <br />
               when he told us of Mr. Haultain's position 
               <br />
               in the matter. Then too. there was a covert
