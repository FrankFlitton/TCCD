               <br />
               ada, I believe, and if anything like 25 cents 
               <br />
               a yard has been paid it is something mons- 
               <br />
               trous if the description that my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Victoria and Haliburton (Mr. Sam. 
               <br />
               Hughes) gave of the material there is cor- 
               <br />
               rect. If it is soft material and there is 
               <br />
               enough of it the outside price would be 5 
               <br />
               cents a yard. They could make a fortune 
               <br />
               at that. If I had 50,000.000, yes, 20,000,000 
               <br />
               yards to do I could get it done for 3 or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3%</span> 
               <br />
               cents a yard without any trouble. That is 
               <br />
               why I say that the condition about American 
               <br />
               dredges should not be passed over without 
               <br />
               attention being called to it. I need not say 
               <br />
               that my record is well known in that respect, 
               <br />
               or that for many years I have believed in 
               <br />
               protecting everything Canadain so long as 
               <br />
               it is real protection and not-something else 
               <br />
               under the name of it. I believe merefOi'e, 
               <br />
               in protecting Canadian dredges if capitalists 
               <br />
               or others in Canada will provide proper 
               <br />
               dredges that will do the sort of work that 
               <br />
               is to be done at reasonable figures. I am 
               <br />
               surprised that these dredges are not more 
               <br />
               numerous in Canada. I attribute it to the 
               <br />
               fact that there is seldom any large amount 
               <br />
               of Work to be done or that there is work 
               <br />
               of a sufficient quantity to justify their 
               <br />
               ownership. In this case the only way the 
               <br />
               public can get this work done is to allow 
               <br />
               competition with American dredges. If, on 
               <br />
               the other hand, they can use a modern suc— 
               <br />
               tion dredge this would have been a good op- 
               <br />
               portunity. The proper thing, it seems to 
               <br />
               me, is not to attack this work year after 
               <br />
               year but to adopt a comprehensive plan and 
               <br />
               carry it to a conclusion. The hon. minister 
               <br />
               says that the work for which tenders have 
               <br />
               been asked will only extend over one year, 
               <br />
               but at the same time it involves an expendi- 
               <br />
               ture of $100,000. The facilities of the na- 
               <br />
               ture of those proposed are not sufﬁcient, 
               <br />
               but if he would have his department make 
               <br />
               out a speciﬁcation of this work and invite 
               <br />
               tenders for the whole of it, permitting any 
               <br />
               one to bring in a dredge, I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisﬁed</span> 
               <br />
               that the contractor under such circum- 
               <br />
               stances could make a very large proﬁt at 
               <br />
               one—third of what we have been paying for 
               <br />
               that dredging there. I say therefore that 
               <br />
               the department should include American 
               <br />
               dredges in the advertisement for tenders. 
               <br />
               We want something more than the protec- 
               <br />
               tion of Canadian dredges. We want the 
               <br />
               protection of the public interest. and if as 
               <br />
               a result of that protection, exorbitant prices 
               <br />
               are exacted by the class of dredges that are 
               <br />
               here now for the beneﬁt of the few people 
               <br />
               owning these dredges, then apply the rule 
               <br />
               that the Conservative government applied 
               <br />
               to monopolies. If any article became the

               <br />
               the hon. minister has seen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁt</span> to introduce 
               <br />
               for the time being and which has led to the 
               <br />
               discussion of the extraordinary transaction 
               <br />
               which is disclosed here. I think therefore 
               <br />
               it would be well if he would consider in 
               <br />
               connection with this large work the Whole 
               <br />
               project at one time. and then, if Canadian-s 
               <br />
               will not bring in dredges or procure them 
               <br />
               so as to enable them to do the work at a 
               <br />
               reasonable price, he should give other 
               <br />
               dredges a chance to come in. I agree 
               <br />
               with the remarks of my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition in regard to that 
               <br />
               extraordinary provision which is contained 
               <br />
               in this advertisement. I cannot see what 
               <br />
               difference it makes where a man procures 
               <br />
               his dredge provided he procures it in time 
               <br />
               to do his work. It is impossible to do the 
               <br />
               work at such a price as it ought to be done 
               <br />
               at unless tenderer-s are allowed to buy 
               <br />
               and bring in a dredge if they are going to 
               <br />
               do it this summer. If such a privilege were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granted</span> by reason of the largeness of 
               <br />
               the contract a person could buy a dredge, 
               <br />
               bring it in and make a proﬁt, at half the 
               <br />
               price that was paid last year. He could 
               <br />
               well afford to bring in a dredge and the 
               <br />

               Mr. HYMAN. I have twice said that i 
               <br />
               will see that there is an extension of the 
               <br />
               advertisement and that I will carefully go 
               <br />
               over the advertisement and see if there is 
               <br />
               anything in it that should come out. I do 
               <br />
               not know that it would be necessary to 
               <br />
               publish it for thirty days. We will extend 
               <br />
               it for at least ﬁfteen days and I will con- 
               <br />
               sult with the department as to Whether 
               <br />
               there is any necessity for continuing it any 
               <br />
               longer.
