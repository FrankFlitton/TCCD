               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pretty</span> near to-morrow if it is to be in the

               'But here is another thought that comes 
               <br />
               up at the same time. All this, as I said at

               ﬁrst. is in pursuance of an hypothesis that 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister had determined to put 
               <br />

               <br />
               these are the methods he has taken to put 
               <br />
               it through—the autocratic methods. What 
               <br />
               is the inducement that brought ‘back the

               measure that is now before the House? 
               <br />
               What was the inducement—because there 
               <br />
               were strong inducements on the other side. 
               <br />
               On the other side were his principles, on 
               <br />
               the other side was his record from the old
