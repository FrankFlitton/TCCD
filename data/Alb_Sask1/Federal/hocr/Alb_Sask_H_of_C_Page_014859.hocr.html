               absolutely in earnest when I tell the govern-

               ment that in the case of Manitoba they 
               <br />
               have not nursed their child as they ought 
               <br />
               to have done. I hope my words will have 
               <br />
               some effect on them and that when they 
               <br />
               reconsider this matter—as I have no doubt 
               <br />
               they will reconsider the school clause they 
               <br />
               will extend our province to the west. The

               two clauses in this Bill which have been 
               <br />
               most discussed have been the land clauses 
               <br />
               and the educational clauses. I cannot agree 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend from Portage laPrairie 
               <br />
               tMr. Crawford) with regard to the lands. 
               <br />
               He is the most generous man I have ever 
               <br />
               heard at in this House from Manitoba; 
               <br />
               he is willing to give everything to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion government, but it seems to me that 
               <br />
               a representative of Manitoba is not doing 
               <br />
               his duty when he speaks in that way. I 
               <br />
               believe that the western provinces should 
               <br />
               own their lands just the same as Quebec, 
               <br />
               Ontario and the maritime provinces own 
               <br />
               their lands. The arguments on the other 
               <br />
               side of the House, from the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister down, have been attempts to ﬁnd ex- 
               <br />
               cuses for retaining these lands to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion, rather than to show the country what 
               <br />
               would be the best disposition of these lands. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend (Mr. Crawford) said we 
               <br />
               did not say anything about the timber or 
               <br />
               the minerals, but I take it for granted that 
               <br />
               if we owned these lands we would own 
               <br />
               the timber and the minerals as well. I be- 
               <br />
               lieve that the western provinces are just 
               <br />
               as well able to administer their lands, yes, 
               <br />
               and better able than the Dominion gov- 
               <br />
               ernment which is so far distant. I want to 
               <br />
               be fair, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'and</span> I will admit that there may 
               <br />
               possibly be a little something in the argu~ 
               <br />
               ment that for the time being immigration 
               <br />
               might be interfered with, but if I understand 
               <br />
               it aright, the immigration policy of this 
               <br />
               government takes in the whole Dominion 
               <br />
               and is not applicable to the west alone. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ivbelieve</span> that those western <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces</span> would 
               <br />

               <br />
               into them, and they would certainly better

               Now, I want to give some ﬁgures to show 
               <br />
               the progress of Manitoba and the Northwest 
               <br />
               in recent years. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Last</span> year we grew 86,000,- 
               <br />
               000 bushels of grain; and this year there 
               <br />
               will be ready for crop about 2,500,000 acres. 
               <br />
               That is a very large tract of land. The im- 
               <br />
               migration which came into the country from 
               <br />
               the United States last year amounted to 
               <br />
               48,000. The cash receipts from the sale or 
               <br />
               Dominion lands amounted in 1896 to $174,- 
               <br />
               509, and in 1904 to $1,681,824. The land 
               <br />
               sales by companies having land grants 
               <br />
               amounted in 1896 to $361,338 and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904</span> to 
               <br />
               over $5,000,000. I produce these ﬁgures to 
               <br />
               show that it is not probable that this coun- 
               <br />
               try is going to give those two new provinces 
               <br />
               any money grant that will adequately com- 
               <br />
               pensate them for their lands. I would like 
               <br />
               to show you, by a comparison with land 
               <br />
               values in some of the western states, how 
               <br />
               the lands in the Northwest may be expected 
               <br />
               to increase in value. In Illinois, in 1850 land 
               <br />
               was worth $10 an acre; to-day it is worth 
               <br />
               $61.12. In Iowa in 1850 it was worth $7.87 ; 
               <br />
               now it is worth $53. In Minnesota in 1850 
               <br />
               it was worth $9.38 ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> it is worth $39.05. 
               <br />
               Is there any reason why our lands should 
               <br />
               not increase in value in the next thirty 
               <br />
               years in the same proportion ? If they do, 
               <br />
               consider our public lands as worth $50 an 
               <br />
               acre, and then you will have some idea of 
               <br />
               what you are doing when you retain the 
               <br />
               lands and profess to give these provinces a 
               <br />
               generous recompense for them. We can 
               <br />
               hardly at the present time make a true esti- 
               <br />
               mate of the value of those lands. In 1881 
               <br />
               we had 232 miles of railway in that country ; 
               <br />
               to-day we have 6,000 miles.
