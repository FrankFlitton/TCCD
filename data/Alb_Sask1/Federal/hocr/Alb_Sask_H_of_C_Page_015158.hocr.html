               <br />
               not in accordance with the statute of 1875, 
               <br />
               and as it is in effect assumed to alter the 
               <br />
               statute, it was ultra vii-es. But he was not

               dealing with the question of the validity of 
               <br />
               any ordinance amending another ordinance 
               <br />
               as to school rights and privleges. So, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, ordnances 29 and 30 are undoubt~ 
               <br />
               edly territorial law, and would remain ter- 
               <br />
               ritorial law until the province was formed 
               <br />
               and something was substituted for them by 
               <br />
               the new legislature. But ordinances 29 and 
               <br />
               30 undoubtedly include everything that is 
               <br />
               in section 16 of the original Bill. They do 
               <br />
               more, but they certainly include all of 16. 
               <br />
               Now, what has been this marvellous change 
               <br />
               that so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">completely</span> satisﬁed the hon. mem— 
               <br />
               ber from Brandon ‘? He objected to section 
               <br />
               16 with ordinances 29 and 30, but he had not 
               <br />
               the slightest objection to '29 and 30 with 
               <br />
               section 16. Instead of improving the Bill, 
               <br />
               from his paring down point of view. he has 
               <br />
               actually made the Bill stronger. Under the 
               <br />
               Bill as it was first introduced by the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister, ordinances 29 and 30 were repeal- 
               <br />
               able, and by repealing or amending them the 
               <br />
               special privileges given to Protestants or 
               <br />
               to Roman Catholics with reference to 
               <br />
               representation on the board could have been 
               <br />
               removed if the proper authorities saw ﬁt to 
               <br />
               remove them. But with the change that 
               <br />
               has been made. this cannot be done.

               I intended to say something further on 
               <br />
               section 93 but that has been dealt with so 
               <br />
               very fully that I will not enlarge upon the

               <br />
               tlon as affecting the whole Dominion. I 
               <br />
               think we should consider with very anxious 
               <br />
               care what may be the result of the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion, even if we assume that parliament has 
               <br />
               the power, or that the Act may be validated 
               <br />
               by the imperial parliament. Canada has 
               <br />
               had a very unhappy experience which should 
               <br />
               enable us to foresee what may happen if we

               <br />
               not causing friction, which is treated with

               unconcern, if not indifference, by the major-

               case in the Territories at present and

               <br />
               Manitoba lesson of 1896. They have had 
               <br />
               a lesson there that school laws may be 
               <br />
               smashed and broken. and if the wit of 
               <br />
               man can devise a method to defeat a law so 
               <br />
               imposed they will defeat it. The draughtsman 
               <br />
               of this Bill is assuming to frame a clause in 
               <br />
               substitution for subsection 1 of 1893, so that 
               <br />
               any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> of the province will be null 
               <br />
               and void if it prejudices any rights under 
               <br />
               ordinances 29 or 30. He has put the pro- 
               <br />
               posed provinces, as I have said, in a more 
               <br />
               restricted position than is Manitoba or any 
               <br />
               of the other provinces I mentioned. But a 
               <br />
               statute may be worded within the powers of 
               <br />
               the legislature and not contravening this Act,

               yet such that in its administration separate 
               <br />
               schools can be made impossible. If the

               right hon. gentleman has any doubt about 
               <br />
               that, I would suggest that he consult the 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton). I 
               <br />
               have no doubt that with his experience. that 
               <br />
               hon, gentleman can point out half a dozen 
               <br />
               ways in which that can be done. I am con- 
               <br />
               vinced that the conversion of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               her for Brandon is due, to a great extent, to 
               <br />
               his conviction that the law can be obstructed, 
               <br />
               no matter how it is framed. The First Min- 
               <br />
               ister may think he makes all safe by dis- 
               <br />
               allowing statutes. But an Act may be 
               <br />
               passed that he cannot disallow. and yet in 
               <br />
               the working out of that Act a coach and 
               <br />
               four may be driven through ordinances 29 
               <br />
               and 30. For example. every year the ap- 
               <br />
               propriation Act of the legislature will grant 
               <br />
               a lump sum for education. Can the min- 
               <br />
               ister disallow that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'3</span> But how about the ad- 
               <br />
               ministering of that fund? Can the First 
               <br />
               Minister interfere ‘? Or can his government 
               <br />
               interfere ?
