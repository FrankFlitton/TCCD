               Mr. GUTHRIE. It is quite possible that

               that clause to which the hon. member re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               equality which does exist to-day between 
               <br />
               the legislative powers in the different pro~ 
               <br />
               vinces. Let me point to another matter 
               <br />
               with regard to British Columbia. By sec- 
               <br />
               tion 92 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               the lands of the provinces shall be exclu- 
               <br />
               sively under their own management. Yet 
               <br />
               the lands of the province of British Colum- 
               <br />
               bia'were not left entirely to it. Large por- 
               <br />
               tions of those lands were transferred to the 
               <br />
               Dominion government. And when the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba was carved out of the 
               <br />
               Territories, its lands, which would other- 
               <br />
               wise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rhave</span> become provincial lands, were

               <br />
               right to refuse to grant it? I submit that 
               <br />
               we have a perfect right either to grant or 
               <br />
               withhold autonomy, and if we have the

               <br />
               would not that parliament have the power 
               <br />
               to enact it? I submit that if the imperial 
               <br />
               parliament has the power, so have we, be- 
               <br />
               cause it is a matter beyond dispute that

               the powers of this parliament, in all that is 
               <br />
               granted to us under this British North 
               <br />
               America Act, are what we know as plen~ 
               <br />
               ary powers. They are powers as ample 
               <br />
               and complete as those of the imperial par- 
               <br />
               liament in this respect. They are not dele- 
               <br />
               gated powers. We are not acting as 
               <br />
               agents of the imperial government, but are 
               <br />
               acting by virtue of our plenary powers to 
               <br />
               pass this legislation; and in this respect 
               <br />
               our powers are as high as those of the im- 
               <br />
               perial parliament itself. This view of the 
               <br />
               law has been given out by the very highest 
               <br />
               authority. It will be found in the Privy 
               <br />
               Council cases. and I submit that on that 
               <br />
               ground the Bill before us is strictly con- 
               <br />
               stitutional. For the sake of argument let 
               <br />
               me put this case. Let us suppose that 
               <br />
               there is no reference whatever in this Bill 
               <br />
               to the subject of education. Let the Bill 
               <br />
               go through without any educational clause 
               <br />
               whatever in it, what will be the position of 
               <br />
               the new provinces? They would come un- 
               <br />
               der the main part of section 93 which says 
               <br />
               that education shall remain exclusively

               within the jurisdiction of the provincial

               Then ltukc the case of the free colonial 
               <br />
               legislature of Newfoundland. I do not 
               <br />
               know whether there is a system of 
               <br />
               separate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools</span> in that colony or not, but 
               <br />
               I will assume that it has by law such a. 
               <br />
               system; and I say that if Newfoundland 
               <br />
               should knock at the door of confederation 
               <br />
               for admission and we should admit her, 
               <br />
               that colony would come in subject to the 
               <br />
               provisions of section 93. subsections 1, 3 
               <br />
               and 4, as it is. a colony with a free legisla- ' 
               <br />
               ture, able to enact its own laws, and higher 
               <br />
               than a territory governed from another 
               <br />
               source. It would therefore come in under 
               <br />
               section 93 while a territory would come in 
               <br />
               practically unrestricted. I submit then that 
               <br />
               a free colony is in a minor position to a 
               <br />
