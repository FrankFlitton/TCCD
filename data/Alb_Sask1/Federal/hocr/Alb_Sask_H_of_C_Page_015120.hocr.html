               I commend these remarks to the govern-

               ment, because had they followed the prac-

               tice which Mr. Gait says existed amongst 
               <br />
               the English parliamentarians, and if they 
               <br />

               making Canadian history. I can only say 
               <br />
               that if the time of the House for the last
