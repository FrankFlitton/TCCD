               Why all this contention; why are we here 
               <br />
               day after day discussing a question in which 
               <br />
               the Dominion parliament presumes to over— 
               <br />
               ride the rights and liberties and freedom 
               <br />
               of these provinces and to take away from 
               <br />
               them the power they inherently possess to 
               <br />
               make their own educational laws? What 
               <br />
               kind of people do we ﬁnd in the Northwest 
               <br />

               <br />
               likely to submit to restriction of that kind? 
               <br />
               Sir, we ﬁnd that many of them come from 
               <br />
               countries where they have been oppressed; 
               <br />
               from Russia and other countries where they 
               <br />
               did not enjoy many liberties. They come 
               <br />
               to this liberty loving land of Canada where 
               <br />
               they were led to believe every man would 
               <br />
               have the rights of British citizenship, and 
               <br />
               all men the world over know that British 
               <br />
               citizenship means freedom; that it means 
               <br />
               something to be prized and something worth 
               <br />
               living for. We ﬁnd in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories people from the United States and 
               <br />
               people from the province of Ontario imbued 
               <br />
               with the same ideas of freedom; we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               them coming from the British Isles to settle 
               <br />
               amongst us and are they to be told that they 
               <br />
               are not to be permitted to make laws in

               <br />
               cannot understand why the federal govern- 
               <br />
               ment should pin itself down to legislation 
               <br />
               of this kind and refuse to a liberty loving 
               <br />
               people, breathing the free atmosphere of the 
               <br />
               open prairie, that freedom to which they 
               <br />
               are entitled under our constitution. I can- 
               <br />
               not understand why this Dominion parlia- 
               <br />
               ment should impose this restriction upon 
               <br />
               this people, contrary to their wish and con- 
               <br />
               trary to the law of the land. Not only, Sir, 
               <br />
               is it contrary to their wish, but it is con— 
               <br />
               trary to the pledge that was solemnly made 
               <br />
               by the First Minister prior to the last gen- 
               <br />
               eral election, when he informed Mr. Haul- 
               <br />
               tain that if he were returned to power he 
               <br />
               would consider the granting to these Terri- 
               <br />
               tories provincial autonomy, and not a li- 
               <br />
               mited self—government.

               Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not desire to de-

               <br />

               my remarks. In closing, I desire to say 
               <br />
               this: I stand by the principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provincial</span>

               the right to exclusively legislate on matters 
               <br />
               of education. We never can give these 
               <br />
               people full provincial rights until we amend 
               <br />
               the educational clause of that Bill, and With- 
               <br />
               draw the restrictions that are sought to be 
               <br />
               imposed upon them. They are entitled to 
               <br />
               the fullest self-government, and that and 
               <br />
               that alone will satisfy them. As a member

               Mr. HENDERSON. Some hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men say ‘ oh.’ I have done it before. and I 
               <br />
               can, when necessary, do it again. On this 
               <br />
               occasion I am glad that I am not called 
               <br />
               upon to do anything of that kind. I am 
               <br />
               glad that my constituents are fully in liar- 
               <br />
               mony with the sentiments I have expressed 
               <br />
               here to—day, and I am in full harmony with 
               <br />
               the views of my constituents. I would not 
               <br />
               be executing the trust imposed on me were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I-</span> for one moment to hesitate and support 
               <br />
               the measure which is before the House. I 
               <br />
               realize that fact, and therefore it shall be 
               <br />
               my pleasant duty—I say it again, my pleas- 
               <br />
               ant duty—not with reluctance, not with 
               <br />
