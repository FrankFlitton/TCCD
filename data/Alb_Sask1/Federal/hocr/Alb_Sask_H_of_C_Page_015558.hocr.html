               tion of particulars, how can you argue that

               <br />
               many, therefore you have a basis from 
               <br />
               which you can deduce a greater or.a less 
               <br />
               population for the one part than for the 
               <br />
               other? These are three of the considera-

               tions upon which you say you rest your 
               <br />
               distribution. The Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               says he does not rest the division on these 
               <br />
               things. He is not driven by his assertion to 
               <br />
               argue an absurdity. The right hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister is driven to argue an ab- 
               <br />
               surdity, and the absurdity is by making it 
               <br />
               appear that mere numbers of school—houses, 
               <br />
               numbers of post ofﬁces and numbers of im- 
               <br />

               you come to the south, it is rich in cattle,

               large ranching interests, but you ﬁnd other 
               <br />
               interests as well. Is it the one or the two 
               <br />
               kinds of products that you take as indi— 
               <br />

               <br />
               In that there is some force ; but in the argu-

               ment used by my right hon. friend, I put it

               population which supports the school-house

               he declared to be existing conditions. Does 
               <br />
               any one know what ‘he meant by that? I 
               <br />
               followed him very closely to get at the con-

               clusion he was going to deduce by saying 
               <br />
