               cognized the change in the words from the

               British North America Act to the words 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liament</span> for the ﬁrst time the power to give 
               <br />
               a constitution to new provinces. Now, What 
               <br />
               is the meaning of section 2 of this Act if it 
               <br />
               is not to give to this parliament discretion-

               ary power as to the kind of a constitution 
               <br />
               we may give to a province? If it was in- 
               <br />
               tended that this parliament should do no

               more than mark out the limits of a province 
               <br />
               and declare that it was made a province, 
               <br />
               the Act would have said so; but instead of 
               <br />
               that the Act proceeds to say that we may 
               <br />
               establish a province and make provision for 
               <br />

               In mentioning these exceptions to the 
               <br />
               general scheme of confederation another in- 
               <br />
               stance occurs to my mind, the case of 
               <br />
               British Columbia. Under the British North 
               <br />
               America Act, representation by population 
               <br />
               in this parliament is the general scheme. 
               <br />
               The provinces may lose representation if 
               <br />
               their population falls, but as far as British 
               <br />
               Columbia is concerned its minimum repre- 
               <br />
               sentation is guaranteed by the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. No matter what the popula- 
               <br />
               tion of British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colugnbia</span> may be, its repre— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sentation</span> here cannot go below a certain 
               <br />
               minimum—another departure from the let- 
               <br />
               ter of the Confederation Act. Under the 
               <br />
               British North America Act each province 
               <br />
               is given a legislature, but as regards the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec it is not permitted to 
               <br />
               control its own local provincial constitu- 
               <br />
               tion as far as its parliament is concerned, 
               <br />
               for the British North America Act declares 
               <br />
               that there shall be two houses and it does not 
               <br />
               leave it in the power of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec to alter that portion of its constitu- 
               <br />
               tion. It does more. Take the matter of 
               <br />
               representation of the house of assembly 
               <br />
               in the province of Quebec. All the other 
               <br />
               provinces have the power themselves to 
               <br />
               alter their electoral districts, making bound- 
               <br />
               aries as they see ﬁt, but in the case of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec it is entirely different. 
               <br />
               There are twelve constituencies in the prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Quebec that the legislature cannot 
               <br />
               interfere with. In the province of Ontario 
               <br />
               our legislature can, if it sees ﬁt, alter the 
               <br />
               boundaries of all the electoral districts, and 
               <br />
               so it is in all the other provinces of the 
               <br />
               Dominion, Quebec alone excepted. Why 
               <br />
               was the exception made in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec ?——simply to meet local conditions 
               <br />
               and thus we have from ocean to ocean all 
               <br />
               these provinces, deriving their constitutions 
               <br />
               from the British North America Act, but not 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               forty years parliament has been interpreting

               the meaning of the British North America

               liaments either here or in England have

               been disposed to look not to the letter but 
               <br />
               to the spirit of the law, do you not think 
               <br />
               that the bed rock of our constitution is 
               <br />
               the spirit and not the mere letter of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. Why, Sir, is it 
               <br />
               common sense to suppose that when the 
               <br />
               British North America Act was passed forty 
               <br />
               years ago the parliament of that day in- 
               <br />
               tended that that instrument which for all 
               <br />
               time was to form the constitution of this 
               <br />
               Dominion, with its changes and with its 
               <br />
               future, was literally to be applied, not 
               <br />
               having regard to the conditions of new pro— 
               <br />
               vinces when its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">application</span> was to be made 
               <br />
               but having regard to the dead past ‘2 I can 
               <br />
               imagine a hundred years hence smﬁ’e ques- 
               <br />
               tion arising in this country ; perhaps it may 
               <br />
               be the question of taking away from a pro- 
               <br />
               vince some of its powers, or it may be a 
               <br />
               question of taking away from the Dominion 
               <br />
               some of its powers, or it may be a question 
               <br />
               in some way or other of rearranging legis- 
               <br />
               lative powers, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.I</span> can understand that it 
               <br />
               might be thought of vital importance to the 
               <br />
               safety of the country that some change 
               <br />
               should be made. Under these circumstances 
               <br />
               I can almost anticipate a lawyer of that day 
               <br />
               rising in his place in parliament and saying : 
               <br />
               You propose to alter the constitution for 
               <br />
               the public welfare. I admit that the public 
               <br />
               welfare may call for a change of the consti- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">itution,</span> but I take my stand on the letter of 
               <br />
               the constitution and I interpret it in the light 
               <br />
               of 150 or 200 years ago. Is that the spirit
