               of the British North America Act and which 
               <br />
               is subject to all the limitations embodied 
               <br />
               in that Act as all the provinces of this 
               <br />
               Dominion are subject to the same limitations, 
               <br />
               it was surely not intended that this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, which is a creature of this Act, could 
               <br />
               constitute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> province and give it what-

               ever powers it pleased without reference

               to the terms of the Act under which this 
               <br />
               parliament itself was created. If we have 
               <br />
               any power to vary in anyway, in the slight- 
               <br />
               est degree, the terms of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. then we can vary them to 
               <br />
               whatever extent we please and we could 
               <br />
               withhold from the new provinces any one

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> America Act ’to the provincial legis- 
               <br />
               latures, and We could confer upon the new 
               <br />
               provinces in the west the power to legislate 
               <br />
               with reference to any one of the several

               subjects which the British North America 
               <br />
               Act assigned exclusively to this parliament. 
               <br />
               It seems to me that that would be an 
               <br />
               absurd view for any lawyer to advance, 
               <br />
               and 1 think it is perfectly clear that the 
               <br />
               intention of the British North America Act 
               <br />
               is that in the case of the constitution of any 
               <br />
               new province. it must be subject to the 
               <br />
               terms and conditions of the Act as they ap- 
               <br />

               <br />
               that have been advanced not only by the 
               <br />

               <br />
               have power only to create this province and

               that the provisions of the British North

               <br />
               be able to show that this is not only the 
               <br />

               Now, my. lords, it is outside the question to

               discuss this question as to whether British 
               <br />

               <br />
               we are now considering. But my construction 
               <br />
               of section 146 is this, that the Queen had the 
               <br />
               right by Order in Council to legislate in the 
               <br />
               way and subject to the limitations contained in 
               <br />
               section 146. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Order in Council became and 
               <br />
               had the effect of an imperial Act of parliament 
               <br />
               so long as the powers conferred by section 146 
               <br />
               were exercised subject to the limitations con- 
               <br />
               tained in section 146. Legislation by Order in 
               <br />
               Council is :an exceptional legislation and can 
               <br />
               only be exercised subject to the limitations in 
               <br />
               the power authorizing the legislation to be had 
               <br />
               in that form. An Act of the imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parlia:</span> 
               <br />
               ment might modify, alter or amend the British

               North America Act, might absolutely repeal the 
               <br />
               Act or alter any of the terms or provisions of 
               <br />
               it. but the Order in Council cannot do that. The 
               <br />
               Order in Council can only legislate in so far as 
               <br />
               its provisions are within the provisions of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               to the imperial Order in Council which would
