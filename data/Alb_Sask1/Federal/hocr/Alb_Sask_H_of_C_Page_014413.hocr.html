               <br />
               dividing the House on the matter, and he 
               <br />
               did divide the House. What do we see on

               the present occasion ? We see the Minister

               of the Interior absent from the ﬁrst day 
               <br />
               of the session. Whether his absence was 
               <br />
               owing to ill—health I know not, and I think 
               <br />
               the public are very little concerned about 
               <br />
               it. But we do know that as soon as the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">First</span> Minister introduced certain legis- 
               <br />
               lation into this House, the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior was here to dissent from the 
               <br />
               proposition of the government; and we 
               <br />
               know that as a result of his dissent he has 
               <br />
               gone out of the cabinet and is out of it 
               <br />
               to—day ; and every one knows that the First 
               <br />
               Minister and his cabinet are afraid to take 
               <br />
               the bull by the horns—I am speaking meta- 
               <br />
               phorically—and test popular opinion in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               opinion in the province of Ontario. What 
               <br />
               IS the report of the hon. gentleman’s own 
               <br />
               political friends from the city of Toronto ? 
               <br />
               it is that he has become a Czar and an 
               <br />
               autocrat. Mr. Robinette, their candidate 
               <br />
               in the last election came down here the

               <br />
               was reported in the newspapers; and be- 
               <br />
               cause Mr. Robinette informed the First 
               <br />
               Minister that he would not be a supporter 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the government’s pol-icy in regard to the

               to appeal to the First Minister to remem-

               ber the watchword of the late premier of

               was the watchword of the Hon. George W. 
               <br />
               Ross ? It was : ‘ Build up Ontario.’ What 
               <br />
               did that mean '3 It meant to build up On-

               ally, educationally and commercially; and 
               <br />
               I appeal to the First Minister to build up

               <br />
               spoke. because every one knows what fol-

               lowed—desolation and disaster to the Liberal 
               <br />
               candidates. He came to East Simcoe, and 
               <br />
               the result there is seen. He went to the 
               <br />
               city of Toronto and to other points and 
               <br />
               said, it is true, my cabinet representatives 
               <br />
               from Ontario are a ruin lot; I have one 
               <br />
               in the Senate who is past four score years ; 
               <br />
               I have Sir Richard Cartwright on my hands, 
               <br />
               but he is to be transferred to the Senate at 
               <br />
               an early day; although the Minister of 
               <br />
               Customs is a benevolent. good-hearted soul. 
               <br />
               he is not known beyond the conﬁnes of his 
               <br />
               own bailiwick. But, he said, I am going to 
               <br />
               strengthen the cabinet in Ontario; I am 
               <br />
               going to bring in a big man in the person

               Minister has not kept faith With the electors 
               <br />
               of the province of Ontario. He promised

               <br />

               <br />
               gregation from Ontario. What has he done? 
               <br />
               There was a time in this House when our 
               <br />
               dull moments were enlivened by the ora- 
               <br />
               tory of Sir Richard Cartwright; but he 
               <br />
               has stolen Sir Richard Cartwright from the 
               <br />
               House and sent him to, the Senate. We 
               <br />
               have left only our benevolent friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Customs and our soporiﬁe friend 
               <br />
               the Postmaster General. I think it has 
               <br />
               come to a pretty pass in the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario that we have to content ourselves 
               <br />
               with the cabinet representation that we 
               <br />
               have. But let us go a little further. Let 
               <br />
               us bear in mind that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> two gentlemen 
               <br />
               are seriously restricted—that they are not 
               <br />
               allowed to perform any acts of importance. 
               <br />
               They are allowed to manage departments 
               <br />
               which extract money from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">packets</span> of the

               spend a dollar, practically; but when it 
               <br />
               comes to spending money, all the depart- 
               <br />
               ments for that purpose go to ministers from 
               <br />
               the other provinces. True, the Minister of 
               <br />
               Public \Vorks for a time had some dispos- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ine and Fisheries came up and ﬁlched that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the province of Ontario, and to-day 
               <br />
               what is left for the Minister of Public 
               <br />
               Works amounts to practically nothing, and 
               <br />
               even that is not controlled bya minister Who 
               <br />

               <br />
               stituency in Ontario. It is quite true' that 
               <br />
               my hon. friend who represents North Ox-

               <br />
               ceived from the First Minister. We all ack— 
               <br />
               nowledge that circumstances sometimes 
               <br />
               arise in politics to deprive both political

               parties of some of their friends and leaders; 
               <br />
