               hon. friend the Minister of Justice (Hon. 
               <br />
               Chas. Fitzpatrick) the other evening ac-

               cepted, as I understood, the responsibility 
               <br />
               for drawing the clause which contained the 
               <br />
               educational provisions, and I understood

               him also to say that the intention was to 
               <br />
               continue the existing state of affairs. No- 
               <br />

               Minister responsible for the exact drafting 
               <br />
               of this clause, and I suppose it is not likely

               that my hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               drew it either. But I am bound to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, that when my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> of Justice employed a draftsman 
               <br />
               to draw this clause, with instructions to 
               <br />
               maintain only the existing state of affairs 
               <br />
               in the Northwest Territories. the draughts- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man.</span> either wholly misunderstood his instruc- 
               <br />
               tions or he possessed a most remarkable 
               <br />
               faculty for covering things which were 
               <br />
               not covered by his instructions. I 
               <br />
               propose to devote three or four min- 
               <br />
               utes to an examination of this clause 
               <br />
               for the purpose of showing what I think it 
               <br />
               means. I am not going to address a lengthy 
               <br />
               legal argument to the House on this sub— 
               <br />
               ject. When this clause was introduced by 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> of which I was then a mem- 
               <br />
               ber, I conceived it to be my duty to protest 
               <br />
               against it, and to carry my protest to the 
               <br />
               extent of laying down the seals of ofﬁce. 
               <br />
               I have no regret for the action I took. I 
               <br />
               think I then understood what the clause 
               <br />
               meant, and I think I now understand what 
               <br />
               it means: and while it is perhaps of no 
               <br />
               moment whatever to convince anybody who 
               <br />
               may have any doubts on the subject, or 
               <br />
               who may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to convince as to what 
               <br />
               this clause means, it is unquestionably my 
               <br />
               duty, speaking to this House on this occa- 
               <br />
               sion. to say what I thought this clause 
               <br />
               meant, and what I think it means new. and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> hy I felt called upon to make the protest
