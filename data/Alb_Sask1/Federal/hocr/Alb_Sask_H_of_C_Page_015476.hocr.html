               There is the reproduction in terms of 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875. Now how was that acted 
               <br />
               upon, what was the result? The result 
               <br />
               was that you had in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories four classes of schools: the Pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">testant</span> public school, the Catholic public

               school, the Protestant separate school and 
               <br />
               the Catholic separate school; or in other 
               <br />
               words, Protestant schools, either public or

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system</span> of education. Now What happened 
               <br />
               after that ? You have then the ordinance 
               <br />
               01' 1887. I fear I may weary the House by 
               <br />
               reading these ordinances, but perhaps they 
               <br />
               may be useful for reference. Section 37 
               <br />
               of the ordinance of 1887 provides:
