               that there is a rural school section in the

               whom are of the Mormon persuasion, and 
               <br />
               who for school purposes would come under 
               <br />
               the head of Protestants. Suppose there 
               <br />
               are ten families of Mormons in that school 
               <br />
               section, one family of Anglicans, one family 
               <br />
               of Presbyterians, one family of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"Methodists</span> 
               <br />
               and one family of Baptists; the Mormons 
               <br />
               will be in the majority and they will elect 
               <br />
               as a board three trustees of their own re- 
               <br />
               ligious belief who in turn will engage a 
               <br />
               Mormon teacher. The school opens in the 
               <br />
               morning at nine o’clock, let us hope with 
               <br />
               the reading of the Lord’s Prayer, and the 
               <br />
               teaching goes on to half-past three when 
               <br />
               the religious instruction privilege comes in. 
               <br />
               Now Mr. Speaker, I would ask you what 
               <br />
               kind of religious instruction is likely to 
               <br />
               be given in that school which is controlled 
               <br />
               by a Mormon board. We ﬁnd by the or- 
               <br />
