               11011. member for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) said 
               <br />
               at that time—and I am going to read his 
               <br />
               words to you—the schools in Manitoba were 
               <br />
               a disgrace to that country, a disgrace to 
               <br />
               any country, and that was not so very long 
               <br />
               ago. I say that to-day we have as good— 
               <br />
               I shall not say any more than that—as good 
               <br />
               schools as there are in the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. A great deal of stress has been 
               <br />
               laid by gentlemen opposite on the fact 
               <br />
               that there are in the Northwest to-day 
               <br />
               practically national schools, meaning, I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> 
               <br />
               sume, national schools as opposed to cleri— 
               <br />
               cal schools. What inﬂuence has brought 
               <br />
               about the improved condition that we have 
               <br />
               to—day ? Has it been the inﬂuence of cleri- 
               <br />
               cal schools or of national schools? If it 
               <br />
               has been as they admit, the approach so 
               <br />
               nearly the national schools, is not that 
               <br />
               argument good. And if you carry that to 
               <br />
               a logical conclusion you should establish one 
               <br />
               system of schools to which the children of
