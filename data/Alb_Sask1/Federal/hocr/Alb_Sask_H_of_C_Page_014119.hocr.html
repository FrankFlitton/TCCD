               of provincial legislatures, with his present

               speeches. And I would refer the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to the words of the Hon. George 
               <br />
               Brown on the subject of the stability, and 
               <br />
               consistency that ought to be the ornament 
               <br />
               and the crown of the Prime Minister of a 
               <br />
               country of the importance of Canada. In 
               <br />
               1896 the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) took a certain position in order to 
               <br />
               obtain power. And now, after his third re- 
               <br />
               turn, we have him laying down a policy: 
               <br />
               which is the absolute negation of that which 
               <br />
               he contended for in 1896. Let him consider 
               <br />
               the words of Hon. George Brown : ‘If, Sir, 
               <br />
               a public man can avow certain principles, 
               <br />
               agitate those principles and seek to over- 
               <br />
               throw the government of the day to estab- 
               <br />
               lish. those principles, and, when he obtains 
               <br />
               power laughs at his professions and casts 
               <br />
               his principles to the winds, he is aiming a 
               <br />
               blow at public morality.’

               <br />
               the Bill introduced by the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               on the 21st of February, in view of the 
               <br />
               large number of inquiries that are being 
               <br />
               made from time to time concerning it, and 
               <br />
               in view of the rumours that are in circula-

               <br />
               this evening, to give a deﬁnite answer to 
               <br />
               those who have asked me whether the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment proposed to carry the Bill through 
               <br />
               the House as it has been introduced or not. 
               <br />
               So, I wish to compliment the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for being so frank 
               <br />
               as he was this evening, for he has stated 
               <br />
               that when he framed this Bill he framed 
               <br />
               it on the line of the legislation already af-

               propose to do in the matter of this legisla- 
               <br />
               tion. The Minister of Justice stated that 
               <br />
               there could be no peace except it were based 
               <br />
               on justice. There are a large number of 
               <br />
               people in this country who do not believe

               They even remained for one hundred and
