               Roman Catholics hold as part of our relig-

               ious faith—religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               Schools. I need not say that I am a believer 
               <br />
               in that doctrine, that I am in that respect, 
               <br />

               <br />
               to know, and I feel fortified to know, that 
               <br />
               there are many great men, not only in this 
               <br />
               country, but in the mother country and 
               <br />
               elsewhere, not professing the religion to 
               <br />
               which I am attached, who also believe in 
               <br />
               the necessity of religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               Schools. I say that section 16 is altogether 
               <br />
               justiﬁed under the letter and spirit of. our 
               <br />
               constitution. I say also, and I shall en- 
               <br />
               deavour to demonstrate it, that, on grounds 
               <br />
               of highest public policy, the enactment of 
               <br />
               section 16 is altogether expedient and is 
               <br />
               rendered absolutely necessary. We know 
               <br />
               the rights which are preserved by section 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">10.</span> If separate schools are allowed, I care 
               <br />
               not whether they are called denominational 
               <br />
               schools or whatever name may be given to 
               <br />
               them. To my mind there is nothing in 
               <br />
               the name, or very little—it is altogether in 
               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insisting</span> on the right or privilege of the

               <br />
               1901 which have been passed pursuant to 
               <br />
               that statute. My hon. friend the leader of

               the opposition devoted a large portion of

               his speech to demonstrate as a legal pro- 
               <br />
               position that the statute of 1875 could at 
               <br />

               <br />
               could |)(‘ repealed to-day. He cited the

               authority of Sir John Thompson and others 
               <br />
               in support of that contention. I do not 
               <br />
               think that any lawyer will dispute that. 
               <br />
               It is quite clear and must be clear to any 
               <br />
               lawyer that the Act of 1875 could have been 
               <br />
               repealed and that it could be repealed now 
               <br />
               at this very moment. But, Sir, it has not 
               <br />
               been repealed. It is in existence to-day. 
               <br />
               The ordinances which have been made in 
               <br />
               pursuance of that statute are in existence

               preserve and perpetuate that right upon the

               tion With me is determined by the fact

               that the right or privilege mentioned in the

               <br />
               tion or birth of the province as a province. 
               <br />
               The'word ‘province‘ in section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1):;</span> means 
               <br />
               the province, not before. but the province

               at the moment that it enters confederation

               <br />
