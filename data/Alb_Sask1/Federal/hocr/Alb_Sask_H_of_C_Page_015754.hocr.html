               only intelligible reason for his making this 
               <br />
               quotation. And let me say to the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman and to others like him on that side 
               <br />
               of the House—there are some, though not 
               <br />
               a great many, who on all occasions inter- 
               <br />
               rupt members of this side who are speak- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing—that</span> it is evident they are not 
               <br />
               above casting a slur upon the Orangemen 
               <br />
               of this country. It is evident that in the 
               <br />
               article read by the hon. member for East 
               <br />
               Grey (Mr. Sproule) that he is there referred 
               <br />
               to in his capacity of leader of the Orange 
               <br />
               body. I am not going to discuss the pro- 
               <br />
               priety of a newspaper using such language. 
               <br />
               But I am prepared to say that the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for South Grey <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Miller), for Whom 
               <br />
               I have great personal respect, does not 
               <br />
               advance his cause by saying that the 
               <br />
               hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) is 
               <br />
               not representative of the Orangemen of 
               <br />
               this country. I do not wish to drag <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Orange</span> 
               <br />
               ism into this debate, but I do say that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Orangtemen</span> are not conﬁned to one nation- 
               <br />
               ality or one class, nor are they so ‘low’ 
               <br />
               but that they are ready to support the in- 
               <br />
               stitutions of this country, to advance the 
               <br />
               liberty of the people. to maintain British 
               <br />
               connection and uphold the British ﬂag wher— 
               <br />
               ever it may wave—to uphold the constitu- 
               <br />
               tion, and. in the case of. the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories, to uphold that constitution whether 
               <br />
               it does or does not give separate schools. 
               <br />
               It does not become any hon. member of 
               <br />
               this House to cast a slur upon O-rangeism. 
               <br />
               The history of that institution everywhere 
               <br />
               has been a history of toleration and of the 
               <br />
               maintenance of equal rights for all. Orange- 
               <br />
               men desire liberty for themselves, but they 
               <br />
               desire it equally for all other people. More 
               <br />
               than any other society in this country, the 
               <br />
               Orange society has stood for the mainten- 
               <br />
               ance of the liberties of all classes. I Wish 
               <br />
               to say of the hon. member for East Grey 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sproule), who has been persistently in- 
               <br />
               terrupted in the House and taunted that he 
               <br />
               represents only a small body or Orangemen. 
               <br />
               that he has the conﬁdence of the Orange 
               <br />
               body of this country and has that conﬁdence 
               <br />
               to an extent that no other Qrangeman =-n 
               <br />
               Canada has. It is no credit to any member 
               <br />
               of this House to try to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belittle</span> the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey in his position as re—.
