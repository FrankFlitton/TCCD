               looked into this somewhat carefully and I

               arrived at the conclusion that the Act of 
               <br />

               <br />
               r. hat took place in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">189092,</span> namely, that the

               legislature of the Northwest Territories was 
               <br />
               given authority, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.by</span> resolution or otherwise,

               <br />
               that the legislature of the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories abolished the use of the French

               <br />
               cording of its resolutions. Apart from that 
               <br />
               the Act of 1877 is as much in force in the
