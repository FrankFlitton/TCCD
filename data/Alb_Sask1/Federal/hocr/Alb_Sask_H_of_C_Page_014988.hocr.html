               <br />
               had rights in these Territories because 
               <br />
               years and years ago their missionaries dis- 
               <br />
               covered that country. All honour to those 
               <br />
               reverend gentlemen who entered that great 
               <br />
               Northwest in the early days. They had 
               <br />
               much to contend with and we honour the 
               <br />
               work they did there. but these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen invariably laid down the rule that 
               <br />
               they are entitled to these rights because 
               <br />
               the country forsooth was discovered by 
               <br />
               these missionaries. I am told by an hon. 
               <br />
               member who comes from the Northwest 
               <br />
               that they never <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discovered</span> the territory 
               <br />
               which will form these Northwest provinces. 
               <br />
               They never got within 300 miles of these 
               <br />
               provinces. Therefore, that claim to the 
               <br />
               right of separate schools in that country, 
               <br />
               fails absolutely to the ground. But, what 
               <br />
               I have noticed in the speeches of these hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen is that they entirely ignore the 
               <br />
               constitutional point. They do not desire 
               <br />
               to have just what the constitution gives 
               <br />
               them, but they want a little more than 
               <br />
               the constitution gives them. I would pre- 
               <br />
               sent for the information of these hon. gen- 
               <br />

               an American, a breezy westerner, who 
               <br />
               came down to see his member of congress 
               <br />
               at Washington. He had in his mind a 
               <br />
               Bill of tremendous importance of some 
               <br />
               kind or other, and he thought that he had 
               <br />
               only to speak to his member about it to 
               <br />
               get it through the House. But, on pre- 
               <br />
               senting it to his member, this is what the 
               <br />
               latter said to him: Well, my dear fellow 
               <br />
               that is contrary to the constitution; it can- 
               <br />
               not be done, ‘to which the westerner made

               what is the American constitution between 
               <br />
               friends! That is about the attitude of these

               <br />
               what they consider to be fair-play, but 
               <br />
               what we consider is a little beyond fair

               <br />
               one course, as I shall state presently, to 
               <br />
               be adopted in order to satisfy the public 
               <br />
               mind. The debate so far has been a very 
               <br />
               exhaustive one, and the arguments pro and 
               <br />
               con have been so exhaustive that it is al- 
               <br />
               most impossible for any member address- 
               <br />
               ing the House at this late stage of the de- 
               <br />
               bate to say anything new or anything of 
               <br />
               interest to the country, but I simply desire 
               <br />
               to impress upon the members of the House 
               <br />
               this view in regard to the constitution. The 
               <br />
               right hon. leader of the government (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) in introducing these Bills 
               <br />
               stated that he was going to give <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absolute</span> 
               <br />
               autonomy to the Northwest provinces. I 
               <br />
               have already stated what that autonomy 
               <br />
               amounts to where‘ these reservations <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> 
               <br />
               made and I desire simply to call the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the House to the fact that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, in introducing his Bills, 
               <br />
               stated distinctly that he stood upon the 
               <br />
               rock of the constitution. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agrees</span> thus 
               <br />
               far with the hon. Solicitor General and 
               <br />
               with my hon. friend the leader of the op- 
               <br />
               position. But, Sir, the arguments that he 
               <br />
               brought forward in regard to his standing 
               <br />
               on the rock of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cbnstitution</span> were not. 
               <br />
               in my. view, very strong, and after the 
               <br />
               speech of my hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition, which, I must say, appealed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               every hon. member who will express <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">big</span> 
               <br />
