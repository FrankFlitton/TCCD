               seems to me that a question put in this 
               <br />
               form is pertinent and should have been an-

               The practical object of my question is to 
               <br />
               know in what form, according to the rules,

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. The answer to

               Mr. MONK. Perhaps my right hon. friend 
               <br />
               will allow me to say that that is not the 
               <br />
               information which I sought by my question. 
               <br />
               The information sought by the question _I 
               <br />
               put was simply in relation to the fact. In 
               <br />
               the motion I asked for a copy of the report, 
               <br />
               detailed accounts of expenses and the names 
               <br />
               of the parties employed. The question I put 
               <br />
               had reference to a department of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and I think should have been 
               <br />
               answered in the form in which it was put.
