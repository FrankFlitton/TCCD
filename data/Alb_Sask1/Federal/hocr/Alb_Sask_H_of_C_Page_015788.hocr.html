               <br />
               prove the facts upon which I rely. There 
               <br />
               were schools in existence in the Northwest 
               <br />
               more than twenty years before the transfer

               of that country with Canada; these schools

               <br />
               have proved and that nobody can deny. In 
               <br />
               1869, the population of the territory did 
               <br />
               not want to join the confederation unless 
               <br />
               they would have the guarantee that their

               rights and privileges. civil and religious,

               when the delegates were asking an annual 
               <br />
               grant for their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools,</span> it was for the de- 
               <br />
               nominational schools because there were no 
               <br />
               other. and section 22 could be made only 
               <br />
               for the protection of Catholic and Protes- 
               <br />
               tant schools then in existence. All the 
               <br />
               quibbles of the world are of no avail against 
               <br />
               logic and simple reasoning. The parliament 
               <br />
               wanted to fulﬁl the promise which had been 
               <br />
               given by the British government. Our 
               <br />
               statesmen knew that there were no other 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest except the de- 
               <br />
               nominational schools, and their intention 
               <br />
               was to guarantee these schools against at- 
               <br />
               tacks of fanaticism and ignorance by pass-

               In 1870, the Conservative party was in
