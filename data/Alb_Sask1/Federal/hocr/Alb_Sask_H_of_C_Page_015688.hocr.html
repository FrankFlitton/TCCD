               casual statement made in conversation by

               we have agreed to alter the boundaries of

               that the line between Rosebud and Gleichen 
               <br />

               Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY. My suggestion

               was that the line between Gleichen and

               Rosebud be moved twelve miles north— 
               <br />
               that is two townships. I understand that

               the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) 
               <br />
