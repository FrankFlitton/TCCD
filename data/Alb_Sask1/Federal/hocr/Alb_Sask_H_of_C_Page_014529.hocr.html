               That was on the 16th of February. and 
               <br />
               on the following day accordingly, there 
               <br />
               took place at my oﬂice the interview with 
               <br />
               the delegates from Manitoba. There had 
               <br />
               been a subcommittee of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               appointed to receive the delegates, and the 
               <br />
               ministers present on that occasion were, 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice. the Postmaster Gen- 
               <br />
               eral and myself; I think the Secretary of 
               <br />
               State was present, but of that I am not 
               <br />
               quite sure.

               I take now the statement of Mr. Rogers

               During that interview we presented the claim

               <br />

               <br />
               would be good enough to remain in Ottawa for 
               <br />
               three or four days he would again send for us

               want to make any imputation, but I ﬂatter

               myself that I have a pretty good memory

               of my colleagues. What took place was 
               <br />
               this: We heard the petition <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presented</span> 
               <br />
               to us by the delegates from Manitoba. Mr.

               Rogers was the spokesman. I do not think 
               <br />
               Mr. Campbell said anything at all. but if 
               <br />
               he did he took a very indifferent part in

               the discussion which was mainly carried 
               <br />
               cn by Mr. Rogers. He presented to us a
