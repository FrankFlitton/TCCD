               Mr. FOSTER. I spoke not on the adjourn- 
               <br />
               ment but on the ministerial explanation, 
               <br />
               and I am now calling the attention of the 
               <br />
               First Minister to the question I have just 
               <br />
               put. I also want to call his attention to 
               <br />
               something else. It is in the interests of the 
               <br />
               country that we should know whether two 
               <br />
               or three days ago, after conferring with 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior, my right hon. 
               <br />
               friend still had hopes that the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior would accede to what was evidently 
               <br />
               a proposition put to him, possibly in modi— 
               <br />
               ﬁcation of this clause of the Bill, and that 
               <br />
               his resignation at the last moment came as 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disappointment</span> It would be interesting to 
               <br />
               the House to know whether the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman made any advance towards a 
               <br />
               compromise in the Bill as presented, in or- 
               <br />
               der to retain his colleague in the cabinet. I 
               <br />
               want to call to the attention of my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend two other matters, which I may 
               <br />
               as well bring before him now, as otherwise 
               <br />
               I should have to call his attention to them 
               <br />
               later. I ﬁnd that in the printed Bill there 
               <br />
               are material alterations as compared with the 
               <br />
               Bill laid on the table, when introduced by 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman. What is the 
               <br />
               cause for these modiﬁcations? Have some 
               <br />
               modiﬁcations been made between the time 
               <br />
               this Bill was introduced and the time when 
               <br />
               it was sent to the printer, with a View 
               <br />
               of retaining in the government the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior or any other aggrieved min— 
               <br />
               ister? When my hon. friend here to my 
               <br />
               right asked for the printing of a larger num- 
               <br />
               ber of copies of the Bill. it struck me that 
               <br />
               perhaps there was method in not printing 
               <br />
               too many copies. because. before the next 
               <br />
               printing takes place, it may possibly be that 
               <br />
               some other clauses will be modiﬁed in or- 
               <br />
               der to retain members who are at present re- 
               <br />
               calcitrant, or to gain the favour of those 
               <br />
               who are opposed to the Bill as it. stands. 
               <br />
               But I call my right hon. friend’s attention 
               <br />
               to this peculiarity, that seine of the clauses 
               <br />
               of the Bill which he put in Mr. Speaker’s

               of the hon. member for North Toronto (Mr.

               <br />
               premier to a statement he made in the min- 
               <br />

               having taken place between him and his 
               <br />
               late colleague. It is to my mind a very cur- 
               <br />
               ious statement. He said that in consulta-

               <br />
               the House wants is a clear cut statement 
               <br />
               from the premier whether he is wedded to 
               <br />
               that particular clause of the Bill regarding 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> do what his colleague wishes him to do

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I have no ob- 
               <br />
               servation of any kind to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬁer</span> to the House 
               <br />
               on this occasion, because the occasion does 
               <br />
               not call for any observation from me beyond 
               <br />
               the statement which has been made by my- 
               <br />
               self and by my late colleague, the present 
               <br />
               member for Brandon ()Ir. Sifton). The hon. 
               <br />
               member for South York (Mr. Maclean) knoWs 
               <br />
               better than anybody that on such an oc- 
               <br />
               casion ministerial explanations are to be 
               <br />
               given when a gentleman withdraws from 
               <br />
               the administration, and it is left to the 
               <br />
               ri ime minister and to the minister with- 
               <br />
               drawing to make such explanations as they 
               <br />
               deem ﬁt. I rise simply to answer one ques- 
               <br />
               tion, though it is not at all pertinent to 
               <br />
               the issue, because everything that has been
