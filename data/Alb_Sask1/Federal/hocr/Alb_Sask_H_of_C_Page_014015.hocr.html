               the only restriction put upon the executive, 
               <br />
               the Crown, or the sovereign, is that he must

               prised. In 1897 another and a ﬁnal change

               took <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">placeffn</span> 1897 an Act was passed in this 
               <br />
               House whereby it was provided that there 
               <br />
               should be an executive council to be chosen 
               <br />
               by the Lieutenant Governor from the mem- 
               <br />
               bers of the House, and practically having 
               <br />
               the support of a majority of the elected 
               <br />
               members of the legislature. This was in 
               <br />
               fact the last and ﬁnal concession and it 
               <br />
               was the application of the principle of min- 
               <br />
               isterial responsibility. This has been the 
               <br />
               law ever since; it is the law to-day. So 
               <br />
               that, Sir, it is manifest that at this moment 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest Territories are 
               <br />
               in the enjoyment and have been for several 
               <br />
               years, not only of full ministerial respon- 
               <br />
               sibility, not only of full constitutional gov- 
               <br />
               ernment. but also of a large measure of 
               <br />
               local autonomy. A great deal has been 
               <br />
               done, in fact, more has been done than we 
               <br />
               have to do to-day. We have to take the 
               <br />
               last step but it is easy and comparatively 
               <br />
               unimportant in view of and in comparison 
               <br />
               with what has already been accomplished. 
               <br />
               The metal has been in the crucible and all 
               <br />
               we have to do now, is to put the stamp of 
               <br />
               Canadian nationality upon it.3

               The House is aware that some two years 
               <br />
               ago or thereabouts there came to us a very 
               <br />
               general desire from the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories for immediate admission into the 
               <br />
               confederation as provinces. I did not be- 
               <br />
               lieve at the time for my part, that this re- 
               <br />
               quest, respectable as it was, proceeded so 
               <br />
               much from an actual need as from a senti- 
               <br />
               ment. It was to me the expression of a 
               <br />
               sentiment, a sentiment most honourable, a 
               <br />
               sentiment most worthy because it was an 
               <br />
               expression of the self-reliance of young 
               <br />
               and ambitious communities. The House is 
               <br />
               also aware of the answer which we gave 
               <br />
               to the Territories at that time. We re- 
               <br />
               presented to them that in our judgment, the 
               <br />
               time was inopportune for taking this ques- 
               <br />
               tion into parliament, that as we were on 
               <br />
               the eve of a general election, the time and 
               <br />
               occasion would be more propitious and 
               <br />
               more ﬁtting after that event when 
               <br />
               the Territories would have the beneﬁt on 
               <br />
               this ﬂoor of a larger representation. These 
               <br />
               views were generally accepted. The- elec- 
               <br />
               tions have taken place and immediately af- 
               <br />

               <br />
               able thereafter, we invited the executive 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories to send del- 
               <br />

               <br />
               admit them into the confederation. We 
               <br />

               ple at large might be expected to take 
               <br />
               a deep interest in. The ﬁrst was: How 
               <br />
               many provinces should be admitted into 
               <br />
               the confederation coming from the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories—one, or two or more? 
               <br />
               The next question was: in whom should 
               <br />
               be vested the ownership of the public lands? 
               <br />
               The third question was: What should be 
               <br />
               the ﬁnancial terms to be granted to these 
               <br />
               new provinces? And the fourth and not 
               <br />
               the least important by any means was the 
               <br />
               question of the school system which would 
               <br />
               be introduced—not introduced because it was 
               <br />
               introduced long ago, but should be con- 
               <br />
               tinued in the Territories.

               Now, Sir, I will proceed to examine 
               <br />
               one after the other, all these questions. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst, as I have just said is: 
               <br />
               How many provinces should be admit- 
               <br />
               ted into the confederation ? There is con- 
               <br />
               siderable variety, as everybody knows, in 
               <br />
               the area of the different provinces of the 
               <br />
               confederation. Prince Edward Island has 
               <br />
               an area of 2,184 miles, Nova Scotia 21,428 
               <br />
               miles, New Brunswick 27,985 miles, Quebec 
               <br />
               351,873, Ontario 260,862, Manitoba 73,732, 
               <br />
               and British Columbia 372,630, or a total 
               <br />
               area for the seven provinces of confedera- 
               <br />
               tion of 1,110,694 miles. Now, the Territo—

               <br />
               jurisdiction of the local legislature have 
               <br />
               exactly the same area as that of the seven 
               <br />
               provinces of the Dominion. The total area 
               <br />
               of the seven provinces, as I said a moment
