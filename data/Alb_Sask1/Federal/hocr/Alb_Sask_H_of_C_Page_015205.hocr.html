               Mr. HENDERSON. I do not wish to 
               <br />
               prolong the discussion, but there may not 
               <br />
               be another opportunity for some days to 
               <br />
               take this matter up. I never could agree 
               <br />
               with the Minister of Finance that that was 
               <br />
               a capital sum. It is a simple matter of 
               <br />
               bookkeeping. I know that in the Act of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">188-1</span> it is stated as capital, but the Act 
               <br />
               says that the interest at ﬁve per cent will 
               <br />
               be paid to the province as an annual sub— 
               <br />
               sidy. The sum of $4,848,000 was never 
               <br />
               owing by the Dominion t0 the province. It 
               <br />
               was practically a scheme to provide a basis 
               <br />
               on which a new subsidy could be calculated. 
               <br />
               It was no more a capital sum than the 
               <br />
               assessment of a town or village; it was 
               <br />
               simply used for the purpose of determining 
               <br />
               what the subsidy should be, just as we use 
               <br />
               an assessment and an assessment roll in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or‘</span> 
               <br />
               der to ﬁx the rate of taxation. I believe 
               <br />
               that was the opinion of the judges of the 
               <br />
               Supreme Court when they had that matter 
               <br />
               under consideration. My recollection is 
               <br />
               that they decided that when the subsidy 
               <br />
               had been ascertained as $142,414, the capital 
               <br />
               sum dropped out of sight and was no more 
               <br />
               to be regarded as capital. But, as the 
               <br />
               Finance Minister has told us that he is 
               <br />

               <br />
               the intention of parliament is. I am quite

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisﬁed?</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span> we want is to have it de-

               or come down on us at once for $8,000.000. 
               <br />
               Perhaps <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if‘</span> they got the $8.000,000, they

               the government of the Northwest Territories

               acknowledged that they were in debt to the 
               <br />
               Dominion. I notice in a speech delivered 
               <br />
               by the premier of the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               in 1900, that he admitted $3,000,000 odd, 
               <br />
               made up of several items. This resolution 
               <br />
               reads. ‘inasmuch as the said province is 
               <br />
               not in debt.’ This would appear rather 
               <br />
               conﬂicting with the fact. I would like some 
               <br />
