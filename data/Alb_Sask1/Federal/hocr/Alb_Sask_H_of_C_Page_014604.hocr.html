               of that dignitary by the appointment of a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span> in Canada in order to see that

               the system of interference in politics which

               that is so. and everybody knows that the 
               <br />
               reason why Quebec spoke in 1896 as she 
               <br />
               did and as she has spoken since is because 
               <br />
               the great heart of the French people rose 
               <br />
               above all those limitations which had bound 
               <br />
               them and because the people of that province 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recognized</span> that in their great leader they had 
               <br />
               a man who was ever ready to stand for 
               <br />
               equal rights for all and special privileges 
               <br />
               for none. As he stood for the rights of 
               <br />
               the provinces in 1896 so he stands to—day 
               <br />
               for the constitutional rights of minorities 
               <br />
               and the recognition of the principles which 
               <br />
               the confederation compact involves and 
               <br />
               which were embodied in the constitution. 
               <br />
               But, cries such as we have heard here to- 
               <br />
               day are not new. My little province down 
               <br />
               by the sea has not turned its ear to any 
               <br />
               such appeals as seem to avail in other pot-1 
               <br />
               tions of Canada. But, in the county from 
               <br />
               which I come and in which I have run 
               <br />
               three federal elections. I want to say that 
               <br />
               in every ﬁght we have had to contend 
               <br />
               against the canvass which was being made‘ 
               <br />
               on behalf of the Conservative party amongst 
               <br />
               the Protestant and Presbyterian section of 
               <br />
               the electors in these words: Surely you 
               <br />
               will not vote for a Frenchman and a Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic like Laurier. That was the shib— 
               <br />
               boleth of the Conservative party. But, our 
               <br />
               people rose above that. Our people recog- 
               <br />

               <br />
               and religious liberty in Canada, that he was 
               <br />
               possessed of a generous mind, that he was a
