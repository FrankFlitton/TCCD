               to pass this legislation, in view of that

               statement, must hold good. It does seem

               to me that the British North America Act

               opposes very strongly the passing of this 
               <br />

               <br />
               that we had the British North America Act 
               <br />
               as our guarantee and we have relied upon 
               <br />
               it as we should rely upon our constitution. 
               <br />
               It does seem to me that it is ignoring and 
               <br />
               overriding that Act because the Bill in its 
               <br />
               very terms does proceed to amend the 
               <br />
               British North America Act in vital points. 
               <br />
               I do not know what the intention of 
               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite may be whether 
               <br />
               it is their intention to ask the imper—

               <br />
               cmiﬁrniation by the imperial authorities,1 
               <br />
               do not think it will be seriously contend- 
               <br />
               ed in this House that the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada has the right to pass the legislation

               it will be a matter of regret. because I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>

               of eminent counsel whom I have consulted

               <br />
               am correctly informed by counsel as to 
               <br />
               what will be in all likelihood the result of 
               <br />
               this legislation. The hon. Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Fielding) also went on record as 
               <br />
               against the constitution as follows: 
               <br />
               
            </p>
            
            
            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               I do not propose to go into that constitutional 
               <br />
               question, not because I say it should not receive 
               <br />
               any consideration, but because I say it is not 
               <br />
               the great question involved, and I prefer to go 
               <br />
               on and deal with the practical questions which 
               <br />
               are before us. If it is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">«constitutional</span> ques- 
               <br />
               tion above <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all]</span> others, then, perhaps the best 
               <br />
               thing we can do will be to request the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legal</span> 
               <br />
               members of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House to adjourn to the Rail-

               <br />
               we who have not the good fortune to belong 
               <br />
               to that learned profession will stay down here
