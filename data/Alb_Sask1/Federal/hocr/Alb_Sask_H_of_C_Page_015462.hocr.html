               not ask the committee to wait until I have

               Mr. R. L. BURDEN. I think that will be 
               <br />
               desirable. We have had a pretty steady 
               <br />
               grind at the Bill for some time, and there 
               <br />
               will be amendments moved to all the 
               <br />
               clauses still undisposed of. It will be ad- 
               <br />
               visable to put the amendments in such a 
               <br />
               shape as will, with as little prolixity as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pos«</span> 
               <br />
               sible, express the views we entertain on 
               <br />
               this side; and a day or two devoted to a 
               <br />
               little consideration for that purpose will not 
               <br />
               be time wasted. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would.</span> suggest that 
               <br />
               some other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">business</span> could in the meantime 
               <br />
               be taken up. I did intend to have made 
               <br />
               this afternoon some observations with re- 
               <br />
               gard to the difference between the ori- 
               <br />
               ginal and the amended clause 16. However, 
               <br />
               I did not wish to make any suggestion to 
               <br />
               the government as to the course they should 
               <br />
               take, but I would think that when we take 
               <br />
               up the Bill again, we should dispose of the 
               <br />
               land clause ﬁrst and then take up clause 
               <br />
               16, unless the government specially desires 
               <br />
               to take up the school matter ﬁrst and deal 
               <br />
               with the other afterwards. I am not par- 
               <br />
               ticular except that I would like to know 
               <br />
               a little in advance what the course of the 
               <br />
               government will be in that regard.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. As regards the or-

               <br />
