               Gradually we are removing these exempt-

               <br />
               Take, for instance, the situation here in 
               <br />
               Ottawa; the citizens of Ottawa ﬁnd it a 
               <br />
               great grievance to have so much Dominion 
               <br />

               <br />
               government, recognizing that condition of 
               <br />

               this way the Dominion is contributing to 
               <br />
               municipal taxation. We were told in the

               the west to have this grievance removed 
               <br />
               whereby he is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> paying the municipal

               not by this Bill re—enact the rights of the

               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway whatever they

               selves. The Canadian Paciﬁc Railway can 
               <br />
               look after them in the courts. I do not think

               it is in the public interest that this clause

               <br />
               would ask the government not only to with-

               draw this clause but to take into its serious 
               <br />
