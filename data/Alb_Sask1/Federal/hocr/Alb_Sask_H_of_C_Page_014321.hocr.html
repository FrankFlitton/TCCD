               <br />
               another speech he said: ‘The Governor had

               <br />
               resignation of six ministers on a question of 
               <br />
               policy. and had shown his conﬁdence in them 
               <br />
               by reappointing them later.’ That did not 
               <br />
               satisfy his hearers, one of whom exclaimed: 
               <br />
               ‘That still leaves the question unanswered. 
               <br />
               Why did you resign '3’ To which Mr. Foster 
               <br />
               replied ‘I don’t intend to answer. I am not at 
               <br />
               liberty to reveal the secrets of the Privy Coun- 
               <br />
               cil.’ An ingenious way of evading an answer. 
               <br />
               The fact is, the reasons given in the House of 
               <br />
               Commons for his resigning were never dis-

               this question. What was the action of the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘1</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span> I have correctly read 
               <br />
               his policy, if I have discovered the object 
               <br />
               he had in his speech, it was not to be a 
               <br />
               messenger of peace and harmony, but it 
               <br />
               possible to light the incendiary ﬁres of reli- 
               <br />
               gions and racial discord from one end of 
               <br />
               this Dominion to the other. The hon. gen~ 
               <br />
               tleman represents North Toronto. In olden 
               <br />
               days he came from the east. He stayed 
               <br />
               there as long as the people would keep him. 
               <br />
               In olden days, Mr. Speaker, I doubt if he 
               <br />
               would have professed the principles that 
               <br />
               he has professed to-day. But, Sir, he has 
               <br />
               rested in another place, and his new prin- 
               <br />
               ciples of to—day are appropriate and fash- 
               <br />
               ionable in North Toronto, and he put them 
               <br />
               on, and with a great deal of force throws 
               <br />
               off the old discarded ones. What <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span> 
               <br />
               had the hon. gentleman in asking the mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) whether or 
               <br />
               not he was content with the amendments- 
               <br />
               of the government ? The hon. member for 
               <br />
               North Toronto, holding up these amend- 
               <br />
               ments to the member for Labelle, who is as 
               <br />
               we all know a devout son of his church, 
               <br />
               said to him in triumph: All the comfort and 
               <br />
               consolation you can get from these amend- . 
               <br />
               inents is that at‘ half-past three o’clock in
