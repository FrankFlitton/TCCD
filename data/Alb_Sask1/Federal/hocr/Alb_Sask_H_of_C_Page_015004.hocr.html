               ture to say that in my county, and I think

               in most of the counties in Ontario, if a man

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Sproule) was to go around and present

               <br />
               time to come in the Northwest Territories, 
               <br />
               a system that could not be repealed, that 
               <br />
               would be as unchangeable as the laws of the

               lions emanating from Centre York were 
               <br />

               <br />
               is a conclusive proof of my mind that either

               the people of Centre York take very little in-

               <br />
               or six weeks I can say something new or 
               <br />
               original upon it. Now, a great many people

               have found fault with the Liberal party 
               <br />
               and with our honoured premier for going 
               <br />
               back on their record. They say that the 
               <br />
               position taken by the Prime Minister (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) now is altogether diiferent 
               <br />
               from that taken by him in 1896. For my 
               <br />
               part. I believe that the position taken by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister on this Bill is exactly 
               <br />
               in line with his previous record and with 
               <br />
               the principles of the party of which he is 
               <br />
               the honoured leader. The Liberal party 
               <br />
               has always been the party of provincial 
               <br />
               rights. Those hon. members who had the 
               <br />
               honour of holding seats in this House in 
               <br />
               1889 will remember the ﬁerce agitation that 
               <br />
               sprang up in the province of Ontario over a 
               <br />
               measure passed by the legislature of the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec known as the Jesuit 
               <br />
               Estates Bill. That Bill the government of 
               <br />
               the Dominion had nothing to do with; it 
               <br />
               was a provincial statute. But among 
               <br />
               those in Ontario who demanded <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               allowance of that Bill, there was no talk 
               <br />
               of provincial rights. Petitions galore 
               <br />
               poured into this House. Resolutions were 
               <br />
               passed at public meetings. Ministers of 
               <br />
               different churches denounced the Bill and 
               <br />
               the course of the government in refusing 
               <br />
               to disallow it. But when the refusal to 
               <br />
               disallow the Bill was upheld by a large 
               <br />
               majority of this House. with the support of 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman who is now Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of the Dominion. the agitation 
               <br />
               ceased; and ~to-day, when the clouds have 
               <br />
               rolled away when the passions aroused by 
               <br />
               that controversy have cooled, we see that 
               <br />
               the government of Sir John Macdonald was 
               <br />
               right in standing by provincial rights and 
               <br />
               refusing to disallow the Bill. Last session 
               <br />
               we had a debate lasting a month or two 
               <br />
               on what was declared to he the most im-
