               feel satisﬁed to-day with his record on that

               question, which so much disturbed public 
               <br />
               opinion ten years ago ? If ever there was 
               <br />
               a question in this country ‘calculated to 
               <br />
               arouse passion and prejudice, and if ever 
               <br />
               such a question was deliberately thrown 
               <br />
               into the political arena for the purpose of 
               <br />
               political gain, it was the Manitoba school 
               <br />
               question. That question was precipitated 
               <br />
               into the political arena by the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman and his friends then in opposi- 
               <br />
               tion, and by his Liberal friends-in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba. There can be no doubt 
               <br />
               about that. Let us look at the record for 
               <br />
               a moment or two. as the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               himself has called attention to it. There 
               <br />
               were diﬁiculties surrounding the Con- 
               <br />
               servative administration of that day. 
               <br />
               What was the attitude of my right 
               <br />
               hon. friend with regard to those difﬁcul- 
               <br />
               ties? When the Conservatives desired to 
               <br />
               investigate. he was impatient of de- 
               <br />
               lay. When they desired to conciliate, be 
               <br />
               accused them of weakness and cowardice. 
               <br />
               When they sought an interpretation of the 
               <br />
               constitution in the courts, he declared that 
               <br />
               they were exciting passion and discord. 
               <br />
               W'hen they proposed the remedial order. he 
               <br />
               declared it was ineffective and insuﬂicient. 
               <br />
               When they sought to enforce it by an Act 
               <br />
               of this parliament, he declared it was too 
               <br />
               strong and drastic in its terms. He de- 
               <br />
               nounced in violent language the late Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy in 1890, not only as an 
               <br />
               enemy of his creed, but of his race, and 
               <br />
               three years later he was content to accept 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy’s aid on that question. On 
               <br />
               one side of him, he established a very able 
               <br />
               gentleman, who does not now occupy a seat 
               <br />
               in this House, but who then represented the 
               <br />
               constituency of L’Islet, in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec—he used that gentleman to declare 
               <br />
               that the rights of the minority were 
               <br />
               being betrayed in Manitoba. And on 
               <br />
               the other side he accepted the aid of )Ir. 
               <br />
               McCarthy. who denounced the action of the 
               <br />
               Conservative government as coercive and 
               <br />
               oppressive. He himself posed in the Eng- 
               <br />
               lish speaking provinces as the champion of 
               <br />
               provincial rights. and in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec as the heaven-constituted protector 
               <br />
               of the minority. The hon. gentleman thus 
               <br />
               addressed himself with great skill to both 
               <br />
               opposing elements, and eventually succeeded 
               <br />
               1n utilizing that question as the means of 
               <br />
               putting himself and his party into power. 
               <br />
               And after they did attain ofﬁce, I ask 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend. in all seriousness and 
               <br />

               to the full, and according to the spirit, the

               to—day. Years ago Brougham, in the

               <br />

               penance for the disingenuousness of years. 
               <br />
               Does my right hon. friend regard those

               The prime minister ﬁrst declared that this

               question is not one of separate schools, and
