               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘</span> was silent, he made not a word of denial

               when the statement was made across the

               volved neither more nor less than a direct

               unjustiﬁable interference by that church with

               right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) 
               <br />
               was afraid to take the dictum of the people 
               <br />
               of the Northwest Territories in the election 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904</span> upon the question, while he con- 
               <br />
               cealed the real issue from them, refusing to 
               <br />
               consult their representative, while he was 
               <br />
               quiet on the question until they had a 
               <br />
               larger representation in this House, while 
               <br />
               he did not consult the Minister of the In— 
               <br />
               terior (Mr. Sifton), though the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior says he knew about all the 
               <br />
               other provisions of the Bill, while he did not 
               <br />
               consult the other representatives in this 
               <br />
               House from that territory and did not con— 
               <br />
               sult the delegation, we ﬁnd—and I regret to 
               <br />
               say it—that the right hon. gentleman con- 
               <br />
               sulted and conferred with, and submitted 
               <br />
               these clauses to the ablegate of the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic hierarchy whose power was to be 
               <br />
               affected by the clauses of this Bill. Now 
               <br />
               that fact being proven, it‘ being proven 
               <br />
               beyond contradiction, because the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman does not deny it, then I say we 
               <br />
               are face to face with a crisis. We are face to 
               <br />
               face with a state of things which is not 
               <br />
               tolerable, and which the people of Canada 
               <br />
               will not tolerate, and are not tolerating to- 
               <br />
               day. It is all very well for hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite to rise and cry, peace, and tolera- 
               <br />
               ation, and moderation of speech, when 
               <br />
               their leader has himself thrown down the 
               <br />
               gauntlet which has aroused <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">soimuch</span> passion 
               <br />

               question of religious instruction in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. It cannot be that hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen can cry, peace, peace, when there 
               <br />
               is no peace. They themselves have dragged 
               <br />
               into this House a question which they must

               <br />
               comes from the fact that there has been, as 
               <br />
               the people of this country believe, a betrayal 
               <br />
               of trust in regard to this same principle. 
               <br />
               Had the leader of the government been true 
               <br />
               to those professions, he would have left 
               <br />

               vinces themselves, and have allowed them to 
               <br />
               establish such a system as they think best 
               <br />
               suited to their circumstances. But instead 
               <br />
               of that he has chosen rather to bring a 
               <br />
               sword, and with the ﬁrst blow of the sword 
               <br />
               he lops off everything he contended for in' 
               <br />
               1896. If there has been an interference 
               <br />
               with the prerogatives of this parliament by 
               <br />

               which church, even though it were my own

               church—if there has been an interference
