               to. As I ﬁgure the returns, the English polls

               gave 2,835 against 2.226, a clear majority for

               myself at the English-speaking polls 
               <br />
               of 609. Now with regard to the other 
               <br />
               nationalities the French polls gave a 
               <br />
               vote of 565. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span> the people in these

               districts are not French-speaking peo-

               ple; there are some Germans and some 
               <br />
               English-speaking people, but I class these as 
               <br />
               the French polls. The German polls gave a 
               <br />
               vote of 356; the Gaiicians. 780: and the 
               <br />
               half-breeds 525. Now, if the House would 
               <br />
               care to hear how these people voted, I will 
               <br />
               give the ﬁgures. These English-speaking 
               <br />
               polls gave a majority for myself of 916. 
               <br />
               How many of my friends on the other side 
               <br />
               of the House have as large a majority of 
               <br />
               English-speaking people to their credit? I

               fancy the hon. member for East Elgin has

               <br />
               German polls, 6 to 1. And I may mention 
               <br />
               that the Germans at these polls are all

               Protestants. Regarding religious divisions.

               these, of course, can only be given approxi- 
               <br />
               mately. .But, as I have lived in that country 
               <br />
               the greater part of my life, I may claim to 
               <br />
               be somewhat familiar with the conditions. 
               <br />
               I ﬁgure that there are about 2,535 of the 
               <br />
               English-speaking votes, Protestants, and 
               <br />
               about 300 Catholics. Of the French 565 are 
               <br />
               Catholic. Of the Germans 365 are Protes- 
               <br />
               tants; of the half-breeds about one-quarter 
               <br />
               are Protestants—that is 125 Protestants to 
               <br />
               about 400 Catholics ; the Gallcians, 780, about 
               <br />
               half or a little less, belong to the united 
               <br />
               Greek Church. which is. to a certain extent, 
               <br />
               afﬁliated with the Church of Rome, but they 
               <br />
               are not Roman Catholics, and the remaining 
               <br />
               half are of the Orthodox Greek Church, 
               <br />
               which has no more connection with the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic church than has the English 
               <br />
               church or any other Protestant denomina- 
               <br />
               tion. So. as I judge the total might be 
               <br />
               counted as being made up of 3.116 Protes- 
               <br />
               tants and 1,265 Catholics. Crediting half

               the Galicians to the Roman Catholic church 
               <br />
               and half to the non-Roman churches. which. 
               <br />
               in this case may be classed together, there 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,655.</span> Roman Catholics, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">3.406</span> others. 
               <br />
               whom, to include them all under one name, 
               <br />
               we may speak of in this case as Protestants, 
               <br />

               are the facts as I read them. and I put them

               on record for the information of the mem-

               bers of the opposition party in this House 
               <br />

               <br />
               back up their challenges and threats by 
               <br />
               action when they were given the opportunity, 
               <br />
               and take refuge in attempts to discredit an 
               <br />
               opinion they were unable to inﬂuence.

               a total of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,343</span> 'votes. The city of

               Dominion, at least one of the most progres-

               take pleasure—in belittling and discrediting 
               <br />
               the standing and enterprise of the people of 
               <br />
