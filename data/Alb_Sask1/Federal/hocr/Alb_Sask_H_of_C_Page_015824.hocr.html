               Sir \VILFRID LAURIER. We are not

               <br />
               introducing has been in existence at least 
               <br />
               twenty years. The very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conditioner</span> things

               to which my hon. friend objects. the pos-

               sibility of having religious instruction in the 
               <br />

               <br />
               since 1885. No injustice has been done to 
               <br />
               anybody under that system. If my hon. 
               <br />
               friend wants evidence of that, let him ask 
               <br />
               the representatives of the Territories who 
               <br />
               sit on this side. They will tell him that

               they are satisﬁed with this condition of
