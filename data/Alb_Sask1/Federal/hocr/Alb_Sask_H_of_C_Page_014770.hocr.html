               Minister the other day say that while the

               nineteenth century had been the century of 
               <br />
               progress of the United States, the twentieth 
               <br />
               century would be the century of progress 
               <br />
               of the people of Canada. Let us look for a 
               <br />
               moment at the history of the United States 
               <br />
               after the close of the civil war, after they 
               <br />
               had settled their differences at a very great 
               <br />
               cost in blood and treasure. When the North- 
               <br />
               western States along the Mississippi and 
               <br />
               Missouri valleys were opened for settlement. 
               <br />
               when the credit of the country and security 
               <br />
               for life and property were ﬁrmly established 
               <br />
               and people began to ﬂow into those new 
               <br />
               states in millions and bring in their mil- 
               <br />
               lions of money to develop their resources, it 
               <br />
               is on record that a western statesman made 
               <br />
               the remark that a man only needed to put 
               <br />
               his ear to the ground to hear the tramp of 
               <br />
               the coming millions. So, when we have 
               <br />
               settled our racial and sectarian disputes, we 
               <br />
               may hope to see people going into our west- 
               <br />
               ern country, not as now in hundreds of 
               <br />
               thousands, but in millions—when we can 
               <br />
               place our ear to the ground and hear the 
               <br />
               tramp of the coming millions. It is the 
               <br />
               duty of the members of this House to con- 
               <br />
               sider in what ways we- can make the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of that country happy and contented 
               <br />
               rather than to try to create trouble and dis-

               trust by ineﬂicient legislation and to stir up 
               <br />
               religious strife and difﬁculty. As one of the 
               <br />
               means of stirring up religious strife in this

               country we ﬁnd that attacks have been 
               <br />
               made upon respectable members of the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic church on the ground that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{they</span> have} tried to inﬂuence legislation. 
               <br />
               While it may appear that the vote which 1

               of the Northwest ordinances continued may 
               <br />
               be favourable to our Catholic brethren, I 
               <br />
               may say that from the time I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came.</span> to this 
               <br />
               House as a member, there has never been 
               <br />
               a Roman Catholic to speak to me or to ask 
               <br />
               me to vote for this Bill; and I believe the 
               <br />
               same is the experience of large numbers of 
               <br />
               the members of this House. Therefore 1 
               <br />
               say it does not lie in the mouths of hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite to try to impute any such 
               <br />
               designs to any members of this House. 
               <br />
               Some of these accusations have been made 
               <br />
               because the present government refused to 
               <br />
               extend the western boundary of the pro-

               We should take into consideration the rea- 
               <br />
               sons and arguments which caused them to 
               <br />
               make their honourable com-promises and bar- 
               <br />
               monize their differences in order to make 
               <br />
               Canada one grand harmonious whole. I 
               <br />
               would not have the hon. members of this 
               <br />
               House take their inspiration from such ﬁre~ 
               <br />
               brands as the Toronto ‘News’ and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">To</span> 
               <br />
               oronto ‘World.’ I prefer to take my inspira- 
               <br />
               tion from the fathers of confederation, who 
               <br />
               have set the people of Canada upon the 
               <br />
               high road of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">happy,</span> united and great na- 
               <br />
               tion. Animated by their bright example. 
               <br />
               we should approach the consideration of this 
               <br />
               Bill with the same unconquerable spirit, the 
               <br />
               same unﬂinching devotion to duty and the 
               <br />
               same patriotic zeal that inspired them. If 
               <br />
               we are guided by the example of the great 
               <br />
