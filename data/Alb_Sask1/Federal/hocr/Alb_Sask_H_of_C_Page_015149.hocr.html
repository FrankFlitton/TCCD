               remarks to the educational feature of the 
               <br />
               Bill, and I think it is well to consider at 
               <br />
               the very outset what is the real basis of 
               <br />
               the constitution as regards education. The 
               <br />
               subject of education is wholly dealt with in 
               <br />
               section 93, and its subsections, of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act of 1867. In my opinion 
               <br />
               that section was intended to be a ﬁnal and 
               <br />
               conclusive settlement of all controversies on 
               <br />
               the subject of education in this Dominion. 
               <br />
               It was intended to put an end once and 
               <br />
               for ever. if possible, to such wranglings and 
               <br />
               bickerings as had been so hurtful to the 
               <br />
               old Canadas and their peoples. The methods 
               <br />
               laid down to accomplish this may not have 
               <br />
               been in every respect and to the minds of 
               <br />
               some men the very acme of wisdom and 
               <br />
               statesmanship ; but they certainly were the 
               <br />
               result of the earnest and loyal efforts of 
               <br />
               the best minds of that day, and they are 
               <br />
               the law, and as such should cheerfully and 
               <br />
               in all loyalty be respected even though 
               <br />
               there are here and there some men who 
               <br />
               may see what they would like to have 
               <br />
               otherwise. I do not wish to be understood, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, as in the remotest degree 
               <br />
               questioning the wisdom of that Act of 1867, 
               <br />
               in any particular, nor as finding fault with 
               <br />
               any clause or word in section 93. That 
               <br />
               clause dealt with a diﬂicult subject in, as I 
               <br />
               believe. a most comprehensive manner, and 
               <br />
               it would be most presumptious in me or I

               method of accomplishing what was accom-

               day were old and practical statesmen, full 
               <br />

               or how it should become a province. Once

               it became a Province, however, the law 
               <br />
               as laid down in section 93 and its subsec- 
               <br />
               tions at once applied. We ﬁnd running 
               <br />
               through section 93 and its subsections one 
               <br />
               clear oprinciple, that education is a subject 
               <br />
               for provincial legislation—that in no way 
               <br />
               whatever is education under any circum- 
               <br />
               stances a subject for Dominion legislation 
               <br />
               except by way of appeal under the remedial 
               <br />
               clause. That is the principle throughout 
               <br />
               the whole clause and the subclauses. Read 
               <br />
               the main clause, and read every subclause. 
               <br />
               and you will see nothing but that from be- 
               <br />
               ginning to end. The provincial power in 
               <br />
               reference to education, it is true, contains 
               <br />
               certain restrictions and conditions, but 
               <br />
               these conditions always relate to provincial 
               <br />
               status; they relate to no other status 
               <br />
               whatever; and it is quite clear that if any 
               <br />
               one or more subclauses do not apply to a 
               <br />
               particular province, that does not confer 
               <br />
               any jurisdiction upon the Dominion parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. The only effect is that the province 
               <br />
               can exercise power without being hampered 
               <br />
               by such subclauses. I therefore contend 
               <br />
               as a necessary result that parliament can 
               <br />
               neithen legislate as to education, except in 
               <br />
               case of. appeal, nor can it add to or detract 
               <br />
               from or vary in any way the conditions on 
               <br />
               which provinces have authority to legis- 
               <br />
               late. We have questions bandied back and 
               <br />
               forth across the House as to what some 
               <br />
               particular gentleman of the legal profession 
               <br />
               thinks about the application of a certain 
               <br />
               clause. But why ask such questions ? The 
               <br />
               answer may be right or it may Ibe wrong. 
               <br />
               We can neither make it right nor make 
               <br />
               it wrong. If a subclause does apply in a 
               <br />
               particular case, we cannot prevent it apply- 
               <br />
               ing. If a clause of its own strength does 
               <br />
               not apply, we cannot by any Act of this 
               <br />
               parliament make it apply. We have no 
               <br />
               authority to interpret. Therefore why 
               <br />
               should we do more than apply the law as it 
               <br />
               is? Apply the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               and you thus apply section 93 subject to 
               <br />
               its subclauses; and that WDuld mean that
