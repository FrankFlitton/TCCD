               among them Jews and Mormons—they 
               <br />
               would be a majority for the establishment 
               <br />
               of a school. And, when these schools had

               <br />
               anything more than separation; it does 
               <br />
               not involve the idea that the separate

               could follow without a fuller and more

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. My hon.

               depart from the point he raised this after-

               <br />
               friend has gone back to that old heresy 
               <br />
               and fallacy of his that there is no constitu-

               further upon that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nownthough</span> I may ex-

               change some words with him upon it later 
               <br />
               on. But let me show him again, since he 
               <br />
               has declined to see it, so far, the difference 
               <br />
               between section 16, No. 1, and section 10, 
               <br />
               No. 2. Under section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">16.</span> No. 1, which prac— 
               <br />
               tically re—enacted the law of 1875, there 
               <br />
               was no restriction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatever</span> upon the pow-

               cr of the minority to establish such schools 
               <br />
               as they thought ﬁt. So far as I know 
               <br />
               there was no restriction whatever. My hon, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> says that in that case, you could 
               <br />
               have many different laws for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> dis-

               timate and logical conclusion of the law.

               able lawyers, perhaps many things would 
               <br />
               not be done which are done; but unfortun- 
               <br />
               ately these are often interpreted by the 
               <br />
               man on the street who does the best he 
               <br />
               can according to his knowledge. The leg- 
               <br />
               islature of that time thought it advisable 
               <br />
               to 'have two boards of education: they 
               <br />
               thought differently afterwards and abolish-

               ed them, whether they acted within their 
               <br />
               right or not. Suppose the Act of 1875 did 
               <br />
               not authorize that to be dmm ‘fter it 
               <br />
               had been in force for a number of years 
               <br />
               it was withdrawn, and it was held to be a 
               <br />
               grievance, and that grievance has been 
               <br />
               felt ever since. My hon. friend is familiar 
               <br />
               with the correspondence which took place 
               <br />
               between Arch-bishop Tache and others 
               <br />
               when this law was withdrawn in 1892, they 
               <br />
               made it the subject of complaint. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend might think that if the archbishop 
               <br />
               had been as good a lawyer as he is, he- 
               <br />
               might have concluded that they had no 
               <br />
               right under the law of 1875 to this extra 
               <br />
               hoard. But they thought they had. Now 
               <br />
               we have enacted the law of 1875 again, so 
               <br />
               that they may not begin again. Although 
               <br />
               I have great respect for the opinion of my 
               <br />
