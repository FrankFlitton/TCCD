               Mr. R. L. BORJDE'N. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               may possibly remember that when some 
               <br />
               inquiry was made with regard to the 
               <br />
               irregularities that have taken place in 
               <br />
               the elections throughout the Dominion. 
               <br />
               the government at that time assented 
               <br />
               to the proposal that counsel should be 
               <br />
               appointed on both sides to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">represent,</span> not 
               <br />
               only one side of the question, but also to 
               <br />
               bring forward and put into the hands of 
               <br />
               the commission any irregularities, any 
               <br />
               frauds, of which there was information in 
               <br />
               the possession of hon. gentlemen on either 
               <br />
               side of the House. So far as the present 
               <br />
               matter is concerned, it would appear that 
               <br />
               there are two considerations. One is the 
               <br />
               consideration of protecting the rights of the 
               <br />
               half-breeds; the other is the consideration 
               <br />
               of seeing that the public interests are pro- 
               <br />
               tected in regard to all transactions with the 
               <br />
               Department of the Interior. Now, as to 
               <br />
               both of these features, I desire, as 1 pre-

               <br />

               I think my hon. friend has made a very

               fair proposal, and I would be inclined to 
               <br />
               think that the investigation could not be

               very thorough or satisfactory unless some 
               <br />

               The object of this motion, Mr. Chairman, 
               <br />
               is not, as some have supposed, to attempt 
               <br />
               to introduce the dual language into these 
               <br />
               two new provinces. Nor is it an attempt 
               <br />
               to force the French language upon the two 
               <br />
               new provinces. To describe the amendment 
               <br />
               in that way is a very incorrect proceeding. 
               <br />
               It is sought, on the contrary,.by this amend- . 
               <br />
               ment to maintain the constitutional pro~ 
               <br />
               vision in the law of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories which has always existed from time 
               <br />
               immemorial and it is also sought to secure 
               <br />
               the maintenance of the solemn agreement 
               <br />
               which was entered into when Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land was incorporated into and became a 
               <br />
               part of the Dominion of Canada. I would 
               <br />
               like to call the attention <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> the committee, 
               <br />
