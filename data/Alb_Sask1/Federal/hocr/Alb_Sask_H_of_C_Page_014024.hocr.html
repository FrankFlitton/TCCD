               themselves. The reformation created a 
               <br />
               cleavage between Christians. The old 
               <br />
               section remained Roman Catholics ; the new 
               <br />
               called themselves Protestants. Between the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics and Protestants there is a 
               <br />
               deep divergence in dogmas. Between the 
               <br />
               various Protestant denominations there are 
               <br />
               but small differences in dogmas : the differ- 
               <br />
               ences are more matters of discipline than of 
               <br />
               dogma. Therefore the old legislature of 
               <br />
               Canada, ﬁnding a population of Catholics 
               <br />
               and different denominations of Protestants 
               <br />
               all mixed together. ﬁnding only one cause of 
               <br />
               cleavage between them in Christian faith. 
               <br />
               that is dogmas, allowed religious teaching 
               <br />
               to be had in all the schools of our country. 
               <br />
               so that every man could give to his own 
               <br />
               child the religious tenets which he held 
               <br />
               sometimes dearer than life. That is the 
               <br />
               whole meaning of separate schools.
