               Mr. FOWLER. Well, from the geographi- 
               <br />
               cal position of Edmonton, it does not strike 
               <br />
               me that the reasons for placing the capital 
               <br />
               there are so obvious as the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior would have us suppose. There 
               <br />
               must be some hidden reason for it which 
               <br />
               has not yet been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disclosed</span> to the committee. 
               <br />
               Is it because that happens to be the resi- 
               <br />
               dence of the minister himself? Can he 
               <br />
               not get beyond the parochial idea ? Surely 
               <br />
               the position he occupies to-day as a minister 
               <br />
               of the Crown should have broadened his 
               <br />
               ideas, and have enabled him to get away 
               <br />
               from the parish in which he resides. Any 
               <br />
               man who studies the situation must be con- 
               <br />
               vinced that Edmonton is not the proper 
               <br />
               place for the capital, but that the proper 
               <br />
               place is the city of Calgary, which is more 
               <br />
               nearly the centre of population in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince. the commercial metropolis of that 
               <br />
               country. and on the main line of travel. 
               <br />
               the main line of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way. not on a sidetrack as the city of Ed- 
               <br />
               monton is. It seems to me that the min- 
               <br />
               ister is treating this committee with very 
               <br />
               scant courtesy when he shows such a lack 
               <br />
               of explanation for placing the capital in 
               <br />
               this position. I do not think he has any 
               <br />
               right to treat this committee in this cava- 
               <br />

               tricts. That province was divided into four 
               <br />
               federal constituencies. In the two north 
               <br />
               districts of Edmonton and Strathcona the 
               <br />

               will be shortly two main lines of railways

               built, namely, the Canadian Northern, which 
               <br />
               is expected to reach Edmonton this fall, and 
               <br />
               the Grand Trunk Paciﬁc, which will reach 
               <br />
               it in a short time. This leads to the in- 
               <br />
               evitable conclusion that very shortly the 
               <br />
               northern part of Alberta will have a popu- 
               <br />
               lation very much in excess of the popula- 
               <br />
               tion which may be expected in the southern 
               <br />
               portion. My hon. friend spoke of something 
               <br />
               hidden behind the selection of Edmonton. 
               <br />
               Well, I am not a particular advocate of 
               <br />
               the claims of Edmonton to be the capital as 
               <br />
               against the claim of Calgary. I, fortun- 
               <br />
               ately. do not live in the proposed province 
               <br />
               of Alberta, but in what I believe to be a 
               <br />
               better province, that of Saskatchewan. 
               <br />
               Surely my hon. friend has never been in 
               <br />
               that part of the country Iat present termed

               the northern part of Alberta, or he would 
               <br />
               know that Edmonton is situated on a hill,

               way. running through it now. And the 
               <br />
               maps published by the Department of the 
               <br />
               Interior show that the settlement in the 
               <br />
               southern part of the proposed province of 
               <br />
               Alberta is very much in excess of that in 
               <br />
               the northern part. They show that the 
               <br />
               country to the south is being taken up very 
               <br />
               much more rapidly than the country to the 
               <br />
               north. And that settlement will be great— 
               <br />
               ly increased when the large irrigation canal 
               <br />
               is completed which is now in course of con- 
               <br />
               struction. That will open to settlement two 
               <br />
               or three million acres of very fertile land 
               <br />
               that only require irrigation to become cap- 
               <br />
               able of cultivation.
