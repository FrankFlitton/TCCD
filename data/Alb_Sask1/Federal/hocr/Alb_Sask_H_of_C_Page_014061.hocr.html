               It is usual on the introduction of a Bill—on

               a short discussion may arise on some features

               the principle of incorporating more tele- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was introduced in the Manitoba Legislature

               <br />
               have the honour to represent in this House. 
               <br />
               They opposed it chieﬂy on the ground that

               but representations were made to the council 
               <br />
               that the telephone business was essentially 
               <br />
               a monopoly, and therefore no new telephone 
               <br />
               company should be chartered and the appli- 
               <br />
               cation was not granted. Instead, the city of 
               <br />
               San Francisco appointed a commission to 
               <br />
               inquire into the whole subject, and the com- 
               <br />
               mission reported. This is the last clause 
               <br />
               of its report, as published in the bulletin of 
               <br />

               Mr. BOLE. A commission was appointed 
               <br />
               by the city of San Francisco to inquire into 
               <br />
               the whole question of the telephone busi- 
               <br />
               ness. An application was made by certain 
               <br />
               promoters to the city of San Francisco for 
               <br />
               permission to construct and operate a rival 
               <br />
               telephone business in San Francisco. Re- 
               <br />
               presentations were made to the city council 
               <br />
               that to multiply telephone lines would be 
               <br />
               a nuisance, and the city council therefore
