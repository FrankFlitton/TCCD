               is claimed the minority rely upon—neither 
               <br />
               the Act nor the ordinances were the result

               of the will of the people of the Territor-

               Territories had nothing to do with it ; they 
               <br />
               were never consulted. The Act of 1875, 
               <br />
               was passed by this parliament, and the 
               <br />
               ordinances were passed by the Lieutenant 
               <br />

               <br />
               formed his executive. all appointees of this

               tories, but also to the provinces when 
               <br />
               created. The Hon. Mr. Dewdney. sitting up

               <br />
               to improve or alter their school system. I 
               <br />
               have read section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4</span> of the Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               which enabled us to pass the Act of 1875. 
               <br />
               The Act of 1875, did not give permis- 
               <br />
               sion even to the Lieutenant Governor in 
               <br />

               but you ‘shall' create separate schools. That

               that on one occasion Sir John Thompson, as

               right for Catholics to have a school separate 
               <br />
               from Protestants. and vice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">verse.</span> I 
               <br />
               have just read what he said on that point. 
               <br />
               Now, I propose to show, ﬁrst, that by the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 no right to religious teaching in the 
               <br />
               schools was given ; secomd <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> if clause 16 
               <br />
               remain in the Bill, that in itself would have 
               <br />
               conferred no such right——that it went on 
               <br />
               further than the clause of 1875; third, 
               <br />
               that ordinances 29 and 30 are to—day in 
               <br />
               force. and contain all] <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">land</span> more than 
               <br />
               clause 16; fourth, that under the ori— 
               <br />
               ginal Bill ordinances 29 and 30, even as 
               <br />
               they are, could have been amended by the 
               <br />
               legislature of the new province. Section 15 
               <br />
               of the Bill provided that every ordinance 
               <br />
               should remain in force until altered by the 
               <br />
               legislature of the new province; therefore 
               <br />
               it‘ the Bill had been left as it was ﬁrst drawn 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice ordinances 29 and 
               <br />
               30 would have been subject to repeal or 
               <br />
               amendment by the new legislature; ﬁfth, 
               <br />
