               very burning question and a question of 
               <br />
               very great importance. The agitation which 
               <br />
               has been aroused over that clause is im-

               mense. and we all regret it. That agita~

               clauses of this measure have already been 
               <br />
               discussed a good deal in this country. They 
               <br />
               have encountered very bitter opposition 
               <br />
               from the newspapers, especially in that en-

               most Liberals have been outspoken in their

               opposition to those clauses, and they have 
               <br />
               also enjoyed the distinction of being made

               the subject of the censorious tongues of those 
               <br />
               who adorn the pulpits of this country. There 
               <br />
               are many points of view from which this
