               constituency north of that line, that has

               unaltered are the constituencies in the

               southern part of this province according to 
               <br />

               ision unfair ? I would ask the First Minis- 
               <br />
               ter to look at the map. On May lst, 1902, 
               <br />
               that country was divided up into local con- 
               <br />
               stituencies by the legislative assembly at 
               <br />
               Regina. As has been stated there were 15 
               <br />
               constituencies in Alberta, and as the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior has stated, nine of these 
               <br />
               constituencies were south of township 38 
               <br />
               and 6 north. There has never been any 
               <br />
               complaint as to the fairness of that division.
