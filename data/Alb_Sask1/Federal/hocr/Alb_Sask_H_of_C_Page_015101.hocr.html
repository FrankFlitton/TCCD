               <br />
               of their tenets amongst the children. He 
               <br />
               drew us a very startling picture of a family 
               <br />

               <br />
               many years has attracted so much atten- 
               <br />
               tion as this. In 1896 the attention of the 
               <br />
               Dominion was directed to what was known 
               <br />
               as the Remedial Bill, relating to the pro- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vince</span> of Manitoba. But that public atten- 
               <br />
               tion was as nothing compared to the at- 
               <br />
               tention that has been aroused in the present 
               <br />
               instance. This is due primarily to the fact 
               <br />
               that the people of the Dominion regarded 
               <br />
               the boundaries of the province of Manitoba 
               <br />
               as settled and that province as pretty well 
               <br />
               populated, so that, even if there were a 
               <br />

               <br />
               foisted upon the people of Manitoba only

               a comparatively small number of people

               <br />
               millions upon millions. In view of the
