               powered to act. It is in virtue of the powers

               conferred upon us by the imperial parlia- 
               <br />
               ment by this section that we are creating 
               <br />
               this province. It is known, Mr. Speaker, to 
               <br />
               many members of this House that a popular 
               <br />
               impression exists to the cﬁfect that this 
               <br />
               parliament has the power of creating pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and that at the time of the creation 
               <br />
               of provinces it can give those provinces such 
               <br />
               a constitution as it thinks ﬁt. That is 
               <br />
               the popular impression and that impression 
               <br />
               is created no doubt in the minds of many 
               <br />
               by the reading of this section. But is that 
               <br />
               proposition well founded ? I think not; I 
               <br />
               do not think there is anything in this sec- 
               <br />
               tion which authorizes us, in creating a pro- 
               <br />

               <br />
               give it a constitution. we simply perform, if 
               <br />
               I may use that expression. a creative Act; 
               <br />
               we create the. province, the constitutional 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of .18le provides the rest. That is how 
               <br />
               1 read this section. 1t is true that in this 
               <br />
               section the words <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘estalilish</span> ‘ and then ‘ con- 
               <br />
               stitute.’ and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> ‘administer' are used. 
               <br />
               But what do these words mean? There is 
               <br />
               one thing it seems to me that they do not 
               <br />
               mean. It is this, that in creating a province 
               <br />
               we can in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> vary the terms relating 
               <br />
               to the powers of that province that have been 
               <br />
               laid down in a uniform and deﬁnite man— 
               <br />
               ner by our Constitutional Act of 1867, and 
               <br />
               that is the r ason which no doubt has led 
               <br />
               many and has induced probably the leader 
               <br />
               oi the opposition (Mr. R. L. Borden) to ar- 
               <br />
               rive at the conclusion that we have no power 
               <br />
               in creating a province to make any dispos-

               <br />
               cational matters are concerned, because if 
               <br />
               when creating a province we can give to that 
               <br />
               province a particular educational system we 
               <br />
