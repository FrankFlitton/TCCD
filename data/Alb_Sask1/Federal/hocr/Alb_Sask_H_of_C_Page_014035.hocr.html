               <br />
               was manifested some eight or nine years ago 
               <br />
               when a similar question arose. It has been 
               <br />
               asserted by some—with what truth I know 
               <br />
               not—that that question was deliberately 
               <br />
               brought into the political arena for the ad-

               allude to that and express once more the 
               <br />
               hope that whatever may have been done in

               hon. friend has expressed this afternoon, we

               a spirit of Christian charity and forbear-

               ance, realizing that on all such questions

               there are two sides and endeavouring each

               <br />
               the question presented to us not only from 
               <br />
               our own standpoint but also from the

               standpoint of those who differ from 
               <br />
               us in opinion. It is above all things desi-

               tions. touching sometimes upon differences 
               <br />
               of races and dealing with matters of dogma 
               <br />
               and creed, should not be introduced into the

               deal with this question in that spirit.
