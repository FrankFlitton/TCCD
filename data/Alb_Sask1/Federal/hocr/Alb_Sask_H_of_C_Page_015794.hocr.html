               <br />
               speaking generally, What has happened un- 
               <br />
               der the law of 1875 ‘2 The legislature of the 
               <br />
               Territories has maintained the bare prin- 
               <br />
               ciple of separate schools, but it has taken 
               <br />
               away everything else. It began by recog- 
               <br />
               nizing, probably, the spirit of the law of 
               <br />
               1875, and providing a dual system such as 
               <br />
               we have in Quebec. But since then it has 
               <br />
               taken away the control of the curriculum, 
               <br />
               of the qualiﬁcation of teachers, the normal 
               <br />
               schools, everything but what is covered by 
               <br />
               the mere letter of the bond—if I may use 
               <br />
               that expression—as to the existence of 
               <br />
               separate schools. It has been stated that 
               <br />
               these enactments are ultra vires, and opinion 
               <br />
               has been cited to that effect. But we have 
               <br />
               no pronouncement by any tribunal. And it 
               <br />
               occurred to me, I must say, that if we re- 
               <br />
               enact that clause, which is the governing 
               <br />
               clause of the section, that would keep the 
               <br />
               ordinances which now exist. To say that 
               <br />
               under this clause litigations might be be- 
               <br />
               gun to question the validity of the ordin- 
               <br />
               ances, and to try to obtain restoration of the 
               <br />
               law as it existed previous to the passage 
               <br />
               of these ordinances, would [be avery unsatis- 
               <br />
               factory condition of aﬁairs for the minority 
               <br />
               in the new province. I claimed at the time 
               <br />
               that under the substituted clause 16 we 
               <br />
               had something clearer. The ordinances at 
               <br />
               present in force were specially referred to. 
               <br />
               There was no ambiguity possible; and 
               <br />
               what small rights the minority possess to- 
               <br />
               day were indicated there in so many words, 
               <br />
               and the minority could not be deprived of 
               <br />
               those rights. Under clause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">16..</span> as ﬁrst 
               <br />
               brought down—to give an instance—if the 
               <br />
               legislature of the province saw ﬁt to abolish 
               <br />
               the advisory board, and thereby deprive the 
               <br />
               Minister of Public Instruction in the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of the advice—for it is nothing more 
               <br />
               -—of the two Catholic members of that 
               <br />
               board, what would there be to prevent? I 
               <br />
               do not think that there is anything in clause 
               <br />
               16, as at ﬁrst proposed, to prevent such an 
               <br />
               enactment. It would be, nevertheless, an 
               <br />
               encroachment, to a certain extent, upon the 
               <br />
               rights of the Catholic minority. If, under 
               <br />
               clause 16, as at ﬁrst proposed, the legisla- 
               <br />
               ture passed a law declaring that the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of Public Instruction would have a 
               <br />
               right of veto upon the nomination of pro- 
               <br />
               fessors, would that be ultra vires ? I do 
               <br />
               not think so. But it would be an abridge- 
               <br />
               ment of the rights of the minority. Under 
               <br />
               the present clause 16 the trustees have the 
               <br />
               right to choose and control their own pro- 
               <br />
               fessors, provided that those professors have 
               <br />
               the qualiﬁcations required by the law of 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories. In other words, 
               <br />
               under clause 16, N0. 2, I ﬁnd the assurance 
               <br />
               that there would be less possibility of liti- 
               <br />
               gation. It merely, in effect, enumerated the

               excepting as regards the particular case 
               <br />
               which I have mentioned a moment ago, and 
               <br />
               I think I explained the circumstances under 
               <br />
               which that case was brought to our notice.

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. My hon. friend must

               not overlook what he said. Speaking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">01?</span> 
               <br />
               clause 16, No. 2, he said:

               So I do not see in the last enactment that 
               <br />
               there is any concession—very far from it. I 
               <br />
               think the last amendment goes perhaps a little 
               <br />
               farther than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">original</span> enactment which 
               <br />
               caused so much excitement, because it deﬁnes
