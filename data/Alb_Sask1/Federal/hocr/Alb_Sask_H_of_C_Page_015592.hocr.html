               like to know where that material exists.

               It is obvious that it does not exist in the

               <br />
               It seems to me that we can dismiss that at 
               <br />
               once. The census of 1901 is not acted upon 
               <br />

               goes without saying, that a census which

               these local municipal divisions about which 
               <br />
               there has been so much discussion in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con~</span>

               nection with the redistribution of Ontario. 
               <br />
               The right hon. gentleman (Sir VVi'lfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) seems to base his argument 
               <br />
               largely on the list of those who have voted. 
               <br />
               if I look at that list I ﬁnd the arrangement 
               <br />
               of constituencies quite as unsatisfactory as 
               <br />
               the list of electors for the different ridings 
               <br />
               now proposed to be created. Having had 
               <br />
               some acquaintance with this subject in the 
               <br />
               session of 1903, when I acted upon a com- 
               <br />
               mittee to which was entrusted the duty of 
               <br />
               repoiting the distributing of ridings in all 
               <br />
               parts of Canada, where the disnibution was 
               <br />
               a matte1 of dispute, I never heard in the 
               <br />
               committee any suggestion that we should 
               <br />
               proceed upon the basis of those who have 
               <br />
               voted in any particular riding. We proceed- 
               <br />
               ed always upon the basis of population, and 
               <br />
               I think it must be apparent to the right hon.

               gentleman that a list of electors in the rid-
