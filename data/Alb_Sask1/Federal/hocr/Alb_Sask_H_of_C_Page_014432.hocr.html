               that in the fall of 1903 We had a discussion 
               <br />
               about a certain matter of capital advance. 
               <br />
               I read a telegram from Mr. Haultain which

               practically asked me to get a capital ad-

               would be satisfactory to him. Well, later 
               <br />
               in the assembly he declared that they were 
               <br />
               not satisfactory, and it is to the knowledge 
               <br />
               of everybody that that declaration had

               absolutely no other motive than partisanship
