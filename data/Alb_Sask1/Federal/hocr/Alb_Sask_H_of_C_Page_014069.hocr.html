               I believe that the people of Manitoba it let 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">alone</span> will settle this question for themselves. 
               <br />
               Why should we not believe this? We know 
               <br />
               from our own experience in the maritime pro- 
               <br />
               vinces that it has been found possible to main- 
               <br />
               tain a free school system and to administer it 
               <br />
               so as to make it acceptable to the people of 
               <br />
               every class and creed. We hear no complaint 
               <br />
               of the Nova Scotia School Law. The Manitoba 
               <br />
               school system is substantially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,same</span> as 
               <br />
               Nova. Scotia.

               My object in quoting this language of the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance is not to criticise or to 
               <br />
               discuss it; it is simply to Show that when 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman accepted the aid 
               <br />
               and support of the Minister of Finance 
               <br />

               <br />
               him to enter his cabinet, he knew that the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman had used that language, and 
               <br />
               had made these speeches in Nova Scotia. 
               <br />
               Thus, the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid 
               <br />
               Laurier) had full knowledge of the views 
               <br />
               which the Minister of Finance entertained 
               <br />
               in regard to certain provisions similar to 
               <br />
               those in the Bill now before parliament.

               I wish to once more call the attention of 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman (Sir Wilfrid

               ment had every reason to believe, was 
               <br />
               bound to believe, and indeed every one of us 
               <br />
               did believe, that the provisions of that 
               <br />
               Bill had received the assent of every member
