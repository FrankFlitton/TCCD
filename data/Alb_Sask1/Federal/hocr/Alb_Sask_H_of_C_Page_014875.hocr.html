               sions this parliament was asked to repeal 
               <br />
               these provisions of the statute, but refused 
               <br />
               to do so. One would suppose, from what 
               <br />
               is said by hon. gentlemen opposite, that 
               <br />
               this was the ﬁrst time it had been proposed

               <br />
               educational privileges suitable to their con-

               <br />
               a quarter of a century, and over and over 
               <br />
               again it has been conﬁrmed by this House. 
               <br />
               In the session of 1894, on consideration of 
               <br />
               the Bill to amend the Northwest Territories 
               <br />

               <br />
               ship, the late Mr. Dalton McCarthy went 
               <br />
               fully into the question of separate schools 
               <br />
               and school legislation for the Territories. 
               <br />
               He was endeavouring to persuade the House 
               <br />
               that the time had come when the Territorial 
               <br />
               legislature should be given full control of 
               <br />
               educational matters. The scope of the leg- 
               <br />
               islation of 1875 was fully investigated by 
               <br />
               Mr. McCarthy, and it is instructive to note

               The inference from these quotations is 
               <br />
               clear, that so eminent a jurist as the late 
               <br />
               Mr. Dalton McCarthy gave it as his opinion

               tained in these Territories until the time 
               <br />
               when they came to us seeking admission as 
               <br />
               provinces into confederation, then we would 
               <br />
               be bound to perpetuate the existing state of 
               <br />
               affairs in regard to education. I want to 
               <br />
               point out how remarkably consonant this 
               <br />
               opinion of Mr. McCarthy was with the 
               <br />
               opinions expressed in 1875 by Hon. Edward 
               <br />
               Blake and Hon. David <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mills,</span> and consonant 
               <br />
               also with the opinion—not, of course, the 
               <br />
               opinion of a lawyer—expreSsed by Hon. 
               <br />
               George Brown in the Senate when the Bill 
               <br />
               of 1875 was under advisement. We hear 
               <br />
               very much about these proposals as regards 
               <br />
               education being an invasion of provincial 
               <br />
               rights. And. strange to say, this cry of pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights- comes from a quarter that 
               <br />
               did not, in the old days, hold provincial 
               <br />
               rights in very high esteem. Why, Sir, the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario, whence I come, has on 
               <br />
               many occasions had to do battle and 
               <br />
               strenuous battle for provincial rights. 
               <br />
               And who constituted the enemy on those 
               <br />
               occasions ? The Conservative party in 
               <br />
