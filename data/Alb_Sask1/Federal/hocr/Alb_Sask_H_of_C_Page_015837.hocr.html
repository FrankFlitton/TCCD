               <br />

               covenants to which I am about to refer were 
               <br />
               entered into. The Dominion government 
               <br />
               ﬁnally‘ invited the settlers of the Red River 
               <br />
               settlement then organized as a provincial 
               <br />

               such a way as to be in a position to name 
               <br />
               representatives—the Dominion government 
               <br />
               invited the residents of the Red River to 
               <br />
               send delegates to Ottawa, to meet the Dom-

               inion government and to lay before that 
               <br />
               government the claims, the pretentious, and 
               <br />
               the desires of the residents of Rupert’s

               satisfactory to these residents and lead to 
               <br />
               the peaceful taking possession of this vast

               territory by the Dominion government. 
               <br />
               There was a meeting of the members of the

               any rate in the Red River settlement, and 
               <br />
               delegates were deputed to Ottawa,. in con-

               formity with the Wish of the Dominion

               government, at the suggestion of the im-

               perial government, and in order to carry out

               Perhaps I may read the commission issued
