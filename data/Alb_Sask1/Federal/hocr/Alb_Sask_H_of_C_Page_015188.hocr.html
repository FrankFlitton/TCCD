               of 1861, which was then in round numbers 
               <br />
               1,400,000 souls, or 1,396,000 souls. It is 
               <br />
               distributed equally. Quebec received 80

               cents per head of the population upon the 
               <br />
               census of 1861, which showed a population 
               <br />
               of a little over 1,110,000. Then, all the

               New Brunswick, Manitoba, and so on, 
               <br />

               <br />
               reached the maximum of 400,000 souls. It 
               <br />
               was obviously impossible to accept this

               together have a population which exceeds 
               <br />
               the minimum limit of 400,000 souls, so we 
               <br />
               have suggested that the gradation should 
               <br />
               go on until they have reached in each pro-

               we are making this analogous to it, making

               Mr. SPROULE. There have been many 
               <br />
               applications from Quebec and the other 
               <br />

               <br />
               provinces in the last few years there have 
               <br />
               been representations of this kind. In the

               ﬁrst instance, as I understand, they all re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               that was regarded as a fixed and proper

               <br />
               that they are justiﬁed in ﬁxing the new 
               <br />
               provinces at the same sum now? If the 
               <br />
               experience of the past has proven that that 
               <br />

               applications are received from the various
