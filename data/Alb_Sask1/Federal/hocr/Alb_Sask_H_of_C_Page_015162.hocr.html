               terized <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> this parliament. A few days ago 
               <br />
               I went to the city of Toronto, and I found 
               <br />
               the people there clothedand in their right 
               <br />
               mind; I saw no blatant mob; on the con- 
               <br />
               trary, I saw a city magniﬁcent in its univer- 
               <br />
               sities and its colleges, in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">its</span> public institu- 
               <br />
               tions. in its private enterprise, in the energ.v 
               <br />
               and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intelligence</span> of its people, and I came 
               <br />
               away feeling that Canada should be proud 
               <br />
               of Toronto. Let me refer for a moment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rom-assai-</span> 
               <br />
               1 think he was the greatest sinner in this 
               <br />
               respect; and yet there were some thingS 
               <br />
               in the hon. gentleman’s speech that I agreed 
               <br />
               with—that I felt were in keeping with the 
               <br />
               dignity and the tone of this debate. But 
               <br />
               a large part of his speech seemed to me 
               <br />
               to be a mixture'of fact and fiction, lit up 
               <br />
               by a somewhat lurid declamation of a rasp- 
               <br />
               ing character; and therefore 'I felt that if 
               <br />
               that hon. gentleman expects, as I believe he 
               <br />
               does, to become a man of light and leading 
               <br />
               for the people of united Canada, it will be 
               <br />
               necessary for him to mend his methods and 
               <br />
               moderate his language. But the member 
               <br />
               for Labelle has also gone back on his re- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cord</span> with respect to the question before the 
               <br />
               House. ”In 1902, when an effort was made 
               <br />
               in parliament to have a Dominion regis- 
               <br />
               tration for the medical men of the whole 
               <br />
               of Canada, the hon. member for Labelle op- 
               <br />
               posed that on the grOund that it was a 
               <br />
               quest'on of education, saying that education- 
               <br />
               al questions belonged exclusively to the 
               <br />
               province. Why this change? Is this not 
               <br />
               an educational question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'1</span> Does it not, then, 
               <br />
               as exclusively belong to the province as 
               <br />
               the question of Dominion registration for 
               <br />
               medical men? And yet the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man to-day is taking a directly Opposite 
               <br />
               position from that which he took in 1902. 
               <br />
               Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that the sheet 
               <br />
               anchor for the permanence and security 
               <br />
               of the rights of minorities in any country is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> stand solidly by the constitution. It 
               <br />
               may suit the convenience or the inclination 
               <br />
               of the minority to-day to encroach upon 
               <br />
               the provisions of the constitution, but it will 
               <br />
               come back to them in the years to come 
               <br />
               with double force and when they least 
               <br />
               expect it. Therefore my view is that we 
               <br />
               should always stand unﬂinchingly and solid— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ly</span> in line with the terms of the constitution.

               able discussion during this debate as to

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">you</span> heard- that because Lord Carnatvon,

               <br />
               Sir, an .Act of parliament is an expression 
               <br />
               of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span> will. The same canon of

               construction that applies to a contract you 
               <br />
               apply to the interpretation of an Act of 
               <br />
               parliament; that is what the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice said this afternoon, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-,which</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will]!</span> 
               <br />
               shorten my remarks upon this particular 
               <br />
               point. If I meet with you, Mr. Speaker 
               <br />
               and we enter into a contract which for cer- 
               <br />
               tainty we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reduces</span> to writing, the inten- 
               <br />
               tion of the contracting parties is discovered 
               <br />
               by the language which we have used, and 
               <br />
               the courts will so determine; and if this 
               <br />
               or any other legislature enacts a statute, 
               <br />
               the intention is the mind of the legislature 
               <br />
               as expressed in the words that are used. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               will not deny that that is the correct canon 
               <br />
               of interpretation that you are -to apply to 
               <br />

               <br />

               Now, I listened with very much inter- 
               <br />
               est the other day to the Minister of Inland 
               <br />
               Revenue (Mr. Brodeur) who said that there 
               <br />
               was a compact between these provinces 
               <br />
               even reaching out to the great North— 
               <br />
               west; but when he was interrogated by 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition, he admitted 
               <br />
               that whatever the compact was, was ex— 
               <br />
               pressed in the Alct <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament—that</span> 
               <br />
               you could not go back of the Act of par- 
               <br />
               liament. But. 'Sir, on the top of that, with 
               <br />
               a kind of triumphant wave of the hand, he 
               <br />
               turned to the supporters of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment sitting behind the First <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister.</span> 
               <br />
               and he said: Are you going back upon 
               <br />
               the compact and the terms that were agreed 
               <br />
               upon in the years gone by? And he was 
               <br />
               applauded to the echo. It did occur to me 
               <br />
               that my right hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               government moved a little uneasily in his 
               <br />
               seat when the Minister of Inland Rev- 
               <br />
               enue made that statement; because he 
               <br />
               was the great exponent of going back on 
               <br />
               the compact in 1896, when he refused to 
               <br />
               carry out the terms of the Manitoba Act 
               <br />
               as to remedial legislation; and therefore 
               <br />
               it seems to me that it was hardly worth 
               <br />
               while for the Minister of Inland Revenue 
               <br />
               to dwell upon that when he was com- 
               <br />
               pelled to admit that the intention was with- 
               <br />
               in the four corners of the Act itself. No 
               <br />
               wonder that the hon. member for Labelle, 
               <br />
               in consequence of the action of the First 
               <br />
               Minister in 1896, in answer to the Minister
