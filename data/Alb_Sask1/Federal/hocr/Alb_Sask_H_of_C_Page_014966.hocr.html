               believe the Catholics of this country are just 
               <br />
               as loyal and ready to uphold the government 
               <br />
               of this country as any other class of the 
               <br />
               community, and they will not say that if 
               <br />
               they cannot get what they want. whether 
               <br />
               it is constitutional or not, they will take no 
               <br />
               part in the government of this country.

               if the Prime Minister was driven from
