               should be excluded from the new provinces

               is a suggestion that they should be excluded

               from representation in this parliament.

               new provinces have been represented in par- 
               <br />
               liament for ﬁfteen or twenty years ? Does 
               <br />
               he not know that the Yukon, still a terri-

               It does not seem to me to be worthy of the

               position of the hon. gentleman as a minister 
               <br />
               of the Crown to endeavour so absolutely 
               <br />
               to misrepresent a suggestion made by my 
               <br />
               friend from South York. Why should he 
               <br />
               do this in view of the words of the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister of two sessions ago ? Did not the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister at that time point out that 
               <br />
               the Territories under the government which 
               <br />
               they enjoy—and the territory of Athabaska 
               <br />
               would enjoy the same rights, I suppose—does 
               <br />
               he not remember that the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               said two years ago that they enjoyed almost 
               <br />
               every right that a province now enjoys ? 
               <br />
               Does he not remember that on the 21st of 
               <br />
               February last the Prime Minister said that 
               <br />
               we were adding very little to the powers 
               <br />
               of these Territories when we were granting 
               <br />
               them what he called perfect and complete 
               <br />
               autonomy ? Yet the hon. gentleman is dis- 
               <br />
               tressed because some one on this side of 
               <br />
               the'House now proposes that a portion of 
               <br />
               the area to be embraced within the new 
               <br />
               provinces should be left for the present 
               <br />
               under a territorial form of government. He 
               <br />
               talks about campaigningin the west of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. The hon. gentleman never seems .to be 
               <br />
               able to get campaigning out of his mind. 
               <br />
               Every time he gets on his feet it is with 
               <br />
               the endeavour to put words into the mouth 
               <br />
               of some gentleman on this side of the House 
               <br />
               which he never uttered. He never seems to 
               <br />
               be able to free himself from the idea that 
               <br />
               he will be campaigning himself within a 
               <br />
               very short time, and possibly the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman may have some misgivings as to how 
               <br />
               the next campaign may result, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> he 
               <br />
               would not take so much trouble to mis-

               favourably impressed with the suggestion 
               <br />
               of the member for Hamilton which would 
               <br />
               result <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> creating only one province in the

               great deal may be said in favour of the

               Mr. W. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">T.</span> MACLEAN. I may point out 
               <br />
               to the minister that for thirty years these 
               <br />
               Territories now to be erected into provinces 
               <br />
               have been under territoritl government and 
               <br />
               have had representation in a local legisla- 
               <br />
               ture. They have had representation here, 
               <br />
               and if they have not that representation 
               <br />
               which the hon. gentleman says they ought 
               <br />
               to have it is because his party did not 
               <br />
               bring down this Autonomy Bill years ago. 
               <br />
               They have been in power now eight years 
               <br />
               before making a move to give that represen- 
               <br />
               tation here so that it has been in respect to 
               <br />
               them taxation without representation. But 
               <br />
               that is altogether apart from the question. 
               <br />
               If these provinces have not been given 
               <br />
               representation in this House it is due to the 
               <br />
               hon, gentlemen opposite. I still say that 
               <br />
               the northern boundary is better deﬁned by 
               <br />
               the 55th line than it is by the inclusion of 
               <br />
               Athabaska. I still maintain that Athabaska 
               <br />
               has a foundation for a new province and for 
               <br />
               a present territorial government in the north; 
               <br />
               and if it is the wish of the House to have 
               <br />
               only one province where it is now proposed 
               <br />
               to have two, and to have that line drawn 
               <br />
               at the 55th line for the Northwest boundary, 
               <br />
               I am willing to amend my proposal in that 
               <br />
               direction so as to meet the views of the hon.

               ing the proposition for one province instead 
               <br />
               of two, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> if this amendment is submitted 
               <br />
               it will put me in a false position if I vote 
               <br />
               against it. Now I think some attention 
               <br />
               should be paid to the premier of the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories and to the legislature when 
               <br />
               they themselves advocated one province. I 
               <br />
               understand that the resolution passed in the 
               <br />
               Northwest legislature was on the line that 
               <br />
               they should have provincial autonomy, and 
               <br />
               that the consensus of opinion was to the 
               <br />
               effect that one province was ample for the 
               <br />
               requirements of the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               I feel like sustaining the Prime Minister of 
               <br />
               the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Territories</span> in advocating but 
               <br />
               one province. I take that view not only 
               <br />
               from the standpoint of the Northwest Terri-
