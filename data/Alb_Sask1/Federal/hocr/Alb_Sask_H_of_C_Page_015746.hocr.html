               ‘ \l'e are standing on the rock of the consti- 
               <br />
               tution.’ But he contended that as the min- 
               <br />
               ority in the Northwest Territories enjoyed 
               <br />
               separate schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today,</span> and as those schools 
               <br />
               had been in existence for so many years, 
               <br />
               this provision would bring them under the 
               <br />
               constitution and secure to them that right 
               <br />
               in perpetuity. Now, here was something 
               <br />
               that rather amused me. and that I thought 
               <br />
               was scarcely consistent with that statement. 
               <br />
               Following it, the row broke out between 
               <br />
               the present government and the late ‘Viin- 
               <br />
               ister of the Inierior, and they succeeded in 
               <br />
               bringing him back by amending the clause 
               <br />
               in question. The Prime Minister said: ‘We 
               <br />
               tray have been unfortunate in our language, 
               <br />
               but what we desired to perpetuate is what 
               <br />
               exists in the Northwest to-day.’ But what 
               <br />
               exists there to-day is not by any means 
               <br />
               what was given under the Act of 1875. If 
               <br />
               the rights given under the Act of 1875 were 
               <br />
               what the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’minority</span> fell heir to, the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister admitted that he did not intend to 
               <br />
               perpetuate those rights, but that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intended</span> 
               <br />
               to perpetuate What was grafted on that Act 
               <br />
               by the ordinances and the amendments made 
               <br />
               to it and the regulations. Is that consis- 
               <br />
               tent with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position‘he</span> took. that he was 
               <br />
               standing on the rock of the constitution? 
               <br />
               In my judgment it was not. Then there 
               <br />
               was a controversy. between the late Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               as to who drafted the original clause 16, 
               <br />
               and why it was drafted as it was.
