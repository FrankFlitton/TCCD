               so far as I am concerned, the more talk I

               have heard as to what the constitution 
               <br />
               really is the worse I am confounded. I 
               <br />
               have had no legal training, and I am not 
               <br />
               in a position to form a legal opinion, but 
               <br />
               I am able to exercise whatever intelligence 
               <br />
               .is given to me. My constituents represent a 
               <br />
               fair average of the intelligence of this Dom— 
               <br />
               inion, and I do not claim any greater in- 
               <br />
               telligence than the average elector in my 
               <br />
               constituency, and if I cannot form an op- 
               <br />
               inion as to what is constitutional and what 
               <br />
               is not, then the majority of my constituents 
               <br />
               must be in the same predicament. This all 
               <br />
               tends to show that there is such division of 
               <br />
               opinion on this important question, the 
               <br />
               results of which may be likely to cause un-

               <br />
               that it would have been far better in the 
               <br />
               interests of Canada had the government 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> proceeding so hastily, taken the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pecr</span> 
               <br />
               pie into their conﬁdence and submitted this 
               <br />
               measure to them. We hear that the voice 
               <br />
               of the people is the voice of God, and that 
               <br />
               being so the government would have made 
               <br />
               no mistake had they submitted this measure 
               <br />
               to the electorate. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,I</span> may say frankly, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that had the government consulted 
               <br />
               the people of Canada, I do not believe the 
               <br />
               people would have approved of this meas- 
               <br />
               ure. There is a good old proverb which 
               <br />
               says: It is never too late to mend, and I 
               <br />
               do not think it is yet too late for the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to take the people into their con- 
               <br />
               ﬁdence. I know that hon. gentlemen on 
               <br />
               the opposite side of the House would feel 
               <br />
               more comfortable individually and collect- 
               <br />
               ively, if they knew that they had the ap- 
               <br />
               proval of their constituents in this matter, 
               <br />
               so that the government in the interests of 
               <br />
               their own friends should have taken the 
               <br />
               course which I now suggest. Just fancy 
               <br />
               that great Northwest country, comprising 
               <br />
               hundreds of millions of acres, being dispos- 
               <br />
               ed of and divided and re-arranged without 
               <br />
               consulting the people. We should transact 
               <br />
               the public business as we manage our own 
               <br />
               private <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬁfairs,</span> but in this case a most im- 
               <br />
               portant Bill has been launched on the coun- 
               <br />
               try without consulting the people directly 
               <br />
               interested, and that Bill will no doubt be 
               <br />
               passed by a great majority in this House. 
               <br />
               Of course it will remain to be seen whe- 
               <br />
               ther in the end it will be approved by the 
               <br />
               people. We are told by hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the other side that when the Bill passes 
               <br />
               the House, the whole question will be set- 
               <br />
               tled. II am afraid that the government 
               <br />
               and its supporters are living in a fool’s 
               <br />
               paradise if they believe that. It is said, 
               <br />
               and I believe correctly said, that the schools 
               <br />
               at present existing in the Northwest Ter~ 
               <br />
               ritories are second to none in this broad 
               <br />
               Dominion. If so, why does not this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gov"</span>

               ernment leave the school system alone;
