               my attention. If my hon. friend knew the 
               <br />
               conditions which prevail in that country, 
               <br />
               he would know that there are two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">races,</span> 
               <br />
               the Alsatians and the people of Lorraine, 
               <br />
               that the Alsatians are German by birth, 
               <br />
               education and language. Under the French 
               <br />
               government all their schools were German. 
               <br />
               The ofﬁcial language, as far as municipal 
               <br />
               documents were concerned, was German. 
               <br />
               After the war of 1870 the German language 
               <br />
               was imposed upon this province by law. 
               <br />
               What was the result ‘2 The Alsatian people 
               <br />
               started to speak French in prOtest against 
               <br />
               that legislation, and if the hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               will refer to the latest studies that have 
               <br />
               been published, not upon the oﬂicial admin- 
               <br />
               istration of Alsace and Lorraine, but upon 
               <br />
               the true sentiments of the people, he will

               who spoke good German and who hardly 
               <br />
               could speak French, when they met a Ger— 
               <br />
               man oﬂicial spoke to him in broken French 
               <br />
               rather than have it said that they were a 
               <br />
               conquered race. But within three or four 
               <br />
               years the Emperor of Germany has changed 
               <br />
               his mind upon that question, as he has 
               <br />
               changed it upon many other questions. The 
               <br />
               Emperor of Germany, frightened at the in- 
               <br />
               creasing development of socialism, is en- 
               <br />
               deavouring to bring to the support of his

               empire all the conservative elements within 
               <br />
               it. Laws Of exclusion against the Catholics 
               <br />
               have been repealed. A more liberal method 
               <br />
               of government has been introduced into Al-

               sace and Lorraine, and within the last few 
               <br />
               years the sentiments of the Alsatians have 
               <br />
               changed more rapidly than for the previous

               But, my point is this, and perhaps I have 
               <br />
               passed over it in the heat of argument:

               Territories at the present time more people 
               <br />

               since 1867 you have only eight Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro~</span> 
               <br />
               vinces. To take an example <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the ﬁg- 
               <br />
               ures that were quoted this afternoon, you 
               <br />
               have two elements in this country; you 
               <br />
               have the racial composition and you have 
               <br />
               the national composition. It may be that 
               <br />
               in one province it is more English and that 
               <br />
               in another it is more French; but all provin- 
               <br />
               ces are more Canadian than before. I say 
               <br />
               that if we want this country to last, it we 
               <br />
               do not want these western provinces to he- 
               <br />
               come the destroyers of confederation, if we 
               <br />
               do not want, within ﬁfty or a hundred 
               <br />
               years, the thousands and millions of men 
               <br />
               who have no attachment to our traditions. 
               <br />
               who know nothing of our history and devel- 
               <br />
               opment, whose sentiments are largely at- 
               <br />
               tached to themselves and to the present, to 
               <br />
               take control of that country, we must take 
               <br />
               hold of it ourselves. If we do not implant 
               <br />
               in western Canada the traditions which have 
               <br />
               been so fruitful in bringing about the devel- 
               <br />
               opment of eastern Canada where we French 
               <br />
               Canadians unite with our English-speaking 
               <br />
               compatriots and share their attachment to 
               <br />
               our country, the time will come when that 
               <br />
               western country will not be English or 
               <br />
               French, and Canada itself will be no more 
               <br />
               Canadian. If there were no other ground 
               <br />
               than that, I say that it would be the duty 
               <br />
               of this parliament to make that country an 
               <br />

               <br />
               the constitution of those provinces. It was

               <br />
               not complete without putting in the dual 
               <br />
               language clause. They did it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘In</span> 1890.

               lowed the rest to remain there. My hon.

               friend the leader of the government has 
               <br />
               stated that the only reason why the pre— 
               <br />
               servation of the French language in the 
               <br />
               courts was agreed to in 1890 was because 
               <br />
               the courts were federal courts, but that if 
               <br />
               they had been provincial courts probably 
               <br />
               the same fate would have been meted out 
               <br />
               to the French language as far as the courts 
               <br />
               are concerned as that which befel it as far 
               <br />
               as the legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assembly</span> was concerned. 
               <br />
               That is not the only reason given by Sir
