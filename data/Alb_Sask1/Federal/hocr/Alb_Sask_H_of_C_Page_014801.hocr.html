               all denominations of the Protestant faith

               <br />
               want to point out that in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Roman</span> Catho- 
               <br />
               lic schools of the province of Quebec the 
               <br />
               direction of the church authorities is dis- 
               <br />
               tinctly recognized from beginning to end. 
               <br />
               On the Roman Catholic section of the coun- 
               <br />
               cil of public instruction there are twenty- 
               <br />
               four members, twelve of whom are bishops, 
               <br />
               who have in whole or in part their dioceses 
               <br />
               within the limits of the province, and the 
               <br />
               other twelve are laymen. But the bishops 
               <br />
               constitute always one-half of the total num- 
               <br />
               ber. And as the bishops always work to- 
               <br />
               gether and most of the laymen agree with 
               <br />
               them, it follows that the courses and me- 
               <br />
               thods of study will be those which are ac- 
               <br />
               ceptable to the church authorities. So that 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd in the province of Quebec a dual 
               <br />
               system in which the Roman Catholic section 
               <br />
               is distinctly sectarian and over which the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic church authorities have 
               <br />
               practically undisputed control.

               Now, Mr. Speaker, I Wish to say that 
               <br />
               this system satisﬁes local conditions. I wish 
               <br />
               to say that the people of the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, both Protestant" and Catholic, would 
               <br />
               not change it if they could. A national 
               <br />
               school system such as it would be possible 
               <br />
               to establish in the province of Quebec would 
               <br />
               give satisfaction to neither party. I do 
               <br />
               not stand here as criticising the educational 
               <br />
               system of the province of Quebec and the

               only reason for bringing these facts before

               Now we come to the constitution of the 
               <br />
               school system as we ﬁnd it in the Canadian

               exists the basic right of dissent, that where, 
               <br />
               in a community, there are Roman Catholic

               taxpayers. these taxpayers may unite and

               have a separate school. They may then

               elect Roman Catholic trustees, and these

               <br />
               taxed twice for education and that is prac- 
               <br />
               tically his only advantage. After the school 
               <br />
               has been constituted in the Canadian North- 
               <br />
               west. it cannot deviate in any particular 
               <br />
               from the ﬁxed national type. That school 
               <br />
               comes immediately under the control of the 
               <br />
               government. There is a minister, or a com~ 
               <br />
               missioner of education and that ofﬁcer is 
               <br />
               aided by a council, but mark you, that 
               <br />
               council is very different from the Council 
               <br />
               of Public Instruction such as we know it 
               <br />
               in Quebec. There is a very great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cliﬁerence,</span> 
               <br />
               because. as I said, our council passes regu- 
               <br />
               lations. looks after the administration of the 
               <br />
               schools and is very rarely in any way inter- 
               <br />
               fered with, but the council which exists in 
               <br />
               the Canadian NorthWest is a purely ad- 
               <br />
               visory body. It has no right to vote. It can 
               <br />
               simply suggest. counsel, consider and make 
               <br />
               reports. It meets once a year and is merely 
               <br />
               a sort of expert advisory board to the 
               <br />
               government which may accept or reject 
               <br />
               the report submitted to it. The North- 
               <br />
               west system as I said is completely 
               <br />
               under the control of the government. 
               <br />
               The Minister of Education is himself a mem- 
               <br />
               ber of the government, responsible to the 
               <br />
               legislature and to the people, and under him 
               <br />
               there exists a uniform system of national 
               <br />
               schools throughout the Canadian Northwest. 
               <br />
               We have one normal school and every one 
               <br />
               who would be certiﬁcated as a teacher must 
               <br />
               either pass examination or go through that 
               <br />
               normal school. No teachers are permitted to 
               <br />
               teach in the Canadian Northwest unless 
               <br />
               they are duly certiﬁcated. It would be im- 
               <br />
               possible for members of religious orders to 
               <br />
               teach in these schools as members of these 
               <br />
               orders. They may teach as teachers and 
               <br />
               cases are on record where certain of the 
               <br />
               nuns have been at considerable dlﬂiculty 
               <br />
               and 'trouble to pass through the normal 
               <br />
               school at Regina, just as every one else must 
               <br />
               do. in order that they may be qualiﬁed and 
               <br />
               certiﬁcated to teach in the separate schools 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Northwest. But the fact 
               <br />
               that they are nuns gives them no right to 
               <br />
