               few days since the echoes of this chamber

               relations between England and Canada. It 
               <br />
               is their contention that British institutions 
               <br />
               are the climax of perfection for a consti-

               common sense was the British school sys-

               of religious equality and self-government. 
               <br />
               In England an education Act was recently 
               <br />
               introduced providing for religious instruc-

               tion in the schools, according to the wishes 
               <br />
               of the parents. By whom was it intro- 
               <br />
               duced ? By men like Chamberlain, by men 
               <br />
               like Balfour, and that legislation was as- 
               <br />
               sailed, and I think encountered as bitter 
               <br />
               an opposition as this legislation is encoun- 
               <br />
               tering to—day. Ministers of the gospel went 
               <br />
               as far as to say that the state was in dan- 
               <br />
               ger. that the primary and elementary rights 
               <br />
               were threatened, that the birth right of the 
               <br />
               British citizen was at stake, that it was a 
               <br />
               battle for life. The Solicitor General (Hon. 
               <br />
               Mr. Lemieux) the other night, in the course 
               <br />
               of a very able speech, read to this House 
               <br />
               quotations from speeches that have be8n 
               <br />
               delivered in England by Mr. Chamberlain 
               <br />
               and by Mr. Balfour. I shall not trouble

               the House by reading any more of those 
               <br />

               <br />
