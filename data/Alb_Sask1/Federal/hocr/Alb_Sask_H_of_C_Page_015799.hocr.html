               Mr. BRODEUR. I put a very simple 
               <br />
               question to my hon. friend from Beauhar- 
               <br />
               nois (Mr. Bergeron). I wanted to know from 
               <br />
               him the nature of the amendment which he 
               <br />

               <br />
               thought my question being put in a civil 
               <br />
               way should have been answered in the same 
               <br />
               way. Instead of that the hon. member for

               <br />
               was here not to make party capital 
               <br />
               out of this question, that he was 
               <br />
               sincere in the desire <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toyprotect</span> and de- 
               <br />
               fend the interests of the minority in the 
               <br />
               Northwest. I thought he was here not to 
               <br />
               make party capital in the interest of his 
               <br />
               party which 110w is in a serious condition 
               <br />
               with regard to that question, but that he 
               <br />
               was here to protect and defend the minority. 
               <br />
               I asked him what was the pu'rport of his 
               <br />
               motion. Was it for the restoration of the 
               <br />
               rights of the minority as they existed be- 
               <br />
               fore 1892, or was it simply for the main- 
               <br />
               tenance of the rights which are now in ex- 
               <br />
               istence ‘2 He has not been able to give me 
               <br />
               an answer to that because I do not think 
               <br />
               his motion as drafted shows whether it con— 
               <br />
               templates the restoration of the rights of 
               <br />
               the minority as they were before 1892 or 
               <br />

               <br />
               not able to proclaim before the country and 
               <br />
               before the House a policy which can be 
               <br />
               sustained by a certain number of people. 
               <br />
               They want simply to make party capital. 
               <br />
               They want simply to arouse prejudices in

               some parts of the country—and perish the 
               <br />
               minority in the Northwest provided they 
               <br />
               get some political gains in Quebec. If the 
               <br />
               minority -can not get more than what they 
               <br />
               get to—day, to what party is it due? It is 
               <br />
               to the party of my hon. friend who in 1892 
               <br />
               refused to give to the minority the protec- 
               <br />
               tion which the government could then have 
               <br />
               given to the minority. The minority ac- 
               <br />
               cepted a state of things, the minority was 
               <br />
               satisﬁed wnh accepting the situation which 
               <br />
               was made by the policy of the government 
               <br />
               then supported by my hon. friend. Now if 
               <br />
               we come to deal with that question, we have 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">takejt</span> as it is to-d-ay and we have to 
               <br />
               assure to the minority the rights which are 
               <br />
               now in existence, and that is what we are 
               <br />
               going to do. But what is the Conservative 
               <br />
               party doing? The Conservative party, led 
               <br />
               by the leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L. 
               <br />
               Borden, are they willing to protect the 
               <br />
               minority ‘2 Are they willing to give some- 
               <br />
               thing to the minority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> No, my hon. 
               <br />
               friend the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               wants to leave everything in the hands 
               <br />
               of the provincial legislature and does 
               <br />
               not want to 'protect in any way, shape or 
               <br />
               form the rights of the minority. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Beauharnoi-s thinks that he will 
               <br />
               gain some advantage in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec with such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appeals</span> to prejudice. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend from Beauh-arnois was in the
