               <br />
               hon. gentlemen opposite have laid down.

               That was not the principle laid down by

               the late Minister of “the Interior. The 
               <br />
               principle was that there was a possibility

               of deriving a certain amount of money 
               <br />
               from the sale of land, but the price he 
               <br />
               suggested was under the present condi-

               tions, 21 low price, a price such as might

               be supposed not to he a bar to successful 
               <br />
               settlement. The same in regard to the sale 
               <br />
               of coal lands or royalties on coal. In their 
               <br />
               comparison between the existence of coal in

               <br />

               <br />
               value in the coal is in the market that may

               <br />
               land is in the demand that exists for the 
               <br />
               land. If nobody wants the coal or the 
               <br />
               land the coal and the land are worth 110- 
               <br />
               thing. In Alberta we have hundreds 0f 
               <br />
               square miles of coal practically worth no- 
               <br />
               thing, because there is no market <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘for</span> it. 
               <br />
               Therefore, a comparison between the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span>

               Alberta and the revenue that is derived 
               <br />
               from coal in Nova Scotia is not a proper

               comparison.
