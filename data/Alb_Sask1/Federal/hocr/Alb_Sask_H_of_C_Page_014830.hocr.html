               <br />
               In 1865, the Protestant minority of Lower

               Canada claimed protection, through a peti—

               <br />
               entering confederation. And that, notwith- 
               <br />
               standing the fact that French Canadians 
               <br />
               had always shown themselves broad, gener-

               Quebec attempted to interfere with the

               <br />
               periods of our history. That is the reason

               system. Are these apprehensions warranted? 
               <br />
               We are told: Trust the majority! Our 
               <br />
               answer is this: Similar promises have so

               often been broken, that we now want 
               <br />
               greater security. I shall explain. In 1890, 
               <br />
               have not separate schools, in Manitoba, 
               <br />

               <br />
               which Catholics were conﬁdent of holding 
               <br />
               under the constitution? Has not the separate 
               <br />
               school system been abolished in spite of 
               <br />
               their good faith, in spite of the compact 
               <br />
               and the solemn promises made at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> 
               <br />
               Manitoba entered the confederation; in 
               <br />
               spite of the pledges given to the Catholic 
               <br />
               and French minority of Manitoba, that if 
               <br />
               they gave their consent to the abolition 
               <br />

               once been rejected, in 1894, by the Minlster 
               <br />
               of Justice, Sir John Thompson ? How could 
               <br />
               we banish all apprehensions for the future, 
               <br />
               when we have these facts fresh in our 
               <br />
               minds, facts which are recorded in history 
               <br />
               and which are part of that series of griev- 
               <br />
               ances to which our race has been subjected. 
               <br />
               For we are not making any mistake about 
               <br />
               it. The reason for giving to the legislatures 
               <br />
               of the new provinces absolute control over 
               <br />
               the school system is not, in my opinion, a 
               <br />
               desire to comply with the constitution. It is 
               <br />
               because certain bigoted persons fear lest 
               <br />
               the Catholic religion should be taught in 
               <br />
               the schools, and lest our tongue and in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuence should spread.
