               three months after the Act had been passed;

               taken from the Imperial Order in Council

               passed on the 30th of June, 1870, to take 
               <br />
               effect on the 15th of July, 1870; clearly 
               <br />
               showing that all that transpired was that 
               <br />
               the Territories became part of the Dominion 
               <br />
               territorially at that date, and that the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion was authorized to legislate for those 
               <br />
               Territories so far as their peace, welfare 
               <br />
               and good government were concerned.

               Now, what happened under the Manitoba

               Act '2 That Act was passed in May, 1870, 
               <br />

               toba out of those very Territories which 
               <br />
               came into the Dominion in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tilly,</span> 1870. All

               the authority to form the province of Maui-

               toba was contained in section 146 of the

               British North America Act of 1867; and 
               <br />

               vii-es. They lieid that there was no author- 
               <br />
               ity in section 146 to pass such an Act or to 
               <br />
               constitute a province—that the only author- 
               <br />
               ity there given was to bring those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories territorialiy within the Dominion of 
               <br />
               Canada. Then it became necessary either to 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> a new Imperial Act or a new Imperial 
               <br />
               Order in Council to rectify matters, and 
               <br />
               the Imperial Act known as the British North 
               <br />
               America Act of 1871 was thereupon passed. 
               <br />
               It was mentioned in this House by the 
               <br />
               late Sir John Macdonald as an Act which 
               <br />
               was necessary to conﬁrm the Manitoba Act, 
               <br />
               on account of doubts which had arisen as 
               <br />
               to its validity. Now, what did the Manitoba 
               <br />
               Act profess to do ? By sectiOn 2 it enacted 
               <br />
               that the British North America Act of 1867 
               <br />
               should apply except in so far as varied 
               <br />
               by this Act ; and they varied it. The edu- 
               <br />
               cational clause of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act, section 93. was varied; but when it 
               <br />
               was conﬁrmed by the imperial Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               the imperial Act went a little further than 
               <br />
               the Manitoba Act did. The imperial legis- 
               <br />
               lature no doubt thought that they would set 
               <br />
               at rest for ever the question of these Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, and the greater question of their 
               <br />
               formation into provinces when the time to 
               <br />
               form them into provinces should arrive. 
               <br />
               Now, the British <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘North</span> America Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               in its preamble, reads as follows:
