               Speaker, the debate on this important ques- 
               <br />
               tion which has been prolonged for such a

               great length of time is now in its last stages 
               <br />
               and as a new member, if I found myself 
               <br />
               seeing eye to eye in every particular with 
               <br />
               the party to which I belong, with my Liberal

               friends generally, it is not likely that I

               would have felt called upon to make any 
               <br />

               what differently from some of my friends, 
               <br />
               I have thought it wise and proper to put 
               <br />
               on record the reasons for my action. I have 
               <br />
               noticed that some speakers, especially in the 
               <br />
               later stages of the debate. have as it were 
               <br />
               apologized for speaking owing to the fact 
               <br />
               that the matter has been so thoroughly 
               <br />
               threshed out, and all arguments from the

               for them to make their speeches interest- 
               <br />
               ing. But as I listened to their speeches 
               <br />
               I found that they did make them interest— 
               <br />
               ing, even in spite of the familiarity of any 
               <br />
               of the arguments. Not only so, but they 
               <br />
               made- them exceedingly interesting for some 
               <br />
               of their opponents. II have no such desire

               night. My 'intention is rather to give an 
               <br />
               explanation of my position nor will I need, 
               <br />
               I think, to speak at any length. Many of 
               <br />
               the speeches, if I may use a little criticism, 
               <br />
               have been of considerable length and pos- 
               <br />
               sibly this debate would have been much 
               <br />
               shorter if each speaker had conﬁned him- 
               <br />
               self very closely to the question at issue. 
               <br />
               It seems to have been the natural inclination 
               <br />
               of many to rather criticise the immediate-

               <br />
               dealt With matters not strictly pertinent to 
               <br />
               this question, matters such as the boundar-

               been discussed at great length. I shall

               different views from those which I take. 
               <br />
               The question itself is certainly an important 
               <br />
               one. The educational clauses, have been 
               <br />
               the features of the Bill principally debated. 
               <br />
               These clauses are not the only nor may we 
               <br />
               say the principal item in the Bill. They 
               <br />
               are, however, the features that have caused 
               <br />
               the greatest antagonism and discussion. In 
               <br />
               itself the matter of education does neces- 
               <br />
               sarily bring about friction of any kind. It 
               <br />
               so happens, however, that a portion of our 
               <br />
               people have conscientious views in the mat- 
               <br />
               ter of the necessity of associating religious 
               <br />
               teaching with the education of the young 
               <br />
               and when that happens and it will always 
               <br />
               happen when a religious turn is given to any 
               <br />
               question there is the greatest necessity for 
               <br />
               prudence and moderation of speech. Many 
               <br />
               gentlemen who have spoken in this debate 
               <br />
               have been careful and prudent. Some of 
               <br />
               them I have admired very much; others 
               <br />
               I am afraid have handled the matter unwise- 
               <br />
               ly and in some cases if I may proceed that 
               <br />
               iength in criticism have handled it almost 
               <br />
               recklessly. ‘It is unfortunate that this 
               <br />
               should be the case, but I think that the con- 
               <br />
               sensus of opinion is that when the matter 
               <br />
               is handled with any exaggeration of state- 
               <br />
               ment the intention of the member is lost, 
               <br />
               that is the effect of his argument is lost. 
               <br />
               The occasion of this Bill is certainly a 
               <br />
               great event in the history of Canada, an 
               <br />
               event which you might almost call a na- 
               <br />
               tional epoch; we have reached a time in 
               <br />
               the history of our country when we can 
               <br />
               carve out from these Territories two large 
               <br />
               and important provinces, and such an oc- 
               <br />
               casion ought to be one of great rejoicing. It 
               <br />
               should be an occasion on which we should 
               <br />
               all unite together with pride in inaugur- 
               <br />
               ating these provinces ; it should be such an 
               <br />
               occasion as one would have in his family 
               <br />
               say for the coming out party of a 
               <br />
               daughter or a marriage or the coming of 
               <br />
               age of a son in whom he has pride, in whom 
               <br />
               he has great hope and conﬁdence, and it is 
               <br />
               natural on such an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occasion</span> that if it were 
               <br />
               at all possible all parties should unite to- 
               <br />
               gether in making it an occasion in which 
               <br />
               we can drop politics. Unfortunately this 
               <br />
               event has been marked by a good deal of 
               <br />
               friction, especially over the educational 
               <br />
               clauses. In considering such an event it is 
               <br />
               very natural that the mind should be turn- 
               <br />
               ed to quite an extent to-the progress of our 
               <br />
               country, that we should turn with pride to 
               <br />
               the progress we have made, and note how 
               <br />
               rapidly we are progressing, note to what an 
               <br />
               extent the commerce and the population 
               <br />
               of the country have grown, note especially 
               <br />
               as we listen to the speeches of the various 
               <br />
               members in this debate the unanimity with 
               <br />
               which every man speaks with glowing con- 
               <br />
