               <br />
               that sixteen years ago this parliament gave 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan a representation of 5 seats 
               <br />

               <br />
               than 1,500. And 13 years ago the legisla— 
               <br />
               ture itself gave Saskatchewan a represen- 
               <br />
               tation of 6 out of a total of 26 seats with a 
               <br />
               unit of only 1,858 as against Alberta’s unit 
               <br />
               of 3.159. Now we are giving the same dis—

               trict of Saskatchewan out of practically 50 
               <br />
               —-because keeping in mind the province of

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ritory—we</span> (are giving the Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               area 9 seats out or a total of 50. I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               upon making a calculation—like my hon. 
               <br />
               friend (Mr. Lake) I would not be willing to 
               <br />
               swear to the last ﬁgure of this calculation, 
               <br />
               but roughly speaking it is correct—we are 
               <br />
               giving the Saskatchewan area 9 seats with 
               <br />
               a unit of roundly 2,850 population as against 
               <br />
               a unit of 3.250 for the balance of the Ter-

               of 830 votes cast as against a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unit</span> of 930 
               <br />

               <br />
               it' we take the vote last fall. If there was no

               outrage perpetrated by this parliament in 
               <br />

               <br />
               islature 3 years later, it seems to me it 
               <br />
               will be difﬁcult to work up an outrage 
               <br />

               some of the alternative propositions which

               members on this side of the House. He 
               <br />
               complained very grievously in his criticism 
               <br />
               the other evening against the disparities

               <br />
               at all events some of his complaints were 
               <br />
               based upon discrepancies which we ﬁnd do 
               <br />
               exist even in that perfect distribution which

               <br />

               <br />

               district of Moosejaw in a fairly average 
               <br />
               position so far as population and votes cast 
               <br />
               is concerned. He complained also that cer— 
               <br />
               tain ot' the other districts, Souris, Cannington 
               <br />
               and South Qu’AppelIe, had disproportionate 
               <br />
               votes compared with some other districts, 
               <br />
               and what he said in that regard was .per- 
               <br />
               fectly true. But I think my hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lake) himself will be the ﬁrst to admit that 
               <br />
               there was no disadvantage to the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party in any of these disparities to which 
               <br />
               he drew pointed attention. Take the district 
               <br />
               of Sour-is and the district of Cannington, 
               <br />
               which have a large population, these are the 
               <br />
               parts of the country in which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Assinibloia</span> (Mr. Turriff) got his 
               <br />
               majority last fall, and even the fact that 
               <br />
               Moose-jaw had a disproportionate vote and 
               <br />
               a disproportionate population did not in- 
               <br />
               volve any disadvantage to the Conservative 
               <br />
               party, because Moosejaw is a part of the 
               <br />
               country which never gave anything else 
               <br />
               but a Liberal majority since it has ex- 
               <br />
               isted. However, when the conference met, 
               <br />
               recognizing very clearly that there were un- 
               <br />
               fair disparities in the old district of Assini- 
               <br />
               boia under the assembly’s plan, and some of 
               <br />
               these disparities being such that the people 
               <br />
               of the local communities have sent. down 
               <br />
               grievous complaints, I took it upon myself 
               <br />
               to suggest that even if we gave 9 seats to 
               <br />
               the north and held the south down to 16 
               <br />
               seats, that did not compel us to have these 
               <br />
               disparities remain if we could arrive at an 
               <br />
               agreement as to the remedy. I suggested 
               <br />
               to my hon. friend (Mr. Lake) that there was 
               <br />
               a part of the country on the main line of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway to the east- 
               <br />
               ern part of the province where the assemb- 
               <br />
               ly’s redistribution left the area very small, 
               <br />
               where also the vote last fall was compara- 
               <br />
               tively small, and where the most reliable in- 
               <br />
               formation that we can get goes to show 
               <br />
               that the population increase is almost in- 
               <br />
               ﬁnitesimal in comparison with the increase 
               <br />
               in other parts of the country. I sug- 
               <br />
               gested that there were four districts. Mooso-

               <br />
               which might very fairly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Vbe</span> put into three 
               <br />
               districts and that would enable us to pro-

               vide a new district in the Soo line country 
               <br />
               with regard to which my hon. friend has 
               <br />
               made complaint. I may say that i have 
               <br />
               taken the liberty of drawing a map show— 
               <br />
               ing these changes. The oﬂicials of the de-

               partment so far have been too busy to draw 
               <br />
               up the schedule to describe this map, but 
               <br />
               I think I can give in a very few moments 
               <br />
               a brief statement of the changes I propose
