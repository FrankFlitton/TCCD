               introducing the amendments which we be-

               lieve are proper, are trying to create an 
               <br />
               agitation in Quebec. My h-on. friends are 
               <br />
               afraid of that agitation in Quebec. They 
               <br />
               remember what they did in 1896 and think 
               <br />
               that we are going to do the same thing. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend spoke about the caucus. To 
               <br />
               show him that he was wrong there I may 
               <br />
               state that we had no understanding with 
               <br />
               the member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) and 
               <br />
               the member for Montmagny (Mr. A. La— 
               <br />
               vergne) and yet we happen to be side by 
               <br />
               side on this question. That shows that we 
               <br />
               may be on the same platform without cau- 
               <br />
               cus or understanding. My hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> 
               <br />
               the conclusion of his speech showed that he 
               <br />
               wanted to make political capital out of this 
               <br />
               when he spoke about the petition brought 
               <br />
               into this House by Mr. Amyot in 1890. Mr. 
               <br />

               brought in the petition referred to. I asked 
               <br />
               if there was an answer. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               said: No, I do not see any. This is a long 
               <br />
               petition covering about two columns and a 
               <br />
               half which Mr. Amyot read in the House 
               <br />
