               Speaker, in a matter of such importance to 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, I feel it my duty 
               <br />
               to say a very few words at the present 
               <br />
               time. and especially shall I address myself 
               <br />
               to the urgency of the appointment of a 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. To learn. as we 
               <br />
               did the other day, that the terms of this 
               <br />
               Bill had been agreed upon and laid before 
               <br />
               parliament without consultation with the 
               <br />
               Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Interiorﬁand</span> as it after- 
               <br />
               wards proved, in direct opposition to his 
               <br />
               known views—was surprising enough ; but 
               <br />
               to have the statement ten days later from 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister. that he had then no 
               <br />
               intention of selecting a new Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior, was simply amazing. I am glad 
               <br />
               to say that on the following day the right 
               <br />
               hon., gentleman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">modified</span> that statement 
               <br />
               and gave us a hope that in the near future 
               <br />
               there would be an appointment. I feel that 
               <br />
               we are entitled to ask from the right hon. 
               <br />

               aspirations of the west. I do not believe 
               <br />
               that the Bills in their present form would 
               <br />
               have been brought down if the Prime Min-

               <br />
               practically threw down the gauntlet to the 
               <br />
               people of the west on a subject on which the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister must have known that they 
               <br />

               In his speech in introducing the Bills, 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman said : ‘ The North- 
               <br />
               west Territories have at the present time 
               <br />
               a large measure of local autonomy.’ He 
               <br />
               went on to say that they have ‘ most of the 
               <br />
               essential powers which are now given to 
               <br />
               the provinces,’ and he concluded by saying 
               <br />
               that he proposed to crown that with ‘com- 
               <br />
               plete and absolute autonomy.’ I sometimes 
               <br />
               wonder whether it could be possible that the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman really meant that when 
               <br />
               he said it. I do not think that anybody who 
               <br />
               chooses to study these Bills and to take them 
               <br />
               in connection with the constitutions of the 
               <br />
               other provinces of Canada, can doubt but 
               <br />
               that it is proposed to form in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories ‘imperfect and inferior organi- 
               <br />
               zations,’ to quote the words of the premier 
               <br />
               of that country; and if more proof were 
               <br />
               needed that the people of the Territories 
               <br />
               did not believe that they were going to 
               <br />
               be put on the plane of the older provinces of 
               <br />
               the Dominion, I would point to the character 
               <br />
               oi’ the meetings which are now being held 
               <br />
               almost daily throughout the west. This 
               <br />
               question is not dealt with up there as a 
               <br />
               party question. I notice that in the towns 
               <br />
               in the district which I have the honour to 
               <br />
               represent, in several cases the prime 
               <br />
               movers are gentlemen who are supporters 
               <br />
               of the right hon. gentleman opposite; and 
               <br />
               l was surprised to bear that he had not 
               <br />
               heard that other objections had been taken 
               <br />
               to the terms of these Bills above and be- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yond</span> the objections which were taken to 
               <br />
               the educational clauses. I may tell him that 
               <br />
               I have received copies of resolutions tak- 
               <br />
               ing the very strongest objections to other 
               <br />
               clauses. Of course, the terms in which 
               <br />
               the educational clauses are couched have 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> such as to raise a feeling which must 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overshadow</span> all other feelings amongst the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest Territories; and 
               <br />
               therefore we ﬁnd that the agitation against 
               <br />
               these educational clauses takes the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               place. But I can assure the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               that there are the very strongest objections 
               <br />
               against the proposal that our lands should 
               <br />
               be retained by the Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               There are the very strongest objections 
               <br />
               to having the perpetual exemption.from 
               <br />
               taxation which is at the present moment 
               <br />
               enjoyed by the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               Company placed on the shoulders of the new 
               <br />
               provinces forever. That is a burden which 
               <br />
               we believe the Dominion of Canada should 
               <br />
               hear. I may say that the large measure of 
               <br />
               local autonomy which the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               referred to in his speech as having been 
               <br />
               enjoyed by the Territories has developed a 
               <br />
               strong western sentiment and solidarity 
               <br />
               which is manifesting itself in connection 
               <br />
               with the clauses of these Bills ; and I would 
               <br />
               suggest to him that he should put this mat- 
               <br />
               ter to the test by inviting some genleman 
               <br />
               from amongst the western Liberal members 
               <br />
