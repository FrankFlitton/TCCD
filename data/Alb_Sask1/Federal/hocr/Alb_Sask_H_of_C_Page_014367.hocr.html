               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman is asked to stand

               <br />
               afraid that he might drop that clause ; they 
               <br />
               were afraid that he might be inﬂuenced by 
               <br />
               the other wing of the government, and 
               <br />
               abandon clause 16 for something else. 
               <br />
               \Vell. they were not wrong, because my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend has given up that clause 
               <br />
               and accepted an amendment which is satis-

               factory to the hon. member for Brandon 
               <br />

               <br />
               what kind of an amendment that must be. 
               <br />
               I call the attention of those who are in 
               <br />
               favour of separate schools to Mr. Sifton’s 
               <br />
               approval. If the amendment before the 
               <br />
               House is acceptable to the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brandon, you may judge for yourselves 
               <br />
               how far it goes in favour of separate schools.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               In 1896 there was a hierarchy in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro«</span> 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec just as there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> 
               <br />
               What happened then? After the elections 
               <br />
               were over and my right hon. friend was 
               <br />
               returned to power with a large majority 
               <br />
               from the province of Quebec, one of the 
               <br />
               boasts of the Liberal politicians and the 
               <br />
               Liberal press was that they had been able 
               <br />
               to carry the province against the hierarchy. 
               <br />
               If that were true, what did it mean ? It 
               <br />
               could only mean that the hierarchy had no 
               <br />
               inﬂuence at all. But if it had no inﬂuence, 
               <br />
               how could we be called a priest-ridden pro- 
               <br />
               vince? It is not true, however, that the 
               <br />
               hierarchy had no inﬂuence, and I can tell 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend something which he 
               <br />
               knows quite well. The hierarchy in 1896 
               <br />
               did not do anything. They did not do as 
               <br />
               much as I would have liked them to do in 
               <br />
               their own interests. So broad and non- 
               <br />
               partisan were the mandements they pub— 
               <br />
               lished that they were accepted by the Lib- 
               <br />
               erals as being in their favour. But if the 
               <br />
               day should come when that hierarchy 
               <br />
               would feel impelled to take a hand in the 
               <br />
               contest, their inﬂuence would be soon felt. 
               <br />
               My right hon. friend remembers that when 
               <br />

               <br />
               We are now about to create two new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. \Ve are in a sense enlarging Canada. 
               <br />
               We are making it stronger and more im- 
               <br />
               portant. I would advise the House not 
               <br />
               to stand so much upon the letter of the 
               <br />
               constitution, but to do what is best calcu- 
               <br />
               lated to make all creeds and nationalities 
               <br />
               in these new provinces live together in har- 
               <br />
               mony. What we require in this country is 
               <br />
               tolerance and conciliation, and we cannot 
               <br />
               have that when we call for the sacriﬁce of 
               <br />
               any principle or the destruction of any 
               <br />
               right. Every nationality and creed in this 
               <br />
               Dominion should be made to feel that it 
               <br />
               has the respect and the conﬁdence of other 
               <br />
               nationalities and creeds, if we want Canada 
               <br />
               to be united and ever to achieve anything. 
               <br />
               I sincerely hope that the question now being 
               <br />
               discussed is the last of the kind that will 
               <br />
               ever come before parliament. I sincerely

               hope that in the end we shall all join hand 
               <br />
               in hand. I trust that every province and 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               join hand in hand with his fellow-citizens 
               <br />
               to work together for what we believe the

               best interests of Canada, and not allow

               In speaking of the position taken by my

               leader, I wish to say openly that, to my 
               <br />
               mind, he made an admirable speech upon 
               <br />
               this question, a speech to which nobody 
               <br />
               can take exception. We may not all share 
               <br />
               the conclusions to which he came. but every

               man on this side, and I believe on the other 
               <br />
               side as well is convinced that the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition spoke in all sincerity, with-

               <br />
               is that the case, that if in that amendment 
               <br />
               of his, ten words were struck off at the

               <br />
               in doing so I would be standing on a good 
               <br />
               principle, namely, provincial autonomy and 
               <br />
               provincial rights ; and in my opinion clause 
               <br />
               93 of the British North America Act would 
               <br />
               give the new provinces the school system 
               <br />
               they have to-day. But as a doubt has been 
               <br />
               expressed by the Minister of Justice, I 
               <br />
               would have clause 16. But here is where 
               <br />
               I think there is a difference between the 
               <br />
               position taken by the hon. the leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition and the right hon. the First )Iin— 
               <br />
               ister. My hon. friend the leader of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">op</span> 
               <br />
               position leaves the door open by his amend- 
               <br />
               ment to the people of the new provinces to 
               <br />
               give themselves separate schools. From not 
               <br />
               one man on this side of the House have I 
               <br />
               heard a word against the system of separate 
               <br />
