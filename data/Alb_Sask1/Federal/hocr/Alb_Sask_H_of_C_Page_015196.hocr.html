               <br />
               form practice to-day. My hon. friend (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) wanted to know it" any other plan 
               <br />
               has been suggested. and I am frank enough 
               <br />
               to say, that, notwithstanding that there is 
               <br />
               something to be said in favour of some other 
               <br />
               plan, I have no expectation that you can 
               <br />
               arrange the ﬁnances on any other basis. 
               <br />
               There is no province which is willing to give 
               <br />
               up its subsidy. The system is a part of our 
               <br />
               constitution. It is‘ provided for by the 
               <br />
               British North America Act wholly beyond 
               <br />
               change by ourselves and we would be oblig- 
               <br />
               ed to go to the imperial parliament to change 
               <br />
               it. I believe that the provinces would be 
               <br />
               rivailing each other to get their delegates 
               <br />
               on the other side in opposition to the pro- 
               <br />
               posal if we asked for anything of the sort. 
               <br />
               I fully anticipate that if any revision is 
               <br />
               made it will have to be on the lines of the 
               <br />
               present system. We may devise some sys- 
               <br />
               tem, which. while adopting the present 
               <br />
               principle, will work the details out in some 
               <br />
               other way.

               Mr. SPROULE. The hon. gentleman said 
               <br />
               that originally, at the time of confederation, 
               <br />
               we dealt with provinces that were sovereign- 
               <br />
               ties having the power to levy taxation. Or. 
               <br />
               in other words, there were two parties to the 
               <br />
               contract. Then the one party might offer, 
               <br />
               but the other party might not accept, and it 
               <br />
               would be for the other party to make a 
               <br />
               counter offer and. between them, try to 
               <br />
               reach an agreement; that is to say, one 
               <br />
               would accept what the other would be will- 
               <br />
               ing to give; but in this case there is only 
               <br />
               one party to the contract. There is only one 
               <br />
               party, because the federal parliament is the 
               <br />
               owner of the Territories, and they are only 
               <br />
               establishing an outlying portion of those 
               <br />
               Territories which they may call provinces. 
               <br />
               and they are giving these provinces certain 
               <br />
               powers. They have scarcely consulted the 
               <br />

               one of the important ones, and therefore I

               assume that if there is any correspondence 
               <br />

               there would be correspondence in reference

               that justiﬁes what I have said, that there

               <br />
               federation there were two contracting par— 
               <br />
               ties, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> only one party has the power

               <br />
               vinces that are being created. We have 
               <br />
               been carrying on an experiment for thirty 
               <br />
               years in this matter, and I say that the ex— 
               <br />
               perience of time, has shown that the ex— 
               <br />
               periment is not a good one. Am I not justi-

               question with regard to the new provinces. 
               <br />
               would endeavour to settle on some sound 
               <br />
               principle that would not require to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chang‘</span> 
               <br />
               ed from time to time ? It seems to me that 
               <br />
               would be the part of wisdom and what you 
               <br />
               would expect from very astute business 
               <br />
               men. Experience must teach us something, 
               <br />
               and our experience with our system of di- 
               <br />
               vision of revenues for thirty years should 
               <br />
               enable us to judge whether it is a success 
               <br />
               or a failure. The Minister of Finance ad~ 
               <br />
               mits it is a failure.
