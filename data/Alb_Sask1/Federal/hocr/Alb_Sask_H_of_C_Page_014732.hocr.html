               is their education going to come in? I empha-

               size this matter because statistics have been 
               <br />
               given in this House with regard to crime 
               <br />
               and illiteracy, and other things, in which 
               <br />
               it is assumed that everybody who is not a

               <br />
               dumped into the Protestant column, and we 
               <br />
               get credit for the crimes they commit. 
               <br />
               The time has arrived when the Protestant 
               <br />
               people should demand separate treatment just 
               <br />
               as well as our Roman Catholic friends. 1 
               <br />
               do not see what harm there would be in 
               <br />
               adopting a change for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">awhile—put</span> the Pro-

               testant people together and then dump all 
               <br />
               these other people in with our Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lic friends and let them take care of them 
               <br />
               for a while. They say fair-play is a jewel. 
               <br />
               We are told that after all the Bill just 
               <br />
               gives half an hour for religious instruction 
               <br />
               at the end of the day, and if there is any 
               <br />
               crime it is only a little one. Some of us 
               <br />
               will remember a case in a book dating very 
               <br />
               far back where Saul was sent out to do a 
               <br />
               retrain thing and he came back. And the 
               <br />
               old prophet; said : What means the bleating 
               <br />
               of the sheep and the lowing of the cattle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> 
               <br />
               And Saul replied, my crime is only a little 
               <br />
               one. But it did not save Saul. I am not here 
               <br />
               this evening to say whether it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is‘</span> necessary 
               <br />
               to continue the system of separate schools 
               <br />
               in the west or whether it is not. That is a 
               <br />
               matter which this House has no business to 
               <br />
               determine. It is a matter that pertains to 
               <br />
               the people of the west. and the people, of 
               <br />
               the west have a right to say whether they

               that west, and the reason I point out this 
               <br />
               particularly is that these people all want to 
               <br />

               <br />
               human probability demand the right in the 
               <br />
               future to have their separate schools. I 
               <br />
               think. therefore, we should look very care- 
               <br />
               iully into the matter before we crystallize 
               <br />
               this legislation on the statute—book; and 
               <br />
               more particularly so. because if this Bill 
               <br />
               passes it will partake somewhat of the 
               <br />
               nature of the laws of the Medes and Per- 
               <br />
               sians and be very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁcult</span> to change. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that it would be a very ditli- 
               <br />
               cult matter in future to change it. That is 
               <br />
               one of the objections and a very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong:</span> 
               <br />
               objection that I take to engrossing this 
               <br />
               legislation upon the statute—book. If there 
               <br />
               was any method of allowing the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces in the future to alter this law it‘ 
               <br />
               they found it necessary then my objection 
               <br />
               to the measure would cease. If in ﬁve or 
               <br />
               ten years they found it did not suit them. 
               <br />
               or we found that we had put upon the 
               <br />
               statute-book something we did not intend. 
               <br />
               which is very likely to happen, we would 
               <br />
               not have the power to change it. If that is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">true</span> then it is a very serious matter. I hold 
               <br />
               that it will put this Dominion government 
               <br />
               in a very ridiculous position if we legislate 
               <br />
               upon this question. if the Northwest people 
               <br />
               proceed to enact just what. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> they 
               <br />
               like in regard to schools contrary to the 
               <br />
               provisions of this Bill, if a case is taken to 
               <br />
               the Privy Council, and if the right of the 
               <br />
               province to legislate is upheld. Look at the 
               <br />
               position this Dominion government is put 
               <br />
               in. I think with all deference to those who 
               <br />
               have introduced this Bill that that is very 
               <br />
               likely what will happen both in regard to 
               <br />
               the lands and in regard to the schools.
