               country, when the party in power backed up 
               <br />

               Some people will ask : What business is

               it of yours whether our schools are good or 
               <br />
               bad '2 I reply that certainly it is our duty. 
               <br />
               If we appropriate public money for school 
               <br />
               purposes, we are certainly interested in 
               <br />
               seeing that the money is properly expended. 
               <br />
               If it were any particular church which was 
               <br />
               spending its own money on the schools, 
               <br />
               then of course it would be the business of 
               <br />
               nobody except those belonging to that church 
               <br />
               what these schools were like. Let me read 
               <br />
               here what the hon. Minister of Justice (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fitzpatrick) said in the Quebec provincial 
               <br />
               legislature about these very same schools in 
               <br />
               that province. You may talk about the in-

               tolerance of Ontario, but. I defy you to look 
               <br />
               through the speech of any public man in 
               <br />
               that province and ﬁnd in it a stronger iii-

               Mr. Fitzpatrick, supporting Mr. Marchand, 
               <br />
               said that our common school system was the 
               <br />
               very worst that could he found in any country ; 
               <br />
               its evil effects were everywhere apparent. The 
               <br />
               House had been informed that in many parishes 
               <br />
               the people were so illiterate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> it was im-

               possible to ﬁnd school commissioners able to 
               <br />
               read or write. He, himself, knew that thirty 
               <br />
               per cent of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">juvrymen</span> in our law counts 
               <br />
               could not sign their name, yet 'large sums of 
               <br />
               money were voted last year for the common 
               <br />
               schools. To what use was that money put, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> 
               <br />
               were the popular classes better educated to- 
               <br />
               day than twenty years ago? He thought not. 
               <br />
               A large amount was also yearly expended on 
               <br />
               normal schools which appeared almost totally 
               <br />
               useless under the existing state of things. He 
               <br />
               was informed, he wished to be corrected if he 
               <br />
               was wrong, that over ﬁfty per cent of the 
               <br />
               graduates of the normal schools were at pre- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was not to be wondered at when we reﬂected 
               <br />
               upon the ridiculously small <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">salary</span> paid to 
               <br />

               was on a fairly good footing in this province,

               and commercial pursuits the majority were on

               an unequal footing, not that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ability</span> was 
               <br />
               wanting, but because of the vicious educational

               Mr. BRODER. That would be called in- 
               <br />
               tolerance if any man in Ontario had said it. 
               <br />
               But said by a Quebec man. that charge 
               <br />
               cannot lie. But Mr. Fitzpatrick’s comments 
               <br />
               are rather hard on the statements made by 
               <br />
               the hon. the Minister of Agriculture the other 
               <br />
               day. It ought to be the aim of every man 
               <br />
               in this country to have our schools efﬁcient. 
               <br />
               These schools ought to be the schools of the 
               <br />
               people. If the right hon. the First Minister 
               <br />
               was sincere in what he said about public 
               <br />
               schools. he certainly cannot be sincere in 
               <br />
               giving to the minority in the Territories the 
               <br />
               small concessions he is giving them in the 
               <br />
               Bill before the House, if we are to judge by 
               <br />
               the criticism of his own friend‘s. We have 
               <br />
               had man after man of them get up and say 
               <br />
               that the school clause does not mean any- 
               <br />
               thing that it merely establishes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public.</span> 
               <br />
               schools with half an hour religious instruc- 
               <br />
               tion added. If that be the case. then the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman is not dealing honestly 
               <br />
               with the minority and is not consistent 
               <br />
               with his own professions. if he believes 
               <br />
               that public schools are not in~the interests 
               <br />
               of the country. then he should see that the
