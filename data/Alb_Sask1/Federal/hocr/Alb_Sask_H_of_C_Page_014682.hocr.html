               granted with full generosity by the British

               religious liberty, did not take back 
               <br />
               with one hand what they granted with 
               <br />
               the other, but gave it with an open 
               <br />

               best wishes for her subjects dispersed 
               <br />
               over the whole universe. Mr. Speaker, I 
               <br />
               claim that the question before us is merely 
               <br />
               a question of justice and right—undoubtedly 
               <br />
               right. And we know that the people in the 
               <br />
               minority in the districts of these new prov- 
               <br />
               inces, whether Catholic or Protestant, ex- 
               <br />
               pect the same right and the same educa- 
               <br />
               tional advantages as they possess to-day. We 
               <br />
               have there not only French Canadian Catho- 
               <br />
               lic people, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘but</span> Scotch and Irish Catholics. 
               <br />
               We have also Germans of the Catholic faith 
               <br />
               who give good service to Canada and are 
               <br />
               equal to any other claSS of our people. We 
               <br />
               have the German Protestants, who are the 
               <br />
               equals of any other class in this country

               I admit that if we were granted more we 
               <br />
               would not object to it. At the same time, 
               <br />
               I may tell my hon. friend that I am one of 
               <br />
               those who suffered for years in the struggle 
               <br />
               of the Catholic minority in New Brunswick 
               <br />
               to support separate schools. For a long 
               <br />
               time our schools were practically closed, 
               <br />
               and we were paying, not only our own 
               <br />
               school tax without enjoying schools at all, 
               <br />
               but we were paying the public school tax, 
               <br />
               the Catholic population, especially on the

               north shore of New Brunswick, being among 
               <br />
               the poorest class of the people. I may be

               permitted to say to the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Beauharnois that perhaps if he had gone 
               <br />
               through the same experience he would bet-

               to support a school. In the interest of my 
               <br />
               own Catholic people I do not want to see 
               <br />
               a school that is not efﬁcient, and a school 
               <br />
               cannot be efﬁcient unless you have the 
               <br />
               means to make it so. If you do not give 
               <br />
               them the money to support the school, what 
               <br />
               other privilege will be of any value to them? 
               <br />
               I think any one who has giVen some atten—

               tion to public instruction and to the educa- 
               <br />
               tion of his children will appreciate that 
               <br />
               fact. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">\Ve</span> want ﬁrst of all the means. When 
               <br />
               the teacher has been engaged he is under a 
               <br />
               contract, and it is his duty to give to the 
               <br />
               children a religious education during that 
               <br />
               half hour. He has also the duty, during 
               <br />
               the rest of the day, of supervising the edu- 
               <br />
               cation of the Catholic children in the classes, 
               <br />
               and this is a point in which my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Beauharnois is equally interested 
               <br />
               with myself. The inﬂuence of the teacher 
               <br />
               is there all day long, his guardianship is 
               <br />
               there all the time that the children are re- 
               <br />
               ceiving education in other branches as well 
               <br />
               as in religion ; the child is receiving lessons 
               <br />
