               calling the attention of the government and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the committee to it, I recall the language 
               <br />
               of the Prime Minister yesterday when he 
               <br />
               said that if the language of this section now 
               <br />
               under discussion was not sufﬁcient to carry 
               <br />
               out the object which the government had in 
               <br />
               view he would be prepared to consider any 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable</span> amendment to it. The object 
               <br />
               which the government has in view by this 
               <br />
               clause as stated yesterday by the Prime Min- 
               <br />
               ister and as stated a few moments ago by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Inland Revenue is to carry 
               <br />

               <br />
               now in force in the Northwest Territories. 
               <br />
               That school system was established in 1892 
               <br />
               by the ordinance of that year. Since 1892 
               <br />
               when it was established it has worked very 
               <br />
               satisfactorily to the people of the west and 
               <br />
               the object of the government as I under- 
               <br />
               stand is to perpetuate that system and con- 
               <br />
               tinue it in the new province of Saskatchewan 
               <br />
               and Alberta. The principle of the system 
               <br />
               contained in the ordinances is two-fold. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place it secures to the local govern- 
               <br />
               ment the absolute control and jurisdiction 
               <br />
               _ over secular education in the Northwest Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories. ‘In the second place it leaves 
               <br />
               the religious instruction absolutely in 
               <br />
               the control of the trustees of the school 
               <br />
               districts. Under that system as estab- 
               <br />
               lished by the ordinances from 9 a.m. 
               <br />
               until 3.30 p.m., the school system is absolu— 
               <br />
               tely under the control and jurisdiction of the 
               <br />
               local government and the instruction given 
               <br />
               in the schools. public and separate alike is 
               <br />
               purely secular instruction. From 3.30 pm. 
               <br />
               until 4 o’clock p.m. religious instruction may 
               <br />
               be given. if desired by the trustees. The rea-

               I wish to call the attention of the com- 
               <br />
               mittee and which I would like to have made 
               <br />
               clearer. I want the clause when it is passed 
               <br />
               to be so plain and clear that there will be 
               <br />
               no doubt whatever that in the public schools 
               <br />
               of the new provinces, the half—hour’s reli- 
               <br />
               gious instructions now given by the ordin- 
               <br />
               ances will be continued. In order to make 
               <br />
               that clear and to place it beyond the realm 
               <br />
               of controversy and to make certain that the 
               <br />
               object of the government will be carried out, 
               <br />
               I move, Mr. Chairman. that to subsection 
               <br />
               one, there be added these words : 
               <br />

               Or with respect to religious instruction in any 
               <br />
               public or separate school as provided for in 
               <br />
               the said ordinances. 
               <br />

               This will make it absolutely clear in my 
               <br />
               opinion that the object of the government 
               <br />
               will be carried out. and that there will be con- 
               <br />

               of religious instruction. it the trustees so 
               <br />
               desire. With regard to the position taken 
               <br />
               by the hon.‘mcmber for Beauharnois (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bergeron) and the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               (Mr. Bourassa). that where the Catholics 
               <br />
               are in a majority they should be allowed to 
               <br />
               form church schools, I cannot concur. We
