               <br />
               1901 what have we ? We have two guides 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> have been invoked in this commit- 
               <br />
               tee—one is the number of votes polled at 
               <br />
               the general election of November last, and 
               <br />
               the other the number of votes upon the lists 
               <br />
               prepared for that general election. For rea- 
               <br />
               sons which I stated in this committee, yes- 
               <br />
               terday, and which I need not repeat now, 
               <br />
               it is obvious, I should suppose, to every 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman in this House that the list 
               <br />
               of electors, and not the number of votes, 
               <br />
               cast is the better guide as to the actual 
               <br />
               population. I should not think there could 
               <br />
               be any argument on the other side. So many 
               <br />
               considerations affect the proportion of votes 
               <br />
               cast, out of the total number of votes 
               <br />
               on the list, that it seems idle for any man 
               <br />
               to be put to the trouble of arguing that the 
               <br />
               list of voters is a better guide to popula- 
               <br />
               tion than the number of votes actually poll~ 
               <br />
               ed. But even this guide of the number of 
               <br />
               names on the list fails us so far as the un— 
               <br />
               organized district is concerned, for the rea— 
               <br />
               son that those who are supposed to live in 
               <br />
               this unorganized territory did not vote at 
               <br />
               the general election—no lists were made 
               <br />
               up and no polls were held. This is as I 
               <br />
               understand it. Now, what evidence or in- 
               <br />
               formation have we before this committee 
               <br />
               which will be as reasonably sufﬁcient for 
               <br />
               the unorganized portion of the territory, as 
               <br />
               the list of voters made up in November last 
               <br />
               is for the organized part? I stated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yesteri</span> 
               <br />
               day, and I repeat it to—day. that we have 
               <br />
               no information sufﬁcient for that purpose. 
               <br />
               Therefore, I argued yesterday, and I do not 
               <br />
               to—day depart in the slightest from the stand 
               <br />
               I then took. that it would be a proper thing, 
               <br />
               a reasonable and fair thing. for the govern—

               question and coming to a conclusion upon 
               <br />
               proper information. But let us go a step 
               <br />
               further and see what is the highest estimate 
               <br />
               which has been made by the Prime Minis- 
               <br />
               ter or his Minister of the Interior as to the 
               <br />
               population of this unorganized territory. I 
               <br />
               asked that yesterday: I asked ﬁrst, what 
               <br />
               was the estimate of the population of this 
               <br />
               unorganized territory to which one—twelfth 
               <br />
               of the whole representation'of the province

               dence which could be considered as such by 
               <br />
               this House is that estimate made. The 
               <br />
               highest estimate that 1 have heard. was that 
               <br />
               made by the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver), who said that it was believed that 
               <br />
               in this unorganized territory there is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">po'</span>

               pulation of about 5,000 souls. I do not

               believe that there is any information before 
               <br />

               <br />

               this delimitation will stand, than in the

               of the organized districts of the province? 
               <br />
               It is idle to speculate about that. But if

               speculation must be indulged in, I, for one,

               It seems to me that any such suggestion 
               <br />
               will be recognized to the full by the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman as one to which he cannot 
               <br />
               commit himself, as one which his sense of 
               <br />
               justice will not accept. as one which he will 
               <br />
               be inclined to modify, and I venture to think 
               <br />
               that this suggestion which we have made is 
               <br />
               one which the right hon. gentleman ought 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accept,</span> My hon. friend from St. Antoine
