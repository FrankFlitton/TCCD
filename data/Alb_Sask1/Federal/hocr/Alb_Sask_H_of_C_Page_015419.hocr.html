               Sir, it struck me as peculiar that the hon.

               gentleman was willing to invade provincial 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. The verdict of Edmonton 
               <br />
               was not to that effect, as I have pointed

               out. If there was any reason to prevent

               <br />
               not apply with regard to the land policy, 
               <br />
               because the interests of Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               and Protestants must be precisely identical 
               <br />

               <br />
               question which we have discussed is a very 
               <br />
               immaterial matter. The letter that the hon.

               <br />

               tories consider the school issue as being an 
               <br />
               immaterial matter. they consider the land 
               <br />
               question as far more important. If there 
               <br />
               is any difference of opinion in the North— 
               <br />

               looked upon as a very lunch more serious 
               <br />
               one than the matter of the schools. There 
               <br />
               was no reason in the world why the hon.

               ever since this debate commenced two 
               <br />
               months ago to try if possible to get at the 
               <br />
               reasons why members from the Northwest, 
               <br />
               including the present Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior, were not in favour of the provinces 
               <br />
               having their own public lands; and so far 
               <br />
               as I can see now one of the chief reasons 
               <br />
               has been deﬁned by the hon. member who 
               <br />
               has just taken his seat (Mr. Scott). They 
               <br />
               would like to have the lands, they would 
               <br />
               like to have the whole outﬁt for the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces, but they do not like to assume the 
               <br />
               responsibilities. They want to be men full 
               <br />
               grown, but they don’t quite know whether 
               <br />
               they could. walk it they were left alone. 
               <br />
               They would like to have the full birthright, 
               <br />
               but the little mess of pottage which is 
               <br />
               handed out to them just now is so enticing 
               <br />
               that they would rather lap that up and let 
               <br />
               the future take care of itself. Now the ﬁn- 
               <br />
               ancial policy and the land policy are closely 
               <br />
               joined. The speech that has been made by 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman who has just taken his

               <br />
               in that respect, have all their rights. but 
               <br />
               they don't. quite see how they could raise 
               <br />
               the money for the present and current ex- 
               <br />
               penses of the provincial governments. My 
               <br />
               objection to the matter as it stands is on 
               <br />
               two grounds, ﬁrst, because these terms are 
               <br />
               not arranged on any ground of principle. 
               <br />
               There is no well grounded principle upon 
               <br />
               which the whole ﬁnancial system with refer- 
               <br />
               ence to these two provinces has been reared. 
               <br />
               The other ground of objection is that there is 
               <br />
               no ﬁnality to it. I think every member on 
               <br />
               either side of- this House, must feel that there 
               <br />
               is no ﬁnality in this arrangement. Neither 
               <br />
               province will be satisﬁed if it does not have 
               <br />
               what really belongs to it. When either pro- 
               <br />
               vince is fully organized what will it have ‘3 
               <br />

               eral lands, it will have no control over its

               no control over its grazing lands. What is 
               <br />
               there but the mere skeleton of a pro- 
               <br />
