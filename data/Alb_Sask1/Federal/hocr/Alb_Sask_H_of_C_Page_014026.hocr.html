               Ontario and maritime provinces, were sep- 
               <br />
               arated by long distances. The two groups 
               <br />
               which were geographically united, Ontario 
               <br />
               and Quebec, were separated by the deeper 
               <br />
               cleavage of difference of origin. In all 
               <br />
               there was a strong sense of local 
               <br />
               pride, in all there was a strong assertion 
               <br />
               of self interest, and in all there were 
               <br />
               peculiar institutions as to the security of 
               <br />
               which all dreaded to be launched into the 
               <br />
               unknown. This was particularly true of ed- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ucation</span> in Lower Canada and in Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada. In Lower Canada the Protestant min- 
               <br />
               ority had long enjoyed their own system of 
               <br />
               separate schools. In Upper Canada the R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholic minority had just secured a 
               <br />
               similar system. These two minorities feared 
               <br />
               that in the new constitution, under the sepa- 
               <br />
               ration of legislative powers which must 
               <br />
               ensue, the rights of each might be put in 
               <br />
               jeopardy by a hostile majority. The min 
               <br />
               ority of Lower Canada felt perfectly secure 
               <br />
               under the then existing condition of things 
               <br />
               because those of their own creed and race 
               <br />
               were in the majority in United Canada. 
               <br />
               The Roman Catholic minority in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada feared also the constitution because 
               <br />
               it would be deprived of the powerful alli- 
               <br />
               ance of those of their own origin in another 
               <br />
               province. Under such circumstances, what 
               <br />
               was to be done? How could a scheme of 
               <br />
               confederation be devised so as to ensure 
               <br />
               the support of all parties and sections of 
               <br />
               the community ? It is useless to speculate 
               <br />
               as to what might have been done. It is 
               <br />
               sufﬁcient to say that means were found to 
               <br />
               insure to the minority in each province, the 
               <br />
               free exercise of its rights, and that means 
               <br />
               was to declare that in the provinces of 
               <br />
               Upper and Lower Canada. the rights of the 
               <br />
               minority. which were to be entrusted to

               the respective legislatures of these pro-

               <br />
               of Ontario and Quebec, we ﬁnd that the

               powers of these two provinces are limited 
               <br />

               <br />
               of Ontario nor that of Quebec was given 
               <br />
               power to pass any law which might preju-

               endures the schools of the minority in Quebec 
               <br />
               and Ontario must likewise endure. Yet, re— 
               <br />
               markable as is this enactment. it is per— 
               <br />
               haps still more remarkable, if we remember 
               <br />
               that one of the men who assented to this 
               <br />
               limitation to the power of the province of 
               <br />
               Ontario was Mr. George Brown himself— 
               <br />
               Mr. George Brown who said again and 
               <br />
               again that he was opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools. who had carried on a crusade of 
               <br />
               years against separate schools in his pro- 
               <br />
               vince. If you look only at the surface of 
               <br />
               things. without trying to ﬁnd the inspiration, 
               <br />
               it is indeed remarkable that Mr. Brown. 
               <br />
               who, with Sir John Macdonald was the 
               <br />
               central <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">figure.</span> agreed that the powers of the 
               <br />
               legislature of his own province should be 
               <br />
               limited in that respect. We need not marvel 
               <br />
               if Mr. Brown was attacked and assailed for 
               <br />
               the action he then took. He was assailed 
               <br />
               perhaps by some of his own disciples whom 
               <br />
               he had taught to object to separate schools 
               <br />
               as strongly as he did himself. Mr. Brown 
               <br />
               defended his course in the confederation de— 
               <br />
               bate. or rather he explained his policy, be- 
               <br />
               cause he was under no necessity to defend 
               <br />
               his course: and I beg on this occasion to 
               <br />
               commend his language to those who to-day 
               <br />
               have forgotten confederation, when he came
