               Confederation Act, 1867, did not assume to

               <br />
               In 1867, at the time of the Confederation

               Act. we were not worried over any class 
               <br />
               but Roman Catholics and Protestants. 
               <br />
               There was no attempt made at that time, 
               <br />
               and So far as I know there has been no
