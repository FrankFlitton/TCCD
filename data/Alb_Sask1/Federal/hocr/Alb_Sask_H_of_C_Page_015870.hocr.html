               very closely by the Prime Minister himself.

               sentiments I have heard him utter before 
               <br />
               in this House. I tried to hunt them up 
               <br />
               hurriedly, but have not succeeded in ﬁnd- 
               <br />
               ing them. Perhaps I can do so later. I am

               glad to see that he is with me because I

               think he is now in the right track and I 
               <br />

               <br />

               question and to decide how its proceedings 
               <br />
               should be published. This gave to the legis-

               lature the right to declare whether the

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span> minutes how that resolution came to 
               <br />
               be incorporated in the Bill of 1877. Dealing 
               <br />
               now with what happened in 1890. I find 
               <br />
               that then and there it was decided that 
               <br />
               the local legislature should be absolutely 
               <br />
               free to decide how the records, how the 
               <br />
               proceedings of the legislative assembly 
               <br />
               should be recorded, and we ﬁnd also <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> 
               <br />
               in January, 1892, as I have just mentioned, 
               <br />
               011 motion of ;Mr. Haultain, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">E‘nglish‘</span> 
               <br />
               language was declared to be the only ofﬁ— 
               <br />
               cial language <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in.</span> the records and proceedings 
               <br />
               of the legislative assembly. Now, this is a 
               <br />
               settled question as far as this parliament 
               <br />
               is concerned. It is a question over which 
               <br />
               it would not be advisable to try to do What 
               <br />
               was done in 1890. But what is my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hon.</span> 
               <br />
               friend proposing? Is he proposing to declare 
               <br />
               that the English and French languages will 
               <br />
               be forever the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oﬂicial</span> languages in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories? No, he simply says we 
               <br />
               are going to declare that the English and 
               <br />
               French languages shall be ofﬁcial languages, 
               <br />
               but next year. after a few months. six 
               <br />
               months from that time. the legislative as- 
               <br />
               sembly would have the right to declare 
               <br />
               whether the French language would continue 
               <br />
               to be an ofﬁcial language or not. Why not 
               <br />
               take a bold position? Why should my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, if he wants to restore the French 
               <br />
               language. if he is serious in contending that 
               <br />
               the French is an oﬂ‘icial language in the
