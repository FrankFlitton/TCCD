               <br />
               of being concise and to the point. I believe 
               <br />
               my hon. friend rather rejoices in high and 
               <br />
               loud redundant sentences, and that the mere 
               <br />
               clatter of syllables has some charm for his 
               <br />
               ears, especially when the syllables fall from 
               <br />
               his own tongue. I remember a time when 
               <br />
               the speech was not so concise. In the olden 
               <br />
               days, it was rather prone to conceal the 
               <br />
               paucity of material under a verbosity of 
               <br />
               expression. My hon. friend (Mr. Foster) 
               <br />
               should have realized that the people will not 
               <br />
               be fed upon words and wind, but prefer 
               <br />
               a bill of fare reduced to a single course if 
               <br />
               there is some substance in it. There is not 
               <br />
               much legislation in the speech because we 
               <br />
               do not propose to introduce much legislation. 
               <br />
               There is only one great measure which it is 
               <br />
               proposed to introduce and that is a Bill 
               <br />
               granting autonomy to the western territories. 
               <br />
               \Ve think the time has come when the west- 
               <br />
               ern territories should have full partner- 
               <br />
               ship in confederation, when we should admit 
               <br />
               them as members of the Canadian family 
               <br />
               as full provinces. My hon. friend alluded to 
               <br />
               the fact that for two or three years there 
               <br />
               has been an appeal from the territories for 
               <br />
               full autonomy. Some two years ago we 
               <br />
               received delegations and requests from the 
               <br />
               legislature and in some instances from the 
               <br />
               people also, to have the territories at once 
               <br />
               admitted as full provinces, but we repre- 
               <br />
               sented to the people and to the legislature 
               <br />
               that the time was scarcely opportune to have 
               <br />
               this introduced, that we could not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> 
               <br />
               far from a general election and that at 
               <br />
               that time the representation of the territories 
               <br />
               in this House was small while after a gen- 
               <br />
               eral election there would be a larger repre- 
               <br />
               sentation. They had only four members in 
               <br />
               the last parliament, they have now ten and 
               <br />
               I think the wisdom of our judgment has now 
               <br />
               been justiﬁed. It is true that we found some 
               <br />
               doubting Thomases in the territories who 
               <br />
               thought that we would not implement our 
               <br />
               promises, but there is to-day in the speech 
               <br />
               from the Throne an indication and the cer- 
               <br />
               tainty that on this occasion as on every oc- 
               <br />
               casion this government fulﬁls its pledges 
               <br />
               and carries out its promises. My hon friend 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) does not know the character 
               <br />
               of the legislation which we are about to in- 
               <br />
               troduce. I am sure my hon. friend does not 
               <br />
               expect that we shall tell him at this time 
               <br />
               the principal features of the Bill. We are 
               <br />
               working on it now ; it is far advanced, but 
               <br />
               in respect to three or four salient features 
               <br />
               we thought it better to wait for the repre- 
               <br />
               sentations of the Northwest government and 
               <br />
               also the advice of our friends on the ﬂoor 
               <br />
               of this House.

               There is another suggestion in the speech 
               <br />
               upon which my hon. friend requires some

               point. It is within the knowledge of every- 
               <br />
               body that along a very great part of the 
               <br />
               boundary between Canada and the United 
               <br />
               States is the water system of the St. Law- 
               <br />
               rence. Now, I am sure. that every one will 
               <br />
               admit that it is to the interest of Canada as 
               <br />
               well as the United States that the surface of 
               <br />
               the water should be kept at as high a level as 
               <br />
               possible. Some few years ago, when it was 
               <br />
               rumoured that the state of Illinois intended 
               <br />
               to connect the waters of Lake Michigan 
               <br />
               with the waters of the Mississippi river by 
               <br />
               means of a canal, there was an apprehen- 
               <br />
               sion expressed, not only in this country but 
               <br />
               in the United States, that that work might 
               <br />
               have the effect of lowering the level of. the 
               <br />
               waters of Lake Michigan and adjacent 
               <br />
               waters‘. As the event turned out, this fear 
               <br />
               was groundless, as the volume of water 
               <br />
               taken away by the canal is not sufﬁcient to 
               <br />
               materially affect the level of the lakes. But 
               <br />
               if similar works were to be undertaken 
               <br />
               right and left, if the waters of Lake Erie 
               <br />
               and our system of waterways generally 
               <br />
               were to be tapped at different points, it is 
               <br />
               possible that the volume of water removed 
               <br />
               from the lakes would be so great that the 
               <br />
               level might be appreciably lowered. That 
               <br />
               is not all. In sections of the country where 
               <br />
               the boundary is not water, but land, there 
               <br />
               are streams and large rivers which have 
               <br />
               their sources in one country and which ﬂow 
               <br />
               into the other. Complaint has been made 
               <br />
               by the United States that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadians'have</span> 
               <br />
               constructed some works upon rivers which 
               <br />
               have their sources in Canada and which 
               <br />
               ﬂow into the United States, and that these 
               <br />
               works <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aifect</span> the ﬂow of the waters in their 
               <br />
               country. We also have made complaints 
               <br />
               to the United States that Americans have 
               <br />
               constructed upon some rivers, the St. John 
               <br />
               river, for instance, works which affect the 
               <br />
               ﬂow of the waters in our country. It is, 
               <br />
               therefore, to the mutual interest and advan- 
               <br />
               tage of both countries to have this question 
               <br />
               properly investigated with the view of hav- 
               <br />
               ing concurrent legislation if such should be 
               <br />
               found necessary. From olden times it has 
               <br />
               been a principle of Roman law, which has 
               <br />
               been adopted by most civilized nations, that 
               <br />
               the riparian owner of any stream has the 
               <br />
               right to use the water of that stream for 
               <br />
               his own beneﬁt, provided he does not im- 
               <br />
               pair the ﬂow of the water beyond the boun- 
               <br />
               dary of his property. This is a principle 
               <br />
               of law which dominates in almost every 
               <br />
               country; but it is not possible to have this 
               <br />
               principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">followed</span> and carried out when 
               <br />
               the works are in one country and the boun- 
               <br />
               dary of the property is in another country. 
               <br />
               For these reasons we have thought it ad- 
               <br />
