               torial legislature; and therefore, according 
               <br />
               to the terms of section 133 of the British

               a. thing in which I cannot agree, except so 
               <br />
               far as they must be permanent in every par- 
               <br />
               ticular, so long as we are not ready to give 
               <br />
               these people a more extended form of local 
               <br />
               authority. My hon. friend also says in this 
               <br />
               amendment, that since we passed this law 
               <br />
               and gave this incipient constitution to the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, nothing has occurred 
               <br />
               to change our views. I cannot agree with that. 
               <br />
               Everything has occurred since that time, not 
               <br />
               to change our views, but to set us thinking 
               <br />
               about what we should do at a future time, not 
               <br />
               very far off, in regard to these Territories. 
               <br />
               What has occurred is this : a population has 
               <br />
               gone into these Territories; they have been 
               <br />
               given a. legislature; and that legislature has 
               <br />
               demanded certain measures—not only on the 
               <br />
               question of language, but on that of the schools, 
               <br />
               and on the system of government. Bearing 
               <br />
               these facts in mind, it seems to me that the 
               <br />
               proper time to deal with this question will be 
               <br />
               when we are prepared to give the Territories, 
               <br />
               perhaps not absolute, but a more extended 
               <br />
               form of local self-government ; and when that 
               <br />
               time comes, we must be prepared to deal with 
               <br />
               this question upon the broad principle of this 
               <br />
               constitution, which has been devised for the 
               <br />
               safety of the majority and the protection of 
               <br />
               the minority, and in the light of the condition 
               <br />
               of things which may exist at that time in 
               <br />
               the Territories.

               I suppose my hon. friend, when he read 
               <br />
               these words of mine, laid particular empha-

               <br />
               the same ground to-day. I am prepared to 
               <br />
               deal with this question on the broad‘ prin-

               ciple of the constitution, which has devised 
               <br />
               rules and regulations for the protection of 
               <br />
               minorities. Has anything been done in 
               <br />
               this constitution for the language of any

               The fathers of confederation did not pretend

               to authorize the French language in any 
               <br />

               <br />
               with regard to the schools. As to them the 
               <br />
               minority were given special protection by
