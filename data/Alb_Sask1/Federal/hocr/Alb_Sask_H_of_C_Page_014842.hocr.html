               <br />
               notably the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Labelle</span> (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bourassa) and the hon. the Solicitor General 
               <br />
               (Mr. Lemieux) evinced a very sudden liking 
               <br />
               for the British system of education. That: 
               <br />
               was surely a strange position, for the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is usually anti-imperialist in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> respect. Whenever we wish to draw 
               <br />
               the ties closer, the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               refuses, and says, we do not wish to come 
               <br />
               any closer. Buthe develops suddenly a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> great liking for British institutions, 
               <br />
               and on a matter that is very poorly chosen, 
               <br />
               and which, of all others, has led to more 
               <br />
               friction and is at present causing more

               heartburnings than have been experienced 
               <br />
               in the British Islands in a generation. And

               like to see introdhccd into this country—

               denominational Schools. The system of de—

               nominational schools, as it exists in Great 
               <br />

               <br />
               all due regard to British intelligence and 
               <br />
               British sense of right and justice, is a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">s3</span> stem which never can be successfully <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               tioduced into a young country like this. 
               <br />
               Consider the ﬁgures I read to you from the 
               <br />
               census; and I have other ﬁgures with 
               <br />
               icference to the new territory now being 
               <br />
               set apart, which are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">almost</span> identical with 
               <br />
               the ﬁgures I gave respecting the whole 
               <br />
               of Canada. The Roman Catholics are the 
               <br />
               principal body, even in the new territories, 
               <br />
               in point of numbers. They beat the Method-

               ists, the Presbyterians and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Anglicans,</span> 
               <br />
               all of which come pretty close. If that is 
               <br />
               the case, how are we going to introduce in- 
               <br />
               to that country denominational schools? 
               <br />
               It is an impossibility. Both the Finance 
               <br />
               Minister and the Minister of Customs enter— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed</span> a plea for that system. It sounds very

               well; it is pleasing; but what I submit 
               <br />
               lo this House, and what this country knows, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> that it is impracticable. The First Min-

               <br />
               to the present they have been insuperable.
