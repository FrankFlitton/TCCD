               <br />
               with the principle of the party to which he 
               <br />

               hon. gentleman is very inquisitive. I said 
               <br />
               the other day—and I think my hon. friend 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> agree with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ime—~that</span> I am not aware of 
               <br />
               any measure of any great importance, and 
               <br />
               I am aware of very few measures even of 
               <br />
               little importance, that have ever gone over 
               <br />
               that table without having changes made in 
               <br />
               them ; and I shall be much surprised if this 
               <br />
               Bill, which is of such great importance 
               <br />
               runs the gauntlet of this House without 
               <br />
               fault being found with it—perhaps by my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the leader of the opposition (Mr. 
               <br />
               R. L. Borden): perhaps by my hon. friend 
               <br />
               who sits next to him (Mr. Foster) ; perhaps 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend who sits behind him (Mr. 
               <br />
               Monk), or, perhaps by my hon. friend who 
               <br />
               sits at his right hand (Mr. Sproule). Per- 
               <br />
               haps fault will be found on one hand, per- 
               <br />
               haps on many. Therefore. I cannot see how 
               <br />
               it is possible to gratify my hon. friend and 
               <br />
               say anything as to changes being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contenr</span>
