               <br />

               there were then no separate schools.

               There is a feature of this change to which 
               <br />
               I desire to call special attention. When the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman succeeds in getting his new 
               <br />
               subsection 1 made the law as to Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, these two provinces will be 
               <br />
               in a different position from any other pro- 
               <br />
               vince in the Dominion that has entered since 
               <br />
               confederation, and also from New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick and Nova Scotia. I think the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice will not deny that. Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, the moment this law comes 
               <br />
               into operation, will not have the same free- 
               <br />
               dom as others; they will be more strictly 
               <br />
               bound than Prince Edward Island, Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba or 
               <br />
               British Columbia. And I will explain why. 
               <br />
               If any one of these provinces should hereafter 
               <br />
               choose to pass a separate school law and 
               <br />
               later on ﬁnd that law objectionable and de- 
               <br />
               sire to amend it in a way that would affect 
               <br />
               some privilege previously <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granted),</span> what 
               <br />
               would be the remedy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of'</span> those aggrieved '3 
               <br />
               Such a province might be quite willing to 
               <br />
               enact a separate school law knowing that it 
               <br />
               had the right to repeal that law, and knowing 
               <br />
               that the risk it ran through that repeal is 
               <br />
               that there might be an appeal to this Do- 
               <br />
               minion parliament for remedial legislation, 
               <br />
               and it might be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span> to take that risk of 
               <br />
               what this Dominion would do. But what will 
               <br />
               be the case with Alberta and Saskatchewan? 
               <br />
               They are put in the position of being bound 
               <br />
               by subsection 1 to retain all the provisions 
               <br />
               of ordinances 29 and 30 which give any pri- 
               <br />
               vilege to the minority. Any Act they might 
               <br />
               pass to curtail one single privilege granted 
               <br />
               under ordinances 29 and 30 would be ultra 
               <br />
               vires. It would not be necessary to come 
               <br />
               here for a remedial law; but the cabinet, 
               <br />
               sitting in chambers, would disallow the 
               <br />
               amending Act and put an end to it. It is a 
               <br />
               much more skilful system of coercion than 
               <br />
               was ever attempted upon Manitoba. There 
               <br />
               is no question as to the effect of it. If I 
               <br />
               am wrong, I should be glad if the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice will correct me 
               <br />
               now. I doubt if there is an hon. gentleman 
               <br />
               on the other side of the House who ever 
               <br />
               believed that in approving of the proposed 
               <br />
               amending clause he was changing the whole 
               <br />
               basis of the law and putting Alberta and 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan in a worse position than any

               vinces from that of the other provinces I 
               <br />
               have mentioned. I am not aware that the 
               <br />
               First Minister said one word upon that sub- 
               <br />

               <br />
               on the other side understood that the law 
               <br />
               was being so changed that it would be ultra

               vires for Alberta or Saskatchewan to pass 
               <br />
               any law to alter any privilege under ordi- 
               <br />
               nances 29 and 30. Why, fancy the position 
               <br />
               of these provinces. Here, for example, is an 
               <br />
               ordinance providing for the formation of the 
               <br />
               Board of Education. That board must have 
               <br />
               exactly ﬁve members, of whom three must 
               <br />
               be Protestants and two Roman Catholics. 
               <br />
               The province cannot alter that, but it must 
               <br />
               have always three Protestants and always 
               <br />
               two Roman Catholic on this Board of Edn—

               cation, or one party or other may say that 
               <br />
               their rights are being invaded. You must, 
               <br />
               for all time, have neither more nor less. The 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice was just about right 
               <br />
               when he said that he intended to have no 
               <br />
               doubt about the position. I think there can 
               <br />
               be no doubt of it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">*</span>

               Now the Minister of Justice went through 
               <br />
               the several addresses. I do not intend to 
               <br />
               follow him at any length, but in order that 
               <br />
               i may state clearly my point of view, it 
               <br />
               is necessary that I should follow him very 
               <br />
               shortly. Under section 146 of the Britsh 
               <br />
               North America Act, provision was made for 
               <br />
               taking in provinces and territories. There 
               <br />
               was this distinction between taking in a 
               <br />
               province and taking in a territory. A pro- 
               <br />
               vince was to be taken in upon an address 
               <br />
               of the legislative assembly of the province 
               <br />
               and of the two Houses of this parliament. 
               <br />
               But inasmuch as a territory had no legis- 
               <br />
               lature, it was provided that a territory 
               <br />
               should be taken in on an address of this 
               <br />
               parliament alone. Well, in 1867 the two 
               <br />
               House of Parliament did address Her 
               <br />
               Majesty and ask that the Territories should 
               <br />
               .be taken into the union. The hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman went on to read an Act of 1868 
               <br />
               and other matters, at some length, but 
               <br />
               i do not see that they have any bearing 
               <br />
               whatever upon the question that we are 
               <br />
               discussing; probably his object was to give 
               <br />
               an historical narrative of what took place. 
               <br />
               The fact was that after the address of 
               <br />
               December, 1867, there was delay owing to 
               <br />
               the negotiations pending to buy out the in- 
               <br />
               terests of the Hudson Bay Company, That 
               <br />
               caused delay, but in course of time the 
               <br />
               purchase was made, and again in 1869 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span> address was renewed. I will read 
               <br />
               a word or two from that address. It
