               <br />
               to accomplish it. Suppose that the trustees 
               <br />
               of any public school were all Roman Catho— 
               <br />
               lics and that Protestant children are attend— 
               <br />
               ing to it. what kind of religious instruction 
               <br />
               would be there given? No doubt it would 
               <br />
               be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dogmas</span> of the Roma‘n Catholic 
               <br />
               Church that would be taught. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman is not only conceding the right 
               <br />
               to Roman Catholic separate schools to 
               <br />
               teach the dogma of the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               Church, but he is providing to enable that 
               <br />
               same church to teach its doctrines in a 
               <br />
               public school, even though a large number 
               <br />
               of Protestants may attend it.

               For thirteen years we have had experience

               of that system. and it has worked satis-

               factorily. both in districts in which the 
               <br />
               Catholics are in a majority and in the much

               greater number of districts in which the 
               <br />
               Protestants are in the majority. And the 
               <br />
               reason is this. In those districts in which 
               <br />
               the Protestants are largely in the majority 
               <br />

               <br />
               have always been willing to allow the 
               <br />
               Roman Catholic ratepayers the right to 
               <br />
               have their children given Roman Catholic

               religious instruction in the public schools

               a similar concession in favour of the Pro-
