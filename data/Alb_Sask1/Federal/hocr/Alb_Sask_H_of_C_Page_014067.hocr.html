               is trouble. I will tell you why the right

               hon. gentleman will not appoint a Minister 
               <br />

               Minister of the Interior to consent to these 
               <br />

               <br />
               he cannot resort to the straight constitu~ 
               <br />
               tional method of solving these questions. 
               <br />
               He should not have introduced this Bill 
               <br />
               Without having had the consent and advice 
               <br />
               of the members from the Northwest; and

               I ask the hon. member for Brandon (Mr.

               senting the west. It is not constitutional. 
               <br />
               It may be justiﬁed, but it will end in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               aster, it cannot end in anything else. Now, 
               <br />
               if the right hon. gentleman ﬁxes up his 
               <br />
               fences as far as Manitoba is concerned, he 
               <br />
               will ﬁnd them down in Nova Scotia, and as 
               <br />
               soon as he ﬁxes them up in regard to Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia and the Northwest, he will ﬁnd them 
               <br />
               down in the province of Quebec ; and, being 
               <br />
               in that position, he has to resort to all these 
               <br />
               tricks. He is afraid of trusting the people 
               <br />
               to-day, he is afraidof the good. old principle 
               <br />
               he laid down years ago of provincial rights. 
               <br />
               Now. I want to tell him in regard to this 
               <br />
               education problem, that he can patch it up 
               <br />
               as much as he likes, he can hold what 
               <br />
               caucuses he likes. he can ﬁx up his fences 
               <br />
               in this direction and in that direction; but 
               <br />
               there is only one thing that will satisfy the 
               <br />
               provinces of Canada to-day, and that is 
               <br />
               complete autonomy for the Northwest pro- 
               <br />
               vinces. the right of the people of the west

               to settle their own educational affairs. ‘They

               wish to be free to settle this question ; they 
               <br />
               don’t want all these bickerings in the cabi- 
               <br />
               net. They want to be treated as freemen, 
               <br />
               with the right to settle their own educa- 
               <br />
               tional questions; and it is because they 
               <br />
               dared to assert their freedom in this House, 
               <br />
               because they had a minister in the govern-

               ment who was prepared to assert that right, 
               <br />

               <br />
               they are today to be treated as slaves. 
               <br />
               Again I tell the right hon. gentleman that 
               <br />
               he must have more respect for the consti- 
               <br />
               tution. So far he professes to be upholding 
               <br />
               the constitution. But everything he does is 
               <br />
               irregular—his relations with his ministers, 
               <br />
               these negotiations that are going on to-day, 
               <br />
               all these things that we hear of, and many 
               <br />
               other things that don’t get into the press, 
               <br />
               but that we know are going on, with no 
               <br />
               peace in prospect, continued bickerings are 
               <br />
               in store for us. Again I say he is on the 
               <br />
               wrong line, and he must retrace his steps. 
               <br />
               He has spoken to—day of the retreat of the 
               <br />
               late Minister of the Interior. There was 
               <br />
               no retreat on the part of the late Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior in standing up for the rights 
               <br />
               of the new provinces. He was maintaining 
               <br />
               what I call good doctrine in regard to pro- 
               <br />
               vincial rights. Yet, because he took that 
               <br />
               position in this House, the First Minister 
               <br />
               says he is retreating. Well, the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman may say it is a retreat, but I 
               <br />
               say, No. Once again, in the name of the 
               <br />
               people of the great Northwest, I ask the 
               <br />
               government to keep their hands off these 
               <br />
               new provinces in regard to education. Let 
               <br />
               the people up there settle these questions 
               <br />
               themselves. They are well competent to do 
               <br />
               it ; they know what they want without any 
               <br />
               advice from any other province, I do not 
               <br />
               care which. Al 1they ask is that they be 
               <br />
               permitted to settle their own aifairs. I do 
               <br />
               not care what batteries may be placed in 
               <br />
               this House, on the one side or the other. 
               <br />
               There is no service in this House but the 
               <br />
               one service—the public service. I want to 
               <br />
               tell the right hon. gentleman this, that it 
               <br />
               may take much longer than he counts on to 
               <br />
               put this session through. I do not see why 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman should get one 
               <br />
               dollar of supplies while he has no minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior to take the part of Manitoba. 
               <br />
               I do not see why he should get any legisla- 
               <br />
               tion through this House until he comes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for-</span>
