               <br />
               The same schools are named in section 16.

               <br />
               North America Act. Therefore there was 
               <br />
               grave doubt whether remedial legislation 
               <br />
               could be enacted by parliament by reason 
               <br />
               of laws existing in the new province while 
               <br />
               under. territorial restriction. This of course 
               <br />
               would not apply to laws enacted by the 
               <br />
               provinces after they had been constituted 
               <br />
               as provinces. Section 16, No. 1, left the 
               <br />
               constitution untouched in that respect; 
               <br />
               section 16, No. 2, deﬁnes the words ‘ by law,’ 
               <br />
               as meaning the law set out in chapters 29 
               <br />
               and 30. The effect of this is to give fur- 
               <br />
               ther opportunities for remedial legislation 
               <br />
               and to leave all Canada liable to be disturbed 
               <br />
               by future agitation which in my opinion 
               <br />
               should be entirely conﬁned to the provincial 
               <br />
               arena. In this respect also the member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.for</span> 
               <br />
               Brandon (Mr. Sifton) was not, I think, 
               <br />
               quite equal to the occasion when he under- 
               <br />
               took to revise or consider the work of the 
               <br />
               draughtsmen in that regard. The Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice said a very signi-ﬁcent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span> on 
               <br />
               one occasion in this House. He said that 
               <br />
               some censure had been passed on the 
               <br />
               draughtsman of the Manitoba Act; he was 
               <br />
               determined that no such censure should be 
               <br />
               passed upon the draughtsman of the AI- 
               <br />
               herta and Saskatchewan Acts, and I think 
               <br />
               I may fairly congratulate the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice on this that he has at least proved 
               <br />
               himself more than equal to the member
