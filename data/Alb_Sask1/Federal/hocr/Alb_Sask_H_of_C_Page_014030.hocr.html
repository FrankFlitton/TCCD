               Sir, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I.</span> commend this language to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend. I commend this language to every 
               <br />
               man in this House. There are to—dny, as 
               <br />
               there were then, men in this House and out 
               <br />
               of it who do not believe in separate schools, 
               <br />
               but, as Mr. Brown said, the question is not 
               <br />
               whether that system is good or had; that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> not the question to—day, that is not the 
               <br />
               question of which Senator Brown spoke, it is 
               <br />
               not the question with which we have to deal. 
               <br />
               But we have another duty to perform. Mr. 
               <br />
               Brown, on the ﬂoor of the other branch of 
               <br />
               the legislature, said that his opinions in re- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gard</span> to separate schools had not changed. 
               <br />
               He said practically this to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament</span> of 
               <br />
               Canada : There is a new territory, there is 
               <br />
               virgin soil where there is no population. Do 
               <br />
               not introduce separate schools into it, do not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">introduce</span> that burning question into it, but 
               <br />
               the moment you have introduced separate 
               <br />
               schools you have solved the question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for.</span> 
               <br />
               ever, it is part of the union and the minority 
               <br />
               will have its right to such schools.
