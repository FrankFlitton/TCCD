               the adjustment of the public lands, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               Surely such large questions as these, the 
               <br />
               conditions under which these new provinces 
               <br />
               shall enter the union, will be well pondered 
               <br />
               and considered. However, one topic alone

               to the exclusion of other topics in my 
               <br />
