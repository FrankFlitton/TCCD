               days agd in this House, I came to the con- 
               <br />
               clusion that there was certainly a very ma- 
               <br />
               terial change of front and I asked myself 
               <br />
               the question: What could have occasioned 
               <br />
               that change of front? Was it the fact that he 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has,</span> changed sides in this House? Was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lit</span> the 
               <br />
               fact that he was no longer in power? After 
               <br />
               having given the matter careful considera- 
               <br />
               tion I came to the conclusion that it was 
               <br />
               due to neither of these things, it was due to 
               <br />
               a change of climate; the sudden change from 
               <br />
               the cooling breezes of the Atlantic ocean to 
               <br />
               the more contracted and sultry breezes from 
               <br />
               Toronto bay must have brought about the 
               <br />
               change of front displayed by that hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman. He said in that speech, in which 
               <br />
               he was very strong for toleration:

               Of the city of Montreal, a. city that has been 
               <br />
               styled the Rome of America, and, as a Pro-

               testant representing that great Catholic 
               <br />
               city, I wish to give a few instances of the 
               <br />
               toleration that exists there between the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the diiferent religions. I remember 
               <br />
               in my early days being chairman of the 
               <br />
               Protestant school board for ﬁfteen years. 
               <br />
               The Catholic school board sat immediately 
               <br />
               across the street, and during those ﬁfteen 
               <br />
               years, while a priest was chairman of one 
               <br />
               board and I chairman of the other, always 
               <br />
               the kindliest relations existed between us, 
               <br />
               and nothing but courtesy prevailed between 
               <br />
               one and the other. I simply mention this 
               <br />
               to show how well we get along in the pro— 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec, and I will extend an invita- 
               <br />
               tion to the members from Ontario to come 
               <br />
               down' and visit us, and see if they cannot 
               <br />
               take a leaf out of our book. I do not ﬁnd 
               <br />
               fault with the remarks that have fallen 
               <br />
               from the member for East Grey (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule), for, although I cannot agree with 
               <br />
               him, I can praise his consistency, which is 
               <br />
               more than I can do with regard to some hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on that side of the House. But 
               <br />
               for his beneﬁt, and for the beneﬁt of others, 
               <br />
               I wish to cite a few more instances of the 
               <br />
               toleration which prevails in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. My hon. friend from St. Antoine 
               <br />
               (Mr. A-mes) will corroborate my statement, 
               <br />
               that when the Hon. 1. D. Rolland was chair-

               <br />
               French Canadian ward, and it being felt 
               <br />
               that his services were of great value to the 
               <br />
               city, one of the aldermen for St. Antoine 
               <br />

               We, the Protestants of that ward, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unani‘</span> 
               <br />
               mously elected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Mr.</span> Rolland. Here is an— 
               <br />
               other instance of the good feeling which 
               <br />
               exists among the people of different religions 
               <br />
               in the city of Montreal. We had a very 
               <br />
               saintly old priest there, the Reverend Father 
               <br />
               Dowd, of St. Patrick’s Church. and when 
               <br />
               the funeral service for Father Dowd was 
               <br />
               proceeding no church bells in the city tolled 
               <br />
               more solemnly than did the bells of Christ 
               <br />
               Church Cathedral. About the same time 
               <br />
               Archbishop Bond took seriously ill, and 
               <br />
               when it was feared that his sickness was 
               <br />
               unto death, prayers were offered up in near- 
               <br />
               ly every Roman Catholic church in the city 
               <br />
               for his restoration to health. I am sure that 
               <br />
               no happier state of affairs could exist in any 
               <br />
               country ; I do not think that it could possi- 
               <br />
               bly exist in any other province than Quebec. 
               <br />
               Let me point also that when Bishop Moun- 
               <br />
               tain. the ﬁrst bishop of the Church Of Eng- 
               <br />
               land in Canada, arrived in the city of Que—
