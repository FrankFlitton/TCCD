               not think the stock interests are very great—

               experience in my country. Previous to 
               <br />
               about 1889, squatters' rights were recog- 
               <br />
               nized, but about that time notices were 
               <br />
               scattered broadcast that they would not be 
               <br />
               longer protected. I know many cases of 
               <br />
               people having been removed, and denied 
               <br />
               redress because of the notice having been 
               <br />
               given that they were no longer protected.
