               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               once again it is my very sad duty to have 
               <br />
               to inform the House that we have lost by 
               <br />
               death one of our colleagues. Dr. Johnston,

               the member for West Lambton, is no more. 
               <br />
               This is the fourth time during the present 
               <br />
               session that death has visited the members 
               <br />
               of this House. Nobody could have believed 
               <br />
               when we met here some ﬁve months ago 
               <br />
               that our late friend. Dr. Johnston, who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> 
               <br />
               appeared to be the very incarnation of 
               <br />
               rugged health, would be one of the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               victims; but such is the uncertain tenure 
               <br />
               of life, that upon this, as upon many other 
               <br />
               occasions, the hand of fate has been laid 
               <br />
