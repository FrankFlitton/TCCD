               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> Mr. Rogers was troubled in his con-

               the Manitoba government. But, Sir, no, I 
               <br />
               would never think of making that kind of 
               <br />
               appeal; I acknowledge Mr. Rogers' right to 
               <br />
               go and meet Monseigneur Sbarretti and 
               <br />
               have a conversation with him. If the mem-

               <br />
               (Mr. Sam Hughes), would go and see Mon— 
               <br />
               seigneur Sbarretti and talk with him, I 
               <br />
               think it would do them a great deal of 
               <br />
               good—if any improvement is possible for 
               <br />
               those gentlemen—I am sure it would do 
               <br />
               them good. As for the hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule), I do not think 
               <br />
               any improvement is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible</span> with him, be- 
               <br />
               cause I think he is desperately sincere.

               But, coming back to our action in having 
               <br />
               a Papal ablegate to be appointed, we did 
               <br />
               it because we thought it was our duty to do 
               <br />
               it. Monseigneur Sbarretti has succeeded 
               <br />
               Monseigneur Falconio in the same capacity 
               <br />
               that Monseigneur Martinelli exercised at 
               <br />
               Washington where he has been succeeded by 
               <br />
               )Ionseigneur Falconio transferred from Ot-

               tawa. These prelates have been here re- 
               <br />

               <br />
               terests of the Roman Catholics of Canada. 
               <br />
               As I have said, I know nothing of what 
               <br />
               passed between Mr. Rogers and Monseigneur 
               <br />
               Sbarretti, and I would advise the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for South York to call on them if he 
               <br />
               wants to know what transpired between 
               <br />
               them. But suppose that Monseigneur Sbar- 
               <br />
               retti (lid discuss with Mr. Rogers the rights 
               <br />
               of the Catholics of Manitoba, suppose he 
               <br />
               did ask Mr. Rogers to do something for the 
               <br />
               Catholics of Manitoba, where in the name 
               <br />
               of justice and common sense is there any- 
               <br />
               thing wrong in that? Here is a dignitary 
               <br />
               of the Roman Catholic Church, sent here to 
               <br />
               look after the interests of the people belong- 
               <br />
               ing to his church, and what harm is there 
               <br />
               in his meeting another gentleman and ask-

               <br />
               the interests of his people? Now, we have

               American people living in this country and 
               <br />
               the interests of American citizens who may 
               <br />
               be trading in this country; suppose he ﬁnds 
               <br />
               something in our tariff which he thinks is 
               <br />
               prejudicial to their interests, would it be a 
               <br />
               great sin for that gentleman to meet the 
               <br />
