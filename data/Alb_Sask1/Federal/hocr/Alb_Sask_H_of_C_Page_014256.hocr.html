               Mr. BOURASSA. They have. I think,

               <br />
               but what has been their aim and object? 
               <br />
               it has always been to throw down the 
               <br />
               British ﬂag; and the great grievance they 
               <br />
               have against the bishops is that the bishops 
               <br />
               prevented us from joining the United States 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1774,</span> again in 1812. and opposed the re- 
               <br />
               bellion of 1837, supported British supremacy 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1849</span> and induced us to accept confede- 
               <br />
               ration. When newspapers in Ontario are 
               <br />
               ﬁlling their sheets with attacks and insults 
               <br />
               on the hierarchy they are simply insulting 
               <br />
               the men who. for 100 years have been the 
               <br />
               bulwark of British government in Canada. 
               <br />
               If there was any sincerity in these men, 
               <br />
               who are the great apostles and preachers 
               <br />
               ot loyalty, they should feel ashamed of the

               <br />

               <br />
               they attack the hierarchy they attack the 
               <br />

               has always stood by the ﬂag that has given

               just one ground; it may be a good one for 
               <br />
               some. but on the whole it is not a lasting 
               <br />
               one: and that is the right of might. If the 
               <br />
               rule is to be laid down that there is to be 
               <br />
