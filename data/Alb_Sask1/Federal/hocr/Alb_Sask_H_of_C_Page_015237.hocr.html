               this Act of parliament was subsequently 
               <br />
               founded, it was stated that the deﬁnition of

               the limits which were proposed by the Que- 
               <br />

               <br />
               116,550 square miles. There can be no ques-

               <br />
               been able to see, there has been no divest-

               <br />
               incentive to the new provinces to try and 
               <br />
               open up this district. It seems to me that 
               <br />
               if a remote district of that sort is placed 
               <br />
               under the administration of a local govern- 
               <br />
               ment who have no beneﬁciary interest in 
               <br />
               the land, it would he a source of expenditure 
               <br />
               without affording any revenue. The provin- 
               <br />
               cial government might ﬁnd a considerable 
               <br />
               amount of immigration going into the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Athabaska, 300 or 400 miles away. 
               <br />
               These settlers would call loudly for 
               <br />
               the opening up of new roads and the 
               <br />
               building of bridges over some of the big 
               <br />
               rivers, and that would mean taking away a 
               <br />
               certain amount of money which would other- 
               <br />
               wise be spent in .the more thickly settled 
               <br />
               districts nearer home. Therefore, it seems 
               <br />
               to me that the local government would not 
               <br />
               be very anxious to encourage settlement in 
               <br />
               the remote districts ; whereas, if the lands 
               <br />
               in those remote districts formed part of the 
               <br />
               province, the local government would do 
               <br />
               their utmost to encourage settlement there. 
               <br />
               because they would be enhancing the value of 
               <br />
               their own property. For instance if the min- 
               <br />
               erals are in the possession of the Dominion 
               <br />
               government. the opening up of a new coal 
               <br />
               mine would bring some money to the Dom- 
               <br />
               inion government in the shape of royalty. but 
               <br />
               it brings no revenue to the local government; 
               <br />
               in fact, it is a source of expenditure, be— 
               <br />
               cause the local government has to provide 
               <br />
               for the inspection of the mine and for the 
               <br />
               safety of the miners. Therefore, the open- 
               <br />
               ing up of an undertaking of that sort is a 
               <br />
               loss to the local government, although it is 
               <br />
               a gain to the Dominion government. But 
               <br />
               if the mines and minerals belonged to the 
               <br />
               province it would be quite a different pro- 
               <br />
               position for then the local government
