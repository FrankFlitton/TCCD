               province. 1 want to place myself on record 
               <br />
               as not being inﬂuenced a particle by that 
               <br />
               consideration. If I had my way I would not 
               <br />
               make either of them the capital. but I think 
               <br />
               I would pick out Red Deer which seems to 
               <br />
               be half way between the two and put a 
               <br />
               dozen constituencies north and a dozen south. 
               <br />
               I think we have a precedent in the past 
               <br />
               history of this country when the capital of 
               <br />
               the Dominion was established in the little 
               <br />
               place called By-town and that is the reason 
               <br />
               we tind ourselves here in Ottawa on 
               <br />
               the present occasion. I think that would 
               <br />
               settle the controversy. But. to my mind 
               <br />
               there are some other considerations. I think 
               <br />
               the political aspect of the question has had 
               <br />
               some little inﬂuence on hon. gentlemen op- 
               <br />
               posite. The right hon. Prime Minister (Sir 
               <br />
               Wilfrid Laurier) has stated that the only 
               <br />
               matter in controversy is the political capital. 
               <br />
               “'ell I would not like to dispute the state- 
               <br />
               ment of the right hon. gentleman because 
               <br />
               he probably knows more about what led up 
               <br />
               to the present arrangement than we members 
               <br />
               on this side of the House. If that was the 
               <br />
               main consideration in drawing up this selle— 
               <br />
               dule of the constituencies I think it would be 
               <br />
               in order for the right hon. gentleman to 
               <br />
               justify it. There are one or two anomalies 
               <br />
               which I would like to point out before this 
               <br />
               question is ﬁnally settled. It is stated by 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of the Interior that they 
               <br />
               have given more representation to these 
               <br />
               large places in the north than to the con- 
               <br />
               stituencies in the south. I would point out 
               <br />
               that the constituency of Medicine Hat is 
               <br />
               much' larger than the constituencies in the 
               <br />
               middle of the province. Take for instance 
               <br />
               such constituencies as Lacombe. Ponoka. 
               <br />
               Wetaskiwin and Leduc : probably the whole 
               <br />
               four of them do not cover a greater area than 
               <br />
               the constituency of Medicine Hat. I pre- 
               <br />
               sume that when the hon. gentleman went 
               <br />
               over these constituencies and found out that 
               <br />
               the very large ones required more represen- 
               <br />
               tation. Medicine Hat was not overlooked. 
               <br />
               It is a very large constituency and requires 
               <br />
               more representation on that account. How 
               <br />
               was it adjusted ? They divided Peace River 
               <br />
               and Athabaska into two constituencies and 
               <br />
               got over the difﬁculty in that way. They got 
               <br />
               over the difﬁculty in regard to Medicine Hat 
               <br />
               by adding forty townships and giving it a 
               <br />
               population of nearly double that of other con- 
               <br />
               stituencies and three or four times the area. 
               <br />
               How can that be justiﬁed '3 The question of 
               <br />
               Stony Plain has been referred to. There is a 
               <br />
               fringe of population down the side of this 
               <br />
               constituency and the adjoining constituencies 
               <br />
               could very easily have been extended a little 
               <br />
               westward so as to take in all the votes that 
               <br />
               there are in Stony Plain. To my mind there 
               <br />
               are three or four reasons why this Bill 
               <br />
               should not go through in its present shape.

               on the map it can be said that they are fear-

               <br />
               have many other important matters to give 
               <br />
               their attention to. and this government could

               have easily prevented this controversy had
