               Mr. LAKE. When the Alberta Bill was 
               <br />
               before this House the statement was fre- 
               <br />
               quently made that the desire to make Cal- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gary</span> a capital was at the bottom of a great 
               <br />
               deal of the opposition which had been rais- 
               <br />
               ed by members on this side of the House to 
               <br />
               the schedules as they were presented. Oc- 
               <br />
               casion was taken several times by members 
               <br />
               on this side to repudiate that statement. I 
               <br />
               certainly did so for my part and others did 
               <br />
               the same. We objected to the proposed dis- 
               <br />
               tribution on the ground that it was a most 
               <br />
               unfair distribution of representation. In 
               <br />
               the present Bill there is no question about 
               <br />
               the capital; there is no doubt as to the 
               <br />
               proposition that Regina should be selected 
               <br />
               for the ﬁrst meeting of the new legislative 
               <br />
               assembly, but an examination of the sched- 
               <br />
               ules as attached to this Bill shows that there 
               <br />
               is apparently a deliberate intention on the 
               <br />
               part of the government to deprive the older 
               <br />
               settlers in the new province of their fair 
               <br />
               and legitimate share in the representation 
               <br />
               of that country. Under the schedule those 
               <br />
               older settlers who have mainly made that 
               <br />
               country what it is, who have borne the bur- 
               <br />
               then and heat of the day, who have legis- 
               <br />
               lated in the past for that country and suc- 
               <br />
               cessfully legislated, are to be deprived of an 
               <br />
               equitable voice in what the future of that 
               <br />
               country shall be, now that it is made into 
               <br />

               take whatever as to What we are contending 
               <br />
               for in this matter. We simply ask that 
               <br />
               every vote in that new country shall have 
               <br />
               an equal value,_that the vote of the old-

               timer shall have a value equal to that of 
               <br />
               the new comer to the country. We ask no
