               the French language if it likes. I come 
               <br />
               now to this point: How is it that the use 
               <br />
               of the French language came to be pro- 
               <br />
               vided for in the law of 1877? We must 
               <br />
               not forget that in 1875 when wepassed the 
               <br />
               Act in regard to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               providing for the appointment of a council 
               <br />
               and for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span> generally of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories, nothing was said in 
               <br />
               regard to the language question. but in 
               <br />
               1877. a Bill was introduced into this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment providing for the amendment of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories Act. The Bill passed 
               <br />
               the House of Commons and no mention was 
               <br />
               made of the French language. When the 
               <br />
               Bill was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'before</span> the Senate the hon. Senator 
               <br />
               Girard proposed that we should add a re- 
               <br />
               solution providing. that the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage could be used in the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. Why? Did he ask that in View 
               <br />
               of a compact or of an agreement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'9</span> No. be 
               <br />
               advanced the simple argument, that. the 
               <br />
               majority in the Northwest Territories being 
               <br />
               French. it was only fair that the French 
               <br />
               language should be used in the legislative 
               <br />
               assembly. Here are his own words:

               He would also call <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> to the fact that 
               <br />
