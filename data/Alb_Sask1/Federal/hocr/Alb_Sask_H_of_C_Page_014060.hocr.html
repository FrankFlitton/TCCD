               morning I left for my home in Halifax for

               to return to Ottawa by noon of the follow-

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in'this</span> House, I did not reach Halifax on 
               <br />
               Friday evening owing to the snow blockade, 
               <br />
               but I reached there on Monday evening, 
               <br />
               more than seventy-two hours late. I left 
               <br />
               Halifax on Wednesday morning and arrived 
               <br />
               at Ottawa on Thursday evening. I think it 
               <br />
               is due to myself to make this explanation, 
               <br />
               because I do not think that in my public

               think that anything has been displayed in

               There is one other matter which I forgot

               to mention. On the introduction of this Bill

               I brought to the attention of the government 
               <br />

               been moved for had not yet been brought 
               <br />
               down. I also pointed out that there was 
               <br />
               certain information which I thought would 
               <br />
               be necessary for the intelligent discussion

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               1 think I voice the feeling of the House 
               <br />
               when I say to my hon. friend that no 
               <br />
               apology was needed from him as to his 
               <br />
               absence from the House. Unfortunately, we 
               <br />
               are all victims of the press, and if we were 
               <br />
               to take very seriously everything that is 
               <br />
               said of us, our repose would be considerably 
               <br />
               aﬂfected. But I think we can make allow- 
               <br />
               ance for the newspaper men in their desire 
               <br />
               to give the latest news. Everybody knows 
               <br />
               the painful circumstances under which my 
               <br />
               hon. friend had to leave this House, and no 
               <br />
               one, I can assure him, speaking for this 
               <br />
               side, had any suspicion that his absence was 
               <br />
               due ‘to any other cause than domestic amic- 
               <br />
               tion. With regard to the main question 
               <br />
               which my hon. friend has put to me, I do 
               <br />
               not agree with him as to the constitutional 
               <br />
               practice. I admit that in Canada the dis- 
               <br />
               cussion generally takes place on the second 
               <br />
               reading of a Bill. This is so in England 
               <br />
               also; but my hon. friend is aware that in 
               <br />
               England every important measure, I do not 
               <br />
               say invariably, but as a rule, is explained 
               <br />
               by the minister in charge of the Bill upon 
               <br />
               its presentation for the ﬁrst reading. There- 
               <br />
               upon the matter is left for some time for 
               <br />
               the deliberation of the House and the

               country. This practice I have followed on 
               <br />
               this occasion, and I believe yet that it is 
               <br />
               the best method. The government have ex- 
               <br />
               plained their policy, and have left it to the 
               <br />
               judgment of the House and the country. 
               <br />
               If the Bill were to be presented without any 
               <br />
               explanation, the country would be without 
               <br />
               the real reasons which prompted the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment in introducing it. If the ﬁrst read- 
               <br />
               ing were to be followed immediately by a 
               <br />
               discussion, I think the House, especially the 
               <br />
               opposition, would be taken at a disadvant- 
               <br />
               age, and the government might be charged 
               <br />
               with sharp practice; but if the Bill is left 
               <br />
               for a reasonable time after being introduc— 
               <br />
               ed, the opposition have an opportunity to 
               <br />
               prepare and explain their views upon it. I 
               <br />
               still think this is the best policy that can be 
               <br />
               followed.

               My hon. friend has asked me if it was 
               <br />
               the intention of the government to introduce 
               <br />
               changes into this Bill. I have only to reply 
               <br />
               that it is open to the party who introduces 
               <br />
               a Bill to change it at all times. I have seen

               few Bills introduced into this House or any

               through the third reading without being 
               <br />
               considerably amended, and the more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im-</span>

               portant the Bill the more likely is it to be 
               <br />
               amended. Even Bills of a very minor im-

               portance are very often amended so as to 
               <br />
               be hardly recognizable when they leave the
