               provincial autonomy. Well. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               let me refer for a moment to whattook place 
               <br />
               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1890.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">IVhat</span> was the position of the right

               <br />
               right hon. gentleman. and when he was asked

               whether the land should be left with the

               he was of the opinion that the land should

               minute ago, that it would perhaps interfere

               long as it serves his purpose ! But, as soon 
               <br />
               as it does not serve his purpose, let us in- 
               <br />
               vade provincial rights and send a postcard.—

               I suppose that is the system in vogue in

               Toronto <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now—Ito</span> every member and to

               saying: Do you approve of that? If he 
               <br />
               says he does, all right, and if he says he 
               <br />
               does not, well, Where will he be ?

               We, of the province of Quebec, we, the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of this Dominion, are 
               <br />
               bound to change our mind as to the hon. 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition (Mr. R. L Borden). 
               <br />
               We had always thought that he was a broad 
               <br />
               minded Englishman, we had always thought 
               <br />
               that he was animated by that spirit of fair 
               <br />
               dealing and kindly forbearance that have 
               <br />
               distinguished English institutions for the 
               <br />
               last ﬁfty years. The other day be pro- 
               <br />
               nounced upon us a beautiful eulogy. He 
               <br />
               said that he had traversed the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec from one end to the other and that 
               <br />
               every man he had met there was well read, 
               <br />
               intelligent and sociable and a moment after- 
               <br />
               wards <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ihe</span> moved the amendment which is 
               <br />
               now before the House. The hon. gentleman, 
               <br />
               I am afraid, has missed his vocation. He 
               <br />
               has missed his Profession. He should have 
               <br />
               been a surgeon because he would have made 
               <br />
               a very skilful one. When I listened to him 
               <br />
               I could not refrain from thinking that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span>

               he pronounced that eulogy, when he uttered
