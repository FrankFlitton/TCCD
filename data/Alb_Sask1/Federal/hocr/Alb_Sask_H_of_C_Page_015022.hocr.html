               so much fault with me. It is well known 
               <br />
               that the late Principal Caven, head of Knox

               near to Sir Oliver Mowat, and was frequent— 
               <br />
               ly consulted by him, and that on matters 
               <br />
               pertaining to the state. It is also a matter 
               <br />
               of history, as stated in the life of the late 
               <br />
               Principal Grant, the head of another Pres-

               Education. That was somewhere in the

               early eighties. There is nothing private 
               <br />
               about that; but the conclusion I wish to 
               <br />
               draw from it is this. If the present premier,

               <br />
               the Catholic Church, what an enormous up— 
               <br />
               roar would be raised in this House, and 
               <br />
               also, I am sorry to say, in some parts of the 
               <br />
               province of Ontario. W’e know that a great

               Now, Mr. Speaker, I will not take up much 
               <br />
               more of the time of the House. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">educer</span> 
               <br />
               tion-al clauses in the Bill are of a very in- 
               <br />
               teresting and important character, and no 
               <br />
               doubt that is why there has been so little 
               <br />
               discussion of the other clauses. The consti- 
               <br />
               tutional question I do not propose to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss. Like the speaker who preceded me, 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Haldimand (Mr. Lalor), 
               <br />
               I do not belong to the legal profession, and 
               <br />
               therefore shall leave constitutional points to 
               <br />
               be discussed by men who are versed in legal 
               <br />
               science. I believe. however, that laymen 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quite</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">{capable</span> of judging from the 
               <br />
               speeches we have had in this House who 
               <br />
               has 'had the best of the argument; and I 
               <br />
               am sure that there is no man in this House, 
               <br />
               who wishes to express an opinion consistent 
               <br />
               with his own conscience and who is not tied 
               <br />
               down by the leader of his party, who will 
               <br />
               say that the weight of the argument on the 
               <br />
               constitutional question has not been on the 
               <br />
               government side. Let me also say that I 
               <br />
               stand up for provincial rights; and if we 
               <br />
               want more evidence that we are doing so 
               <br />
               than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:hon.</span> member for Centre York (Mr. 
               <br />
               Campbell) gave us last night, then we are 
               <br />
               pretty hard to please. I believe he proved
