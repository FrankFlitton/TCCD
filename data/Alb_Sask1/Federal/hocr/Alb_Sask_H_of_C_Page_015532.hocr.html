               <br />
               stituency of Stony Plain. He spoke at some

               length of the population of the constituency 
               <br />
               of Gardston. Now the constituency of Card-

               ston I know probably as well as he does and 
               <br />
               Cardston only gave 640 odd votes at the last

               election, while the district of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stony</span> Plain gave

               <br />
               Plain by producing a map which he says 
               <br />
               shows there are no surveyed lands within 
               <br />
               that constituency. Now the Department of

               the Interior may have made an error, and 
               <br />
