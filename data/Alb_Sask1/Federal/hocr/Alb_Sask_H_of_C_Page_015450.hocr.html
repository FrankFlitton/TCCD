               admitted that the intention of the contract 
               <br />
               was that there should be a twenty years’ 
               <br />
               exemption. Whether the period was to 
               <br />
               run from the date of the contract or from 
               <br />
               the date on which the lands were earned 
               <br />
               does not matter now, for the period has 
               <br />
               expired in either case. If it had been in-

               tended to extend the exemption any longer 
               <br />
               the contract would have so stated. it was 
               <br />
               to be an exemption for twenty years from 
               <br />
               a certain date, now more than twenty years 
               <br />
               ago. And if the exemption is now in force 
               <br />
               on a very large portion of these lands in the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories that is not due to any 
               <br />
               fault or any laxity on the part of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories themselves; it is really due to the 
               <br />
               neglect of the Dominion administration. I 
               <br />
               think that is quite clear. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(the</span> patents had 
               <br />
               been issued to the company immediately, the 
               <br />
               exemption period would have expired by 
               <br />
               this time, and the people of the Northwest 
               <br />
               would have been able to tax this land. It 
               <br />
               becomes the duty of the Dominion govern- 
               <br />
               ment, whose fault it is that the exemption 
               <br />
               still runs, to see to it that that exemption 
               <br />
               is taken away. When I went into that 
               <br />
               country upwards of twenty years ago, one of 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst things I heard was that the odd- 
               <br />
               numbered sections were exempt from tax- 
               <br />
               ation for twenty years. I ﬁrmly believed 
               <br />
               that at the end of the twenty years we 
               <br />
               would be able to call upon the owners of 
               <br />
               the alternate sections to pay their share of 
               <br />
               the necessary expense for carrying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> the 
               <br />
               local government of the country. I speak 
               <br />
               from experience as to this exemption be- 
               <br />
               ing a burden upon the people. I live 
               <br />
               at this time in a section of the country 
               <br />
               where a considerable number of the Can- 
               <br />
               adian Paciﬁc Railway lands have been un- 
               <br />
               disposed of and where there are still areas 
               <br />
               undisposed of, and all the time my taxes 
               <br />
               have been higher on that account than they 
               <br />
               would otherwise have been. For instance, 
               <br />
               I had to pay for school taxes at one time 
               <br />
               nearly twice what I should have had to 
               <br />
               pay it all these lands had been occupied 
               <br />
               by settlers, and the lands would have been 
               <br />
               occupied by settlers, I have little doubt, 
               <br />
               had not it been for the fact that they were 
               <br />
               being held at a price by the Canadian Pa- 
               <br />
               ciﬁc Railway Company. At present I have 
               <br />
               to pay considerably more than I would have 
               <br />
               to pay if these lands had been settled on. 
               <br />
               And the same is true of the local improve- 
               <br />
               ment tax. Every farmer throughout that 
               <br />
               country who settles in a district which the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway lands have not 
               <br />
               been disposed of is exposed to this great 
               <br />
               increase of taxation on account of the ex- 
               <br />
               emption. It has been stated that, in the 
               <br />
               course of time, owing to the sale of lands 
               <br />
               by the company, and also owing to the fact 
               <br />
               that, in any case, within ﬁfteen or twenty 
               <br />
               years the exemption will cease, therefore 
               <br />
               this is a vanishing question. Still, I can- 
               <br />
               not see the reason why even for the next 
               <br />

               country must continue to bear this additional

               burden. The Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               Company have been disposing of consider-

               able portions of their land grants lately. 
               <br />
               But this is frequently done in such a way 
               <br />
               that we are unable to tax the lands they 
               <br />
               thus dispose of. 1 know of one large com- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Dillly</span> which is selling Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway lands, but which claims that it is 
               <br />
               merely acting as agent for the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway Company in this service, 
               <br />
               although I think there can be little doubt 
               <br />
               that it has really taken over the lands from 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. They are 
               <br />
               claiming this exemption and the people in

               although those who purchased and those 
               <br />
               who did not buy their lands from the Cana- 
               <br />
               dian Paciﬁc Railway but from this large 
               <br />
               land corporation. 1 consider that it is in the 
               <br />
               interest of the settling up of that country 
               <br />
               that this exemption of the land grant from 
               <br />
               taxation should be swept away. If there 
               <br />
               were not an exemption the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway Company would certainly 
               <br />
               try to dispose of these lands as quickly 
               <br />
               as they could. But so long as there is 
               <br />
               no taxation to be paid on the lands, 
               <br />
               just so long will they continuue raising 
               <br />
               the price to obtain the highest ﬁgure pos- 
               <br />
               sible. When the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               had a monopoly of the carrying trade in 
               <br />
               the Northwest it was to their interest, as 
               <br />
               it is still in many parts of the country, to 
               <br />
               dispose of these lands as quickly as they 
               <br />
               could. Every new settler they put upon 
               <br />
               the lands brought them an added proﬁt in 
               <br />
               the carrying business which they did for 
               <br />
               them. Some time ago they used to sell the 
               <br />
               lands at a very low ﬁgure in order to prO- 
               <br />
               mote settlement. But in certain parts this 
               <br />
               condition is now changing. The Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway owns lands which are tri- 
               <br />
               butary to some of the new railway corpor- 
               <br />
               ations which are coming in, and it is not 
               <br />
               to the interest of the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway to sacriﬁce those lands when the 
               <br />
               people who buy them will do their carrying 
               <br />
               business through other railways, and natur- 
               <br />
               ally the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway will re- 
               <br />
               tain these lands which are exempt from 
               <br />
               taxes in their possession in hope of a rise. 
               <br />
               I do not wish to suggest that the contract <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway should be

               interfered with in any way. I consnler 
               <br />
               that contract as sacred; but I do hold that 
               <br />
               it is the duty of the Dominion government 
               <br />
               to accept the obligations incurred by‘them-
