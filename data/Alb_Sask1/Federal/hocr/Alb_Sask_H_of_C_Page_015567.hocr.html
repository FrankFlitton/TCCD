               Justice (Mr. Fitzpatrick) will be soon in his

               <br />
               tion I raised before the Railway Committee, 
               <br />
               and perhaps the right hon. leader of the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) will be able 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> tell us exactly what the eifect of the 
               <br />
               change is. In the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> passed last session 
               <br />
               provision was made for the issue of interim 
               <br />
               bonds by the railway company, which bonds 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> to be guaranteed by the government, 
               <br />
               and, in the event of such bonds being issued, 
               <br />
               provision was made for their retirement and 
               <br />
               the substitution for them of permanent 
               <br />
               bonds. It was found——and I think very 
               <br />
               probably it was correctly found—that the 
               <br />
               interim bonds would not serve the purpose. 
               <br />
               I never thought it was a very happy ex- 
               <br />
               pedient, and I think the company are quite 
               <br />
               right in coming to the conclusion that in- 
               <br />
               terim bonds would have been a mistake. 
               <br />
               But the question I raised in the Railway 
               <br />
               Committee was this: The original contract 
               <br />
               was drawn with the view to the issue of 
               <br />
               these interim bonds, which, at the conclu- 
               <br />
               sion of the work, would be replaced by per— 
               <br />
               manent bonds; and when thatsubstitution 
               <br />
               should take place there would necessarily 
               <br />
               be an adjustment of the whole construction 
               <br />
               account. Therefore, the government would 
               <br />
               know, at the end, precisely the amount to 
               <br />
               which its guarantee applies. It will be evi- 
               <br />
               dent to any person at all acquainted with 
               <br />
               such matters that there is always some risk 
               <br />
               in issuing, on progress estimates, interim 
               <br />
               bonds, as the amount may far exceed the 
               <br />
               value of the work as ﬁnally ascertained. 
               <br />
               As I say, I pointed this out in the Railway 
               <br />
               Committee to the Minister of Justice and in 
               <br />
               the presence of the counsel for the railway 
               <br />
               company. It was not disputed. I pointed 
               <br />
               out that it was almost impossible to avoid 
               <br />
               some risk in this respect, because the chief 
               <br />
               engineer of the work was absolutely de- 
               <br />
               pendent upon hls subordinates for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro</span> 
               <br />
               gross report. A young gentleman with very 
               <br />
               little experience might have charge of ten 
               <br />
               miles of some very important portion of the 
               <br />
               work. He, of course, would send in his 
               <br />
               estimates month by month, and the chief 
               <br />
               engineer would have to make up his ac- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">counts</span> on the basis of these reports. With 
               <br />
               every desire 011 the part of each person con- 
               <br />
               cerned to be absolutely correct and honest, 
               <br />
               errors might creep in from time to time. 
               <br />
               These, of course, would be repaired on the 
               <br />
               ﬁnal adjustment. There would be no trouble 
               <br />
               in this under the Act we passed a year ago, 
               <br />
               because, whatever the interim bonds might 
               <br />
               be, the permanent bonds would not issue 
               <br />
               until the account was ﬁnally made up. 
               <br />

               But, finding it inconvenient to issue
