               I made a little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> calculation on

               the post ofﬁces to that which was furnish-

               <br />
               Minister of the Interior. I shall give my 
               <br />
               calculation, and I think you will agree with 
               <br />
               me that I acted very fairly. I found that 
               <br />
               in the constituency of Alberta there were 
               <br />
               forty-six post otlices; in Medicine Hat dis- 
               <br />
               trict, which is to .be added to Alberta, there 
               <br />
               were ten; in Calgary, fifty-four; in Edmonton 
               <br />
               district, sixty, and in Strathcoua, ninety- 
               <br />
               ﬁve. A portion of the Strathcona consti- 
               <br />
               tuency runs south of township 38. I made 
               <br />
               a careful calculation of the votes polled 
               <br />
               north and south of Red Deer in my con- 
               <br />
               stituency, and I concluded that one-ﬁfth 
               <br />
               of my constituency was south of the river. 
               <br />
               Going on that conclusion, the part of 
               <br />
               Strathcona <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituency</span> south of Red Deer 
               <br />
               would have nineteen post ofﬁces. That 
               <br />
               would leave south of Red Deer 129 post 
               <br />
               ofﬁces and north of Red Deer 136 post 
               <br />
               ofﬁces. Although I ani well aware that 
               <br />
               post ofﬁces are not a sure indication of 
               <br />
               population, I submit that in a farming 
               <br />
               country they do indicate Whether that 
               <br />
               country is fairly thickly settled or not. If 
               <br />
               we find in a certain district ten post ofﬁces 
               <br />
               and in another of the same size only tour, 
               <br />
               we would naturally conclude that there 
               <br />
               was a much larger population in the form- 
               <br />
               er than the latter.

               I also claim that the local improvement 
               <br />
               districts that were organized north and south 
               <br />
               of Red Deer are an indication of population, 
               <br />
               although not one that can be entirely relied 
               <br />
               upon. The people are not compelled to form 
               <br />
               local improvement districts, but it’ they do 
               <br />
               form these local improvement districts, they 
               <br />
               spend their own taxes in their own way. If 
               <br />
               they do not form these local improvement 
               <br />
               districts they pay their taxes to the govern-

               <br />
               maJ'ority of the people want to see how 
               <br />
               their taxes are going to be spent, and the 
               <br />
               result is that they have formed these local

               constituency there are 92 schools, in the

               <br />
               there are 234 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools,</span> making a total north 
               <br />
               of Red Deer of 326. South of Red Deer 
               <br />
               we have in Alberta constituency 74 schools, 
               <br />
               in Calgary district 116 schools, in part of 
               <br />
               Strathcona south of Red Deer 58 schools and 
               <br />
               in Medicine Hat district 20 schools, making 
               <br />
               a total of 268—326 schools north of Red 
               <br />
               Deer and 268 south of Red Deer. I believe 
               <br />
               I am correct in saying that that corresponds 
               <br />
