               ference to government publications such as

               tice of many other members of this House 
               <br />
               to have an understanding with the post- 
               <br />
               masters in the rural districts by which 
               <br />
               they would place these documents on the 
               <br />
               counters of their stores, so that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farmers</span> 
               <br />
               coming to the post ofﬁce could take copies 
               <br />
               if they desired. The postmasters were 
               <br />
               quite willing to do this, and it was a 
               <br />
               great convenience to the members of the 
               <br />
               House as well as to the agricultural com- 
               <br />
               munity. The circular of the 15th of April 
               <br />
               referred to in the letter which I have read 
               <br />
               appears to have contained instructions that 
               <br />
               postmasters must not continue this practice. 
               <br />
               I made an effort to see this latter circular 
               <br />
               and I telephoned to the Deputy Postmaster 
               <br />
               General—the Postmaster General being 
               <br />
               absent—and he informed me that the cir- 
               <br />
               cular being a departmental matter it could 
               <br />
               not be seen. For this reason I am unaware 
               <br />
               of its actual contents. We know that the 
               <br />
               corridors of this House are piled up with 
               <br />
               reports that involve too much work for the 
               <br />
               members to send out in separate envelopes. 
               <br />
               and it would seem to me that the practice 
               <br />
               to which I 'have referred of distributing 
               <br />
               them through the medium of the rural post- 
               <br />
               masters, is a practice that ought to be 
               <br />
               encouraged rather than prevented. At all 
               <br />
               events I am unable to see what right the 
               <br />
               inspector had to ask the postmaster to ﬁnd 
               <br />
               out what was in the mail parcel that I for- 
               <br />
               warded from this House. I presume he 
               <br />
               may have been looking for such infringe- 
               <br />
               ments as hon. gentlemen are said to have 
               <br />
               been guilty of in the past in sending out 
               <br />
               advertisements. &amp;c., but there should be 
               <br />
               other ways of ﬁnding that out without 
               <br />
               violating the secrecy of the mails. It seems 
               <br />
               to me that this letter should not have been 
               <br />
               sent out by the post <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oliice</span> inspector. I 
               <br />
               draw the attention of the government to 
               <br />
               the matter with the expectation that some 
               <br />
               explanation will be given. I may say that 
               <br />
               we do not hold the postmasters responsible 
               <br />
               for the distribution of mail matter sent in 
               <br />
               this way ; we merely send each postmaster 
               <br />
               a private letter asking him to place this 
               <br />
               departmental literature on the counter of 
               <br />
               his store if he has no objection, and I can- 
               <br />
               not see what harm there can be in that.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. When the subject 
               <br />
               was last discussed, I think the Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice informed us that the clauses would 
               <br />
               be taken up in the order stiggested from 
               <br />
               this side. Is that the understanding of the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman, or will he give us an‘ 
               <br />
