               discussion of this Bill. People will have 
               <br />
               different opinions on the legal situation, and

               <br />
               highest tribunal of the empire—the Judicial 
               <br />
               Committee of the Privy Council. It was 
               <br />
               stated by the hon. member for East Toronto 
               <br />
               that this legislation is ultra vires of the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada. If it is it is invalid, 
               <br />
               and the provincial governments need pay 
               <br />
               no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> to it. It is said: Why not 
               <br />
               take this matter to the Judicial Committee 
               <br />
               of the Privy Council and get their decision 
               <br />
               as to the legality of this measure ? That is 
               <br />
               not necessary. We are proposing to pass 
               <br />
               legislation which we believe to be intra 
               <br />
               vires of this parliament. If it is ultra vires, 
               <br />
               the provinces can ignore it; if it is intra 
               <br />
               vires, then I submit it is the proper legis- 
               <br />
               lation to pass, the only legislation which 
               <br />
               we can honestly and in fair play pass when 
               <br />
               we are creating these new provinces.

               I wish to say, in the outset, that I have 
               <br />
               always been and am now opposed to the 
               <br />
               principle of separate schools. At no time 
               <br />
               in my life did I ever hold the opinion that 
               <br />
               it was desirable to have a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools in this country. From my boyhood 
               <br />
               days until the present moment I have had 
               <br />
               the same feeling; and if I did not believe 
               <br />
               that it was the hounden duty of this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment, in keeping faith with the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest under the provisions of the 
               <br />
               constitution, to pass the legislation which 
               <br />
               the government are asking parliament to 
               <br />
               pass, I would be prepared to vote against 
               <br />
               the government’s Bill. I think it would be 
               <br />
               well to consider for a few moments how it 
               <br />
               happens that we have got separate schools 
               <br />
               in Canada. We have had petitions pouring 
               <br />
               into this parliament against the provisions 
               <br />
               of this Bill. We have had petitions very 
               <br />
               largely from the Loyal Orange lodges of the 
               <br />

               it is that we have separate schools in Upper 
               <br />
               Canada—the province of Ontario. I was old 
               <br />
               enough in 1862 and 1863, when the separate 
               <br />
               school agitation ﬁrst arose in Upper Can- 
               <br />
               ada, to know that every Omngeman in Up- 
               <br />
               per Canada supported the Conservative party 
               <br />
               and the separate school proposal.
