               wisely. consulting with every unit of the

               and we are bound to take the reason in a 
               <br />
               parliamentary sense—that the hon. gentle-

               man is retiring because he could not ﬁnd it

               think. by any member of this House that

               there is a reasonable doubt as to whether or 
               <br />
               not that was the cause of the resignation, as 
               <br />
               to whether the deliberate actions of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister and the rest of the Cabinet 
               <br />
               heretofore have not made it quite abundant- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ly</span> apparent that it was the intention to get

               rid of the hon. gentleman whether he got 
               <br />
               out on this particular clause of the Bill or 
               <br />
               on some other. The Prime Minister has not 
               <br />
               quite satisﬁed the curiosity of the House. 
               <br />
               Outside of the information which was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com</span>

               veyed to us by the bulletin boards there are

               other rumours which are abroad in the cor-

               ridors of this House, abroad on the streets 
               <br />

               the wires. which stretch from Ottawa to dif- 
               <br />
               ferent parts of this country even now while 
               <br />
               we are speaking. And why? It is stated 
               <br />
               that another important minister, another 
               <br />
               important member of the cabinet of the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman, is deliberating as to whether 
               <br />
               he shall not follow in the tracks—n0, I would 
               <br />
               not put it that way—but follow, at least, the 
               <br />
               example of the hon. the Minister of the In— 
               <br />
               terior who has retired, in also expressing his 
               <br />
               formal and unqualiﬁed dissent from this 
               <br />
               Bill. There might be some reasons which 
               <br />
               would impose on us the idea that there is 
               <br />
               truth in that. I could hardly reconcile to 
               <br />
               my own mind the idea of 11 Prime Minister 
               <br />
               and a cabinet undertaking to frame and to 
               <br />
               put before the country so important a Bill 
               <br />
               as this, involving no trivial and unimportant 
               <br />
               ﬁnancial burdens, but involving very oner- 
               <br />
               ous and continuous and growing ﬁnancial 
               <br />
               burdens upon this country, I cannot, I say. 
               <br />
               understand how a Bill of that kind could 
               <br />
               be conceived, put into form and introduced 
               <br />

               ernment? The other day the right hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman said I was quixotic. Well, there is 
               <br />
               this at least to be said about Don Quixote. 
               <br />
               that he was a country gentleman, a man of 
               <br />
               high honour and that he died with good 
               <br />

               <br />
               late Minister of the Interior has confessed 
               <br />
               here that in this House on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Monday</span> of this 
               <br />
               week when I asked where was the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and the right hon. gentleman 
               <br />
