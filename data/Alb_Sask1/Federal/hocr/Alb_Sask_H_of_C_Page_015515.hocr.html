               it advisable to look also for other informa-

               lation relatively between place and place, 
               <br />
               because, in this matter of distribution, the 
               <br />
               one principle that must guide us is that 
               <br />
               no injustice shall be done to one as com- 
               <br />
               pared with another. Well then, we have 
               <br />
               given the population and in conﬁrmation of 
               <br />
               that we have given the number of post 
               <br />
               olﬁces. That goes for what it is worth. 
               <br />
               It is not absolute; it is only approximate.

               Mr. Walter Scott, M.P., are frequently heard.

               Both these latter gentlemen would be equal in

               Has this distribution of constituencies had 
               <br />
               any relation to the selection of the two 
               <br />
               premiers. Gossip is busy with it. Perhaps 
               <br />
               no political considerations entered into the 
               <br />
               calculation, but if they did we should have 
               <br />
               an explanation. In the old days when the 
               <br />
               constituencies were distributed, gentlemen 
               <br />
               of one political stripe sat down and carved 
               <br />
               up the country to suit themselves. Will the 
               <br />
               government tell us all the reasons that in- 
               <br />
               ﬂuenced them in laying out these constitu-
