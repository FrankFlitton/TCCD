               stand for provincial rights to-day. Ever

               <br />
               me say at the outset of my remarks, which 
               <br />
               I hope will be brief, that having but slight 
               <br />
               experience as a debater, having no legal 
               <br />
               training whatever. I being a physician, and 
               <br />
               having but a very imperfect command of 
               <br />
               the English language, I feel that I must 
               <br />
               crave the indulgence of the House. This 
               <br />
               subject is one which should be approached 
               <br />
               with a deep sentiment of patriotism, and 
               <br />
               with the spirit which animated the illus- 
               <br />
               trious fathers of confederation when they 
               <br />
               met to endeavour to devise a scheme under 
               <br />

               <br />
               in North America might live together 
               <br />
               in union, happiness and prosperity. It 
               <br />
               should be gratifying to every true Canadian 
               <br />
               that in the evolution of our national history 
               <br />
               we are in this Canadian parliament to—day

               provinces in our splendid Northwest domain. 
               <br />
               The Northwest Territories were discovered 
               <br />

               <br />
               venturers chieﬂy. Thirty years ago these 
               <br />
               Territories had a population of only 500 
               <br />
               white people, and it is claimed to-day (and 
               <br />
               the claim is well founded) that these Terri- 
               <br />
               tories are now settled by 500,000 frugal, 
               <br />

               to enjoy the full privileges of statehood and 
               <br />
               self-government. The years of 1903 and 
               <br />
               1905 will go down in Canadian history as
