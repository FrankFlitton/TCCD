               In other words the hon. Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance in 1896 said: Sacriﬁce principle to

               keep our party in power and there can be

               little wonder, of course, that to-day he has

               grows he will not bind himself to adhere

               There is one thing about this speech

               which claims the admiration even of the

               friends of the present administration, and 
               <br />
               it is, that the lion. member for North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tor:</span>

               onto was making a splendid effort to in-

               duce his party to stand together. He did 
               <br />
               it cleverly; I give him all possible credit 
               <br />
