               Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the imposi-

               <br />
               a constitutional right under section 93 to

               <br />
               this House has been daily deluged during

               lutely must be decided, and the decision

               <br />
               point to any such decision, our difficulties 
               <br />
               would be removed; but in the absence of 
               <br />
               any such decision it appears to me to be 
               <br />
               child’s play to force these Bills through this 
               <br />
               parliament without any decision upon that 
               <br />
               subject. We have to look to the future of 
               <br />
               our great country. It appears to me, Mr. 
               <br />
               Speaker, that we need not inquire with too 
               <br />
               great nicety whether by possibility this 
               <br />
               parliament may have the power to enact 
               <br />
               legislation such as that now submitted be- 
               <br />
               cause Canada is under no obligation, moral, 
               <br />
               legal or other, to any one. to experiment 
               <br />
               with her constitution. If doubts do exist on 
               <br />
               that score. and they do exist. then I say 
               <br />
               it would be our legal duty, our duty in 
               <br />
               justice and in equity to give full force 
               <br />
               to the doctrine of provincial rights leaving 
               <br />
               the new provinces educationally absolutely 
               <br />
               free. A free people may be trusted to 
               <br />
               be both just and generous. A restricted 
               <br />
               people will probably act as Manitoba acted. 
               <br />
               Having pointed out. Mr. Speaker, the 
               <br />
               dicta of a number of the members of the 
               <br />
               cabinet it plainly appears that they fail- 
               <br />
               ed to agree in their views upon this school

               question, except as to the necessity of 
               <br />
               saving this government. But, is it not 
               <br />
               possible, Mr. Speaker, that we may ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the true reason why the government insists 
               <br />
               upon forcing separate schools upon the new
