               word with regard to this ‘ yellow dog’ mat- 
               <br />
               ter. I hold no brief for the Halifax 
               <br />
               ‘Chronicle’ and have had nothing to do with 
               <br />
               it for nearly a quarter of a century. It has 
               <br />
               not always agreed with the government and 
               <br />
               too often, as it seemed to me, it was mis- 
               <br />
               taken in its course. But I must say that 
               <br />
               the statement quoted by the hon. gentle- 
               <br />

               warrant whatever for the interpretation put 
               <br />
               upon it. W'hether those statements are 
               <br />
               reasonable and proper criticisms of public 
               <br />
               affairs is a matter for consideration by 
               <br />
               those interested. But I contend that the 
               <br />
               references to the Orange body are made by 
               <br />
               the hon. gentlemen who have spoken and 
               <br />
               not a word has been quoted from the news-

               tics, his jumping up and down, his hat-lift— 
               <br />
               ing and hand—ﬂinging, I have never had any 
               <br />
               feeling but one of quiet contempt, until, in 
               <br />
               a moment of weakness, I confess, I did feel 
               <br />
               annoyed at what was said. I say that no 
               <br />
               gentleman would have referred to me in

               <br />

               Mr. LALOR. It is not my intention to 
               <br />
               delay the House at great length, but I must 
               <br />
               express my opinion of some of the remarks 
               <br />
               that have been made here and of the con- 
               <br />
               duct of a portion of the members of this 
               <br />
               House. I am a new member, and I must 
               <br />
               say that I am surprised that the business of 
               <br />
               the House is conducted in the manner in 
               <br />
               which it is. One might think himself to 
               <br />
               be in a bear-garden to see the antics and 
               <br />
               observe the tactics of gentlemen on the 
               <br />
               opposite side of this House. What we have 
               <br />
               observed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tonight</span> is not unusual because 
               <br />
               we have seen the same kind of thing day 
               <br />
               after day, and especially when the hon. 
               <br />
               member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) at- 
               <br />
               tempts to speak. I think it most unfair to that 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman. I have listened carefuly 
               <br />
               to him while he was speaking and I have 
               <br />
               never heard him say anything but what 
               <br />
               must be regarded as fair, moderate and 
               <br />
               tolerant towards people of all shades of 
               <br />
               opinion. I have watched from time to time, 
               <br />
               knowing the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.position</span> he occupies, to see if 
               <br />
               he would say anything that could be con- 
               <br />
               strued as other than fair and courteous to 
               <br />
               those of other religious denominations than 
               <br />
               that to which he belongs. But,- I must say 
               <br />
               truthfully that I have failed to ﬁnd any- 
               <br />
