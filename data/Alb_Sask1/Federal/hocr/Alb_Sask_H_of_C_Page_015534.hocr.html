               Mr. OLIVER. Well, I did not intend to 
               <br />
               answer him in that way. In regard to ex- 
               <br />
               perimental farms, may I suggest to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Calgary that there have‘ been 
               <br />
               applications, and very proper applications, 
               <br />
               before the Department of Agriculture to my 
               <br />
               knowledge ever since 1896 for the estab—

               <br />
               sents, and I do not think it is any discredit 
               <br />
               to the district that it should be so. The 
               <br />
               experimental farm at Indian Head is situ- 
               <br />
               ated in a farming district, than which there 
               <br />
               is no better on this continent. And why is 
               <br />
               it any discredit to the agricultural capabili- 
               <br />
               ties of either the Edmonton or the Peace

               <br />
               be anxious for the establishment of an ex— 
               <br />
               perimental farm ? My hon. friend (Mr. M. 
               <br />
               S. McCarthy) is driven to hard straits in

               the agricultural capabilities of a country that 
               <br />
               is not subject to be discredited by the source
