               in this interview which I might comment

               upon. It is quite evident from the explan-

               vious to all, that this interview was not a

               public discussion, it was merely a friendly 
               <br />
               conversation between two gentlemen who 
               <br />
               had met together to discuss a question 
               <br />
               which they had previously discussed. Now, 
               <br />
               my hon. friend has hinted, or has attempted 
               <br />
               to create the impression, that the govern-

               <br />
               motives with regard to the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba. and that we refused to extend 
               <br />
               her boundaries because we wished to punish 
               <br />
               the province of Manitoba for having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abolish»</span> 
               <br />
               ed separate schools. To establish his point 
               <br />
               he quotes a statement in a Quebec news- 
               <br />
               paper. thc ‘Soleil.’ which is a newspaper 
               <br />

               Sir, it is very strange that whenever a 
               <br />
               newspaper friendly to the, government says 
               <br />
               something which the hon. gentleman thinks 
               <br />
               is favourable to themselves. he at once 
               <br />

               sible, for instance, for the attitude of the 
               <br />

               <br />
               and it took place on the 17th of February.

               There were present a subcommittee of coun-

               bell. When that conference took place, the

               decision of this government was already 
               <br />
               known. We had stated what we would do.

               after conference. The policy of the gov-

               ernment was thus determined, and could

               not be affected by anything that might

               <br />
               hon. friend (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11.</span> L. Borden) wants to 
               <br />
               know whether or not there was any ques- 
               <br />
               tion between the government of Canada and 
               <br />
               Monseigneur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S‘barretti</span> as to the extension 
               <br />
               of the boundaries of Manitoba. As I said a 
               <br />
               moment ago, I have not seen the state- 
               <br />
               ment of His Excellency,—I have not read it 
               <br />
               critically—but the answer to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend’s question he already has before him- 
               <br />
               he has only to read that statement. He 
               <br />
               has read it, and in it he ﬁnds that Monsei- 
               <br />

               <br />
               ernment had nothing at all to do with his 
               <br />
               own action. That ought to suit the purpose 
               <br />
               of my hon. friend and ought to convince 
               <br />
               him that he cannot make any political cap- 
               <br />
               ital on that line. I have only to refer to 
               <br />
               the words of Monseigneur Sharretti when 
               <br />
               he says himself—and his words are in the
