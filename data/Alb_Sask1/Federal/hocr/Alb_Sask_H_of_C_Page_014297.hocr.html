               They have attempted to make this House

               believe that under this amendment it is

               Mr. M. S. MCCARTHY. You will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that this amended Act does not preserve 
               <br />
               the administration. it simply preserves these

               ordinances. and all there is in these ordin-
