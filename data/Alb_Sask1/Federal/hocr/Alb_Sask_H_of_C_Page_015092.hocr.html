               question; as a representative of the city of 
               <br />
               Toronto, I regret to have heard in this House 
               <br />
               on more than one occasion references made 
               <br />
               to that city which I think were highly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">un»</span> 
               <br />
               fair. I submit, Sir, that the language was 
               <br />
               unparliameutary, it certainly was untrue, 
               <br />
               in which Toronto was referred to as being 
               <br />
               a hot-bed of bigotry and intolerance. This 
               <br />
               remark was made by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Guysborough (Mr. Sinclair) by the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for North Ontario (Mr. Grant) and I 
               <br />
               think by other hon. gentlemen opposite. I 
               <br />
               myself stand here in this parliament as a 
               <br />
               living protest against that statement, be- 
               <br />
               ing a member of the minority, not only the 
               <br />
               minority in this country, but the minority 
               <br />
               in the city of Toronto, where there is a dis— 
               <br />
               parity of about ﬁve or six to one in the rid- 
               <br />
               ing which I represent and some ten to one 
               <br />
               throughout the whole city; and I think 
               <br />
               it fair to say that that city is not bigoted 
               <br />
               and intolerant, which elected me in the face 
               <br />
               of the opposition of two governments, the 
               <br />
               late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Ross</span> government and this government. 
               <br />
               I am not complaining of that. for we 
               <br />
               have to face opposition in the politi- 
               <br />
               cal world as in other departments of 
               <br />
               life; but I an] placing on record the 
               <br />
               fact that in the face of the opposition 
               <br />
               of these two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">governments,</span> I a Roman (‘n- 
               <br />
               tholic, was elected by a very substantial 
               <br />
               majority in a constituency where there 
               <br />
               were some ten thousand votes on the list, 
               <br />
               about two thousand of which were Catholic 
               <br />
               votes; and I attribute that to the fair- 
               <br />
               ness, the liberaiity and the toleration of 
               <br />
               my non-Catholic brethren, my friends and 
               <br />
               neighbours in the city of Toronto. I will 
               <br />
               go further : I will say that hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               opposite found the city of Toronto not a 
               <br />
               bigoted place in 1896. I recollect the hon. 
               <br />
               Postmaster General (Sir William Mulock') 
               <br />
               coming there as the representative of the 
               <br />
               present premier of this country to attend 
               <br />
               a public meeting, and expressing senti- 
               <br />
               ments and opinions which were then in 
               <br />
               accord with the public sentiment of that 
               <br />
               city. He took advantage of that public 
               <br />
               sentiment, and his government took advant- 
               <br />
               age of it then and have taken advantage of 
               <br />
               it ever since. I will go further, and will 
               <br />
               quote an authority. I think no hon. member 
               <br />
               of this House, either present or past, can be 
               <br />
               regarded as a more representative exponent 
               <br />
               of the French Canadian race than the late 
               <br />
               member for L’Islet, the Hon. Mr. Tarte; 
               <br />
               and when he on more than one occasion, as 
               <br />
               one of the ministers of the Crown, visited 
               <br />
               that city, he was always given a most hand- 
               <br />
               some and cordial reception, and he is on 
               <br />
               record as saying that there was no place 
               <br />
               which he had greater pleasure in visiting 
               <br />
               than the city of Toronto, to make new 
               <br />
               acquaintances and to renew old ones. And 
               <br />
               if the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'Labelle</span> (Mr, Bour- 
               <br />
               assa) comes to Toronto, notwithstanding 
               <br />
               all the heat there may be over the discus- 
               <br />
               sion of this question, I will promise him a

               I ventured a moment ago to say that the 
               <br />
               question of the legality of the Bill now 
               <br />
               before the House was purely a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutional</span> 
               <br />
               question. That Bill, as now framed, is, in 
               <br />
               my opinion, a direct invasion of the provin- 
               <br />
               cial prerogative in regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the-matters</span> 
               <br />
               therein contained, those more especially 
               <br />
               which are referred to in the amendment of 
               <br />
               the hon. leader of the opposition. We have 
               <br />
               to see in what way this parliament is em- 
               <br />
               powered to pass an Act creating two new 
               <br />
               provinces. These provinces are 'being creat- 
               <br />
               ed or erected under the Act of 1871. What 
               <br />
               does that Act say ? By section 4 it gives 
               <br />
               plenary powers to this parliament to admin- 
               <br />
               ister the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affairs</span> of those districts so long 
               <br />
               as they are territories; but when they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> 
               <br />
               to be created into provinces, we have to 
               <br />
               look to section :2, which is the authority 
               <br />
               under which these provinces are now being 
               <br />
               created. It is unnecessary for me to read 
               <br />
               that section to the House, which is already 
               <br />
               familiar with it. I desire to refer for a 
               <br />
               moment to the correspondence that took 
               <br />
               place regarding the passing of this imperial

               some that the powers vested in the Do-

               minion by this Act are what are called plen-

               framers of this Act, what was the view they

               had in mind when it was being framed and 
               <br />

               <br />
