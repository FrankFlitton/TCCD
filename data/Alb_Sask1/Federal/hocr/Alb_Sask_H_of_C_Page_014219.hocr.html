               <br />
               up a basis of compromise. It will be found in 
               <br />
               the sessional papers of this House. The 
               <br />
               terms were submitted to the leading men

               ciple should be yielded without full con-

               was approved by him. That compromise

               was carried into legislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eifect.</span> It does

               this question which is before the House at

               tial compromise on the general principle 
               <br />

               view. I thought that some compromise 
               <br />
               should be made. My colleagues in the gov-

               Mr. Speaker,—and this is an observation I

               desire to commend to the attention of the

               House—there were very very few people 
               <br />
               who said, no compromise. And why was 
               <br />
               it that so few people then opposed the com- 
               <br />
               promise ? It was because the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gav</span> 
               <br />
               nada had been ﬁghting about this ques-

               <br />
               of the contest, and desired that there should 
               <br />
               be a compromise of some kind so that 
               <br />
               they might have peace. More than that, 
               <br />
               the material progress of this country 
               <br />
               had been stopped. My hon. friend from

               that the Manitoba school question paralys-

               ed governmental activity for a considerable 
               <br />
               length of time. The members of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment practically did nothing else ; they 
               <br />
               could do nothing else but attend to the 
               <br />
               agitation and difﬁculties that arose out of 
               <br />
               this question. When a question of this 
               <br />
               kind has to be met it has to be met in a

               Mr. SIFTON. The principle was embodied 
               <br />
               in the compromise that wherever there was 
               <br />
               a certain number of Catholic children 
               <br />
               there should be a Catholic teacher. In that 
               <br />
               way it goes farther than the compromise- 
               <br />
               we have here. I cannot from memory give 
               <br />
               the exact ﬁgures but in a rural district 
               <br />
               there was a certain number of children called 
               <br />
               for and in a town a larger number was 
               <br />
               called for, and wherever a certain number 
               <br />
               of Catholic children attended a school then, 
               <br />
               for each unit of that number, a Catholic tea~ 
               <br />
               cher was required to be employed. Further, 
               <br />
               a provision we inserted that the children 
               <br />
               should, where the rooms in the school 
               <br />
               house permitted it, be divided up at half- 
               <br />
               past three for the purpose of having relig-
