               do everything he wanted to do. but did as 
               <br />
               much as he could. why he did not impress 
               <br />
               upon my right hon. friend the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deSirabllity</span> 
               <br />
               of keeping the Bill intact as it was intro- 
               <br />
               duced. I am now speaking about clause 
               <br />
               16. We have heard a great deal about that 
               <br />
               clause. It was that clause which brought 
               <br />
               about the resignation of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Brandon (Mr. Sifton), and we have 
               <br />
               heard a great many speeches about the posi- 
               <br />
               tion taken with regard to the same clause 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend the Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4</span> Finance 
               <br />
               (Mr. Fielding) and some other ministers 
               <br />
               whose names were not mentioned. I do 
               <br />
               not propose to discuss why the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman the First Minister did not wait for 
               <br />
               the arrival of the member for Brandon 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton) or the Minister of Finance (Mr. 
               <br />
               Fielding) before bringing in his Bill. That 
               <br />
               is none of my business. I take it for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">granted</span> that when the government came 
               <br />
               down on the 2lst February and put before 
               <br />
               the House of Commons a project of law, 
               <br />
               that measure was the result of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delib-</span> 
               <br />
               erations of the Dominion cabinet. And I 
               <br />
               repeat that I listened with pleasure to the 
               <br />
               speech of my right hon. friend when he in- 
               <br />
