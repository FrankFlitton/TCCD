               Mr. Ross saw in 1881, if the exemptions 
               <br />
               were made an item of the contract. that 
               <br />
               when provinces were created it would be 
               <br />
               improper and unjust to leave them saddled 
               <br />
               with the burden of the exemptions. Mr. 
               <br />
               Blake in 1881 declared that the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>

               the Northwest would be less than men it 
               <br />
               they suffered such a limitation upon their 
               <br />
               autonomy to exist. In January, 1905, when

               this year, I took the position that if it was

               <br />

               might be found of obtaining relinquishment 
               <br />
               by the company of the provincial exemption 
               <br />
               rights. The Prime Minister intimated to 
               <br />
               11‘0 his recognition that these exemptions. 
               <br />
               both Dominion and provincial. would have

               Mr. SCOTT. You can have your own 
               <br />
               opinion about that. The Prime Minister 
               <br />

               new provinces. Is it unnecessary? I say 
               <br />
               it is no more unnecessary than your section 
               <br />
               ‘23. Section 23 does not say that the pro-

               <br />

               <br />
               these Bills. but section 16 of the contract 
               <br />
               of 1881 which imposes the limitation. Sec- 
               <br />
               tion 23 merely states that the provinces are 
               <br />
               subject to that contract—to the degree that 
               <br />
               the contract is good or bad in legality or 
               <br />
               constitutionality, weak or strong, doubtful 
               <br />
               or perfect, to that degree the provinces are 
               <br />
               bound. If you deem it proper and impera-

               <br />
               that their autonomy has been invaded by a
