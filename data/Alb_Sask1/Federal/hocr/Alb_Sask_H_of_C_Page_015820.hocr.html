               the purview of section 93 of the British 
               <br />

               small concession. and it seems to be very 
               <br />
               reasonable. Everybody has heard on the

               <br />
               have been struck with the fact that all the

               members of the Northwest Territories, whe- 
               <br />

               <br />
               have expressed a pride in their school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sys‘</span> 
               <br />
               tem, because it provides both for national 
               <br />
               schools so far as secular instruction is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, and it acknowledges the rights of 
               <br />
               conscience for those who think that there 
               <br />
               should be religious instruction in schools. 
               <br />

               <br />
               from them. I would follow in this matter 
               <br />
               the example of old Scotland. of England, 
               <br />
               and also of that land from which we have 
               <br />
               many traditions. I think it is a proper

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing:</span> that. pari passu with secular educa-

               <br />

               <br />
               but he is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> this amendment. because

               he would leave that matter altogether to 
               <br />
               the province todeal with as it pleases. Well. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">511'.</span> we have discussed this point and the 
               <br />
               House has pronounced upon it. I appeal 
               <br />
               to the fair and calm judgment of the House 
               <br />
               if this is not a reasonable amendment. which 
               <br />
               does not interfere with the conscience of 
               <br />
               any man. It is merely carrying out the 111-

               Labelle has made this matter very plain 
               <br />
               and after my hon. friend from Beauharnols 
               <br />
               has made a very able argument in regard 
               <br />
               to it. These are little matters of party 
               <br />
               tactics, but I trust that my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice does not suppose for one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               moment that we. are so absolutely blind as 
               <br />
               to be misled by a little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by~play</span> of that kind. 
               <br />
               It is not paying us any compliment at all 
               <br />
               to suppose that we are misled by anything 
               <br />
               so transparent. because every one under- 
               <br />
               stands it perfectly. Now, I understand 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exactly</span> what is intended ,and if you accept

               the principle there is a great deal to be

               said in favour of the proposal. But my

               hon. friend from Labellc made that so ab- 
               <br />
               solutely clear last night that I need not say 
               <br />
               very much. The point reduced to a few 
               <br />
               words. is simply this: <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> are dealing with

               <br />
               in the district has certain rights in respect 
               <br />
               to religious instruction. but the minority 
               <br />
               where it is the majority in a school dis- 
               <br />
               trict, has not the constitutional guarantee 
               <br />
               of its rights. If I understand the point 
               <br />
               made by my hon. friend from Beauharnois 
               <br />
               and my hon. friend from Labelle that is 
               <br />
               what they brought to the attention of the 
               <br />
               committee. This amendment is intended to 
               <br />
               cover that. It not only seems to cover that, 
               <br />
               but a great deal more. I will point that 
               <br />
               out to my right hon. friend the leader of the 
               <br />
               gOVernment and my hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice and we will see if they do not 
               <br />
               agree with me. Will my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice do me the kindness, be- 
               <br />
               cause we cannot always have these matters 
               <br />
               immediately in our minds. to look for one
