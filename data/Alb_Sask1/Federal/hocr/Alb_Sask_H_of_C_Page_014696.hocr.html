               owing to the attitude taken by the Liberals

               the attitude taken by the Liberals in the prO-

               they have broken. Let us go back to their 
               <br />
               pledges in regard to the legislative council. 
               <br />
               They said to the people in that province: 
               <br />
               Abolish the legislative council and your 
               <br />
               rights will be protected. They had no sooner 
               <br />
               got the minority in that province to consent 
               <br />
               to the abolition of the legislative council of 
               <br />
               Manitoba than they started to do away 
               <br />
               with the rights which the minority had 
               <br />
               in that province. That was the ﬁrst trou- 
               <br />
               b‘le. That occurred in 1890. We next 
               <br />
               hear of this trouble coming up in our Dom- 
               <br />
               inion parliament in 1892 again in 1894 and 
               <br />
               I shall refer in a moment to the debates 
               <br />
               which took place in those years in this 
               <br />
               House. -I am not saying that it was the

               Manitoba trouble which came <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upIin</span> 1892 or 
               <br />
               1894, but I do say that the trouble which 
               <br />
               took place in the province of Manitoba in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1590</span> led to the trouble which afterwards 
               <br />
               arose in 1892 and 1894, and was largely 
               <br />
               responsible for the agitation which we had 
               <br />
               in the province of Ontario, an agitation 
               <br />
               which I am bound to say did so great 
               <br />
               01 edit to our province, an agitation however, 
               <br />
               in which the Protestants were not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unreaA</span> 
               <br />
               sonable; they were fair as was shown by 
               <br />
               the result of that agitation. Now let me 
               <br />
               refer to a statement that was made by the 
               <br />
               late Sir John Thompson during the debate in 
               <br />
               1892. He said : 
               <br />
               
            </p>

               One other important characteristic was to be 
               <br />
               considered in regard to the Territories while 
               <br />
               they were to remain in the Territorial condi— 
               <br />
               tion, and that was in view of the peculiar cir- 
               <br />
               cumstances of the Territories, the fact that we 
               <br />
               were inviting all races, creeds and denomina— 
               <br />
               tions, there was to be the widest toleration

               while the Territories existed.

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               That was the corner stone of the whole ; the 
               <br />
               corner stone which the hon. member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sim:</span>

               ground that there can be he good reason given 
               <br />
               for its existence. As the hon. leader of the 
               <br />
               opposition has said to-night, no man knew 
               <br />
               better than those who were engaged in framing 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875, the difﬁculties which sectarian 
               <br />
               disputes might create in that new country. No 
               <br />
               one realized better the fact, that in so far as 
               <br />
               the population was to be gathered into the 
               <br />
               Territories from the older provinces, it was to 
               <br />
               be gathered from diﬂerent races, and from 
               <br />
               amongst men who had strong lines of difference 
               <br />
               as regards religious belief. While the popula- 
               <br />
               tion should be going in there, and while the 
               <br />

               at least, there was to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'be</span> the broadest tolera-

               tion for every belief, and for the races, as re~

               tories will ask for admission and be entitled 
               <br />
               by their population and position to have this 
               <br />
               clause enacted, then this parliament would be 
               <br />
               bound to repeal the law, otherwise we should 
               <br />
               be, as I say, riveting the system of separate 
               <br />
               Schools upon them. This point I think a most 
               <br />
               important one.

               There was a long discussion in regard to 
               <br />
               the motion of the late Dalton McCarthy to 
               <br />
               give the power to the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               to abolish their system of separate schools, 
               <br />
               but the position taken by Sir John Thomp— 
               <br />
               son was as I have just read and we know 
               <br />
               the result of the vote. The vote was 114 to 
               <br />
               21. It was considered not wise to change 
               <br />
               the conditions that existed in those Territor- 
               <br />
               ies and why ? Largely because in 1875 
               <br />
               when the Northwest Territories Act was 
               <br />
               framed, it was conceded that we were put- 
               <br />
               ting this clause in so that the people who 
               <br />
               were coming into those Territories might 
               <br />
               know exactly what the laws would be in 
               <br />
               the Territories in regard .to their schools. 
               <br />
               It is suggested now by some that we wipe 
               <br />
               out these rights absolutely. It is suggested 
               <br />
               by others that we leave it entirely to the 
               <br />
               provinces to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deal,</span> with; but the position 
               <br />
               taken as I say in 1894 was that it was wise 
               <br />
               to leave it just as it stood at that time, and 
               <br />
               when the provinces were to be created the
