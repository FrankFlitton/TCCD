               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               is altogether too hasty in his conclusions. I 
               <br />
               am sorry to say that my portfolio has not

               wise I would have been prepared to show

               the number of votes cast in each constitu- 
               <br />
               enc’y at the last election, and how many 
               <br />
               were cast in the proposed constituencies. In

               the meantime I will endeavour to give some 
               <br />
               information to the committee. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has asked me what are the con- 
               <br />
               stituencies which are to remain as they 
               <br />
               have been. Well, ﬁrst of all the constitu- 
               <br />
               ency of Medicine Hat is about the same as 
               <br />
               it was before. Medicine Hat was in the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Saskatchewan, now the greater 
               <br />
               portion of it is in the district of Alberta. It 
               <br />
               is larger by a few miles. The constituency 
               <br />
               Cardston is j'ust the same as it has been. 
               <br />
               Lethbridge is exactly the same as it was 
               <br />
               before. Macleod is divided into two, as it 
               <br />
               was one of the largest districts in the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories. So we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> now the con- 
               <br />
               stituencies of Macleod and Pincher. High 
               <br />
               River is the same as it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before,</span> exactly 
               <br />
               the same. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Band?</span> is a little larger than it 
               <br />
               was. Calgary, the limits are now conﬁned 
               <br />
               to the city, whereas before it comprised a 
               <br />
               portion of the country district. Then on the
