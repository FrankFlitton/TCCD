               Well, Sir, why does not the hon. member 
               <br />
               for North Toronto still believe in the con- 
               <br />
               stitution ? I have always understood that a 
               <br />
               man who had principles and who believed in 
               <br />
               his principles stuck to them and tried to 
               <br />
               convince the people that they were wrong 
               <br />
               and not be convinced by the people that he 
               <br />
               was wrong. I think the hon. member for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> Toronto has been long enough in poll-

               ment not to allow himself, when he believed 
               <br />
               that he had the right view of the question, 
               <br />
               and when he believed in the right of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>

               minority, to be convinced that he was wrong 
               <br />
               even by a thrice expressed opinion on the 
               <br />
               part of the people, especially so, when dur- 
               <br />
               ing the elections of 1900 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> that ques- 
               <br />
               tion was not in the least talked of. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Ottawa (Mr. Belcourt) was 
               <br />
               quite right the other day when he said that 
               <br />
               the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               changed his mind because he found 
               <br />
               that his former view was not to his 
               <br />
               political advantage and it did not pay. 
               <br />
               These are the principles of hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen on the other side of the House. They 
               <br />
               have principles but they cannot stick to 
               <br />
               them. They do not believe in any thing that 
               <br />
               does not pay and is not to their political ad- 
               <br />
               vantage. It is not the statesmen who try 
               <br />
               to enlighten the mob, but it is the mob that 
               <br />
               tries to enlighten the political statesmen of 
               <br />
               the Conservative party. We have an ex-

               aw of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> and the meaning of the Brit- 
               <br />
               ish North America Act is that when separate 
               <br />
               schnnls have been established they have been 
               <br />
               established for good. Why was it that the 
               <br />
               law of 1875 was passed ? Was it not passed 
               <br />
               at the request of the Protestant minority in 
               <br />
               Manitoba, under section 93 of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, to make clearer and 
               <br />
               to relieve any doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">p-there</span> may have been re- 
               <br />
               lating to the rights of the Protestant mino- 
               <br />
               rity of the west ‘.’ When that law was pass- 
               <br />
               ed by parliament, the Protestant minority as 
               <br />
               it then existed believed that the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories would be a second province of 
               <br />
               Quebec and that the French Catholics would 
               <br />
               have a majority there. That is so clear that 
               <br />
               you cannot ﬁnd any speech against it, not 
               <br />
               even a speech by George Brown himself, and 
               <br />
               I defy hon. gentlemen opposite to show me 
               <br />
               one single article in the Protestant papers 
               <br />
               of that time against the law of 1875. What 
               <br />
               was the attitude of the ‘ Globe ’ then ? Can 
               <br />
               we ﬁnd a single word in the ‘Globe ' of 1875 
               <br />
               against the law which gave separate schools 
               <br />
               to the minority of the Northwest Territories? 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nor,</span> can we ﬁnd a single word of protest in 
               <br />
               the ‘Mail.’ which, I believe. is the organ of 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative</span> party to-day. Well Sir, 
               <br />
