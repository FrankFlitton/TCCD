               The people of the Territories contend that

               <br />
               would not be unwise and impolitic to create 
               <br />
               provinces out there on any different basis from 
               <br />
               that on which other provinces stand. Entire

               <br />
               manency of the confederation structure. Is it 
               <br />
               not a fair proposition that the citizens of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories should be looked upon 
               <br />
               in all respects as equal to the citizen of any 
               <br />
               other province of Canada. The subjects that

               be to give as much ﬁnancial ability as possible 
               <br />
               to the local legislature to deal with their local

               Let me now make a comparison between 
               <br />
               the value of the lands when Manitoba en- 
               <br />
               tered confederation and their value to-day. 
               <br />
               In 1883 Sir Charles Tupper read a statement 
               <br />
               to this House, which showed that the sales 
               <br />
               of land from 1872 to 1880 had been less 
               <br />
               than two million acres, and that the aver- 
               <br />
               age price received was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">31;</span> cents per acre. 
               <br />
               Further 0n he declared that only 13 cents 
               <br />
               per acre out of this sum had been paid to 
               <br />
               date. Compare the value of the lands in 
               <br />
               these days with their value in the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> We ﬁnd that the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway lands were selling in J anu- 
               <br />
               ary at an average price of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4.10‘per</span> acre 
               <br />
               and the school lands at an average of 
               <br />
               nearly $10 per acre. We also have 
               <br />
               the statement of the First Minister 
               <br />
               that $3 an acre is a very moderate 
               <br />
               rate for land in that country. Therefore, I 
               <br />
               contend there is no comparison whatever be- 
               <br />
               tween the conditions of Manitoba in 1870 
               <br />
               and those of the Territories in 1901. 
               <br />
               Coming to the question of the compensa- 
               <br />
               tion offered to the new provinces for the loss 
               <br />
               of their public lands, I would like to ask the 
               <br />
               First Minister what is the basis of that calcu- 
               <br />
               lation? Why have the government selected 
               <br />
               25,000,000 acres out of the 175,000,000 which. 
               <br />
               roughly speaking, will be comprised in each 
               <br />
               of these new provinces, and why have they 
               <br />
               placed a value of only $1.50 per acre on 
               <br />
               these 25,000,000 acres? Again why do they 
               <br />
               only pay 1 per cent interest at ﬁrst on those 
               <br />
               lands. and how do they arrive at the grad- 
               <br />
               ual increase in the rate of interest as popula- 
               <br />
               tion increases in that country ? I can only 
               <br />
               suppose that they began to argue the 
               <br />
               question backwards. I would presume that 
               <br />
               their ﬁrst thought was: How much money 
               <br />
               is the least we can give to the people of 
               <br />
               these provinces ? And having decided upon 
               <br />
               the ﬁgure, they began to hunt for 
               <br />
               some method of making it up. The 
               <br />
               whole arrangement seems to me an ex- 
               <br />
               traordinary one. I could not ﬁnd a word 
               <br />
               to describe it until the Prime Minister sup- 
               <br />
               plied it the other day, when he used the 
               <br />
               word ‘ramshackle.’ That well characterizes 
               <br />
               the arrangements made in this Bill for com- 
               <br />
               pensation to the provinces for the loss of 
               <br />
               their public lands. It will be noticed that 
               <br />
               compensation is only offered for one- 
               <br />
               seventh of the whole area or one-ﬁfth of the 
               <br />
               whole area still undisposed of according to 
               <br />
               a return brought down the other day. Who 
               <br />
               will say that 113,000,000 acres out of these 
               <br />
               138,000,000 still 11ndisposed of in each of 
               <br />
               these provinces are of no value whatever, 
               <br />
               that only 25,000,000 are of any value, and 
               <br />
               that the value of those shall be ﬁxed at 
               <br />
               $1.50 per acre ? Further than that, no con- 
               <br />
               sideration whatever is given for the mines, 
               <br />
               minerals and timber which are being with- 
               <br />
               held from us. As to the ﬁsheries, I do not
