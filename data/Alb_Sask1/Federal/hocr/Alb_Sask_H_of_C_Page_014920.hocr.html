               We are taunted very often by being asked

               The better time to consider that question is 
               <br />
               when the Territories cease to be under terri-

               I am not prepared to say that this par- 
               <br />
               iiament had not the power to deal with 
               <br />
               that matter at an earlier date, but I believe 
               <br />
               there was a great deal of wisdom in the 
               <br />
               suggestion of Sir John Thompson. He did 
               <br />
               not want the country to be constantly in a 
               <br />
               turmoil of strife and feeling over this reli~ 
               <br />
               gious question. Knowing that the time 
               <br />
               would come when this issue would be raised, 
               <br />
               be preferred that it should remain dormant 
               <br />
               until such time as the Territories were to 
               <br />
               be made into provinces, and then the whole 
               <br />
               matter could be dealt‘with, instead of hav- 
               <br />
               ing the contention raised in 1894, to be 
               <br />
               repeated in 1905 or some other year, when 
               <br />
               a measure such as we are now discussing 
               <br />
               would come before the people. I think there 
               <br />
               was a great deal of wisdom in that sug- 
               <br />
               gestion, and I think that since we are now 
               <br />
               repealing the Territorial Act, this is the 
               <br />
               most opportune time which has offered <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> 
               <br />
               self within the last thirty years for the re- 
               <br />
               peal of the measure that created the dual 
               <br />
               system of schools in the Territories. A Bill 
               <br />
               has been introduced by the right hon. the 
               <br />
               First Minister which provides for a dual 
               <br />
               system of schools, without the consent of 
               <br />
               the people of the Northwest. I do not think 
               <br />
               1 am saying anything too strong when I 
               <br />
               say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> we have not the consent of the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest to this measure. 
               <br />
               They certainly have not been consulted. In 
               <br />
               fact, as I have already said, they have been 
               <br />
               - misled. Shall I go too far if I say they 
               <br />
               have been deceived by the letter of the First 
               <br />
               Minister? They had the promise of the 
               <br />
               First Minister that when the new parlia~ 
               <br />
               ment was elected, he would be prepared to 
               <br />
               take up the question of provincial auto- 
               <br />
               nomy, and it was not to be a partial auto— 
               <br />
               nomy. Having that promise, the people of 
               <br />
               the west had every reason to believe that 
               <br />
               the leader of the government would be faith- 
               <br />
               ful to it, and that no matter who were re- 
               <br />
               turned as representatives from that coun- 
               <br />
               try, full and complete autonomy or self- 
               <br />
               government would be extended those Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. But what is provided by this Bill? 
               <br />
               \Ve ﬁnd that it provides for a dual system 
               <br />
