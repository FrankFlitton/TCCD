               the First Minister applies that to parlia-

               <br />
               the law may be general, the separate 
               <br />
               school provisions will apply only to min- 
               <br />
               orities. Look at section 41 of ordinance 
               <br />
               29, and if I am wrong I ask the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice to correct me. You cannot bring 
               <br />
               a separate school into existence under sec-

               moves. There can be no separate school 
               <br />
               without that. Well, then, what about con-

               scientious scruples against being taught in 
               <br />

               <br />
               be in a district, twenty-ﬁve Roman Catho-

               lics and ten Methodists. the minority can 
               <br />
               have a separate school. The majority must

               there can be in that-case remedial legis-

               lation? The Minister of Inland Revenue 
               <br />
               was interrupted by the hon. member for

               <br />
