               <br />
               in it, just as in this Dominion parliament, 
               <br />

               I do not suppose there are one hundred

               tages or privileges which we enjoy. We 
               <br />
               have never had any such display of feeling.

               that the Catholic majority of the province 
               <br />

               fluenced by these feelings, statements. or 
               <br />

               of Quebec the Catholic majority will take 
               <br />

               that it Will come about in our day, and I

               them in the press of the province of Ontario.

               <br />
               ated in this way. The fathers of confedera-

               tion listened to Mr. Gait and introduced the 
               <br />

               <br />
               some of them no doubt ultra Protestant. 
               <br />
               desired to have separate schools and agreed 
               <br />
               to have separate schools. I understand that

               on the Bill which was introduced by the

               I said a few moments ago that I believe

               I voiced the Protestant opinion of the pro-
