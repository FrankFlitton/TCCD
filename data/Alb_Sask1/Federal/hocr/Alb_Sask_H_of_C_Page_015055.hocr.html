               the reasons which impel me, which force

               has the power, the constitutional right, to

               unless it is settled by some legislation

               Canada, as towards any other part of Can- 
               <br />
               ada. I think that from the year 1888 they 
               <br />
               had direct representation in this House, 
               <br />
               and also in the Senate. They amended 
               <br />
               their school law by ordinances passed in 
               <br />
               1890 and 1891, and this government has 
               <br />
               assented to them. For thirty years the 
               <br />
               people have had a guarantee, with the con~ 
               <br />
               sent of this House, that the system of 
               <br />
               schools in operation there would be per- 
               <br />
               petuated. Shall we place these new pro- 
               <br />
               vinces on a lower plane than we would 
               <br />
               place the colony_ of Newfoundland ? ‘Shall 
               <br />
               we say to these new provinces: If you 
               <br />
               come in you must come in without the 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of subsections 1, 3 and 4 of sec- 
               <br />
               tion 93 of the British North America Act, 
               <br />
               while Newfoundland would come in sub- 
               <br />
               ject to those subsections ? I submit that, 
               <br />
               from the point of justice, of equity, of fair 
               <br />
               dealing with the minority in this country, 
               <br />
               as a pure matter of expediency, if on no 
               <br />
               higher ground, for the purpose of taking 
               <br />
               this matter out of provincial politics—as a 
               <br />
               pure matter of expediency, as well as a 
               <br />
               matter of justice, the educational clauses 
               <br />
               of the Bill as now framed should be passed.
