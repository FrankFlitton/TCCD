               not mix himself up with those legal texts. 
               <br />
               the old gentleman said: If to be a lawyer 
               <br />
               means that one must conﬁne himself to texts 
               <br />
               of law and forget the difference between 
               <br />
               truth and nntruth. I thank Heaven I am not

               the leader of the opposltion I was forcibly 
               <br />
               reminded of that declaration of his predeces- 
               <br />
               sor. It was when turning to the Orange

               section of his party—I would rather not refer 
               <br />
               to the fact but it was patent to everybody— 
               <br />

               that in his study of texts and legal quibbles. 
               <br />
               my hon. friend has forgotten one of the 
               <br />
               basic principles of law. and that is that the 
               <br />
               written document is not the contract. What 
               <br />
               is really the contract is the agreement en- 
               <br />
               tered into between the two parties. and the 
               <br />
               written document is only the evidence of 
               <br />
               that agreement. I will go further. Written 
               <br />
               contracts were invented by legislators when 
               <br />
               men became dishonest enough not to be 
               <br />
               true to their pledges and in order to guard 
               <br />
               against dishonesty. But if we are bound 
               <br />
               ‘by our contract with the Canadian Paciﬁc

               <br />

               <br />
               settled in these Territories. relying on the 
               <br />
               word of honour of the Canadian parliament ? 
               <br />
               Are we not bound in honour by the word 
               <br />
               given to two millions of our fellow subjects

               a fact which should not be forgotten. With- 
               <br />
               out going again into a deep and ﬁne study 
               <br />
               of the question whether those Territories 
               <br />
               became part of the union in 1870 or whether 
               <br />
               those new provinces are entering the union 
               <br />
               now. there is one thing we know, and that 
               <br />
               is that they were purchased and paid for by 
               <br />
               the people of Canada as a whole. We know 
               <br />
               that every dollar which has been spent on 
               <br />
               the development of that country, we know 
               <br />
               that the millions of dollars which have been 
               <br />
               expended to bring foreign people into it. 
               <br />
               were contributed by Roman Catholics as 
               <br />
               well as Protestants. Now, Mr. Speaker. if 
               <br />
               there is one principle upon which I think we 
               <br />
               can safely appeal to the spirit of justice of 
               <br />
               any English speaking majority. it is that 
               <br />
               every man is equal before the collector of 
               <br />
               taxes. Therefore I say that when we are 
               <br />
               considering the rights and the law and the 
               <br />
               constitution. this very simple fact should 
               <br />
               not be forgotten. May I not go a little

               <br />
               pause and consider a little what the French

               Canadians have done for the opening up and 
               <br />

               long before governments existed. long before
