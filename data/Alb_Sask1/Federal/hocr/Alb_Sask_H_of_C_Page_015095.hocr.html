               Now, Sir, a word as to the changes we have 
               <br />
               made in that clause. I stated the other day 
               <br />

               <br />
               the ground on more than one occasion, we again

               effect of the law as it stands. Now -I sub- 
               <br />
               mit, this is a legal question, not a question 
               <br />
               01 a matter of policy. I repeat What I said 
               <br />
               before, that I believe this question was set 
               <br />
               at rest when confederation was formed, 
               <br />
               because in the Acts embodying confeder- 
               <br />
               ation and carrying out its principles we 
               <br />
               ﬁnd all the machinery, so to speak, and, I 
               <br />
               may safely say a method of working out all 
               <br />
               questions which might come before the par- 
               <br />
               liament of Canada in the then future. It 
               <br />
               does seem to me that the foundation was 
               <br />
               laid sufficiently broad and sufﬁciently deep, 
               <br />
               and that the terms of confederation were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sufﬁciently</span> elastic in themselves to permit 
               <br />
               of an honest and fair interpretation of 
               <br />
               that Act by the parliament of Canada in 
               <br />
               such a way that it will at all times bear 
               <br />
               the fruits intended by its founders, and 
               <br />
               at all times work out, the good that it was 
               <br />
               intended to produce for the Canadian peo- 
               <br />
               ple. There is little we can differ upon In 
               <br />
               that Act. It does seem to me to be a great 
               <br />
               pity that we in Canada who agree upon 
               <br />
               so many and who differ upon so few things, 
               <br />
               should be at variance on this question, a 
               <br />
               question which has aroused so much un- 
               <br />
               pleasantness, and I am sorry to say, so much 
               <br />
               bitterness in this country. I regret it ex- 
               <br />
               ceedingly. I say it is a lamentable condi-

               Sir, I desire to revert once more to that 
               <br />
               feature of the constitution, because to my 
               <br />
               mind it is an all important question. In 
               <br />
               discussing this matter in parliament hon. 
               <br />

               <br />
               opposition may differ from the government, 
               <br />
               hon. members on the same side of the 
               <br />
               House may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬁer</span> from one another. But 
               <br />
               after all, where are these questions ultimate- 
               <br />
               ly to be settled, where do they wind up ? I 
               <br />
               am safe in saying that constitutional mat- 
               <br />
               ters of this kind, matters of great weight 
               <br />
               and moment, do not end in parliament. The 
               <br />
               courts are to that extent above parliament 
               <br />
               in their right of deciding that they may 
               <br />
               interpret the powers of parliament, they 
               <br />
               have the power of deciding Whether an 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> of this parliament is ultra vires or in- 
               <br />
               tra vii-es. whether this parliament can in- 
               <br />
               vade the provincial domain with impunity 
               <br />
               or whether it cannot. That principle has 
               <br />
               been invoked a hundred times in respect 
               <br />
               of provincial legislation, the correlative 
               <br />
               remedy has been applied, for in many cases 
               <br />
               where it has been invoked against provin- 
               <br />
               cial legislation which has been declared null 
               <br />
               and void. So it will be in the future with 
               <br />
               regard to this Bill. Acts of this parliament 
               <br />
               have been passed upon by the courts and 
               <br />
               they will be in the future. It seems to me to 
               <br />
               be begging the question to say that we must 
               <br />
               take a business man’s view of a constitu- 
               <br />
               tional question, or we must take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">states</span> 
               <br />
               man’s view, because after all the view that 
               <br />
               will prevail will be the legal View. Why 
               <br />
               not view this whole question as a legal one, 
               <br />
               because that is what it will ultimately be, 
               <br />
               If I am correctly informed, the ques- 
               <br />
               tion of the validity of this Act will 
               <br />
               not rest here. If I am credibly in— 
               <br />
               formed—and I have very little doubt 
               <br />
               of the correctness of my information—ii: 
               <br />
               will pass on to the courts. It will not end 
               <br />
               here, but it may come back here in the 
               <br />
               shape of an application for remedial legis- 
               <br />
               lation. History may repeat itself. I hope 
               <br />
               sincerely on behalf of the minority that 
               <br />
               history will not repeat itself in the calam- 
               <br />
               itous disasters that resulted from the last 
               <br />
               appeal to this parliament by a minority for 
               <br />
               remedial legislation. Now, Sir. I pass on to 
               <br />
               the View of this question, not of a legal 
               <br />
               gentleman, not of a statesman, but of a lay- 
               <br />
               man, the Postmaster General. What does 
               <br />
               he say upon this question ? 
               <br />

               In fact there are just two ways of looking 
               <br />
               at the British North America Act; you may 
               <br />
               look at it from the standpoint of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lawyer,</span> 
               <br />
               or you may look at it from the standpoint of 
               <br />
               a statesman. If you look at it from the
