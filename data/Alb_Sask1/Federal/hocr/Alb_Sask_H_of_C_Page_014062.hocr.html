               fore the Orders of the Day are called, I shall 
               <br />
               make a few remarks with respect to a

               matter which I have informed my right hon.

               friend the Prime Minister I would speak 
               <br />
               upon to—day. My remarks will be very 
               <br />
               brief. They are in connection with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in«</span> 
               <br />
               troduction of the Bills for the establishment 
               <br />
               of new provinces in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories. I do not of course propose to discuSs 
               <br />
               the merits of these measures—the rules of 
               <br />
               the House would not permit me to do so. 
               <br />
               and even if they would, that course is not 
               <br />
               advisable at the present moment, when, as I 
               <br />
               understand, certain questions in connection 
               <br />
               with these Bills are under consideration by 
               <br />
               the government. However, if I were dis— 
               <br />
               posed to enter into a discussion of the 
               <br />
               merits, I would be unable to do so on ac— 
               <br />
               count of the very well known rules of the 
               <br />
               House which do not seem to be thoroughly 
               <br />
               understood in some quarters throughout the 
               <br />
               country. The particular matter to which I 
               <br />
               desire to call attention is: that the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister introduced this legislation, as a 
               <br />
               measure concurred in by all the members 
               <br />
               of the administration, whereas we dis- 
               <br />
               covered afterwards that this was not the 
               <br />
               fact. My right hon. friend has always 
               <br />
               vaunted himself as a strict follower of con- 
               <br />
               stitutional usage—he has sometimes done 
               <br />
               more than that, because some ten years 
               <br />
               ago he claimed for himself the attributes of 
               <br />
               foresight and of courage when a somewhat 
               <br />
               similar question as that which arises to-day
