               not at all jealous of that honour which he

               <br />
               speeches on the same question. I took some 
               <br />
               part in that discussion. I intend to take 
               <br />
               some part in the present discussion. My

               hon. friend is re—echoing the attempts that 
               <br />
               have been made in the press to show that 
               <br />
               there has been a great change from the posi- 
               <br />
               tion taken by the Liberal party in 1896 in 
               <br />
               the position taken by them in 1905. Now 
               <br />
               we shall have an opportunity by and by of 
               <br />
               discussing that question; when we come to 
               <br />
               the second reading of the Bill I will en- 
               <br />
               deavour to discuss the question with my 
               <br />
               hon. friend, and we shall discuss it on both 
               <br />
               sides of the House. I do not admit that 
               <br />
               there has been any departure at all in the 
               <br />
               conduct of the Liberal party between 1896 
               <br />
               and 1905; but I am sorry to say that hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen on the opposite side are always 
               <br />
               in the wrong. They never can interpret the 
               <br />
               constitution as it is. In 1896, the position 
               <br />
               which we took and maintained before the 
               <br />
               country was that it was not right for the 
               <br />
               federal parliament to try to impose on the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba a system of schools 
               <br />
               which the province of Manitoba had re— 
               <br />
               jected, acting within the plenary exercise 
               <br />
               of its powers. If there had been a system 
               <br />
               of schools in the province of Manitoba in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1870.</span> when it was admitted to confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. then, Sir, the minority would have 
               <br />
               been entitled to those schools by the judg- 
               <br />
               ment of the courts; but the courts decided 
               <br />
               that there had been no such system of 
               <br />
               schools. and therefore the powers of the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba were not in any way 
               <br />
               curtailed. There is a difference. therefore, 
               <br />
               in the position of Manitoba in 1870, as ex- 
               <br />
               posed in 1896, and the position which we 
               <br />
               are confronted with at the present time. 
               <br />
               But I will not discuss this question with 
               <br />
               my hon. friend to-day—I do not think the

               time is opportune.

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               Hon. GEO. E. FOSTER (North Toronto). 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, it was a candid admission of 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend when he confessed 
               <br />
               that he had not given much information to 
               <br />
               the hon. leader of the opposition in response 
               <br />
               to his question of yesterday and of to-day. 
               <br />
               It was a charming bit of persiﬂage that the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman made an exhibition 
               <br />
               of in those few words—airy, light, well- 
               <br />
               chosen, skimming all around, but avoiding 
               <br />
               carefully any expression which would go 
               <br />
               to shed light upon the grave and serious 
               <br />
               questions which my hon. friend beside me 
               <br />
               had raised. Now, I do not intend to be 
               <br />
               led away by this little diversion into a dis- 
               <br />
               cussion of matters which are not at pres- 
               <br />
               ent before the House. I want to reiterate, 
               <br />
               in the ﬁrst place, the position taken by the 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the opposition. He quoted 
               <br />
               from statements that had been made by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance, and could have quoted 
               <br />
               from statements which had been made by 
               <br />
               the late Minister of the Interior, to show to 
               <br />
               the right hon. the premier that he knew 
               <br />
               thoroughly well, when these hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men were in his cabinet, and when just 
               <br />
               lately he introduced his Bill for discussion 
               <br />
               in his cabinet, that these hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               had well-known and pronounced views with 
               <br />
               reference to the question of education as it 
               <br />
               would develop in these new provinces. That 
               <br />
               is the only purpose my hon. friend had in 
               <br />
               View. The quotations which he made drove 
               <br />
               that fact fairly well home, so that the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman could not say that he did 
               <br />
               not know, in the absence of these two 
               <br />
               gentlemen, that their opinions had been 
               <br />
               ﬁrmly formed and plainly expressed. The 
               <br />
               startling thing about it was this——and it was 
               <br />
               not explained away by all the charming 
               <br />
               discursiveness of my hon. friend yesterday. 
               <br />
               The question is: what is the constitutional 
               <br />
               practice when a Bill, having been discussed 
               <br />
               in the cabinet and agreed to or supposed 
               <br />
               to be agreed to there, is launched upon the 
               <br />
               House as the utterance of the government 
               <br />
               as a whole ‘2 That is the question, and the 
               <br />
               startling thing about it is that the premier 
               <br />
               introduced a Bill for discussion in his cabi— 
               <br />
               net, knowing the views of these tw0 gentle- 
               <br />
               men in their absence, and with a haste that 
               <br />
               has not yet been explained. Engaged as it 
               <br />
               were, in a race for a goal with the Minister 
               <br />
               of Finance and the Minister of the Interior, 
               <br />
               he beat them by about two days and twelve 
               <br />
               hours—he got in ahead, and he launched 
               <br />
               his Bill. Now, the country and this 
               <br />
               House had no warrant for believing any— 
               <br />
               thing else than that that Bill in its entirety 
               <br />
               had been assented to and had the cordial 
               <br />
               agreement of every member of the cabinet. 
               <br />
               That is the point the country heeds. and 
               <br />
               that is the point my hon. friend the leader 
               <br />
               of the opposition makes. What has happened 
               <br />
               in this case is. I believe, unprecedented in 
               <br />
               the history of this parliament, and it is a
