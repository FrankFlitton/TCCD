               legislature of the new province that power 
               <br />
               which the legislature of the Territories pos- 
               <br />
               sesses at the present time. That has been 
               <br />
               exercised once by the legislature of the 
               <br />
               Territories, and it might be exercised again 
               <br />
               from time to time, as the occasion would 
               <br />
               require. So the power which he proposes to 
               <br />
               confer upon the legislature of the new 
               <br />
               province might be exercised tomorrow,

               Mr. BRODEUR. I mean that they do not 
               <br />
               use it any more. There was a resolution 
               <br />
               passed, which I quoted a few moments ago, 
               <br />
               declaring that the only ofﬁcial language 
               <br />
               in the legislative assembly should be En- 
               <br />
               glish. Does that mean that the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage can be used any longer in their pro- 
               <br />
               ceedings ? I do not think so. Well, then, 
               <br />
               let us take the situation as we ﬁnd it. I 
               <br />
               say the assembly has given its decision on 
               <br />
               that point, has exercised the authority which 
               <br />
               was vested in it by this parliament. It has 
               <br />
               always been the policy of this government 
               <br />
               to accept the situation as we ﬁnd it, we 
               <br />
               have done so on the school question. and 
               <br />
               we will do so with regard to the French 
               <br />
               language.
