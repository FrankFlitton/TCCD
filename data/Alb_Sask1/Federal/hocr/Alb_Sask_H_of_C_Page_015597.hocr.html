               the other side, I appeal to my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from North Toronto (Mr. Foster), who has 
               <br />
               sat on the treasury benches when the redis- 
               <br />
               tribution was undertaken, that you cannot 
               <br />
               have the same unit of population for the 
               <br />
               representation of a city as for the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation of a rural community. Two years 
               <br />
               ago, when we last had a redistribution mea- 
               <br />
               sure before this House, a strong appeal 
               <br />
               was made to us by representatives of ur— 
               <br />
               ban populations, that they were not treated 
               <br />
               fairly because the unit of population was 
               <br />
               not the same for the city as for the rural 
               <br />
               places. Our unit of population for coun- 
               <br />
               ties was 25,000, but for Toronto and Mon- 
               <br />
               treal we had a very much larger unit. If 
               <br />
               this principle were not adopted some por- 
               <br />
               tions of the rural populations would ‘be left 
               <br />
               unrepresented. Calgary, for instance, had 
               <br />
               a population, according to the last census 
               <br />
               of 4,865. This is a compact population in- 
               <br />
               cluded within, perhaps, two square miles. 
               <br />
               Stony Plain had a population of 2,938; 
               <br />
               here is a population of about 3,000 scattered 
               <br />
               over a territory hundreds of miles in extent. 
               <br />
               On what principle are you to deal with 
               <br />
               these two populations if not on the prin-
