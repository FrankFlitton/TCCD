               of this debate. On the 8th May, 1905, the right 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman said: I believe it is the in- 
               <br />
               tention of the government to give substan- 
               <br />
               tial justice to all parties concerned. Let us 
               <br />
               then start on that basis. The First Minister 
               <br />
               has expressed, not only his own desire, but 
               <br />
               no doubt the desire also of his colleagues, 
               <br />
               to do justice in this redistribution ; and 
               <br />
               therefore in the hope that, if we show that 
               <br />
               injustice is done, he will be the ﬁrst to re- 
               <br />
               medy it, we shall continue the discussion. 
               <br />
               It is not an easy task to divide a province 
               <br />
               into electoral divisions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Certainly</span> it is not 
               <br />
               an easy task to do so justly, although we 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> almost imagine from the extent of the 
               <br />
               injustice in this schedule that it had been 
               <br />
               an easy task. The government, in clause 12 
               <br />
               of the Bill, have given us two of the fact- 
               <br />
               ors which they have evidently taken into 
               <br />
               consideration in dealing with this matter, 
               <br />
               namely, that the electoral divisions shall be 
               <br />
               deﬁned with due regard to the distribution 
               <br />
               of population and existing local divisions, 
               <br />
               which we rtake to mean the divisions in the 
               <br />
               Northwest legislature at present. But there 
               <br />
               are other factors which should be taken into 
               <br />
               consideration in making distribution. There 
               <br />
               are the physical features of the country. It 
               <br />
               is inadvisable that a mountain range, for 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">example,</span> should separate two parts of a 
               <br />
               constituenncy, or that an unfordable river 
               <br />
               should cut it in twain, and it is equally inad- 
               <br />
