               extent. is happening in this Dominion of 
               <br />
               ours to-day. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> ﬁnd every little while in

               the newspapers accounts of where these 
               <br />
               people get together in some alley and stab 
               <br />
               each other to death. One result is that the

               argued by the right hon. leader of the gov-

               ernment I would ask what steps he has

               taken to prevent the inﬂux of these people 
               <br />
               into the Dominion. Has he instructed his 
               <br />
               Minister of War to keep the Northwest 
               <br />
               mounted police strung along the boundary 
               <br />
               with ﬁxed bayonets to stop them ? Surely 
               <br />
               it is not possible that he gives his coun- 
               <br />
               tenance to the Minister of the Interior to 
               <br />
               spend large sums of money to bring these

               people into the country, to do all he can to 
               <br />
               coax these people who are so depraved, 
               <br />
               among whom crimes are so prevalent and 
               <br />
               divorces and other evils so common. to

               people of the Northwest Territories that 
               <br />
               stand so much higher than do the people 
               <br />
               of the United States. I think that probably 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman proved more than 
               <br />

               the trouble in regard to separate schools
