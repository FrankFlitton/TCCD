               Now, it is because of that declaration on 
               <br />
               the part of the Prime Minister that I rise 
               <br />
               to protest as a western representative, 
               <br />
               against this procedure. The idea of having

               these great questions considered without 
               <br />
               having that portfolio ﬁlled is contrary to 
               <br />
               the best judgment of the people of western 
               <br />
               Canada. The Prime Minister may say that 
               <br />
               there has been no undue delay in ﬁlling 
               <br />
               that portfolio, that a longer time has elapsed

               in ﬁlling other vacancies in other cabinets. 
               <br />
               But this vacancy at this particular time is 
               <br />
               unique in its character, and there are very 
               <br />
               special reasons why the portfolio should be 
               <br />
               tilled at the earliest possible moment. In 
               <br />
               the ﬁrst place, the resignation has taken 
               <br />
               place during the holding of a session of

               cially in regard to western Canada, which 
               <br />
               transactions should be explained to this

               House by a responsible head of that de-

               the whole future of the people of western

               <br />
               within an area of 73,000 square miles. The

               the Prime Minister of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories to have only one province. He said

               in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eﬁect:</span> Look at this one territory of

               turn the right hon. gentleman‘s argument 
               <br />
               against himself ; look at little Manitoba with 
               <br />
               an area of 73,000 square miles in contrast 
               <br />

               <br />
               area of 250,000 square miles. Any person 
               <br />
               with a spirit of fairness must resent such 
               <br />
               treatment of Manitoba at the hands of the 
               <br />
               Prime Minister. And what is the reason

               for this refusal on his part to listen to the
