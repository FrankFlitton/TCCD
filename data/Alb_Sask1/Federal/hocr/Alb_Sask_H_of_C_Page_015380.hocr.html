               a reference he made to me which I think 
               <br />
               is quite uncalled for. I was only endeavour- 
               <br />
               ing to straighten out what I thought was 
               <br />
               a misunderstanding, and the hon. gentleman

               take much notice of what is said in the 
               <br />
               heat of debate, but the hon. gentleman made 
               <br />
               one remark the tenor of which I did not 
               <br />
               exactly catch. but which I would ask him to 
               <br />
               explain. He seemed to say that there was 
               <br />
               some position to be made for me in some 
               <br />
               way, and that I was not to go back to my 
               <br />
               electors. Well, I never heard of that before, 
               <br />
               and as the hon. gentleman is kindly disposed 
               <br />
               now, I wish he would let me know where 
               <br />
               that position is, what it is, and where he 
               <br />
               heard of it. I can only say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> I give an

               the remark made by the hon. gentleman

               wick up to Ontario. All I have to say is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that.</span> I hope many more men of the calibre 
               <br />
               of the hon. member for North Toronto 
               <br />
               will be driven from the province of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick to the province of Ontario. In 
               <br />
               reference to the hon. gentlemen who repre- 
               <br />
               sent Ontario in this cabinet, I do not believe 
               <br />
               that they reﬂect the sentiment of the prov- 
               <br />
               ince to-day. When the Minister of Customs 
               <br />
               sits in his seat and hears the people of On- 
               <br />
               tario called bigots, as he has done on many 
               <br />
               occasions with a smile on his face, I say it 
               <br />
               comes with ill-grace from a gentleman who 
               <br />
               occupies that position to allow statements 
               <br />
               of that kind to be made by gentlemen repre— 
               <br />
               senting other provinces without correcting 
               <br />
               them. Nor do I think it becomes the Post- 
               <br />
               master General (Sir William Mulock), who 
               <br />
               also represents the province of Ontario in 
               <br />
               the cabinet, to sit in his seat and permit 
               <br />
               statements to be made such as We have 
               <br />
               heard in this debate, reﬂecting on that pro- 
               <br />
               vince. I am proud to say that I represent 
               <br />
               a constituency in the province of Ontario. 
               <br />
               True. it is a constituency which was carried 
               <br />
               by Liberals for thirty years; but I believe 
               <br />
               I could go back and carry it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> by a 
               <br />
               Iarger majority than I had last November. 
               <br />
               I live near the city of London, and I am not 
               <br />

               result will be when the government opens
