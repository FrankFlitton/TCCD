               <br />
               prevailed as between the government of 
               <br />
               Great Britain and the dependencies of the 
               <br />
               empire during the past sixty or seventy 
               <br />
               years. Every argument which has been ad- 
               <br />
               vanced for retaining the control and admin- 
               <br />
               istration of these lands in the central gov- 
               <br />
               ernment would have availed equally in 
               <br />
               favour of retaining the control and adminis- 
               <br />
               tration of the lands of this country in the 
               <br />
               imperial government at London. There is 
               <br />
               no doubt about that. The British govern- 
               <br />
               ment attempted to enforce that principle. 
               <br />
               They did enforce it for a time, with results 
               <br />
               so absolutely unsatisfactory to themselves 
               <br />
               and to the people of the various dependencies 
               <br />
               of the empire that it was found necessary 
               <br />
               to make an absolute change. Further than

               that, the policy of the government in this 
               <br />
               regard is absolutely opposed, as I believe 
               <br />
               to the wishes of the people of the Northwest
