               <br />
               received, with regard to a portion at least 
               <br />
               of what I have asked, is not of very much 
               <br />
               use. What I asked for was the estimated 
               <br />
               population of each constituency as on the 
               <br />
               let of July, 1905. What I have got is a 
               <br />
               statement from the census, which I-could 
               <br />
               have made out myself, of the population of 
               <br />
               each constituency in 1901.

               Mr. OLIVER. I asked the Census Com- 
               <br />
               missioner for such an estimate and he said 
               <br />
               he could not give me an estimate that would

               certain constituencies. I presumed they
