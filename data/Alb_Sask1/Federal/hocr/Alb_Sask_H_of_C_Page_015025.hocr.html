               to those people who are residents or who

               cult for me to explain really the meaning

               something that we are all seeking after,

               boon ? Will it come to us of itself ? Will 
               <br />

               Sir, it will not come that way. It will

               not come except by preparation on our part,

               I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you will pardon 
               <br />
               me if for a moment I allude to my own 
               <br />
               experience as a boy in the public schools, 
               <br />
               because, Sir, sometimes the experience of 
               <br />
               one person may be taken as a type of the 
               <br />
               experience of thousands. When I attend— 
               <br />
               ed the public schools as a boy, a son of 
               <br />
               Protestant parents, I met there boys of 
               <br />
               about my own age who were sons of Ito- 
               <br />
               man Catholic parents. These boys whom I 
               <br />
               met were strictly taught in the religious 
               <br />
               faith of their parents, the Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               faith. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
               <br />
               say, I am delighted to say that I formed 
               <br />
               an attachment for those boys and they for 
               <br />
               me. We became very agreeable and friend— 
               <br />
               ly towards one another. We sat in the 
               <br />
               same classes, we helped each other with 
               <br />

               that that same pleasant feeling continued 
               <br />
               between myself and the friends I made at 
               <br />
               school. When We reached the years of man- 
               <br />
               hood and dealt together in various ways. 
               <br />
               it was always with a degree of conﬁdence 
               <br />
               in one another and in a friendly, social 
               <br />
               spirit. And that feeling lasts with us up to 
               <br />
               the present time, and -I am satisﬁed that it 
               <br />
               will continue so long as we live. Now, 
               <br />
               suppose there had been a separate school in 
               <br />
               that particular school section to which .I 
               <br />
               belonged, and in which I attended school. 
               <br />
               Had that been the case, no doubt these 
               <br />
               friends of mine would have attended the 
               <br />
               separate school and I would have attend- 
               <br />
               ed the public school. Possibly we might 
               <br />
               never have become acquainted at all. Or, 
               <br />
               we might have known one another simply 
               <br />
               as living in the same school section two or 
               <br />
               three miles apart—for I speak of rural 
               <br />
               schools altogether—and perhaps we might 
               <br />
               be a little acquainted. When we met each 
               <br />
               other on the country road it would be a 
               <br />
               cool nod of the head on the part of one 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> a formal ‘good morning ; ’ and a cold 
               <br />
               nod of the head on the other side and an 
               <br />
               equally formal ‘How do you do ’—and that 
               <br />
               would be all the friendliness between us. 
               <br />
               There would not be the souial feeling and 
               <br />
               pleasantness that ought to exist between 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of the same neighbourhood. And 
               <br />
               possibly this breaking up of interests might 
               <br />
               have led to mutual distrust and to a feel- 
               <br />

               <br />
               was only waiting an opportunity to do him 
               <br />
               an injury. But feelings like this should not 
               <br />
               exist ; and therefore, I hold that the public 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">school</span> is the place in which to bring the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the rising generation together. I be- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lieve</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> when boys are brought up in the 
               <br />
               public school together they become acquaint- 
               <br />
               ed with one another and there is a warm 
               <br />
               friendliness and sociability such -as ought to 
               <br />
               exist between them. And so, when they 
               <br />
               meet each other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’on</span> the country road there 
               <br />
               :s a warm grasp of the hand and a ‘John 
               <br />
               how do you do ‘2’ And an answering hand 
               <br />
               (lasp with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the'warin</span> greeting. ‘ Charley. I 
               <br />
               I am glad to meet you.’ I hold that the 
               <br />
               separate school creates discord and irritation 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> unfriendliness. and that it strikes a 
               <br />
               blow at the very foundation of the public 
               <br />
               school which has for its object the uniting 
               <br />
               together of the rising generation. The pub- 
               <br />
               lic school seems to harmonize, to a certain 
               <br />
               extent, the minds of the rising generation.
