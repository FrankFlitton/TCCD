               <br />
               is this: More than half a century ago, 
               <br />
               a leader. who proclaimed himself also a 
               <br />
               great man, and who certainly was such 
               <br />
               a man admired by the French Canadians 
               <br />
               of the province of Quebec, induced the 
               <br />
               people of Lower Canada to take up arms, 
               <br />
               and brought upon them a disastrous war. 
               <br />
               But as soon as hostilities had broken out, 
               <br />
               that great man made haste to take refuge 
               <br />
               across the border, while the grandfather

               once for all against that party which, dur-

               <br />
               They would, I say, have to break away

               to be taken seriously in the province of

               believe that he and the hon. gentleman for 
               <br />
               Labelle are the only two wise members of 
               <br />
               the House. I thought the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Jacques Cartier would resent the scathing 
               <br />
               references to him contained in the organ of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Labelle. I mean the 
               <br />
               ‘Nationaliste’, of Montreal.
