               the facts you will ﬁnd that we are to-day

               them because We have been totally divested 
               <br />
               of our public domain. Manitoba at the time 
               <br />
               of confederation had lands of wide area and 
               <br />
               very valuable. These should be handed over 
               <br />
               to the province and the province should 
               <br />
               have its own public domain, and if you will 
               <br />
               follow closely the British North America 
               <br />
               Act you will ﬁnd that it is according to the 
               <br />
               spirit of that Act that the public lands 
               <br />
               should be handed over to the province. As 
               <br />
               evidence of this take the little province of 
               <br />
               Prince Edward Island which had no public 
               <br />
               lands and received the sum of $800,000 in 
               <br />
               lieu thereof, whereas Manitoba only receives 
               <br />
               annually the paltry sum of $100,000 for all 
               <br />
               its public domain. Why should the province 
               <br />
               of Manitoba not be given its lands? What 
               <br />
               argument can be adduced why <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'that</span> prov- 
               <br />
               ince and the other provinces in the west

               as well should not own their own public 
               <br />
               domain. True, we had the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) the other night trot- 
               <br />
               ting out the old argument which I thought 
               <br />
               had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> relegated to the background. He 
               <br />
               said this government had to construct the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for Manitoba and 
               <br />
               the west. I do not think there is an hon.

               gentlemen in this House who will not admit 
               <br />
               frankly that‘the Canadian Paciﬁc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> 
               <br />
               is a road entirely of a national character in 
               <br />
               which all the provinces derive beneﬁt. But 
               <br />
               who paid for the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway? 
               <br />
               Six", the little province of Manitoba and the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories have paid nearly 
               <br />
               every dollar <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expended</span> on the construction 
               <br />
               of this great transcontinental line. They 
               <br />
               had to give 20,000 acres of their most valu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">able</span> land per mile. Further than that, those 
               <br />
               lands were exempted from taxation. How 
               <br />
               have the other provinces been dealt with as 
               <br />
