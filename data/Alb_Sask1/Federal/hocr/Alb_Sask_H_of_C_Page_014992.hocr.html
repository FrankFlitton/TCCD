               ernment have duties with regard to private 
               <br />
               legislation. If the minister looks at any 
               <br />
               book on parliamentary government he will 
               <br />
               see that. Otherwise why go through the

               It is in order to see that in matters concern- 
               <br />
               ing the public interest, as this does, the legis-

               Mr. SPROULE. It seems to me rather 
               <br />
               strange that the government should not look 
               <br />
               at the legislation in this House. That is the 
               <br />
               object of having a government. When a 
               <br />
               Bill of this kind appears before the Railway 
               <br />
               Committee it is the Minister of Railways 
               <br />
               who objects to certain clauses and his expert 
               <br />
               Mr. Collingwood Schreiber is always there 
               <br />
               with him. He is there for two reasons; 
               <br />
               ﬁrst to see that there is nothing in' the Bill 
               <br />
               which conﬂicts with the government’s policy 
               <br />
               or aims and that the Bill is in accordance 
               <br />
               with the usual principles of such Bills. The 
               <br />
               government overlooks these Bills at every 
               <br />
               stage and the law clerk of course goes over 
               <br />
               them as well. This is all under the direction 
               <br />
               and control of the government, because the 
               <br />
               government is responsible for all legislation 
               <br />
               which passes this House; whether it be a 
               <br />
               private or a public measure, it makes no 
               <br />
               difference.

               the government to open a constituency and 
               <br />
               see whether the people were in accord with 
               <br />
               them on this Autonomy Bill. I referred 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> to the success which had met this ap- 
               <br />
               peal to the people of Edmonton. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from Durham (Mr. Ward) undertook 
               <br />
               to explain how it was the good people of 
               <br />
               that constituency had given such an un- 
               <br />
               mistakable expression of their opinion by 
               <br />
               returning the hon. the Minister of the In- 
               <br />
               terior (Mr. Oliver) by acclamation. The rea- 
               <br />
               son was, he said, because sixty per cent of 
               <br />
               the people in that section are Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lics. But if sixty per cent of the people of 
               <br />
               that section belong to that faith, and it,
