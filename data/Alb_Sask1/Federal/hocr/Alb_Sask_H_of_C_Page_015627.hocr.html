               <br />
               from the south. It will be seen that neither

               the voters‘ list nor the number of votes 
               <br />
               cast is a fair criterion by which to estimate 
               <br />
               the population of that section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A</span>

               40-acre plots along the line of the ditch. 
               <br />
               Then take the district of Lethbridge, in 
               <br />
               the south, and compare it with Stony Plain, 
               <br />
               near Edmonton. Lethbridge is a very pros— 
               <br />
               perous town—city. you may say—with a 
               <br />
               'population, probably, of 5,000, and the centre 
               <br />
               of very large business interests of all kinds. 
               <br />
               From the coal mines there they have been 
               <br />
               sending out 2,000 tons of coal daily for 
               <br />
               years past. The town of Raymond is also 
               <br />
               ill the Lethbridge district. Four years ago 
               <br />
               there was not a soul where that town now 
               <br />
               stands with a population of nearly 3,000. 
               <br />
               It has a sugar reﬁnery that cost over <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$400,-</span> 
               <br />
               000. and has about it a very large rural 
               <br />
               and agricultural population. To show 
               <br />
               that the number of votes cast is not a 
               <br />
               criterion of poulation in that country, 
               <br />
               I may say that in the town of Ray- 
               <br />
               mond, with a population 2,800, only 113 
               <br />
               votes were cast in the last election. It 
               <br />
               surely is unreasonable to give to Lethbridge 
               <br />
               _and Raymond, with their great agricultural 
               <br />
               population, only the same representation as 
               <br />
               is given to Stony Plain, near Edmonton, or 
               <br />
               to give this district in the south only one 
               <br />
               member when two members are given to 
               <br />
               Athabaska. Or take the district of Pincher 
               <br />
               Creek, in which I live. We have the Crow’s 
               <br />
               Nest pass there, with the town of Frank 
               <br />
               and its coal mine that sold for over $3,000.- 
               <br />
               . 000 the other day. That mine is in opera- 
               <br />
               tion, and has probably $500,000 invested in 
               <br />
               plant and sends out a large quantity of 
               <br />
               coal daily, The French camp of Li‘lle is in 
               <br />
               the pass also. It is another mine, in 
               <br />
               which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro%ably</span> half a million dollars is in- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vested.</span> T e town of Coleman is also in the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[ass</span> with another great mine. with a plant 
               <br />
               it: which is invested $300,000 or $400,000. 
               <br />
               Belleview is the name, I believe of another 
               <br />
               new town with a mine and plant in oper- 
               <br />
               ation. Besides these there are several smal— 
               <br />
               ler mining villages. In addition to all 
               <br />
               this, there is the agricultural portion of 
               <br />
               Pincher Creek <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> will ship this year 
               <br />
               500,000 bushels of Wheat from the station 
               <br />
               where I live. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> is a population 
               <br />

               I live, including the Crow’s Nest Pass 
               <br />
               and Pincher Creek. I do not think it 
               <br />
               fair to say that one member should be sent 
               <br />
               from that district to the assembly to vote 
               <br />
               on equal terms with a member from the 
               <br />
               sparsely settled northern district. I do not 
               <br />
               think we could give a much better represen— 
               <br />
               tation to that country than that given by 
               <br />
               the legislative assembly in 1902. That was 
               <br />
               immediately after the census. As has been 
               <br />
               stated here. nine members were given south 
               <br />
               of Red Deer and six north of Red Deer. 
               <br />

               <br />
               That would indicate that that representa- 
               <br />
               tion was a fairly good one. Then take the 
               <br />
               redistribution of Dominion seats in 1903. 
               <br />
               south of the Red Deer there were given two 
               <br />
               seats and two north. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               Strathcona (Mr. Peter Talbot) said last night 
               <br />
               that oneﬁfth of his district was also south of 
               <br />
               Red Deer, so that in Dominion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representao</span>

               <br />
               the south. I think that would be another 
               <br />
               fair way to estimate the seats in that coun- 
               <br />
               try. Why, in this distribution, do they 
               <br />
               give thirteen seats north of Red Deer and 
               <br />
               only twelve south. I cannot see any good 
               <br />
               reason why that is done. I cannot see any 
               <br />
               good reason why Athabaska with only 250 
               <br />
               votes should have the same representation 
               <br />
               as Calgary which has over 10,000 souls. I 
               <br />
               do not think that any hon. gentleman would 
               <br />
               say that that is a fair way to represent 
               <br />
               that large district in the new parliament. 
               <br />
               Then take the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Band</span> district and look at 
               <br />
               the interests there, for instance, the Anthra- 
               <br />
               cite coal mines. In Canmore, $250,000 are 
               <br />
               invested in coal mines and in Bank head 
               <br />
               $800,000. These districts are growing just 
               <br />
               as rapidly as the northern country. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“'e</span> 
               <br />
               have been told by some members that we 
               <br />
               are providing for an increase of population 
               <br />
               and by others that we are not; but no mat- 
               <br />
               ter which way you take it, these places are 
               <br />
               developing as rapidly as that northern coun- 
               <br />
               try and will develop more rapidly in the 
               <br />
               future. Therefore, I have yet to see any 
               <br />
               fair reason why north of Red Deer should 
               <br />
               have thirteen seats and south of Red Deer 
               <br />
               only twelve. As regards the grain produc- 
               <br />
               ing capabilities of the two countries, I see 
               <br />
               that in 'the Edmonton district spring wheat 
               <br />
               averages 16-53 bushels per acre, fall Wheat 
               <br />
               11'60, oats, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">29-70</span> and barley 24'73. Take 
               <br />
               Calgary and I ﬁnd that spring Wheat aver- 
               <br />
               ages <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">19-04</span> per acre compared with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">16-03</span> 
               <br />
               in the Edmonton district; fall wheat <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2340</span> 
               <br />
               compared with 11'60; oats 37'41 compared 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2971</span> per acre in Edmonton district. 
               <br />
               In the Macleod district there is still a great- 
               <br />
               er diﬂerence. Fall wheat there compares 
               <br />
               25'97 bushel with 11-60 in the north. and 
               <br />
               oats. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">34‘57</span> against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2971</span> in the north. I 
               <br />
               take these ﬁgures from the geography pub- 
               <br />
               lished recently by the Department of Agri- 
               <br />
               culture. They show that even from an 
               <br />
               agricultural standpoint, the southern coun- 
               <br />
               try will rank above the north; and for that 
               <br />
               reason I do not see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘why</span> it should not con- 
               <br />
               tinue to progress in the same proportion. 
               <br />
               For many years the southern country was 
               <br />
               supposed to be nothing but a stock coun— 
               <br />
               try, but in almost every part of it where 
               <br />
               agriculture has been tried to any extent, 
               <br />
               it has proved a success. In the district
