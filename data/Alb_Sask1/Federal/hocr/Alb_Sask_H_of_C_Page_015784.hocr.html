               <br />

               <br />
               under his jurisdiction. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span> is not so.

               <br />
               no more able to continue their campaign of 
               <br />
               falsehood. In this discussion in which we 
               <br />
               had to answer to the windy and empty sen~ 
               <br />
               tences of our opponents, their last cry was :

               <br />
               may respect or violate the natural rights of 
               <br />
               the parents and of the conscience, but these 
               <br />
