               <br />
               is-an enormous district in area, and I think 
               <br />
               it would be fair to cut it down a little, and 
               <br />
               'so I propose to take off three ranges from

               <br />
               ranges into the district of Moosejaw. I 
               <br />
               think the district of Moosejaw can very 
               <br />
               well stand the addition of these three ranges.

               part of the map I propose to add a range 
               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">propose</span> to take a range line oﬁ Grenfell and

               by cutting off four ranges from the west of 
               <br />
               these districts. Then I propose to draw a

               ranges off the district of South Regina. By

               said that we should not go on the population 
               <br />

               it would be fair to go entirely on the vote

               taken four years ago; calculate that each

               entry is worth so many people, say three if 
               <br />
               you like; multiply each homestead entry 
               <br />
               by three, and by that means we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will,</span> arrive

               my hon. friend from Qu’Appelie suggest that

               Mr. LAKE. Certainly it is not a fair

               basis, to consider that a homestead entry in 
               <br />

               <br />
               lation of that country. If we ﬁnd a number

               <br />

               <br />
               country we shall not be very far out. I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that in these four districts of Moo- 
               <br />
               soniin, Whitewood, Grenfell and Wolseiey, 
               <br />
               which my hon. friend thinks is so 
               <br />
               unfair to suggest should be thrown into 
               <br />
               three, there was a census population in 
               <br />
               1901 as follows: Moosomin. 5,163: White- 
               <br />
               wood, 3,733; Grenfell, 3.950; “‘olseley, 
               <br />
               4,059 ; making a total of 16,911. There have 
               <br />
               been homestead entries in these four dis- 
               <br />
               tricts since the census was taken as fol- 
               <br />
               lows: In Moosomin, 631; in Whitewood, 
               <br />
               690; in Grenfell, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,038;</span> in Wolseley. 1.131; 
               <br />
               a total of 3,490. Now, I propose to multiply 
               <br />
               these homestead entries by three, and I get 
               <br />
               this result—that the homestead entries mean 
               <br />
               an addition to the population in these four 
               <br />
               districts since the census was taken of 
               <br />
               10,470. Add that to the census population, 
               <br />
               we get 27,421 as an estimated present popu- 
               <br />
               lation in these four districts. I may say that 
               <br />
               these four districts cast an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aggregate</span> vote 
               <br />
               last fall of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">5,(F1.</span> If we make them into 
               <br />
               three districts, we shall have a population 
               <br />
               unit of 9,140, and an average vote cast last 
               <br />
               fall in each of the three districts of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1,690.</span> 
               <br />
               Now, my hon. friend objected very strongly 
               <br />
               to my proposition to make four districts out 
               <br />
               of Souris, Cannington and Qu‘Appeile. I 
               <br />
               am going to present the same calculation in 
               <br />
               regard to them. The census population of 
               <br />
               these three districts in 1901 was as follows : 
               <br />
               Souris, 5,704; Cannington, 3,485; Qu'Appeile, 
               <br />
               5,530; a total of 14,719. There have been 
               <br />
               homestead entries made in these districts 
               <br />
               as follows : In Souris, 2,998 ; in Cannington, 
               <br />
               2,354; in Qu’Appelle, 2,865 : a total of 8.217, 
               <br />
               as against a total of 3,490 in my hon. 
               <br />
               friend‘s four districts. Multiply this total 
               <br />
               of homestead entries by three, and we get 
               <br />
               an estimated increase of population in these 
               <br />
               three districts of 24,651. Add that to the 
               <br />
               total census population of 14,719, and we get 
               <br />
               a present estimated population for these 
               <br />
               three districts of 39,370 as against 27,421 in 
               <br />
               my hon. friend’s four districts which I pro- 
               <br />
               pose to make into three. Now, if I make 
               <br />
               these three districts into four, there will be 
               <br />
               a population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unit</span> for each of the four dis- 
               <br />
               tricts of 9,842 as against a population unit 
               <br />
               of 9,140 for each of the three districts which 
               <br />
               I make out of the four districts of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend; and I ﬁnd that last fall we had 
               <br />
               an average vote in each of the four districts 
               <br />
               which I make out of these three districts of 
               <br />
               1.889 as against an average vote in each of 
               <br />
               the three districts which I make out of my 
               <br />
               hon. friend’s four districts'of 1,690. Does 
               <br />
               my hon. friend tell me that that is not fair ? 
               <br />
               Does he tell me that the suggestion he has 
               <br />
               made is a more equitable one ? His districts 
               <br />
               are less in area, less in vofes cast, less in 
               <br />
