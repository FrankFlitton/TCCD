               <br />
               We have and we will have in all probability 
               <br />
               two constituencies in which public opinion 
               <br />
               may be tested. We have North Oxford and 
               <br />
               no doubt we will have the city of London. 
               <br />
               Both of these constituencies are intelligent 
               <br />
               constituencies. Both of these constituencies 
               <br />
               are looked upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> as Liberal constitu- 
               <br />
               encies. In view of the prestige that a min-

               that if the constituency of the city of Lon-

               <br />
               Public Works (Mr. Hyman) is called upon 
               <br />
               to submit himself in a by—election there in

               <br />
               public opinion on this issue, there is an 
               <br />
               opportunity for this government to test pub- 
               <br />

               <br />
               this parliament and the Conservative party 
               <br />
               who differ from the government on this im- 
               <br />
               portant legislation will not be in a position 
               <br />
               to say that public-opinion has not been 
               <br />
               tested in London, an intelligent and suit-

               able constituency in which to test pub- 
               <br />
               lic opinion. The government have taken an 
               <br />
               undue and unfair advantage of the Conser- 
               <br />

               <br />
               because, outside of one thing alone, there

               <br />

               caused the government to stagger and to

               fessions, and by an interchange of ideas 
               <br />
               we are able to legislate intelligently on 
               <br />
               different questions. The Minister of Jus-

               tice and the legal members tell us what the 
               <br />
               meaning of the law is, and other gentle-
