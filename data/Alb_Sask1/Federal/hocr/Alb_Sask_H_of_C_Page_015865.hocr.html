               given this afternoon some ﬁgures that throw

               a great deal of light on this question. It is 
               <br />
               true that we are only four per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent-of</span> the

               to the speech delivered in 1890 in this par-

               liament by the late Hon. David Mills, who 
               <br />
               proved conclusively that there was no such

               thing as an oﬂicial language under the 
               <br />

               <br />
               guage ot‘ the majority of its inhabitants, 
               <br />
               and that when Canada was taken over by 
               <br />
               the English it was not necessary to put 
               <br />
               into the Treaty of Paris that French was

               with us and put into the constitution of

               was put into the constitution as far as this 
               <br />
               parliament is concerned and as far as the

               <br />
               cerned. and declare that the dual language 
               <br />
               shall be ofﬁcial in the Northwest Territor- 
               <br />
               ies ? Really, I cannot see, if my English- 
               <br />
               speaking friends are true to the traditions 
               <br />
               of their nation, why they should object to 
               <br />
               this. Do you think that the French Cana- 
               <br />
               dian people will be less loyal if their lan- 
               <br />

               <br />
               If there is a black page in the history of 
               <br />
               England it is the attempt to impose the 
               <br />
               English language and English ways of edu- 
               <br />
               cation upon the old iand of Ireland. For 
               <br />
               400 years the attempt has been made by 
               <br />
               force of bayonets to impose the English lan- 
               <br />
               guage upon an unwilling people. Think 
               <br />
               you that the Irish people have been thereby 
               <br />
               made more loyal, or that they Will be made
