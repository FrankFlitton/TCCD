               Moreover, clause <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">16,</span> as it has been amended

               by my hon. friend from Saskatchewan (Mr.

               Lamont), to my mind, will create a very 
               <br />
               strange position indeed. Of course, I voted 
               <br />
               for the amendment of my hon. friend when 
               <br />
               that amendment stood by itself before the 
               <br />
               committee because it was based on the true 
               <br />
               principle that it is the right of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rate-</span> 
               <br />
               payer and the father of a family to decide 
               <br />
               what kind of education his children shall 
               <br />
               receive. But when that amendment is con- 
               <br />
               nected with clause 16 it brings about a 
               <br />
               state of things which should 1be well put 
               <br />
               before the House and the country before a 
               <br />
               ﬁnal vote is given. According to clause 16. 
               <br />
               as now before the House, it will be the 
               <br />
               right of the majority of every school <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               trict in the new provinces to decide what 
               <br />
               kind of religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teaching</span> shall be given in 
               <br />
               the public schools. The legislatures will 
               <br />
               have no right whatever to interfere; and 
               <br />
               the result will be that if the majority 
               <br />
               should happen to be of any denomination 
               <br />
               other than Protestant or Roman Catholic 
               <br />
               that majority may decide that the religious 
               <br />
               education given in the public schools will 
               <br />
               be one that will suit neither Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               nor Protestants, and neither this House nor 
               <br />
               the legislature will have any power to in- 
               <br />
               terfere. In that case, where will be the 
               <br />
               minority ? My hon. friend to my left says 
               <br />
               they will not send their children to the 
               <br />
               schools. Then what becomes of the right of 
               <br />
               the minority to have the school teaching 
               <br />
               such as we are promised by this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amend</span> 
               <br />
               ment? The government press have been 
               <br />
               saying that the effect of the amendment of 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Saskatchewan (Mr. 
               <br />
               Lamont) will be to secure to the Catholics 
               <br />
               the right of having everywhere such reli— 
               <br />
               gious teaching as they desire. But in a 
               <br />
               district where the Greek Orthodox Church, 
               <br />
               or the Mormons, or Jews, or others who 
               <br />
               are neither Protestant nor Roman Catholic, 
               <br />
               are in a majority, they will be able to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dic&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               tate what kind of religious teaching will be 
               <br />
               had in the public schools, and a separate 
               <br />
               school cannot be formed by the secession of 
               <br />
               either the Protestant or Catholic minority. 
               <br />
               If the majority should be neither Catholic 
               <br />
               nor Protestant, you will deprive the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cattle</span> 
               <br />
               lies of any religious instruction in the pub- 
               <br />
               lic schools, and they will be deprived of 
               <br />
               their right to secede under section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">41</span> of the 
               <br />
               ordinances. So that their position would be 
               <br />
               worse than it is now. This answers the 
               <br />
               argument of my hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> opposition who said the amendment of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imy</span> hon. friend from Sasktchewan covered 
               <br />
               -my point and something more. What he 
               <br />
               ‘should have said is that the amendment, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,connected</span> with clause 16 of this Bill and 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lwith</span> clause 41 of the ordinances of 1901, 
               <br />
               does not cover my point, although it covers 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Isomething</span> never asked for by me or any- 
               <br />
               body else. It will prevent the local legisla—

               tures from dealing with the matter of reli-
