               Outside of that valley, I submit with all

               deference—and I do not think my state-

               <br />
               argument made today by my hon. friend

               friend that the petition which was.present-

               ed on that occasion for the whole people 
               <br />

               forgotten by my hon. friend and we have 
               <br />
               only to refer to the case to make it very 
               <br />
               plain. Here is the Bill of Rights. There 
               <br />
               have been several Bills of Rights, but it is 
               <br />
               not at all a point of any importance in this 
               <br />
               debate to ascertain which was the true Bill 
               <br />
               of Rights, whether it was the ﬁrst, or the 
               <br />
               second, or the third or the fourth. I think 
               <br />
               there is very little use of going into this 
               <br />
               debate because all the Bills of Rights were 
               <br />
               practically the same and differed only in 
               <br />
               a very few and minor details. This is the

               Northwest and for the whole of Rupert’s 
               <br />
               Land, it having been presented to cover 
               <br />
               the whole extent of what is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> Mani- 
               <br />

               <br />
               what is still Mackenzie and a part of Kee- 
               <br />
               watin, if not all, there would have been 
               <br />
               something in the argument of my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, but if under such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances.</span> 
               <br />
               when a broad petition of that kind was 
               <br />
               presented, it was not accepted, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span> accepted 
               <br />
               only in part it follows that the concession 
               <br />
               made as to the schools and as to the French 
               <br />
               language was restricted simply to the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Manitoba where it was granted. 
               <br />
               This seems to be so clear as not to be sus- 
               <br />
               ceptible of any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">controversy.</span> My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Jacques Cartier, and my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from Beauharnois have agreed that the peti— 
               <br />
