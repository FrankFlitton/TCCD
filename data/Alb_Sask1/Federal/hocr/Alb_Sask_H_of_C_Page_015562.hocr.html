               for North Toronto when he comes to deal 
               <br />
               with this question in detail. So far he 
               <br />
               admits that he has not made an argu- 
               <br />
               ment on that subject, but he says and 
               <br />
               says eloquently that there is unfairness 
               <br />
               and injustice and he threatens revenge 
               <br />
               just as some time ago he threatened dis- 
               <br />
               ruption of the constitution in regard to 
               <br />
               another question. He is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong</span> in 
               <br />
               threats, but we have to get used to these 
               <br />
               things. He is going to avoid all difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culty by referring this question to a com- 
               <br />
               mission of judges. I will admit that if 
               <br />
               it were. a questionof dividing the consti- 
               <br />
               tuencies so that no harm should be done 
               <br />

               mlssion of judges, or an impartial outside 
               <br />
               commission, might very well be appointed. 
               <br />
               But so far as this argument has gone that 
               <br />
               question has not arisen. Nothing has 
               <br />
               been placed before the House to show that 
               <br />
               any question has to be decided that can 
               <br />
               be decided by people outside of this House 
               <br />
               better than by people inside of this House. 
               <br />
               When we come to the actual division of 
               <br />
               the constituencies. then, I will admit, it
