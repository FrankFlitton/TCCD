               <br />
               trust that I have left no room for doubt as 
               <br />
               to my own position. 0n last 3rd November, 
               <br />
               in last January, on the 3rd of May when I 
               <br />
               voted for the general principle of autonomy 
               <br />
               and for the principles bound up in the main 
               <br />
               details of the measures, I deemed myself 
               <br />
               in honour bound, and at this moment I deem 
               <br />
               myself in honour bound, to oppose any auto- 
               <br />
               nomy scheme which will leave the North- 
               <br />
               west provinces for ever under these exemp- 
               <br />
               tions. As a whole, I believe the Bills pro- 
               <br />
               vide not only fair but generous terms. On 
               <br />
               that account, and further because of the 
               <br />
               other vexed and complicating difﬁculties 
               <br />
               which have arisen and which would almost 
               <br />
               necessarily have led to a contrary vote by 
               <br />
               me being misconstrued, I have not deemed 
               <br />
               it fair nor right to oppose the Bills nor to 
               <br />
               withdraw my support from the Prime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Min.</span> 
               <br />
               ister on the measures. But in view of the 
               <br />
               position which I held on this question be- 
               <br />
               fore my electors, I have open to me only one 
               <br />
               alternative. If the government and the 
               <br />
               House can see their way clear to adopt my 
               <br />
               amendment, I shall have redeemed the 
               <br />
               pledge upon which I accepted election in 
               <br />
               West Assinihoia. I therefore beg to move.

               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Mr. Speaker, 
               <br />
               I regret, as much as my hon. friend him- 
               <br />
               self who has spoken with a good deal of 
               <br />
               warmth on this subject, the necessity under 
               <br />
               which the government has found itself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im‘</span> 
               <br />
               pelled to introduce the section in the Bill to 
               <br />
               which he has taken such strong exception. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend is aware, and the House is 
               <br />
               aware also, that the party to which he and 
               <br />
               I belong did everything we could to prevent 
               <br />
               parliament from accepting that clause of 
               <br />
               the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway contract 
               <br />
               when it was submitted to parliament in the 
               <br />
               year 1881. Unfortunately the elforts we 
               <br />
               made at that time were unavailing; parlia- 
               <br />
               ment thought differently. That parliament 
               <br />
               made a mistake on that occasion I do not 
               <br />
               think is susceptible now of any discussion. 
               <br />
               However, even though parliament did make 
               <br />
               a mistake on that occasion, it is a rule 
               <br />
               which has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nevercbeen</span> violated, and which 
               <br />
               my hon. friend himself admits. that, even 
               <br />
               under such a sense of’mistake which would 
               <br />
               be shared by the parliament of this day, 
               <br />
               there is nothing to do but to abide loyally 
               <br />
               by what has been done; and I understand 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend himself does not pro- 
               <br />
               pose that parliament at this juncture should 
               <br />
               with a rough hand attempt to repudiate the 
               <br />
               engagement which was entered into in 1881. 
               <br />
               His amendment does not go that length, nor 
               <br />
               did he imply in his argument that we should 
               <br />
               attempt to give to the new provinces which 
               <br />
               we are now creating the power of taxing 
               <br />
               the property of the Canadian Paciﬁc Rail- 
               <br />
               way Company, in face of the exception 
               <br />
               which was made in its favour when the 
               <br />
               contract was entered into in 1881. The only 
               <br />
               amendment which my hon. friend wants to 
               <br />
               have made is a declaration to the effect that 
               <br />
               this clause which We insert in the Bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giv«</span> 
               <br />
               ing effect to the exemption contained in the 
               <br />
               Act respecting the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway 
               <br />
               Company, ‘shall not prejudice the right of 
               <br />
               the parliament of Canada, by expropriation 
               <br />
               or otherwise, to obtain the relinquishmenr 
               <br />
               by the said company of the company’s rights 
               <br />
               under section 16 of the contract as afore- 
               <br />
               said.’ The only answer I have to make to 
               <br />
               my hon. friend on this point is that the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment do not think it advisable to com- 
               <br />
               plicate this Bill further than it is at present 
               <br />
               by the unfortunate necessity of inserting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               the Bill the section which he wants thus 
               <br />
               amended. The parliament of Canada made 
               <br />
               a solemn contract with the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railw‘ay</span> Company. and this contract cannot 
               <br />
               be done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">away</span> with except in one of two 
               <br />
