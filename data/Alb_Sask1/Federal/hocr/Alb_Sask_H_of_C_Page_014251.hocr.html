               inconsistent with provincial autonomy in

               <br />
               well to notice the arguments urged by the re-

               <br />

               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argiment</span> is fallacious. The power con-

               that is, when it claimed for Manitoba the 
               <br />
               rights under section 22 of the Manitoba Act 
               <br />
               as opposed to section 93 of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act which departed materially 
               <br />
               from it. Therefore we have here the dis— 
               <br />
               sent of Lord Watson from the opinion laid 
               <br />
               down by Mr. Haultain and the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition that we must accept section 
               <br />
               93 without modiﬁcation as applicable to 
               <br />
               these provinces. 
               <br />

               But, Sir, I suppose that when the North- 
               <br />
               west Territories were admitted into con- 
               <br />
               federation, the Canadian parliament meant 
               <br />
               what it said. I take also for granted that 
               <br />
               when the Imperial Order in Council was 
               <br />
               adopted, the imperial government knew 
               <br />
               what it did. Upon what terms were those 
               <br />
               Territories admitted? I will again read 
               <br />
               section 146 to show the point I want to 
               <br />
               make. That section says:
