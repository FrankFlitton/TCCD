               <br />
               children get in separate schools. I want 
               <br />
               religion to be taught in the schools. I want 
               <br />

               was in favour of public schools; but he 
               <br />
               did so because he thought it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[the</span> best

               had before parliament a question very much 
               <br />
               like the present one. except that we were 
               <br />
               dealing with a state of things which was 
               <br />
               existing at that time, whilst at present we 
               <br />
               are creating a state of things. In 1896 the 
               <br />
               Manitoba school question was before parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. It had been before the country since 
               <br />
               1890. I heard the other day the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Brandon (Mr. Sifton) boast of hav- 
               <br />
               ing had a great deal to do with the Maui- 
               <br />
               toba school business. I was sorry to hear 
               <br />
               him talk like that, although he gave some 
               <br />
               reasons, in a very clever way, which hid, 
               <br />
               if I may use the word, the odious part of 
               <br />
               the business. He declared that the separate 
               <br />
               schools were not eﬂicient, that they were 
               <br />
               not what they should have been, and that 
               <br />
               money was squandered on them. I need 
               <br />
               not tell the House that those statements 
               <br />
               have been refuted time and time again. 
               <br />
               There may have been some abuses, as there 
               <br />
               are in most things. but on the whole the
