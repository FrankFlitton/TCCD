               <br />
               in the constitution. that their language shall 
               <br />
               be there for ever. My hon. friend from 
               <br />
               Montmagny (Mr. Armand Lavergne) this 
               <br />
               afternoon asked a question as to whether 
               <br />
               parliament had not the right to implant the 
               <br />
               French language in the new province. Sir; 
               <br />
               I answer to my hon. friend that I do not 
               <br />
               recognize that parliament has that right to 
               <br />
               implant the French language in those new 
               <br />
               Territories. Parliament may have the 
               <br />
               power to do so. but I deny that it has the 
               <br />
               right. Parliament has the power to do 
               <br />
               everything, but I deprecate the day when 
               <br />
               the French people of this country shall ask 
               <br />
               parliament to anything that they have the 
               <br />
               power to do if they have not at the 
               <br />
               same time the right to do it. These are the 
               <br />
               reasons for which I ask that this motion 
               <br />
               shall not be granted. These are the reasons 
               <br />
               why I say in the presence of friends and 
               <br />
               foes. in the hearing of the people in all parts 
               <br />
               of Canada and especially in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, that if we should grant this motion 
               <br />
               we would be granting the worst measure 
               <br />
               that could be granted for the protection even 
               <br />
               of the very people whom it intends to serve.
