               <br />
               a certain population based upon the number 
               <br />
               of voters on the list or on the number who 
               <br />
               voted, assuming the correctness of that 
               <br />
               estimate, why is it necessary in applying 
               <br />

               .Sir WILFRID LAURIER. Because in

               Ontario you were dealing with a compact 
               <br />

               <br />
               tories you are dealing with a moving and 
               <br />
               everchanging population, and you have an 
               <br />
               uneven population distributed over a large 
               <br />

               <br />
               North Toronto (Mr. Foster) has spoken of 
               <br />
               the feeling against the proposed distribu~

               many members in the north. For my part I

               appeals to excite division between the north

               tely withdraw the imputation, I do not 
               <br />
               want to impute motives to him. I do not:

               want to charge him with anything of that

               I have said, I simply refer him to the fact

               that the whole discussion we have had has 
               <br />
               been due simply to the rivalry between Cal- 
               <br />
               gary and Edmonton. And I repeat the 
               <br />
               only objection to Stony Plain having one 
               <br />
               member and to Athabaska having two is 
               <br />
               that being nearer Edmonton than Calgary, 
               <br />
               they will be more likely to vote for Edmon-
