               absolutely unpledged and without a man- 
               <br />
               date on this subject ? My hon. friend knows 
               <br />
               that there is only one answer to that. I will 
               <br />
               put another question to him. If the hon. ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior had stood out on 
               <br />
               his principle as he called it, would one 
               <br />
               single member from the Northwest have 
               <br />
               dared to go against him ? If he had stood 
               <br />
               out and if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> rest had stood out with him 
               <br />
               would the right hon. lead-er of the govern- 
               <br />
               ment have dared to have attempted to put 
               <br />
               through his Bill? That is the question. 
               <br />
               Therefore, there was an incentive and a 
               <br />
               motive either for the use of the pistol or 
               <br />
               the soporiﬁc. One or the other has been 
               <br />
               used undoubtedly as no man would have 
               <br />
               repudiated his principles and the record of 
               <br />
               a lifetime on a most grave question, unless 
               <br />
               there had been some further inducement
