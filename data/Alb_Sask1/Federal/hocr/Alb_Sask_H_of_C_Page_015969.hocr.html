               Mr. SCOTT. Evidently not. Well, in my 
               <br />
               own opinion, section 23 in these Bills means 
               <br />
               absolutely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing—or</span> at all events very lit-

               <br />
               the Bill, then it is fair, it is right, it is 
               <br />
               imperative that further notice be put in

               not intend to repeat my remarks—I con- 
               <br />
               tend that if the government in 1881 had 
               <br />
               power to make this contract and to pass 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law,</span> there is no necessity for this sec- 
               <br />
               tion in the Act, for that law would apply, 
               <br />
               and it cannot be overridden by local legis- 
               <br />
               lation afterwards. On the other ‘hand, if 
               <br />
               this law was ultra vires the parliament of 
               <br />
               Canada in 1881, then this parliament is not 
               <br />
               called upon to conﬁrm any portion of a con- 
               <br />
               tract that was ultra vires of parliament 
               <br />
               when it was made. There is a vast differ- 
               <br />
               ence between carrying out a contract made 
               <br />
               with a former parliament which contract 
               <br />
               was within the powers of that parliament, 
               <br />
               and carrying out a portion of a contract 
               <br />
               made that was not within the powers of 
               <br />
               parliament. If it was within the power 
               <br />

               40 minutes of the time of this House. He 
               <br />
               says that section 23 means nothing, there- 
               <br />
               fore he takes 40 minutes to ask us to strike 
               <br />
               it out. If it means nothing then striking 
               <br />
               it out means nothing. That is the position of 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman according to ’his own 
               <br />
               statement. That is hisown deﬁnition of the 
               <br />
               position which he occupies in taking up the 
               <br />
               time of the House to-night. If it means 
               <br />
               anything at all it means that a right which 
               <br />
               has been made with the Crown, conﬁrmed 
               <br />
               by the parliament of this country in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1881,,</span> 
               <br />
               may be taken away without compensation. 
               <br />
               If it has any meaning at all I would sup— 
               <br />
               pose it to mean that. or that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span>

               tempt to accomplish that result. I do not

               know what the hon. member for Kootenay
