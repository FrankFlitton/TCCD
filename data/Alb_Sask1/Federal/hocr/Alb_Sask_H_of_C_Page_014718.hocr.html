               not get an extension in that direction until 
               <br />
               I consult my native and beloved province

               perly said that to consult Quebec in this

               matter is an insult to the province of Mani— 
               <br />

               <br />
               Ontario should be consulted in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> 
               <br />
               but so far as the province of Quebec is 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(pacer-lied.</span> I do not think it is entitled to

               an extension to the north mean? As an 
               <br />
               agriculturist of the province of Manitoba, I 
               <br />
               would like to say a word upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> point. 
               <br />
               If we get our extension to the north we will 
               <br />
               have a deep water outlet, the natural outlet 
               <br />
               of that great western country and the pro- 
               <br />
               gressive government of Manitoba will im- 
               <br />
               mediately undertake the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction</span> of a 
               <br />
               line of railway to Hudson bay. What will 
               <br />
               that mean ? It will mean to the agriculture 
               <br />
               producers of that country that we are plac- 
               <br />
               ed 1.000 miles closer to the markets of the 
               <br />
               world than we are now. Any hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               men who know anything about transporting 
               <br />

               <br />
               to rtransport by water than by rail and 
               <br />
               therefore I claim as an agriculturist—it 
               <br />
               would be much to om- interests. and there

               <br />
               l'e-adjusting the affairs in the west, the gov— 
               <br />
               ernment will see ﬁt to give to the hospitals 
               <br />
               a large increase in the grant which they 
               <br />
               now receive. The provincial government 
               <br />
               gave last year to the hospital at Winnipeg 
               <br />
               the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">521387.37,</span> whereas this govern- 
               <br />
               ment only gave to the hospital the sum of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1653.27.</span> Owing to the facilities which the 
               <br />
               hospital offers to immigrants brought into 
               <br />
               this country, surely the federal government 
               <br />
               should deal more liberally With it.
