               It was the case of the Attorney General of 
               <br />
               Quebec against the Attorney General of the 
               <br />
               Dominion. It was held in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, that, under section 109, the lands 
               <br />
               in dispute reverted to the Crown in right 
               <br />
               of the province. In the courts of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec they held that upon the 
               <br />
               ground that, as the province had the ex— 
               <br />
               clusive right to legislate in regard to pro- 
               <br />
               perty and civil rights, it followed as a con- 
               <br />
               sequence that it might have legislated 
               <br />
               equally in regard to these lands, and con- 
               <br />
               sequently that these lands were the pro- 
               <br />
               perty of the province. And that judgment 
               <br />
               went through the courts and was main- 
               <br />
               tained in the Privy Council. Then there 
               <br />
               was the Mercer case in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ontario.</span> I speak 
               <br />
               of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tram</span> memory only and under cor- 
               <br />
               rection. The last court of appeal in On- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tario,</span> held that escheated lands fell to the 
               <br />
               Dominion, if I mistake not—the contrary 
               <br />
               of what our own Court of Appeals held. 
               <br />
               But the matter went to the Privy Council, 
               <br />
               and the Privy Council held that in the case 
               <br />
               of an escheat, the province had the right to 
               <br />
               the land under section 109. And, in the case

               the Queen, :1 case that lawyers will remem— 
               <br />
               ber, the question involved was as to an In- 
               <br />
               dian reservation which had been abandoned 
               <br />
               by the Indians. The Privy Council held 
               <br />
               that, under section 109 of the Confederation 
               <br />
               Act, these lands, abandoned by the Indians 
               <br />
               who were under control of the Dominion 
               <br />
               government and under the legislative con- 
               <br />
               trol of the Dominion parliament, fell into 
               <br />
               the provincial domain under section 109. 
               <br />
               The latest case I have is the case of the 
               <br />
               Attorney General of British Columbia VS. 
               <br />
               the Attorney General of Canada, in which 
               <br />
               the question arose in a still more pointed 
               <br />
               manner and in which, I think, the Privy 
               <br />
               Council went even further. In that case, 
               <br />
               as hon. members will remember, British 
               <br />
               Columbia had conceded to the Dominion 
               <br />
               government a forty-mile strip upon the line 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway for a con- 
               <br />
               sideration, I believe, of $100,000 a year. 
               <br />
               That was an absolute cession of the lands. 
               <br />
               Gold was found in that forty-mile strip, 
               <br />
               and the question arose as to whether the 
               <br />
               Dominion power or the provincial power 
               <br />
               had a right to that gold and the royalties 
               <br />
               upon it—which of the Powers owned the 
               <br />
               mineral wealth. In that case, if I remember 
               <br />
               aright, the Lords of the Privy Council held 
               <br />
               that the words ‘ British Columbia’ must be 
               <br />
               read into section 109 of the Confederation 
               <br />
               Act—that not only the four provinces then 
               <br />
               parties to the confederation compact, but, 
               <br />
               said the Lords of the Privy Council you 
               <br />
               must read into section 109 the names of 
               <br />
               British Columbia and all the provinces that 
               <br />
               have since been added to the Domin- 
               <br />
               and the right to this gold and 
               <br />
               royalties upon it is in the Crown 
               <br />
               right of the province. So I am

               <br />
               dence seems to favour the view that section 
               <br />
               109 is of a most general character, and 
               <br />
               that all lands belonging to the Crown, fall 
               <br />
               to the Crown in right of the province the 
               <br />
               moment that province is created. It was 
               <br />
               so understood in regard to the provinces 
               <br />
               that entered the Dominion since confeder- 
               <br />
               ation. It was so understood in regard to 
               <br />
               British Columbia. There was no special 
               <br />
               mention of the lands in the Order in Coun- 
               <br />
               cil by which the gates were opened to that 
               <br />
               province for its entry into confederation. 
               <br />
               Therevas no mention of lands in the Order 
               <br />
               in Council under which Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land came into confederation. But, in the 
               <br />
               case of British Columbia these lands, by 
               <br />
               the very vigour of the Confederation Act 
               <br />
               were supposed to remain the property of 
               <br />
               the province, and, in the case of Prince Ed—

               ward Island, where there were no public 
               <br />
               lands, the Dominion had to agree to a cer- 
               <br />
               tain sum to be given to the province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> 
               <br />
               lieu of public lands. So. I say, by com— 
               <br />
               mon understanding of section 109 and the 
               <br />
               interpretation put upon that section since 
               <br />
               our constitutional questions have arisen, it 
               <br />
               would seem to be evident that public lands, 
               <br />

               longed to the province the moment they

               vince. As a matter of fact, we did not 
               <br />
               purchase the landed rights. There was an 
               <br />
               amount given to the Hudson Bay Com- 
               <br />
               pany in consideration of the abandonment 
               <br />
               of its rights in that territory. But those 
               <br />
               rights were not rights in the lands, but 
               <br />
               hunting rights and commercial rights under 
               <br />
               charters obtained long ago under Charles 
               <br />
               11. But I do not think that those charters 
               <br />
               conferred any special title in the lands. So 
               <br />
               I do not think the hon. gentleman is right 
               <br />
               in saying what he does as to the purchase 
               <br />
               of the lands. The same remarks apply to 
               <br />
               that section of the Act in which we enjoin 
               <br />
               upon the province that it shall not interfere 
               <br />
               with the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. I ven- 
               <br />
               ture the opinion that that is not intra vires. 
               <br />
               We can create a province, but we have no 
               <br />
