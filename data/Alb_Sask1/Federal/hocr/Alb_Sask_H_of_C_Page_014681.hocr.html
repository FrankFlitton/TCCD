               The judges of the Supreme Court of Can- 
               <br />
               ada had decided that wherever a class of 
               <br />
               persons in any province or territory, a class 
               <br />
               of persons coming into the union with privi-

               leges granted by the law of their province

               <br />
               from which they came—that class of persons 
               <br />
               must be preserved in their privileges. It is 
               <br />
               self—evident and I believe that the opinion 
               <br />
               I am now giving can be upheld—that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">even</span>

               <br />
               eges conferred by the' law on that class of 
               <br />
               persons in that portion of territory. that 
               <br />
               class of persons would be entitled to 
               <br />
               claim in Canada the privileges and the

               <br />
               the Protestant minority, as I said be-

               generously granted by the parliament of

               never grants half measures, when it grants 
               <br />
               a measure of justice. That parliament
