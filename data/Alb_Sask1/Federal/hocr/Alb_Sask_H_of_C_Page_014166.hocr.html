               ting against this Bill on what may be called 
               <br />
               religious lines. I am not discussing their

               <br />
               ation is religion, and no one can contest 
               <br />
               that. I say that inevitably if the right hon.

               Sproule) and the hon. member for Jacques 
               <br />
               Cartier (Mr. Monk) and the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Beauharnois (Mr. Bergeron). There is 
               <br />
               nothing wrong in saying that. We all 
               <br />
               know that these gentlemen have their differ- 
               <br />
               ences on this question and could not agree. 
               <br />
               I say that the government then would have 
               <br />
               to be formed on religious lines, and that 
               <br />
               would be the greatest calamity that could 
               <br />

               in the presence of such a condition of things, 
               <br />
