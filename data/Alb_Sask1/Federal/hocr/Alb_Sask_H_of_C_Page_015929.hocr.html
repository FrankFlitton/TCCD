               I now ask the House to consider the in- 
               <br />
               trinsic merits of this question. There is a 
               <br />
               railway mileage involved in the two prOVin- 
               <br />
               ces of 750 miles, with six divisional points. 
               <br />
               Assume that this has a taxable value of 
               <br />
               $100000 for each three miles—and it is 
               <br />
               stocked and bohded for $193,500 for each 
               <br />
               three miles—and you have a total taxable 
               <br />
               value of $25,000.000 to-day. A tax of 5mills 
               <br />

               <br />
               would amount to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$125000</span> per annum. But 
               <br />
               it is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">particularly</span> for to-day or for the

               that the loss involved to these two new

               <br />
               perpetual inability to tax this property is a 
               <br />
               loss simply beyond calculation. The ex-
