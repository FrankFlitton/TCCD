               grapple with that subject and decide upon

               it without deliberate consideration. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub-</span> 
               <br />
               mit to the First Minister that this is a most 
               <br />
               important matter to the people of the west 
               <br />
               and that the government should not go it 
               <br />
               blindly, or ask their supporters to go it 
               <br />
               blindly upon the evidence which they have 
               <br />
               submitted to—day. What the people of that 
               <br />
               country desire is that they should have an 
               <br />
               opportunity of being heard in the matter; 
               <br />
               an opportunity of representing their case 
               <br />
               to somebody which will listen and give at- 
               <br />
               tention to it. I am not suggesting thatthey 
               <br />
               would not receive attention here, but 1 sub- 
               <br />
               mit that the evidence is not at hand which 
               <br />
               would enable the members of this House to 
               <br />
               decide what a fair electoral division of that 
               <br />
               country would be. The people of the west 
               <br />
               ' desire to have some independent tribunal 
               <br />
               before which these local constituencies could 
               <br />
               place their claims, such for instance that of 
               <br />
               the town of Olds which has forwarded a re- 
               <br />
               solution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protesting.that</span> they are placed 
               <br />
               right upon the line of two constituencies. I 
               <br />
               would urge on the First Minister that this 
               <br />
               is not a party matter. Local politics in that 
               <br />
               country have not hitherto been fought out 
               <br />
               on party lines, and probably they will not 
               <br />
               be in the next elections. This is a matter 
               <br />
               in which the government can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aﬂord</span> to be 
               <br />
               fair and to give to the respective portions 
               <br />
               of that country an opportunity of stating 
               <br />
               their case. If any person doubts my as- 
               <br />
               sertion that this is not aparty question, let 
               <br />
               him read the Liberal press in southern and 
               <br />
               central Alberta, and he will soon be assured 
               <br />
               that just as strong objections come from 
               <br />
               the Liberals as from the Conservatives. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister has expressed a desire to be 
               <br />
               fair, and he has now a grand opportunity 
               <br />
               of Showing to the people of that country 
               <br />
               that his professions are something more 
               <br />
               than empty sound. If the Prime Minister 
               <br />
               does not choose to accept the ﬁgures I have 
               <br />
               given him; if he prefers to listen to the men 
               <br />
               who happen to have his ear; then it is not 
               <br />
               unfair that I should ask on behalf of, I be- 
               <br />
               lieve, of 95 per cent of the people of southern 
               <br />
               and central Alberta, irrespective of politics, 
               <br />
               that they should have an opportunity of 
               <br />
               presenting their case to an independent tri- 
               <br />
               bunal. That is what they desire, and they 
               <br />
               will abide by the result knowing they must 
               <br />
               abide by it. If my suggestion is adopted by 
               <br />
               the government, it will have the effect of 
               <br />
               alleviating that sectional ﬁght between the 
               <br />
               north and the south which this division is 
               <br />
               going to continue for many years to come. 
               <br />
               I shall therefore move Mr. Chairman that 
               <br />
               the distribution be transferred to a judicial 
               <br />
               committee. But, before I read the amend- 
               <br />
               ment I might point out that in it I have 
               <br />
               speciﬁed that the personnel of the committee 
               <br />
               shall be the justices of the Supreme Court 
               <br />

               year 1881. and has lived in both the northern 
               <br />

               this motion with any desire of obtaining any 
               <br />

               of the three Supreme Court judges have 
               <br />

               ment; not that I am suggesting that their 
               <br />
               political views lean that way now, for I sup- 
               <br />
               pose they are expected to abandon politics 
               <br />
               when they go upon the bench. However, 
               <br />
               two out of these three judges have been re- 
               <br />
               cently appointed by this government and 
               <br />
               the third was appointed under the Conser- 
               <br />

               tion is manifestly fair, and it will I am sure 
               <br />
               satisfy the First Minister that no attempt
