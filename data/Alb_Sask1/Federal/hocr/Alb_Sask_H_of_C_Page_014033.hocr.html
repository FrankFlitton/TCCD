               garded by the right hon. gentleman and 
               <br />
               his colleagues at that time, that the whole

               summer passed away without any answer 
               <br />

               ister of the Northwest Territories. It was 
               <br />
               only in the stress of an election campaign

               fact that he had not answered those com- 
               <br />
               munications. They were written on May 19 
               <br />
               and June 1; and it was 011 September 30, 
               <br />
               after parliament had been dissolved, and 
               <br />
               when a campaign 'was actually in progress, 
               <br />
               that the right hon. gentleman was good 
               <br />
               enough to remember that he had not given 
               <br />
               any answer to the Prime Minister of the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. Then the matter 
               <br />
               seemed to him to possess a little more im—

               portance than he had previously considered.

               of those lands. He knows something of 
               <br />
               the history of this question. We remember 
               <br />
               that there were statesmen in Great Britain 
               <br />
               not many years ago who thought that the 
               <br />
               public lands not only of Canada but of all 
               <br />
               the dependencies of the empire should be 
               <br />
               retained under the control of the home gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, and administered not so much for 
               <br />
               the beneﬁt of the dependency in which they 
               <br />
               were situate as for the beneﬁt of the whole 
               <br />
               empire at large. But it was soon found, 
               <br />
               when it was attempted to put that view in 
               <br />
               practice, that it was absolutely impractic— 
               <br />

               <br />
               and might be safely entrusted, the entire

               pendency. The right hon. gentleman spoke 
               <br />
               of immigration. Does he not know that 
               <br />
               there is a new Quebec and a new Ontario ?
