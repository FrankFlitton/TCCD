               Speaker, in 1875 this parliament passed a

               law providing that Catholic and Protestant 
               <br />
               minorities in the Northwest should have the 
               <br />
               right to establish such schools as they 
               <br />
               thought ﬁt. There was no objection to that 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law‘;</span> why ? Sir John Macdonald was then 
               <br />
               the leader <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the opposition in this House, 
               <br />
               and why did he not object'to the establish-

               ment of separate schools in the Northwest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'3</span> 
               <br />
               Because he remembered the promise he had 
               <br />
               made in 1869 to those minorities. He re- 
               <br />
               membered that he. Lord Stra-thcona and the 
               <br />
               imperial government and Archbishop Taché 
               <br />
               had promised that the rights of the minori— 
               <br />
               ties in the Northwest should never be dis- 
               <br />
               turbed; and, faithful to his word, he did 
               <br />
               not object to that legislation, and the rights 
               <br />
               of the minorities were preserved. In 1880 
               <br />
               this parliament re-enacted most of the law 
               <br />
               which was passed in 1875. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey (Mr. Sproule) was then in 
               <br />
               the House, and I see by the Debates of that 
               <br />
               day that he made a speech—not on that 
               <br />
               question ; oh, no ; but he made a speech on 
               <br />
               some other question which was brought up 
               <br />
               on the same day on which the Bill was 
               <br />
               under consideration. Let us see what was 
               <br />
