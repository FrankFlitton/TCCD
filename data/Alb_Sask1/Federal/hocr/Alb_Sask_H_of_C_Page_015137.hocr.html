               Now, Mr. Speaker, we are called upon 
               <br />
               to add the little that is necessary in order 
               <br />
               to give full autonomy to these Territories. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst question to be considered is : Has 
               <br />
               parliament the power to legislate for these 
               <br />
               new provinces in the manner proposed? 
               <br />
               And the second question is: Are the pro- 
               <br />
               visions tor the establishment of these new 
               <br />
               provinces fair and reasonable in View of 
               <br />
               the conditions now existing in those Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories ? I will not repeat what I have 
               <br />
               just said about the Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1871.</span> But it has 
               <br />
               been suggested that the provisions of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act apply automati- 
               <br />
               cally to the new provinces. What that means, 
               <br />
               I must confess, I am somewhat at a loss to 
               <br />
               understand. I think I heard it suggest- 
               <br />
               ed by some that our authority in this par- 
               <br />
               liament is limited to the making of a de- 
               <br />
               claration that the territory affected is a 
               <br />
               province, and then the provisions of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act would be ap— 
               <br />
               plicable. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Is</span> that what is meant by say- 
               <br />
               ing that these provisions apply automatic- 
               <br />
               ally ? This might be possible with respect 
               <br />
               to those provisions that apply to all the 
               <br />
               provinces. But what of the others ? There 
               <br />
               are provisions that apply to Quebec, there 
               <br />
               are provisions that apply to Ontario, there 
               <br />
               are provisions that apply to Ontario and 
               <br />
               Quebec, there are provisions that apply to 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, there are provisions that 
               <br />
               apply to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; 
               <br />
               and there are some provisions that apply to 
               <br />
               all the provinces. Which of these would 
               <br />
               apply here ?

               had drafted the British North America Act

               to draft the Manitoba Act. How did they

               <br />
               where is the necessity for this section? The 
               <br />
               same thing applies to Prime Edward Island 
               <br />
               and to British Columbia. When British 
               <br />
               Columbia came into confederation, in 1871, 
               <br />
               those who are curious enough to look into 
               <br />
               the details of this matter will ﬁnd, in the 
               <br />
               Order in Council provision is made which is 
               <br />
               practically in terms identical with the sec- 
               <br />
               tion of this Bill. And the same thing 
               <br />
               applies to Prince Edward Island. In all 
               <br />
               these cases the terms of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act were applied to the new pro- 
               <br />
               vinoes, except so far as they may be varied 
               <br />
               or amended by the statute or the Order in 
               <br />
               Council. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Then it has been argued that the provi- 
               <br />
               sions of the British North America Act may 
               <br />
               be made applicable, but we have not the 
               <br />
               power to alter or vary the terms of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act. Here again I 
               <br />
               appeal to precedent. If we have no power 
               <br />
               to vary the British North America Act 
               <br />
               why did they insert in the Manitoba Act, 
               <br />
               in the Prince Edward Island Order in Coun- 
               <br />
               cil, and the British Columbia Order in Coun- 
               <br />
               cil, a provision that the sections of the 
               <br />
               British North America Act would be appli- 
               <br />
               cable to these provinces except in so far as 
               <br />
               they may be varied or altered by the Act 
               <br />
               or by the Order in Council ? If we are in 
               <br />
               error, it seems to me, we have ample <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre«</span> 
               <br />
               cedent for our error. On that branch of 
               <br />
               my argument, the conclusion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> come to is, 
               <br />
               that we have the power to give to these 
               <br />
               provinces such a constitution or adminis- 
               <br />
               tration as this parliament deems it exped- 
               <br />
               ient to give. But the most that can be 
               <br />
               said in favour of those who take the con- 
               <br />
               trary view—and it has not been said so far 
               <br />
               as I am aware—is that inasmuch as the 
               <br />
               British North America Act, 1871, provides 
               <br />
               that the parliament of Canada may from 
               <br />
               time to time establish ‘ prdvinces,’ the word 
               <br />
               ‘provinces’ as so used must be interpreted 
               <br />
               having regard to the meaning of that word 
               <br />
               in the British North America Act, 1867, and 
               <br />
               therefore the province so established must 
               <br />
               be an institution corresponding generally 
               <br />
               with the provinces whose constitution is 
               <br />
               fixed in the British North America Act. 
               <br />
               Admitting, for the sake of argument, that 
               <br />
               that is so, it can only require that the new 
               <br />
               provinces shall be constituted, as to cor- 
               <br />
               respond in powers with the other provinces 
               <br />
               so far as, with regard to any subject or 
               <br />
               class of subjects the power: of all the 
               <br />
