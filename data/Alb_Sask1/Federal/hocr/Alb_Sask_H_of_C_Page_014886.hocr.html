               tended that all the rights and privileges ac- 
               <br />
               corded by the Act of 1875 should be pre- 
               <br />
               served to the minority in these two new pro-

               <br />
               the late Minister of the Interior says, in—

               Now, when dissatisfaction was expressed,

               and it became so great as I have already
