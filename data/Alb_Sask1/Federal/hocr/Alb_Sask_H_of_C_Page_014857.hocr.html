               <br />
               tility, and undoubted possibilities would be 
               <br />
               unparalleled in the world. I belieVe it was 
               <br />
               coming to Manitoba and I would like to 
               <br />
               take up a little time tO—night in telling you 
               <br />
               why I believe it was coming to Manitoba. 
               <br />
               Some hon. gentlemen have compared Mani- 
               <br />
               toba to a postage stamp. 
               <br />
               postage stamp? A postage stamp occupies 
               <br />
               a very small space on the corner of a letter. 
               <br />
               but it is the postage stamp that makes the 
               <br />
               letter go. There is no question about that. 
               <br />
               I can prove beyond a doubt that Manitoba 
               <br />
               has made that great western country go. 
               <br />
               i t has been the port "of entry and it has been 
               <br />
               the experimental farm for the Whole North- 
               <br />
               west. I see upon the other side of the 
               <br />
               House the hon. member for Winnipeg (Mr. 
               <br />
               Bole), and if I am not mistaken he will 
               <br />
               bear out what I have to say. I claim that the 
               <br />
               Dominion of Canada had the right to ex- 
               <br />
               tend the borders of Manitoba, and being 
               <br />
               from Manitoba and being particulaly inter- 
               <br />
               ested in that country which has been my 
               <br />
               home for about 22 years, I am sure hon. 
               <br />
               members of the House will excuse me if 
               <br />
               I try to prove why we should have our ter- 
               <br />
               ritory extended westward. As I said before. 
               <br />
               it has been the great experimental farm. 
               <br />
               Twenty-ﬁve years ago our hon. friends op- 
               <br />
               posite did not have very much use for Mani- 
               <br />
               toba and the west. They absolutely opposed 
               <br />
               any expenditure of money in that country. 
               <br />
               They opposed to the hilt the building of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. I assure you, Sir, 
               <br />
               that the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway has done 
               <br />
               great things for that country notwithstanding 
               <br />
               the fact that freights were high in those 
               <br />
               early times. Perhaps they had to be high 
               <br />
               because the country was sparsely settled 
               <br />
               and they had to go all around the north 
               <br />
               shore of Lake Superior before they reached a 
               <br />
               country that would give them any business. 
               <br />
               I would like to call the attention of the 
               <br />
               House, because I am exceedingly anxious 
               <br />
               to prove what I say. re the opinions ex— 
               <br />
               pressed in former times by leaders of 
               <br />
               the Liberal party as to the value of that 
               <br />
               country. It was only the untiring energy 
               <br />
               of men like Sir Charles Tupper who never 
               <br />
               gave up, that carried through the great 
               <br />
               project of the building of the Canadian 
               <br />
               Paciﬁc Railway. We heard the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Customs (Mr. Paterson) in loud 
               <br />
               tones the other night announce the prosper- 
               <br />
               ity of this country, but I say, without fear 
               <br />
               of contradiction in this House, that if that 
               <br />
               western country is prosperous to-day it is 
               <br />
               due to the Liberal—Conservative party. When 
               <br />
               these hon. gentlemen talk about the pros- 
               <br />
               perity of the country it reminds me very 
               <br />
               much of the time when we were boys on the 
               <br />
               farm. One boy would crawl under the barn 
               <br />
               and the other would go and ﬁnd a hen’s 
               <br />
               nest. When he had found the hen’s nest we 
               <br />
               would run to our mother and say: Look at 
               <br />
               the hen’s nest we have found. The boy who 
               <br />
               had crawled under the barn and had noth- 
               <br />
               ing to do with the ﬁnding of the hen’s nest

               for less than $10 an acre. But what position

               did the leaders of these hon. gentlemen take

               As you know the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway

               were to receive 20,000 acres of land per

               mile. Mr. Blake, as reported in ‘Hansard’

               <br />
               calculates it at $2 an acre. I do not believe

               the House will accept that calculation. I

               <br />
               at. It is an entirely absurd calculation to say 
               <br />
               that these 1,700,000 acres are worth $2 an

               acre to this country. Even valuing them at 
               <br />

               They proceeded to the consideration of the
