               I have read that draft Bill and I fail to

               It seems to me that if a question arises on 
               <br />
               which the difference of opinion between one 
               <br />

               <br />
               then. he is not doing his duty to his con—

               taking any part in the discussion of that 
               <br />
               question when it comes up. It strikes me 
               <br />
               that if I were in such a connection, I would 
               <br />
               lose no opportunity to make myself heard.

               lation which seemed to me so far wrong. 
               <br />
               Those hon. gentlemen who have resigned 
               <br />

               ii: the cabinet who take the same view, 
               <br />
               it seems to me that, even though they differ 
               <br />
               with their colleagues they might as well 
               <br />

               Mr. SPROULE. That is the statement as 
               <br />
               I took it down. Had it not been that the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice displayed so much 
               <br />
               warmth and declared that he could prove 
               <br />
               his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement,</span> while at the same time ﬂour- 
               <br />
               ishing a document as though it contained the 
               <br />
               proof, I would not have paid so much atten- 
               <br />
               tion to his statement. But he made the 
               <br />
               statement that these' petitions emanated 
               <br />
               from the same source as the others. And 
               <br />
               just before that he had attributed the dis- 
               <br />
               tribution of these petitions in Ontario to 
               <br />
               myself. Had he not thus, by implication at 
               <br />
               least, attributed the distribution of these 
               <br />
               petitions to myself. I would not have paid 
               <br />
               any attention to the matter. If any one in 
               <br />
               this House could know whether his allega-
