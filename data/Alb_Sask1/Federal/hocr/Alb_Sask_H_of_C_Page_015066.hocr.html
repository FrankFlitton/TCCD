               of constitutional law. The Liberal party as 
               <br />
               a whole studied very carefully indeed, not 
               <br />
               only constitutional law generally, but con- 
               <br />
               stitutional law as it related to education in 
               <br />
               provinces. They studied and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussed</span> and 
               <br />
               debated, and formed very strong opinions on 
               <br />
               that question ; and I may say that my own 
               <br />
               feelings and views on that question to-night 
               <br />
               are largely coloured by the debates and the 
               <br />
               feeling of that time. I have noticed also 
               <br />
               that the speakers who have discussed this 
               <br />
               matter, the laymen if not the legal men, 
               <br />
               have announced that they had no intention 
               <br />
               of discussing the legal question; and yet 
               <br />
               they have not been speaking for more than 
               <br />
               ten or ﬁfteen minutes before they have been 
               <br />
               led into the temptation, and have been dis— 
               <br />
               cussing the constitutional features of the 
               <br />
               question. While the legal question is dis- 
               <br />
               cussed by legal men. we laymen have also 
               <br />
               to consider it as judges. We do not ap- 
               <br />
               proach the matter as advocates but rather 
               <br />
               as jurymen, and we have the beneﬁt, in all 
               <br />
               the arguments which have been presented 
               <br />
               by the legal men, of what I may call pre~ 
               <br />
               digested food. I may say also that if legal 
               <br />
               minds only are capable of arguing and de- 
               <br />
               bating and coming to a- decision on these 
               <br />
               questions, it naturally follows that they will 
               <br />
               reach the same conclusion; and yet in this 
               <br />
               instance we ﬁnd legal men differing just 
               <br />
               as much as laymen could possibly differ. 
               <br />
               So that there is no absolute certainty of a 
               <br />
               proper result from the fact that legal men 
               <br />
               happen to be arguing the case. However, it 
               <br />
               is not a matter of preference on the part of 
               <br />
               laymen. I myself would have preferred 
               <br />
               very much if this matter had not been left 
               <br />
               to a decision in this way. I would have pre— 
               <br />
               ferred that a decision of the courts on these 
               <br />
               questions had been obtained before the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment proceeded to act. I would not 
               <br />
               claim that a decision of the Privy Council 
               <br />
               would be necessarily better than a decision 
               <br />
               of this government or of the Supreme Court 
               <br />
               of Canada. But it would be a decision of 
               <br />
               the ﬁnal court of appeal, and it would be 
               <br />
               acceptable even by those who did not favour 
               <br />
               it, and action based on a decision of that 
               <br />
               kind would .not be attacked—those attacking 
               <br />
               it would be undermined by the very quota- 
               <br />
               tion of such a decision. I regret exceedingly 
               <br />
               that before this legislation was introduced 
               <br />
               such a decision was not obtained. To as- 
               <br />
               sume that we have the power to act is, I 
               <br />
               think, unwisein the face of the opposition; 
               <br />
               but if we are forced to face it, where then 
               <br />
               does the battle lie ? We can trust the legal 
               <br />
               men at least to produce everything in that 
               <br />
               way. We have sections 93 and 146 of the 
               <br />
               Act of 1867 brought forward ; we have the 
               <br />
               Imperial Acts of 1871 and 1886 and the Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie Act of 1875 ; we have the-ordinances 
               <br />
               and the regulations : and we have such ques- 
               <br />
               tions as: does section 93 act automatically, 
               <br />
               and if so when <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> Has it been modiﬁed, and 
               <br />
               if so, what is the date of the modiﬁcation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘3</span> 
               <br />
               Has this parliament power to act, and if so. 
               <br />
               how is it to exercise that power, and must

               it exercise it ? We have also the fact that 
               <br />
               almost all the speakers declare that they 
               <br />
               are on the ground of the constitution, a very 
               <br />
               good place indeed to be ; and I must believe 
               <br />
               that the Act of 1867 is the real rock of the 
               <br />
               constitution, that.wherever it is applicable 
               <br />
               it should be the foundation, that at all events 
               <br />
               the spirit of the Act of 1867 is actually the 
               <br />
               spirit of the confederation of the provinces 
               <br />
               which make up this Dominion. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               The Act of 1867 was a special bargain 
               <br />
               between certain provinces which came to- 
               <br />
               gether to form confederation; and like all 
               <br />
               bargains it was made with an eye to the 
               <br />
               special circumstances immediately before 
               <br />
               them, each province looking to its own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par</span> 
               <br />
               ticular interests and safeguarding what. it 
               <br />
               valued the most—refusing to concede any- 
               <br />
               thing likely to injure it. When this bargain 
               <br />
               was completed, then—ani then only—was 
               <br />
               provision made for future additions to con- 
               <br />
               federation—for the addition of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfound&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               land, British Columbia, Prince Edward Is- 
               <br />
               land, Ruperts Land, and the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories. They did not make a very speciﬁc 
               <br />
               provision for these additions. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> They 
               <br />
               saw that they might conic. They knew the 
               <br />
               bargain that they had made for themselves, 
               <br />
               and they thought it would be sufﬁcient to 
               <br />
               provide that any additions of these other 
               <br />
               provinces and Territories would be subject 
               <br />
               to the provisions of the Act they had 
               <br />
               agreed to. That, I think was the whole 
               <br />
               spirit of the Act. I doubt if any one of 
               <br />
               these provinces would have gone into con- 
               <br />
               federation had they been told: We will 
               <br />
               make this bargain with you to-day as it 
               <br />
               stands, but we may to—morrow introduce 
               <br />
               another element into confederation and 
               <br />
               deal with it in an entirely different manner 
               <br />
               and spirit. They evidently considered that 
               <br />
               the provision ‘ <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject</span> to the provisions of 
               <br />
               this Act’ was to be the spirit which would 
               <br />
               govern all future additions to confederation. 
               <br />
               It is not likely that the different parties 
               <br />
               then entering confederation had any spe- 
               <br />
               cific thought in their minds of a territorial 
               <br />
               form of government in any part of the coun- 
               <br />
               try before it became a province. That is 
               <br />
               one of the misfortunes in the case. The 
               <br />
               law itself is, I think, a very creditable law 
               <br />
               for the purposes which they had in view; 
               <br />
               but like all other laws, it will not at all 
               <br />
               suit other circumstances and conditions to 
               <br />
               the same extent, and it is but imperfectly 
               <br />
               ﬁtted to the present set of circumstances. 
               <br />
               The trouble with us now is that we are 
               <br />
               literally trying to bring into this law certain 
               <br />
               meanings and applications that perhaps 
               <br />
               were not foreseen or intended at all ; and it 
               <br />
               is probably a defect of the legal mind that 
               <br />
               it insists that because this is the law it 
               <br />
               must be made applicable in some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> 
               <br />
               might easily happen that such a law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">w1.=l</span> 
               <br />
               not in any one case ﬁt the circumstances. 
               <br />
               The ﬁrst question we have to decide is ' 
               <br />
               whether this parliament has the requisite 
               <br />
               authority to pass such a law. The ques-
