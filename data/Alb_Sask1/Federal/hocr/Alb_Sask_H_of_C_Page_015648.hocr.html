               ments of the Minister of the Interior; and, 
               <br />
               ﬁrst, with regard to his observation that 
               <br />
               the opposition were apparently coming 
               <br />
               down one seat a day. I submit that no 
               <br />
               such interpretation can be placed upon our 
               <br />
               action. At the outset we proved beyond 
               <br />
               contradiction—by simply. calling attention 
               <br />
               to the map of the local seats as distributed by 
               <br />
               the Northwest legislature in 1902—that there 
               <br />
               were nine seats given to the southern por- 
               <br />
               tion and six seats given to the northern 
               <br />
               portion. We showed by simply-pointing to 
               <br />
               the map that that distribution by the looal 
               <br />
               legislature was a fair one, and we stated 
               <br />
               that it had been decreed by a non-partisan 
               <br />
               government after all localities in the coun- 
               <br />
               try had been represented and had had an 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity</span> of stating their views. We 
               <br />
               showed that in that distribution there were 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> that time three local seats, or only a 
               <br />
               part of three seats, north of the northern 
               <br />
               limit of railway construction, and we show 
               <br />
               that under this proposed distribution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> 
               <br />
               day there are now eight seats north of the 
               <br />
               northern limit of railway construction. 
               <br />
               We showed that in the southern country, 
               <br />
               urder the distribution of 1902, there were 
               <br />
               eight seats south of the main line of the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway, and we show 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> these eight have only been in— 
               <br />
               creased to nine. We have therefore proven 
               <br />
               very clearly indeed that if the local dis— 
               <br />
               tribution of 1902 was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fair.</span> this proposed 
               <br />
               distribution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> manifestly unfair. The sug- 
               <br />
               gestion has been made on the other side 
               <br />
               that the local distribution was unfair, and 
               <br />
               in answer we have pointed out that no 
               <br />
               complaint has ever been made in the local_ 
               <br />
               assembly against it; and if .there had been 
               <br />
               complaint, there is no doubt that gentle— 
               <br />
               men opposite would have been informed of 
               <br />
               it. In order to justify the division which 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> government now proposes, they must 
               <br />
               proceed upon the assumption that all the 
               <br />
               development has been in the northern part 
               <br />
               of the country, and that the southern part 
               <br />
               has been at a standstill, or has just sufﬁ—

               <br />
               tell the government that we will take their 
               <br />
               own distribution of 1903. Let me say that 
               <br />
               when that redistribution was made in this 
               <br />
               House all the members from that part of

               the country were supporters of the Liberal 
               <br />
               government. Notwithstanding that, we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as»</span> 
               <br />
               sume that when the division was made in 
               <br />
               1903 this government gave fair and equal 
               <br />
               representation to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> sections of 
               <br />
               the country. We have the facts here to 
               <br />
               prove that there has been a greater influx 
               <br />
               into the southern portion 
               <br />
               than there has been into the northern por-

               tion for the last three years, but we do not 
               <br />
               insist upon that; we simply adopt the de- 
               <br />
               cision ot' the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> in 1903, and ask 
               <br />
               them to give these different sections of the

               live to Alberta, one to the portion of East 
               <br />

               to prevent a certain section of that country 
               <br />
               being represented at all. That is not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact,</span> 
               <br />
               and in order to demonstrate that it is not 
               <br />
               a fact, I may say that I had an alternative 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schedule</span> prepared, and in that schedule I 
               <br />
               proposed that Athabaska should get one

               portion of that country should not have re— 
               <br />
               presentation, but we do desire that no sec—
