               <br />
               he said in reply to my inquiry at that time 
               <br />
               was very excellent in its way. He cited

               constitutional authorities as to the course 
               <br />
               which should be adopted upon the formation 
               <br />
               of a government and he read certain quota-

               <br />
               a matter of this kind the inquiry is one 
               <br />

               pressed perhaps in so violent a way as
