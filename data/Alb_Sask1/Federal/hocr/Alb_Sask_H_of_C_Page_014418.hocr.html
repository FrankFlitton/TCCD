               Mr. WALTER SCOTT. When you left the 
               <br />
               chair at six o‘clock, Mr. Speaker, I was 
               <br />
               commenting upon the violent difference

               <br />
               contained in his speech. The proposals of 
               <br />
               the government contemplate a payment in 
               <br />
               lieu of the public domain to these two new 
               <br />
               provinces aggregating $750,000 per annum at 
               <br />
               the beginning; as the population of the 
               <br />
               provinces increases, this payment is to 
               <br />
               increase to an amount in the future 
               <br />
               of $2,225,000 per annum. The gentleman 
               <br />
               from Carleton (Mr. R. L. Borden) objects 
               <br />
               to these proposals and suggests instead that 
               <br />
               the public domain should be transferred to 
               <br />
               the management of the provincial govern- 
               <br />
