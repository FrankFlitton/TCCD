               Mr. BERGERON. Is that so ? Well, that 
               <br />
               is something new. Who will say that we 
               <br />
               have not to deal with a very religious party? 
               <br />
               They are an courant with all matters in 
               <br />
               the province of Quebec. The Charlevoix 
               <br />
               election took place in 1875 or 1876. Before 
               <br />
               that we did not hear of any trouble. We 
               <br />
               had bishops and priests—good bishops and 
               <br />
               good priests; at least, everybody thought 
               <br />
               so and said so. Although I was young then, 
               <br />
               I do not remember <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hearing</span> any fault found 
               <br />
               with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> clergy of our province. In that elec- 
               <br />
               tion in Charlevoix it seems there were some 
               <br />
               indiscretions committed by the clergy. They 
               <br />
               were called undue inﬂuence. The Liberal 
               <br />
               party at that time, indeed the Liberal party 
               <br />
               or this Country has never been an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orthodox</span> 
               <br />
               party, and my right hon. friend knows it. 
               <br />
               The Canadian Club of that time, in the 60’s 
               <br />
               and the Club St. Jean Baptiste of Mon- 
               <br />
               treal, knew something about it. They 
               <br />
               belonged to the old Liberal school of 
               <br />
               France, they were far from being religious, 
               <br />
               and they have preached their ideas in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec, and that is why the 
               <br />
               Liberal party were distrusted by the people 
               <br />
               of Quebec. They had clubs <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">like</span> the Insti- 
               <br />
               tute Canadien and other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions</span> of that 
               <br />
               kind, where they were not at all bashful in 
               <br />
               expressing their opinion about the clergy 
               <br />
               from the bishops down. No wonder then 
               <br />
               that the population of Quebec, being a reli- 
               <br />
               gious population, distrusted them and were 
               <br />
               unwillingto conﬁde their interests in their 
               <br />
               hands. That explains why they were in 
               <br />
               opposition for so many years. But during 
               <br />
               that election they took hold of this question 
               <br />
               of undue inﬂuence and brought it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[before</span> 
               <br />
               the courts and succeeded. It is true it was 
               <br />
               proved rthat some cunés had gone out 
               <br />
               of their way, had been over zealous. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, we read every Monday morning in the 
               <br />
               newspapers of Protestant ministers who 
               <br />
               have been over zealous in their remarks. I 
               <br />
               do not blame the Anglicans for that, I do 
               <br />
               not blame the Presbyterians, nor the Bap- 
               <br />
               tists, nor the Methodists, as a body. I do 
               <br />
               not hold them responsible because one or 
               <br />
               two ministers are too enthusiastic. So 
               <br />
               probably some of the Quebec cures were in- 
               <br />
               discreet. The election was voided. and an- 
               <br />
               other election took place, and again :1 Con—

               <br />
               other of these side issues. Because they 
               <br />
               were not able to ﬁght their opponent with 
               <br />
               a serious policy, they had recourse to things 
               <br />
               of that sort. When the Manitoba school

               to them. And how did it come about ? Our 
               <br />
               friend, the late Dalton McCarthy, had gone 
               <br />
               to Manitoba and spoken there very elo- 
               <br />
               quently. He told these people what they 
               <br />
               should do, and his propaganda took well.

               The Manitoba <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> took hold of it, 
               <br />
               and I have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubt</span> in my own mind that 
               <br />
               my right hon. friend had nothing at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> to 
               <br />
               do with it, or any of his friends. The Man- 
               <br />
               itoba government was over ears engaged 
               <br />
               in some railway deals, and they had to di- 
               <br />
               vert public opinion if possible. They saw 
               <br />
               that Mr. McCarthy had had great success 
               <br />
               in preaching against separate schools and 
               <br />
               against the ofﬁcial use of the French lan- 
               <br />
               guage, and they took hold of his teachings 
               <br />
               themselves. In 1890 they abolished the sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools and the French language. They 
               <br />
               did more than that. As I said the other day, 
               <br />
               they kept $14,000 worth of the property of 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics, they have got it yet, they 
               <br />
               have never given it back to the Roman 
               <br />
               Catholic minority of Manitoba. From 1890 
               <br />
               to 1896 what did we see ? What a spectacle 
               <br />
               there was in this country i The Minister of
