               <br />
               being held. Both the Prime Minister and 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior stated this af- 
               <br />
               ternoon that these lands are of great im- 
               <br />
               portance to the people of the west, and 
               <br />
               that if they were handed over to them they 
               <br />
               would have to depend very largely upon 
               <br />
               these lands for revenue. They argued that 
               <br />
               the provinces would be less likely to take 
               <br />

               ion government to whom these lands are of 
               <br />
               much less moment. I should think that ar- 
               <br />
               gument would work the other way. These 
               <br />
               lands are of direct local concern to the 
               <br />
               people of the province, and in my view 
               <br />
               the province is more likely to take good 
               <br />
               care of them than is the Dominion. 1 do 
               <br />
               not know why we should suppose that the 
               <br />
               people of the Northwest are any more reck- 
               <br />
               less, any less capable or any less honest

               than the people of Canada as a whole, or 
               <br />
               why the representatives of the people of the 
               <br />
               west assembled in their legislature would 
               <br />

               less provident than the people of Canada as 
               <br />

               <br />
               provident, or less honest, surely they would 
               <br />

               Mr. OLIVER. I do not know exactly 
               <br />
               what the suggestion of charging an annual 
               <br />

               <br />

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I will tell you. The 
               <br />
               hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentleman,</span> (Mr. Oliver) said that these 
               <br />
               lands could not be developed because there 
               <br />
               is no market for the coal, and therefore, to 
               <br />
               follow out his argument to its logical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span> 
               <br />
               sult; it is a wise policy to sell these lands 
               <br />
               to speculators who will hold them until 
               <br />
               there is a market, and pay nothing to the 
               <br />
               public revenue while the increment of 
               <br />
               value is being added. I say that is not 
               <br />
               good policy, I say that in the meantime 
               <br />
               these speculators should pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an,</span> annual 
               <br />
               rental to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public</span> treasury in order to give 
               <br />
               at least some compensation for the enorm- 
               <br />
               ous proﬁts which they in the end will make 
               <br />
               out of these coal lands.
