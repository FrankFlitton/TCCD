               said on both sides in this House, I doubt 
               <br />
               whether 1 per cent of the electors of this 
               <br />
               country really know where they are. Now, 
               <br />
               Sir, I think this disposes of the argument 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theiminority</span> are satisﬁed, as it also dis— 
               <br />
               poses of the argument that the English-

               speaking majority in this parliament and in 
               <br />
               this country are not prepared to do justice. 
               <br />
               Now we are told that the second clause is 
               <br />
               clearer than the ﬁrst. It is clearer on one 
               <br />
               point, that it leaves so little advantage to 
               <br />
               the Roman Catholics that it is not worth 
               <br />
               mentioning. Is that a ground on which this 
               <br />
               government should stand as the defenders 
               <br />
               of the minority ‘3 It is stated that some sac-

               majority. I do not know why. Is it because 
               <br />
               the English Protestant people have demand- 
               <br />
               ed it? No. Sir. The division between the 
               <br />
               Protestant people of this country has been 
               <br />
               as to whether there should be any separate 
               <br />
               schools in the Northwest at all. The ma- 
               <br />
               jority of Canadians do not split hairs, the 
               <br />
               people of this country have already pro- 
               <br />
               nounced upon the question as to Whether we 
               <br />
               will give separate schools to the Northwest. 
               <br />
               If I asked to-day for the establishment of 
               <br />
               such separate schools in the Northwest as 
               <br />
               the Protestants enjoy in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec. at ﬁrst sight perhaps they would 
               <br />
               not be willing to grant them. But I say that 
               <br />
               when we reduce our demands to the mere 
               <br />
               right of separation, the Protestant people
