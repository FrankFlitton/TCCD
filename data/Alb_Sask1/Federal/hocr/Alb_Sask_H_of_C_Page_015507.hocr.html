               <br />
               the existing districts, these constituencies

               <br />
               Under such circumstances, it was necessary 
               <br />
               to form one or two districts in which the

               The present constituencies are the basis we

               whole basis, and how they have arrived at 
               <br />
               the basis. The Prime Minister evidently 
               <br />
               knew nothing about it. Is the Minister of 
               <br />
               the Interior going to make the same confes- 
               <br />
               sion ? I may tell him straight that he will 
               <br />
               not get anywhere with his Bill until he 
               <br />
               makes the most ample and full explanation 
               <br />
               of the basis, the way in which he has ap- 
               <br />
               plied the principles, and showed to us that 
               <br />
               it is fair and reasonable.

               Mr. OLIVER. The map has been before

               ﬁve weeks. I have stated to the House the

               basis upon which the representation was 
               <br />

               to him that while there is no effort on the

               the arrogant manner in which hon. gentle-
