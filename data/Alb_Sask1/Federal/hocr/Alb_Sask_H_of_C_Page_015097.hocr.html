               Legislation by reference, which was increas- 
               <br />
               ing in 1876, and has since that date still fur- 
               <br />
               ther developed, was described by the committee 
               <br />
               as making an Act ambiguous, so obscure and so 
               <br />
               difficult that the judges themselves can hardly 
               <br />
               assign a meaning to it, and the ordinary citizen 
               <br />
               cannot understand it without legal advice.

               That was in 1875. Since then the prac- 
               <br />
               tice has been gradually discontinued and 
               <br />
               is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> looked upon with disfavour in the 
               <br />
               British House of Commons. I think that 
               <br />
               is a good reason Why the Bill should not 
               <br />
               be approved of in its present form. Now, 
               <br />
               I claim that it is unwise to stereotype and 
               <br />
               crystallize into law for ever a certain condi- 
               <br />
               tion of affairs existing at any one time. I 
               <br />
               think that to remove the elasticity which 
               <br />
               should be about a measure of this kind and 
               <br />
               to limit for all time to come a set of prin- 
               <br />
               ciples which in future years may become a 
               <br />
               hardship to the minority or to the majority 
               <br />
               of the people of that country is a mistake, 
               <br />
               and that it would have been better to have 
               <br />
               left it subject to the power to change from 
               <br />
               time to time. Now, it cannot be changed 
               <br />
               except by legislation by the imperial House 
               <br />
               if this Act is held to be good which I very 
               <br />
               much doubt. What will the minority get 
               <br />
               by the Bill? It is said that it is going to 
               <br />
               give them something of very great value 
               <br />
               and importance. The hon. ex-Minister <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
