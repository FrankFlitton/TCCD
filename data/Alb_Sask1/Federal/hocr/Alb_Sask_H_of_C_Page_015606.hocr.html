               I do not understand that the conference 
               <br />
               was of a conﬁdential or private nature, and 
               <br />
               I may say that Mr. Hauitain contended at

               Mr. SCOTT. Not absolutely. As a matter 
               <br />
               of fact we did not arrive at a perfect agree- 
               <br />
               ment either with regard to the boundaries 
               <br />
               or with regard to the number of constituen- 
               <br />
               cies. I have already told the House that my 
               <br />
               choice for a boundary line between the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces was the present boundary of Alberta. 
               <br />
               I pressed that strongly. But I stood alone. 
               <br />
               and so I was driven to agree to the 4th 
               <br />
               meridian. A very substantial majority of 
               <br />
               those in the conference favoured the 4th 
               <br />
               meridian as against the 3rd meridian. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) reminds me that be favoured the 3rd 
               <br />
               meridian; but, the majority was in favour 
               <br />
               of the 4th, and that was finally adopted by 
               <br />
               the government. And I say that the number 
               <br />
               of constituencies was discussed at consider- 
               <br />
               able length. Mr. Haultain contended, and 
               <br />
               with a good deal of force that the number 
               <br />
               of constituencies allotted to each province 
               <br />
               should be thirty, but he was unable to carry 
               <br />
               a majority of the conference with him. 
               <br />
               There was a discussion with regard to the 
               <br />
               method to be followed in the preparation of 
               <br />
               the schedules, and I repeat, though it has 
               <br />
               been emphatically denied by some hon. mem- 
               <br />
               bers opposite,——but my own memory with 
               <br />
               regard to this is supported by the memory of 
               <br />
               other hon. gentlemen <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present—that</span> we did 
               <br />

               <br />
               tain’s suggestion with regard to schedules. 
               <br />
               and I put forward a motion in favour of a 
               <br />
               bi-party committee representing each pro- 
               <br />
               vince to arrive at an agreement with re- 
               <br />
               gard to schedules. This was not carried. 
               <br />
               There are hon. gentlemen here who recoi-

               lect distinctly that I made the motion. My

               <br />
               Carthy) said that the absurdity of what I 
               <br />
               stated was proved by the fact that the boun-

               Mr. SCOTT. My recollection is that this

               telegram incident occurred while the mem-

               was settled. There was no attempt made

               at this meeting to settle the delimitation
