               I would mention this matter again. As I

               shape, might I make a suggestion on my 
               <br />
               own behalf. I do not profess to be 
               <br />
               very familiar with the territorial law, but 
               <br />
               as far as I understand we are pro- 
               <br />
               viding for the qualiﬁcation of voters and 
               <br />
               the procedure governing elections. I was 
               <br />
               going to suggest at ﬁrst that we should 
               <br />
               provide that the new provinces should be 
               <br />
               governed by the Dominion Elections Act, 
               <br />
               but the difﬁculty would be that there would 
               <br />
               be no Franchise Act to act as a basis. Might 
               <br />
               I suggest to the Minister of Justice the view 
               <br />
               that as to clause 6 it should be provided 
               <br />
               that so far as the qualiﬁcation of voters is 
               <br />
               concerned it should be based upon the Fran-

               ings are concerned they should be govern-
