               parliament publicly teaching the people on 
               <br />
               this question. With regard to the schools in 
               <br />
               the Territories with which this Bill deals, I 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that they are housed in 1,100 school- 
               <br />
               houses. Of these less than a dozen—to be 
               <br />
               exact, eleven—are occupied by the separate

               Protestant and nine are so-called Roman

               Catholic. I ﬁnd that these 1,100 are using 
               <br />
               exactly the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">textbooks;</span> are taught,

               in fact, in every way are public government

               this: I ﬁnd that in the two so-called Pro-

               <br />

               <br />
               Methodist, Presbyterian, Anglican, or what- 
               <br />
               ever other denomination—may come after 
               <br />
               school hours are done, after 3.30 o’clock, and 
               <br />
               may for thirty minutes give religious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instruc-</span> 
               <br />
               tion. I ﬁnd that in the nine so-called Catho- 
               <br />
               lic separate schools, if a majority of parents 
               <br />
               desire it, a clergyman of that faith may have 
               <br />
               the same privilege, at the same hour, and 
               <br />
               for the same length of time; and I further 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that no child is obliged to remain whose 
               <br />
               parents object. This provision is in exact 
               <br />

               I ﬁnd by comparison that the schools of 
               <br />
               the Territories and the schools of Nova 
               <br />
               Scotia are practically the same. 'If these 
               <br />
               schools in the Territories are not cfree

               civil and religious liberty, if there are

               <br />
               failed in my conception of these terms.

               These are the kind and quality of public 
               <br />
               schools which with slight variation have 
               <br />
               been in these Territories for about thirty 
               <br />
               years. These are the kind and quality oi'

               this and this only—seeks this and nothing 
               <br />
               more and nothing less. These are the kind 
               <br />
               and quality of schools which the Catholic 
               <br />
               clergy are uttering their complaint against, 
               <br />
               because they are not sectarian. These are 
               <br />
               the schools against which many Protestant 
               <br />
               preachers are hurling their anathemas, be-

               cause they claim that these schools are 
               <br />
               altogether Catholic and French. )Some of 
               <br />
               these tirades against the school clausas of 
               <br />
               the Autonomy Bill are, I believe, said in

               honesty, but in profound ignorance of the 
               <br />
               public school system of the Territories, 
               <br />
               which this Bill seeks to establish and per-

               the schools of which Mr. Greenway said—
