               Now, Mr. Speaker, my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remarks</span> hitherto 
               <br />
               have been mostly of an explanatory char- 
               <br />
               acter. I have endeavoured, as far as I 
               <br />
               could, to make clear what was the purport 
               <br />
               of the contemplated legislation before this 
               <br />
               House, and also what were the existing con- 
               <br />
               ditions in certain parts of this our country 
               <br />
               for the purposes of comparison. And now 
               <br />
               it becomes necessary for me to make a state— 
               <br />
               ment as to What attitude I shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take,</span> upon 
               <br />
               this Bill when it reaches the committee stage 
               <br />
               or the second reading. I wish to state that, 
               <br />
               as a member of the Conservative panty, i 
               <br />
               feel that our party deserves the greatest 
               <br />
               credit for being a party in which full lib- 
               <br />
               erty is given to the individual when ques- 
               <br />
               tions which relate to conscience come up 
               <br />
               for discussion. An attempt was made by 
               <br />
               the Minister of Agriculture this afternoon 
               <br />
               to make it appear before the country that 
               <br />
               the Liberal party at the present time were 
               <br />
               the sole custodians of the spirit of toler- 
               <br />
               ation and freedom in this country. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think.</span> 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, that the spectacle, as it was 
               <br />
               called this afternoon, which the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party presents at this time is one of 
               <br />
               which it has no reason to be ashamed. 
               <br />
               On this side of the House at least there is 
               <br />
               absolute liberty of conscience; on this side 
               <br />
               of the House there is complete absence of 
               <br />
               coercion; on this side of the House every 
               <br />
               member is permitted by his chief and his 
               <br />
               fellow members to look at questions of this 
               <br />
               nature conscientiously, and to arrive at the 
               <br />
               conclusion which to him seems best; and, 
               <br />
               Mr. Speaker, I am going to take advantage 
               <br />
               of the words of my honoured chief in which 
               <br />
               he said :

               And so, Mr. Speaker, the honoured leader 
               <br />
               of the Conservative party, realizing that in 
               <br />
               questions where religious prejudice, as it has 
               <br />
               been called—I prefer to call it devotion—is 
               <br />
               concerned, the leader of the Conservative 
               <br />
               party has seen ﬁt to give to his followers 
               <br />
               complete and absolute liberty. He has told 
               <br />
               them that they shall one and all consult 
               <br />
               their constituents and their conscience, and 
               <br />
               shall then vote as they see ﬁt on this Bill ; 
               <br />
               and, unless I am greatly mistaken, there 
               <br />
               are many members on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House who would have been glad enough if 
               <br />
               their leader had made the same declaration. 
               <br />
               I think there are quite a few in that solidly 
               <br />
               united party of which we heard this after- 
               <br />
               noon, and of which we have heard on many 
               <br />
               previous occasions, who would be glad 
               <br />
               enough if they might be allowed to vote as 
               <br />
               their consciences dictated, and as their 
               <br />
               constituents demand, at this time. If the 
               <br />
               leader of the government had been willing 
               <br />
               to make the same frank statement which 
               <br />
               the leader of the opposition has made and 
               <br />
               had he said to his followers, Gentlemen, on 
               <br />
               this phase of the question you have your ab- 
               <br />
               solute and complete liberty, I believe the 
               <br />
               House would then have been divided natur- 
               <br />
               ally, each man voting as he thought to be 
               <br />
               in the best interests of Canada, and the re- 
               <br />
               sult would have been a far more true ex-

               pression than the one that will be reached 
               <br />

               Mr. Speaker, we are called upon, as I 
               <br />
               said at the outset, to pass legislation for the 
               <br />
               creation of two new provinces. In the 
               <br />
               natural course of events those provinces 
               <br />
               would be given full provincial autonomy ; 
               <br />
               they would be given power to prosecute 
               <br />
               their own affairs in their own way; and it 
               <br />
               could only be under the stress of another 
               <br />
               and a greater principle that this House 
               <br />
               would venture in any way to curtail that 
               <br />
               provincial liberty. At <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> time it is neces- 
               <br />
               sary for us to ask ourselves whether this 
               <br />
               greater principle excludes the less. And 
               <br />
               so I Lﬁlld myself exercising the liberty which 
               <br />
               my chief has given me, and the liberty 
               <br />
               which I feel bound to use. Had this been 
               <br />
               a matter which was considered vital to the 
               <br />
               Conservative party as a whole, I might 
               <br />
               have found myself in a position similar to 
               <br />
               that of some hon. members on the other 
               <br />
