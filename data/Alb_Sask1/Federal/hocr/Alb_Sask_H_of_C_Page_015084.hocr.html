               said that I was not then as familiar with

               <br />
               many of the clauses of that Act; so that 
               <br />
               enactments bearing upon it might be passed

               brought before the House in such a way

               that I understood it, I always opposed such 
               <br />
               an enactment. In support of that statement, 
               <br />
               I need only mention the fact that when Mr. 
               <br />
               Dalton McCarthy moved a resolution with 
               <br />
               regard to one of the clauses of the Act of 
               <br />
               1875, I both spoke and voted in favour of 
               <br />
               his motion, and what were the reasons I 
               <br />
               gave for doing so '2 I said that while Sir

               My hon. friend says he did not under- 
               <br />
               stand that section, and that is why he did 
               <br />
               not protest against it; but this session, 
               <br />
               before the Bills were even introduced, and 
               <br />
               consequently before he could have seen the 
               <br />
               educational clauses, he started an agitation 
               <br />
               against them.
