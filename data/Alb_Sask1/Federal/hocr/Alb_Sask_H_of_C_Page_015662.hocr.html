               through my constituency on the Canadian 
               <br />
               Northern Railway, take the proposed line 
               <br />
               of the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway from We- 
               <br />
               taskiwin east, now laying rails 011 the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               ﬁfty miles, take also the line followed by 
               <br />
               the same company from Lacombe east, 
               <br />
               with rails laid for the ﬁrst ﬁfty miles—we 
               <br />
               have hundreds of settlers coming into that 
               <br />
               Country a hundred miles ahead of the rail- 
               <br />
               way. There is the difference between our 
               <br />
               northern country and the southern country. 
               <br />
               In the southern country the railways pre— 
               <br />
               cede settlement; in the northern part, II] 
               <br />
               the agricultural part of the country, settlers 
               <br />
               precede the railway.
