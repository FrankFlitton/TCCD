               .Now, Mr. Speaker, when the right hon. 
               <br />
               ﬁrst Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) intro-

               21st February, he did so in a very able 
               <br />
               speech. It was a speech that attracted the 
               <br />
               attention of every person within hearing 
               <br />
               distance and more than that, judging from 
               <br />
               the vast number of petitions which have 
               <br />
               come in from all parts of the country against 
               <br />
               certain clauses in the Autonomy Bill, it was 
               <br />
               a speech that attracted the attention of all 
               <br />
               readers of newspapers in all parts of the 
               <br />
               country. When the right hon. First )Iin— 
               <br />
               ister spoke on the land question it struck 
               <br />
               me that perhaps it was not right that the 
               <br />
               federal government should withhold the 
               <br />
               land from the provinces and give them in 
               <br />
               lieu a certain sum of money. I felt that 
               <br />
               way. and after my hon. friend from Jacques 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cartier</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Monk) had delivered his speech, 
               <br />
               which was certainly a most able and argu- 
               <br />
               mentative speech on the land question, and 
               <br />
               after he had brought forward some excellent 
               <br />
               precedents to show that when provinces are 
               <br />
               created out of these Territories the land 
               <br />
               should pass within the control of those 
               <br />
               provinces, I felt more ﬁrmly convinced that 
               <br />
               the land ought to go to the provinces and 
               <br />
               be placed under their particular control. 
               <br />
               When the right hon. First Minister spoke 
               <br />
               on the educational clauses of the Bill, I 
               <br />
               noticed that he based his argument very 
               <br />
               largely upon the utterances of the late Hon. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Geo.</span> Brown. lie said that Hon. Geo. Brown 
               <br />
               had said that once separate schools were 
               <br />
               introduced into the Territories then sepa- 
               <br />

               schools were introduced then separate

               schools lfor all time. Well, no doubt, the 
               <br />
               Hon. Geo. Brown said that, but Hon. Geo. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brown</span> on the other hand fought very 
               <br />
               strongly for many years against the estab-

               <br />
               very best against separate schools, but when 
               <br />
               it came down to the time of confederation 
               <br />

               would always be opposed to separate 
               <br />
               schools. Mr. Brown more than once said,

               in presenting his arguments, that separate 
               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               arguments are quite familiar to the house——

               he was entirely opposed to the separate 
               <br />
               school system. I think when the right 
               <br />
               hon. reader of the government placed so 
               <br />

               Geo. Brown when he said once separate 
               <br />
               schools always separate schools. certainly 
               <br />
               he ought to have kept in mind the assertion 
               <br />
               of Mr. Brown when he said he was opposed 
               <br />
               to separate schools on the ground that they 
               <br />
               would be an injury to the country and that 
               <br />
               they were not equal to the public school 
               <br />
               system. Therefore, if the right hon. leader

               Baptists and all other sects, and he argued 
               <br />
               very strongly upon the fact that all others 
               <br />
               would have the right to separate schools 
               <br />
               and of course tangle up the country in a 
               <br />
               way that would be very bad for it. That 
               <br />
               would include a great many other sects, for 
               <br />
               instance the Galicians, Doukhohors, Men— 
               <br />
               nonites, Mormons and many others. Now, 
               <br />
               we will just deal with the Mormons for a 
               <br />
               moment. I will endeavour to show that 
               <br />
               there is likely to be a very great inﬂux of 
               <br />
               the Mormon people into the Northwest Ter- 
               <br />
               ritories and I will then endeavour to show 
               <br />
               that the separate school clauses in the 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bill would be an advantage to 
               <br />
               the Mormon people which is something that 
               <br />
               I think ought not to be given. We take 
               <br />
               from a very reliable paper that is published 
               <br />
               in Ontario the following :

               The report which comes from Toronto that 
               <br />
               the Cochrane ranch in Alberta has been sold to 
               <br />
               President Smith of the Mormon church in Utah 
               <br />
               will not be received with surprise by Canadians 
               <br />
               generally, but it is apt to create a feeling of 
               <br />
               concern as to whether the embarrassing ques-

               tion with which the American people are wrest- 
               <br />
               ling is to be transferred to the Dominion. The

               Cochrane ranch comprises 66,500 acres in one
