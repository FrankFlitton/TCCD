               insinuation that Mr. Haultain does not re- 
               <br />
               present the views of the people of the'North-

               <br />
               General (Mr. Lemienx) has seen ﬁt to state 
               <br />
               that the letter signed by Mr. Haultain was 
               <br />
               not assented to' by his colleague, Mr. Bulyea, 
               <br />
               and that therefore it did not represent the 
               <br />
               views of the Territorial government. Now, 
               <br />
               1 assume that the same reason would apply 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it‘</span> we should say that this Bill was introduc-

               the consent of the Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. Sifton). Let me ask the Solicitor Gen-

               eral to point out one fact of one protest 
               <br />
               in that letter signed by Mr. Haultain, that 
               <br />
               is not borne out by the draft of the Bill 
               <br />
               which he submitted to this House in Dec- 
               <br />
               ember. 1001, and to which the legislative 
               <br />
               assembly at Regina had given their ap— 
               <br />
               proval. That was their mandate, that was 
               <br />
               their case; and until the hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man can point to something in that letter 
               <br />
               which is not borne out by that draft Bill, 
               <br />
               then I would consider that the insinuation 
               <br />
               is not worthy of any further reply. If the 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman is looking for some members 
               <br />
               of the Territorial government who have been 
               <br />
               false to their trust, he certainly cannot 
               <br />
               point his ﬁnger to Mr. Haultain. Mr. Haul-

               tain needs no recommendation in the west, 
               <br />

               Now, Sir, I was somewhat surprised to 
               <br />
               hear the Solicitor General revive the old 
               <br />
               contention that the federal government had 
               <br />
               purchased the Northwest Territories. We are 
               <br />
               advised <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> that we were not only pur- 
               <br />
               chased for the general beneﬁt of Canada, but 
               <br />
               also that we were discovered by a French 
               <br />
               Canadian. I think if he will look into the 
               <br />
               records he will ﬁnd that that argument was 
               <br />
               abandoned many years ago. In 1885 the 
               <br />
               strongest position this government would 
               <br />
               take was that they had a large pecuniary 
               <br />
               interest in that country, and that is the posi- 
               <br />
               tion they did take. Let me ask the hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman to answer a con le of questions 
               <br />
               in regard to the purchase 0 which he has 
               <br />
               referred. Let me ask him to explain to this 
               <br />
               House when the Bill comes up for discus- 
               <br />
               Sioll ot‘ the clauses seriatim in committee, 
               <br />
               if that money was paid as the purchase 
               <br />
               price of these lands, why was not the deed 
               <br />
               of surrender_made to the people who paid 
               <br />
               the money ? Again, let him explain why, 
               <br />
               if this land was purchased for the general 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the Dominion and to be held 
               <br />

               is to be treated as our other fellow-citizens

               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Solicitor</span> General can produce no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">docu~</span> 
               <br />
               ment which will show that £300,000 were 
               <br />
               paid as a purchase price for the land. That 
               <br />
               money was paid to get rid of a trading 
               <br />
               monopoly, and, as he says, it has been 
               <br />
               a very bad investment. But I would like 
               <br />
               to direct him to the debate of 1869, where 
               <br />
               he will see that the increase in customs 
               <br />
               and excise duties more than doubled the 
               <br />
               amount of interest on this £300,000 that was 
               <br />
               paid for the release of the land. I would 
               <br />
               also point out that the purchase of these 
               <br />
               rights opened a ﬁeld for the trade of 
               <br />
               eastern manufacturers which has been worth 
               <br />
               ten times, or a hundred times. the money 
               <br />
               that has been paid for it. Now, he seems 
               <br />
               to think that this administration has some 
               <br />
               claim or title upon that land because they 
               <br />
               have expended a certain sum of money upon 
               <br />
               it. He says that it has cost us a couple of 
               <br />
               rebellions, and that we have been obliged to 
               <br />
               keep up the mounted police. Well, on the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> reason I assume that the Dominion
