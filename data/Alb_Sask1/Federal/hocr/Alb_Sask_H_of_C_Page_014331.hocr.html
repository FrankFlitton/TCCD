               the Roman Catholic minority is unfounded. 
               <br />
               Both cannot be correct. Perhaps my hon. 
               <br />
               friend from East Grey. in his supreme de— 
               <br />
               sire to do justice, will, in talking the matter 
               <br />
               over with his western friends, point out to 
               <br />
               them the view which the Quebec Tories take 
               <br />
               of this measure as compared with that 
               <br />
               which he and his friends take. But what is 
               <br />
               the attitude of my hon. friend the leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition? He simply takes his stand 
               <br />
               on provincial rights. The hon. member for 
               <br />
               East Grey does the passion part of the play. 
               <br />
               He acts the tragic role and appeals to pas- 
               <br />
               sion; other members of the party opposite 
               <br />
               indulge in melodramatic appeals to senti- 
               <br />
               ment; others attempt more or less skilfully 
               <br />
               to excite prejudice, but one and all they 
               <br />
               are working to the same end, and that is the 
               <br />
               success and glory of the Conservative party, 
               <br />
               no matter by what means that may be 
               <br />
               secured. But there is one thing which these 
               <br />
               gentlemen might well bear in mind. It is 
               <br />
               that the welfare of this country depends on 
               <br />
               our people living in harmony; and let this 
               <br />
               question he once settled in a broad spirit 
               <br />
               of tolerant justice and we will continue in 
               <br />
               that career of progress in which we have 
               <br />
               been advancing for the last eight years. 
               <br />
               For several years during the agitation ac- 
               <br />
               companying the Manitoba school question, 
               <br />
               the progress of this country was stopped, 
               <br />
               and stopped it would be again if the opposi- 
               <br />
               tion could have their way and succeed in 
               <br />
               throwing this question into the arena of 
               <br />
               political strife. But the good sense of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pal“</span> 
               <br />
               liament, I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, will 
               <br />
               prevail, and the country will breathe a 
               <br />
               sigh of relief when this question is settled 
               <br />
               for all time, without any sacrifice of princi- 
               <br />
               ple on either side and in a manner which 
               <br />
               will enable all classes to live in harmony. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend the leader of the opposition 
               <br />
               said that because the Act of 1875 was pass- 
               <br />
               ed When there were only 500 people in the 
               <br />
               Northwest it should now be done away 
               <br />
               with when there are 500,000 people in that 
               <br />
               country. But it seems to me that if 500,000 
               <br />
               people have gone into that country, know- 
               <br />
               ing the law and the conditions which pre- 
               <br />
               vailed, they furnish us, with 500,000 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argu’</span> 
               <br />
               ments in favour of the maintenance of the 
               <br />
               status quo. Why should we deal with the 
               <br />
               people of the Territories when we make 
               <br />
               them a province in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">diﬂerent</span> manner from 
               <br />
               that in which we deal with the people in 
               <br />
               other provinces when they were brought 
               <br />
               into confederation? What we propose now 
               <br />
               is in harmony with the unbroken practice 
               <br />
               in similar cases, respected in every part of 
               <br />
               this broad Dominion. Therefore, I am un- 
               <br />
               able to understand why, when we are rais- 
               <br />
               ing these two Territories to the dignity of 
               <br />
