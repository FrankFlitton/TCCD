               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DEALERS.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Translation)</span> I say that 
               <br />
               there was no question of the French langu- 
               <br />
               age, that no complaint was made that its 
               <br />
               use was not prescribed, and I aﬂirm that 
               <br />
               no member. before voting on the second 
               <br />
               reading. had made any reservation on that 
               <br />
               point. nor blamed the government for not 
               <br />
               having provided for the use of the French 
               <br />

               which showed so much zeal in regard to 
               <br />
               this Bill, that had petitions circulated, did 
               <br />
               not think of that omission of the govern— 
               <br />
               ment? And the Conservative newspapers, 
               <br />
               I will say further, the opposition newspapers 
               <br />
               such as the ‘ Nationaliste,’ for example, did 
               <br />
               not think of that slip. The correspondent
