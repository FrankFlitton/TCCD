               I think the wording is already plain

               enough but this addition will probably make

               Mr. HENDERSON. I am not quite clear 
               <br />
               that the amendment will get over the difﬁ- 
               <br />
               culty to which I have referred. In a similar 
               <br />
               instance the province of Ontario claimed 
               <br />
               that they were not only entitled to be paid 
               <br />
               the annual sum but that if they desired 
               <br />
               they were entitled to get the principal upon 
               <br />
               which that interest was based. Notwith- 
               <br />
               standing that the Act of parliament creat- 
               <br />
               ing the annual sum declares that it should 
               <br />
               be paid as an additional subsidy, and not- 
               <br />
               withstanding that the wording of that Act 
               <br />
               (chap. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4</span> statutes of 1884) is much more 
               <br />
               expressive than the words in the amend- 
               <br />
               ment of the Finance Minister himself, a 
               <br />
               portion of that capital amount has been 
               <br />
               paid over to the province. True, it is 
               <br />
               charged to the province as a debt, but no 
               <br />
               doubt the intention is that at some future 
               <br />
               time the entire sum may be paid over. I am 
               <br />
               quite aware that the Minister of Finance 
               <br />
               argues against my contention that the Act 
               <br />
               of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1884-</span> speaks of this sum as a ‘capital 
               <br />
               sum.’ but as against that there is the broad 
               <br />
               statement that the amount of $142,414 is 
               <br />
               the annual payment to be made to the prov- 
               <br />
               ince of Ontario in consideration of that 
               <br />
               capital sum and the Act declares that the 
               <br />
               sum shall be paid to Ontario as an addi- 
               <br />
               tional subsidy. I very much fear that the 
               <br />
               contention will be set up in years to come, 
               <br />
               that as this sum is interest there must be 
               <br />
               capital behind it, and that if the province 
               <br />
               is entitled to interest it is entitled under the 
               <br />
               Act of 1885, chap. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4,</span> to call for the principal 
               <br />
               when it so desires. I know that the Minis 
               <br />
               ter of Finance is endeavouring to get over 
               <br />
               that. but I think he should have used words 
               <br />
               so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explicit</span> that all chance of difﬁculty in the 
               <br />
               future would be avoided. 
               <br />

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Why refer to this as interest at all? 
               <br />
               Could we not call it by some other name? 
               <br />
