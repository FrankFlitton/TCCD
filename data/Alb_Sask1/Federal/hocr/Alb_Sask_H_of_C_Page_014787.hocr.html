               Now, Sir, a word as to separate schools— 
               <br />
               and I repeat again quite frankly, as I said 
               <br />
               in my opening remarks, that I believe in 
               <br />
               separate schools in Canada. I believe that 
               <br />
               in our conditions and circumstances here 
               <br />
               in Canada, it is necessary that those Who 
               <br />
               have different views and ideas in regard 
               <br />
               to education and in regard to what edu- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cation</span> implies, should have those views res- 
               <br />
               pected; and if there is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a,large</span> section of 
               <br />
               our people who believe that it is necessary 
               <br />
               that religion should be taught in the schools, 
               <br />
               they ought to have the opportunity and the 
               <br />
               advantage of having religion taught in their 
               <br />
               schools if they wish it. I say this with 
               <br />
               the experience of a Quebec man, who per- 
               <br />
               haps knows a little more about the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opera.</span> 
               <br />
               tion of a complete system of separate schools 
               <br />
               than people in other parts of Canada. We 
               <br />
               have in Quebec the most complete and abso- 
               <br />
               lute separation of the two systems of 
               <br />
               school education that exists 
               <br />
               of Canada. We have a good deal of know- 
               <br />
               ledge of its working and its results, and 
               <br />
               I venture to say, as one who enjoys the pri- 
               <br />
               vilege of separate schools in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, that we would consider ourselves 
               <br />
               very much ill—treated if any jot or tittle of 
               <br />
               that privilege should be withdrawn from 
               <br />
               us. There has been some. curiosity as to its 
               <br />
               results. I remember, in the early part of 
               <br />
               this debate, the hon. member for East Grey 
               <br />
               (Mr. ‘Spr0u1e) read an article from the 
               <br />
               Hun’tingdon " Gleaner,’ I think it was. in 
               <br />
               which that little paper attributed the im- 
               <br />
               migration of Protestants from the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec to the unfortunate school system 
               <br />
               there, and seemed to endorse the idea that 
               <br />
               the Protestants were leaving the pr0vince 
               <br />
               of Quebec and going away because they 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span> not get education for their children. 
               <br />
               Without in any way wishing to impugn 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> authority of the Huntingdon ‘ Gleaner’ 
               <br />
               I would venture to say that I and others 
               <br />
               on the ﬂoor of this House can speak With 
               <br />
               as great authority as the editor of that 
               <br />
               paper as to the rights, privileges and con- 
               <br />
               ditions of the minority in the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec, and I would say this. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from East Grey gave us an extra- 
               <br />
               ordinary history of what he called a system 
               <br />
               on the part of the Catholic Church in the 
               <br />
               province of Quebec for aiding this exodus 
               <br />
               of Protestant farmers from the province. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend, I believe, did that in full 
               <br />
               honesty. I have no doubt that he really 
               <br />
               believed that extraordinary story, and I 
               <br />
               would tell the hon. gentleman a little story 
               <br />
               which I heard myself once. I did not be-

               quoting the Huntingdon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'(ileanerﬁ</span> that the 
               <br />
               Protestants of Quebec were leaving that

               province. 1 take direct issue with that 
               <br />
               statement. It is true that some Protestants 
               <br />
               of Quebec have been leaving their farms 
               <br />
               and going away, but it is equally true that 
               <br />
               Protestants from Nova Scotia, New Bruns- 
               <br />
               wick and Prince Edward Island have been 
               <br />
               going away. I know a good deal about 
               <br />
               the New England states and I know that 
               <br />

               <br />
               the youth of the maritime provinces, 
               <br />
               just as in these cities there is a very 
               <br />
               large number of the ﬂower of the youth of 
               <br />
               the eastern townships of Quebec. They 
               <br />
               have gone to the eastern states from pro- 
               <br />
               vinces where there is a Protestant majority 
               <br />
               just as they have gone from Quebec where 
               <br />
               there is a Roman Catholic majority and 
               <br />
               they were in a small minority. They went 
               <br />
               because of the ﬁscal policy of the govern-

               a fortune in the United States and which
