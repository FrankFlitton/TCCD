               It has been said that the Catholics, at 
               <br />
               least where they have a majority, are free 
               <br />
               to engage their own teachers, that they are 
               <br />
               free to elect their own trustees. and may 
               <br />
               then avail themselves of the right to choose 
               <br />
               their own teachers. But it must not be 
               <br />
               forgotten that, so far as these teachers are 
               <br />
               concerned, they must of necesgity, under 
               <br />
               subsection 17 of section 95, be qualiﬁed 
               <br />
               under the regulations of the department of 
               <br />
               education. If this had only reference to 
               <br />
               the technical knowledge of the teachers and 
               <br />
               their pedagogical qualiﬁcations, I would 
               <br />
               have nothing to say. Our teachers are not 
               <br />
               afraid to submit to any kind of an educa- 
               <br />
               tional test. I do not see why our teachers 
               <br />
               in the Northwest should not be able to ob- 
               <br />
               tain their share of the diplomas, especially 
               <br />

               province. But there is everything in this 
               <br />
               ordinance to prevent Catholic teachers from 
               <br />
               attending the normal schools. For three 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> during Mr. Haultain's administration. 
               <br />
               from 1892 to 1895. Catholic teachers were 
               <br />
               precluded from following the courses of the 
               <br />

               ration has been given. and that is the rea- 
               <br />
               son why there are not more protests from 
               <br />
               the Northwest. The Catholic minority in 
               <br />
               the Northwest are being deceived by the

               thing they now have in fact. Not later

               amendment moved by the First Minister

               this afternoon tried to connect the provi- 
               <br />
               sion of the ordinance of 1901 with the pre- 
               <br />
               ceding ordinances. But, as I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">if</span> 
               <br />
               you go to the ordinances of 1886, 1888, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">189.4,</span> 
               <br />
               1896 and 1898. you will see that any three 
               <br />
               resident ratepayers could organize a school 
               <br />
               district without any qualiﬁcation, and the 
               <br />
               Catholics always could organize Catholic 
               <br />
               public schools Wherever they were in a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority.</span> In 1901, however, this was 
               <br />
               changed, and for the ﬁrst time there was 
               <br />
               in the ordinances a provision which allow- 
               <br />
               ed only public schools to be created—article 
               <br />
               12 of that ordinance, under which any por- 
               <br />
               tion of the Territories may be erected into 
               <br />
               a public school district.
