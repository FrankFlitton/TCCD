               we ﬁnd that they were ﬁrst demanded by the

               these privileges for the minority of the pro- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec must have foreseen that in

               all decency and in all fairness similar privi~ 
               <br />
               leges must be accorded to other minorities 
               <br />
               in other parts of the Dominion. There can 
               <br />
               be no dispute about that, and indeed ever 
               <br />
               since confederation that principle has been 
               <br />
               crystallized in the legislation of this parlia- 
               <br />
               ment. In 1870, when Manitoba was ad- 
               <br />
               mitted into the confederation, the legisla- 
               <br />
               tion enacted in this federal parliament pur- 
               <br />
               posed to establish a system of separate 
               <br />
               schools in the prairie province, but per- 
               <br />
               haps through bungling here and through 
               <br />
               had faith elsewhere the intention of 
               <br />
               parliament was not carried out. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, even that lapse does not alter the 
               <br />
               fact, that it is in the spirit of our constitu- 
               <br />
               tion which this parliament has tried to live 
               <br />
               up to, that with respect to education <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minor-i»</span> 
               <br />
               ties should have special protection. Let we 
               <br />
               speak of the conditions existing in the pro-- 
               <br />
               vince of Quebec with which I am familiar. 
               <br />
               I consider myself fortunate that I was 
               <br />
               brought up in a province in Which people 
               <br />
               of dilferent races and different creeds are 
               <br />
               able to work harmoniously together for the 
               <br />
               welfare of our common country ; I consider 
               <br />
               myself fortunate in this because it has given 
               <br />
               me the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity</span> to understand some 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> which men situated differently have 
               <br />
               not had the opportunity of realizing. At 
               <br />
               confederation, in 1867, the Protestant min- 
               <br />
               ority of Quebec were granted separate 
               <br />
               school privileges, and the carrying out of 
               <br />
               that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understanding</span> was placed largely in 
               <br />
               the hands of the Catholic majority. I am 
               <br />
               prepared to say here, Sir, that from 1867 to 
               <br />
               the present day not only has the spirit of 
               <br />
               our constitutional guarantee been faithfully 
               <br />
               adhered to by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ltoman</span> Catholic majority, 
               <br />
               but that the majority has shown itself in all 
               <br />
               respects and at all times generous in its 
               <br />
               treatment of the Protestants and has done 
               <br />
               everything it possibly could to promote 
               <br />
               good feeling and harmony. I am happy to 
               <br />
               be able to state in this parliament of Can— 
               <br />
               ada to—day that there is perhaps no country 
               <br />
               in the world where people of different origins 
               <br />
               and diiferent creeds live together in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span> 
               <br />
               accord as in the province of Quebec. There 
               <br />
               is no country, I believe. which affords such a 
               <br />
               good example of the good that can be brought 
               <br />
               about where the majority and the minority 
               <br />
               are disposed to be fair to each other. Every—

               <br />
               for reprisals upon us. I may, Sir, that the

               <br />

               future as though this debate had never taken 
               <br />
               place. The policy of the majority in the

               in starting these new provinces on their

               for Alberta and Saskatchewan. A few

               moments ago I glanced over a manifesto

               <br />
               East Grey (Mr. Sproule). The hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man starts out in this manifesto by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(190131“</span> 
               <br />
               ing how desirable it is that in a country like 
               <br />
               Canada we should have peace, but be im- 
               <br />
               mediately proceeds to make for peace by a 
               <br />
               declaration of war. It is contended that 
               <br />
               the schools in the Northwest should be na— 
               <br />
               tional schools, and I know that the argu- 
               <br />
               ment is often made that national schools 
               <br />
               are absolutely non-sectarian and that an ad- 
               <br />
               herent of any particular faith might go to 
               <br />
               a national school without doing violence to 
               <br />
               his religious convictions or his conscientious 
               <br />

               <br />
               we might as well discuss this question frank— 
               <br />
               ly, fairly and candidly. That statement is 
               <br />
               not founded on fact. The views of Protest- 
               <br />
               ants and Catholics in respect to education 
               <br />
               are so radically different that there is no
