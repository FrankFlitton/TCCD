               amended section 16, which was spoken of 
               <br />
               on the second reading of the Bill and also 
               <br />

               <br />
               that subject now. I anticipated a long 
               <br />
               discussion on the previous clauses of the 
               <br />
               Bill, and did not prepare myself to deal 
               <br />
               with that particular clause to-day.

               have never had up to the present time any 
               <br />
               statement on behalf of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government,</span> 
               <br />
               beyond a very general statement made by 
               <br />
               the Prime Minister on the second reading 
               <br />
               of the Bill, which did not go into particu- 
               <br />
               lars and seemed to me to be remarkably

               <br />
               We had a very

               full and elaborate statement from the ex-

               <br />
               regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference,</span> and I am not at all 
               <br />
               clear as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> whether the view he took is 
               <br />
               the one which still commends itself to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend the Minister of Justice. and for 
               <br />
               that reason I would have been glad to have 
               <br />
               his views on that subject to—day. However, 
               <br />
               I am entirely willing to consult his conven- 
               <br />
               ience. except that I would suggest to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend that after he has made his state- 
               <br />
               ment, we might possibly after some dis- 
               <br />
               cussion ask the clause to stand for a little 
               <br />
               consideration of any views which might be 
               <br />
               put forward in case they should prove to 
               <br />
               be very divergent from those of the ex- 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior.

               Mr. FOSTER. Would it not be well also 
               <br />
               to suggest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:to</span> the Minister of Justice that

               very interesting.
