               <br />
               has no technical meaning. It means exactly

               <br />
               issue such as he himself created when he 
               <br />
               made that remark. There was nothing in 
               <br />
               the Act of 1875 to prevent the Territories 
               <br />
               from establishing separate schools of that 
               <br />
               character if they saw <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ﬁt,</span> nor was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> 
               <br />
               anything in that Act to impose upon the 
               <br />
               territorial legislature the necessity of estab- 
               <br />
               lishing such schools. In other words, such 
               <br />
               wide powers were given by the Act of 1875 
               <br />
               to the Ternitonies that they could establish 
               <br />
               denominational schools <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> they saw ﬁt. There 
               <br />
               was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span> to restrict them. but neither 
               <br />
               was there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything</span> in the Act of 1875 to 
               <br />
               impose the obligation of establishing deno- 
               <br />
               minational schools. The term used is not 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'denominational</span> schools,’ but the right hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman has thus interpreted it. The 
               <br />
               term used is ‘ separate schools ’ and separate 
               <br />
               schools only. I see that my hon. friend 
               <br />
