               The necessity for the extraordinary burden 
               <br />
               upon the people of the west is not obvious. 
               <br />
               Ample evidence exists to show that the railway 
               <br />
               was not in any sense built for the beneﬁt of 
               <br />
               the Northwest. In 1865 the Honourable 
               <br />
               George Brown voiced the opinion of the gov-

               ernment of the day when he stated in his place 
               <br />
               in the parliament of Canada during the con- 
               <br />
               federation debates ‘ the confederation is, there- 
               <br />
               fore, clearly committed to the carrying out of 
               <br />
               both these enterprises,’ his reference being to 
               <br />
               the construction of the Interco-lonial Railway 
               <br />
               and the opening up of communications with the 
               <br />
               Northwest Territories. ‘I doubt,’ he proceeded 
               <br />
               to say, ‘if there was a member of the confer- 
               <br />
               ence who did not consider that the opening up

               of the Northwest and the improvement of our

               vantage of the lower provinces as for the in- 
               <br />
               terests of Upper Canada. Indeed, one gentle- 
               <br />
               man held that the lower provinces were more 
               <br />
               interested—they wished to get their products 
               <br />
               into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">west—they</span> wanted a back country as 
               <br />
               much as we did—they wanted to be the carriers 
               <br />
               for that great country—and they were, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">therefore</span> 
               <br />
               to say the least, as much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interested</span> in the

               questions as we were.’ But there is no need to

               go back beyond the solemn <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compact</span> entered

               sembly of the Northwest Territories. I 
               <br />
               have heard it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggested</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House. I 
               <br />
               think. that there had been an omission on 
               <br />
               ‘the part of the legislative assembly to ask 
               <br />
               that this exemption from taxation should 
               <br />
               be done away with, and so I consider it 
               <br />
               advisable to place on the records the state- 
               <br />
               ment I have just read. I think the state- 
               <br />
               ment shows quite <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clearly</span> tlmt a very con- 
               <br />
               siderable burden is imposed upon the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of the Northwest Territories by this 
               <br />
               exemption. As I understand, it was ad- 
               <br />
               mitted just now on tllle other side of the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[House</span> that the reason for the clause it 
               <br />
               was proposed to insert in the present Bill 
               <br />
               was to protect parliament. Now, it seems 
               <br />
               to me that this is not just. This burden 
               <br />
               was imposed upon the people of the new 
               <br />
               provinces without their consent—there can 
               <br />
               be no question about that. There <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> 
               <br />
               no province at the time, there was no repre- 
               <br />
               sentative body in the Territories, and 
               <br />
               there was no representation of the Terri- 
               <br />
               tories in this parliament. Therefore, it ap- 
               <br />
               pears to me that, as it was the Dominion 
               <br />
               itself which made the contract, it is the 
               <br />
               Dominion which is responsible to the Can-

               adian Paciﬁc Railway Company for the 
               <br />
               beneﬁts which that company were to re- 
               <br />
               ceive on the completion of their share of 
               <br />
               the contract. I think, therefore, that it is 
               <br />
               only fair that the Dominion, at the pre- 
               <br />
               sent time, should assume that burden itself 
               <br />
               and relieve the people of the Northwest 
               <br />

               from it. As has been pointed out in the 
               <br />
               statement which I have just read, the

               share, along with the other people of Can- 
               <br />
               ada, of the money gran-t required to aid the 
               <br />
               Canadian Paciﬁc Railway. They are also 
               <br />
               ﬁnding the land grants, not only for the 
               <br />
               line constructed in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories, but. also for a portion of that con- 
               <br />
               structed in Manitoba and for the whole of 
               <br />
               the line constructed in British Columbia. I 
               <br />
               fail to see why, in addition to all this, this 
               <br />
               burden caused by the exemption from tax- 
               <br />
               ation should be placed upon the people of 
               <br />
               the Northwest. And it is a burden. With 
               <br />
               reference to the exemption of taxation on 
               <br />
               the land grant, I think we have a very 
               <br />
               strong claim to relief upon the Dominion 
               <br />
