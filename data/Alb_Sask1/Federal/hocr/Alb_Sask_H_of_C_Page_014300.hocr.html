               The hon. the Minister of Finance stated

               that he would be quite willing to accept the

               <br />
               has not always been the case. because the

               I see that the hour is getting late and

               There are certain other important features 
               <br />
               in this Bill to which I wish to refer. There 
               <br />
               is ﬁrst the placing of the boundary line 
               <br />
               at the fourth meridian. A few days ago 
               <br />
               I called attention to a resolution passed at 
               <br />
               a public meeting in the town of Medicine 
               <br />

               on the international boundary. although 
               <br />
               there is the same grazing country on the 
               <br />
               boundary as we have at the dividing line 
               <br />
               of the two provinces. and although we have 
               <br />
               customs ofﬁcers and the mounted police who 
               <br />
               assist in keeping matters in order. Yet dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculties have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">always</span> arisen. Another dif- 
               <br />
               ﬁculty we are creating is that you will leave 
               <br />
               such a very little portion of the irrigated 
               <br />
               land in the eastern province that it will be 
               <br />
               hardly worth while passing legislation 
               <br />
               respecting it. \Vhiie that difﬁculty may 
               <br />
               be got over by the provisions of the. 
               <br />
               Bill under which the matters are left 
               <br />
               with the federal administration. But, if I 
               <br />
               understood the ex-Minister of the Interior
