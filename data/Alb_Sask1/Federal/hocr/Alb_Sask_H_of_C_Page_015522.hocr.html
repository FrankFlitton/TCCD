               Let us look at some further ﬁgures and

               and the passenger receipts tell the same

               <br />
               What they are north of towns-hip 38. This 
               <br />
               indicates where the people are and where 
               <br />
               the business is being done. When the Prime 
               <br />
               Minister was speaking about the number 
               <br />
               of post ofﬁces, I wonder if he and his friends- 
               <br />
               considered the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue</span> from these post 
               <br />
               ofﬁces. For instance, for the year ending 
               <br />
               June, 1904, the post ofﬁce revenue in Cal- 
               <br />
               gary was $28,638, and in Edmonton $13,104. 
               <br />
               Take similar statistics all along the line 
               <br />

               ern country has increased in far greater pro- 
               <br />
               portion than the north. I thinh it is a fair 
               <br />
               argument to say that you will usually ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the most people around where you will ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the most business being done, and on the

               6th of February last, I moved for a return 
               <br />

               mention onlythe ﬁgures for the last three 
               <br />
               or four years. At‘ Edmonton, which in- 
               <br />
               cludes Strathcona for this purpose, I ﬁnd 
               <br />
               that the increase in customs receipts for 
               <br />
               1903 over 1902 was about $25,000, while at 
               <br />
               Calgary the increase for the same period 
               <br />
               was over $50,000. At Medicine Hat which 
               <br />

               <br />
               1901 in customs revenue was about $22,000.

               At Lethbridge which is also in the south the 
               <br />
               customs receipts were in 1901, $21,716.10; 
               <br />
               in 1902, $28,105.73 ; in 1903, $36,930.20. From

               <br />
               This shows in what part of the country the 
               <br />
               business is being done and where the people 
               <br />
               are going. Another fair argument is that in

               the part of the country where there are rail- 
               <br />
               ways constructed you will usually ﬁnd the 
               <br />
               greatest actual settlement. If we take 
               <br />
               township 38 as the dividing line again, it 
               <br />
               will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found:</span> that north of township 38 
               <br />
               there are constructed only 150 miles of rail-

               way and part of that is but graded and not 
               <br />

               <br />
               township 38 there are 994 miles of railway 
               <br />
               in operation, so that I think it is a ,fair ar- 
               <br />
               gument to say that you will ﬁnd the actual 
               <br />

               population to give 13 or 14 representatives

               <br />

               railways say 240 miles ; and add on the 150 
               <br />
               miles already constructed, the total mileage 
               <br />
               in the south will be only 830 miles. A com-

               parison of the number of chartered banks 
               <br />
               north and south of township 38 will tell the 
               <br />
               same story: All the statistics simply corro-

               borate the statement I have made, and prove 
               <br />
               that the division of that country on the lines 
               <br />
               laid down by the legislative assembly would 
               <br />
               be absolutely fair. Let us take these 11 
               <br />
               seats south and 11 seats north for a further 
               <br />
               comparison. I am leaving out the constitu— 
               <br />
               encies of Athabaska, Peace River, and Red 
               <br />
               Deer which is in the middle and which can 
               <br />
               be added to either the north or the south. 
               <br />
               But take the 11 seats south of township 38 
               <br />
               and the 11 seats immediately north, and it 
               <br />
               will be found that there are required 1,415 
               <br />
               names on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">noters’</span> lists for every consti- 
               <br />
               tuency in the south, whereas in the north 
               <br />
               there are only required 1,114 names, showing 
               <br />

               voters for each constituency. I have stated 
               <br />
               to the Prime Minister that my ﬁgures do not 
               <br />
               agree with the ﬁgures he gave as to the 
               <br />
               number of votes cast and the number of 
               <br />
               voters names on the lists, and I will show 
               <br />
               where they vary. I have the figures worked

               would point to any constituency in which 
               <br />
               he thinks the vote is over estimated or un- 
               <br />

               <br />
               of. votes polled was 1.168 and the number of 
               <br />
