               The ﬁrst law which we ﬁnd was an ordi- 
               <br />
               nance passed in 1884. This law had sev- 
               <br />
               eral important provisions. Perhaps the 
               <br />
               most important of all was that there was 
               <br />
               to be a council of education, a board of edu- 
               <br />

               <br />
               members, 6 of whom were to be Roman 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Catholics</span> and G of whom were to be Pro- 
               <br />
               testants;‘that the board of education was 
               <br />
               to be divided into two sections, the Protes- 
               <br />
               tant section and the Catholic section; that 
               <br />
               each section was to have under its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">juris-</span> 
               <br />
               diction and control the management of the 
               <br />
               schools of its own denomination, the R0- 
               <br />
               man Catholic section was to have under its 
               <br />
               control the management of the Roman Ca- 
               <br />
               tholic schools and the regulation of their 
               <br />
               discipline; it was to arrange for proper ex- 
               <br />
               aminations, guiding and licensing of teach~ 
               <br />
               ers, to select the books to be used in the 
               <br />
               schools provided that in the case of all 
               <br />
               books having reference to religion and 
               <br />
               morals. such selection should be subject to 
               <br />
               the approval of a competent religious antho- 
               <br />
               rity, to appoint inspectors. That was the 
               <br />
               complete power of supervision of the schools 
               <br />
               given to the Roman Catholic section of the 
               <br />
               board of education. The same thing was 
               <br />
               provided for the Protestant subsection. 
               <br />
               Another important provision was that a 
               <br />
               school district could be for-med on the peti- 
               <br />
               tion of a certain number of ratepayers 
               <br />
               wunin a certain area and that all schools 
               <br />
               were to be organized at once either as Pro- 
               <br />
               testant or Roman Catholic public schools. 
               <br />
               Another important provision was that with 
               <br />
               regard to religious instruction, that when a 
               <br />
               school system had been organized. a sepa-

               rate school could be organized by the mino- 
               <br />
               rity. Another important point was that all 
               <br />

               any substantial alteration until the year

               1887, when an important amendment was

               should be either Protestant public schools 
               <br />

               <br />
               pealed, and a provision was made to the con- 
               <br />
               trary, namely, that all public schools should 
               <br />
               be at once organized as public schools quite 
               <br />
               independent of the religious faith of the ma— 
               <br />
               jority. No important amendment took place 
               <br />
               afterwards until the year 1892, when a very 
               <br />
               important amendment was made. By that 
               <br />

               force until 1901, when it was consolidated 
               <br />
               with practically no change, except that there
