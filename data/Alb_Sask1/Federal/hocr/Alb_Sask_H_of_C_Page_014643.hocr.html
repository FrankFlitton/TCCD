               Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">W‘ILFRID</span> LAURIER. It appears 
               <br />
               that my hon. friend laid that memorial on 
               <br />
               the table of this House, but we know that 
               <br />
               many memorials and petitions are brought 
               <br />
               here and very little attention is paid to 
               <br />
               them. When I read the statement of Mr. 
               <br />
               Rogers, I had no recollection that this mat— 
               <br />
               ter had been brought to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> of 
               <br />
               this government by the government of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba. I inquired of my colleagues, and they 
               <br />
               were of the same opinion as myself. To 
               <br />
               make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sure,</span> I asked the clerk of the Privy 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council</span> if any petition had been received 
               <br />
               from the government of Manitoba, and he 
               <br />
               gave me this memorandum: 
               <br />

               From June, 1896. to January, 1905, there is 
               <br />
               no record in the Privy Council office of a. claim 
               <br />
               advanced by the province of Manitoba for the 
               <br />
               extension of its boundaries. In May, 1902, there 
               <br />
               was a protest from the Northwest Territories 
               <br />
               against the extension of the boundaries of the 
               <br />
               province of Manitoba.

               What my hon. friend shows to-day is that 
               <br />
               a petition was passed by the legislature of 
               <br />
               Manitoba and was presented at this table 
               <br />
               by my hon. friend. But I have no recollec- 
               <br />
               tion of it, and I cannot bring it down, 
               <br />
               because it is not in the archives of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, but is already in the archives of 
               <br />
               the House of Commons. Therefore, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend will see that after all I was 
               <br />
               not inaccurate.

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. I am not quite so 
               <br />
               sure of that. It is rather a small matter 
               <br />
               perhaps, but I would be inclined to think 
               <br />
               that the right hon. gentleman is rather in- 
               <br />
               accurate. It is quite true, as he says, that 
               <br />
               the resolutions of the Manitoba legislature 
               <br />
               were not followed by executive action in 
               <br />
               one sense; but he said something else. 
               <br />
               He said : 
               <br />
