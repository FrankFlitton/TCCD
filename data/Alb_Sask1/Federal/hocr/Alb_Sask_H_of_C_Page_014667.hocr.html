               <br />
               In the late elections, throughout the whole 
               <br />
               west, there was no announcement by the 
               <br />
               government that the new provinces would 
               <br />
               be deprived of their control of education. 
               <br />
               When the Minister of the Interior was 
               <br />
               asked to speak upon the question of educa- 
               <br />
               tion, he told the people, forsooth, that the 
               <br />
               matter could not be discussed. except at a 
               <br />
               full cabinet meeting, and yet in his absence, 
               <br />
               and in the absence of the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance, the question is dealt with and the 
               <br />
               people of the west kept in the dark. The 
               <br />
               people of the west were told that the min- 
               <br />
               isters from the Northwest Territories would 
               <br />
               have the fullest opportunity to consult the 
               <br />
               Dominion cabinet assembled in force, but 
               <br />
               the fact is that the representatives of the 
               <br />
               Territories were not summoned to Ottawa 
               <br />

               until after the departure of the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance and Interior had departed, and this 
               <br />
               session of parliament was in progress. 
               <br />
               That may have been a clever thing 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> the government to do, but it is not, 
               <br />
               new. They did the same thing with regard <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> 
               <br />
               to the Transcontinental Railway, which was 
               <br />
               not discussed until the House was in 
               <br />
               session, introduced in a hurried way 
               <br />
               into parliament, and with regard to which 
               <br />
               the announcement was made that powerful 
               <br />
               interests could not wait. I wonder what in- 
               <br />
               terests cannot wait now. The people of 
               <br />
               Canada are asking what these interests are, 
               <br />
               and the people are bound to ﬁnd out. The 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior told us that this 
               <br />
               matter would require the greatest consider- 
               <br />
               ation, and that for years he had pond- 
               <br />
               ered anxiously over the various clauses of 
               <br />
               the Bill, but not over the educational 
               <br />
               clauses. Is not that proof that the 
               <br />
               government intended the people to under- 
               <br />
               stand—and it may be possible that the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of the Interior also understood—that 
               <br />
               this question was settled by the people of the 
               <br />
               west in a way satisfactory to themselves, 
               <br />
               and that whatever rights were established 
               <br />
               under the British North America Act would 
               <br />
               be the rights which would govern the peo- 
               <br />
               ple of that free province, and not that the 
               <br />
               parliament of Canada would endeavour to 
               <br />
               gag the people of the Territories and make 
               <br />
               them vassals of the federal power. 
               <br />
               The ex-Minister of the Interior says that 
               <br />
               before his departure in January last, he 
               <br />
               made out a memorandum for his colleagues 
               <br />
               in the cabinet, but not with reference to 
               <br />
               the educational clause. He says that he 
               <br />
               was favoiired with correspondence from the 
               <br />
               right hon. gentleman who leads the govern- 
               <br />
               ment, but not in reference to the educa- 
               <br />
               tional clause. He says that there were 
               <br />
               conferences in which this measure was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis</span> 
               <br />
               cussed with members of the government, 
               <br />
               but there was no discussion as to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">edu‘</span> 
               <br />
               cational clause. We come down then to 
               <br />
               the fact that when the Bill was prepared

               clause, and there was not one word about 
               <br />
               that. I appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, if 
               <br />
               this does not show, in the most conclusive 
               <br />
               manner, that there was a deliberate intell- 
               <br />
               tion to' spring this measure and to take 
               <br />
               advantage of the people at the last moment. 
               <br />
               Is it not true that until the last moment the 
               <br />
               ex-minister of the Interior and the cabinet 
               <br />
               of which he was one of the most prominent 
               <br />
               members, understood or pretended that the 
               <br />
               measure was out of the arena of discussion, 
               <br />
               that it had been settled by the representa- 
               <br />
               tives of the west, and that the people of 
               <br />
               the west were to have their rights ? But, 
               <br />
               in some way which we cannot fathom, but 
               <br />
               which we will get at in time, some silent 
               <br />
               pressure was brought to bear upon the First 
               <br />
               Minister three or four days before the Bill 
               <br />
               was introduced, and at the time when there 
               <br />
               was a question about extending the bound- 
               <br />
               aries of Manitoba, this fatally dangerous 
               <br />
               question is revived, and the representatives 
               <br />
               of Manitoba are told: If you want your 
               <br />
               boundaries extended, you had better improve 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your</span> school policy. And told by whom? By 
               <br />
               the members of the cabinet ? By the repre- 
               <br />
               sentatives of the people of Canada? No, 
               <br />
               not by them, but by the representative of 
               <br />
               the Holy See, who, he tells us, invited these 
               <br />
               gentlemen to meet him. Of course, we are 
               <br />
               bound to accept his statement, that it 
               <br />
               was without any sinister motive, and 
               <br />
               only casually, that he discussed the 
               <br />
               matter, but still with the object of ad- 
               <br />
               vancing what he believed and properly 
               <br />
               believed, to be the interests of his church. 
               <br />
               I am not going to ascribe motives, but it 
               <br />
               will be for the people to say just what all 
               <br />
               this means. I am going to call the atten- 
               <br />
               tion of the people to what I believe it 
               <br />
               means. I believe it means that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliber‘</span> 
               <br />
               ate plan was formed in 1897 to work sil- 
               <br />
               ently and in the dark, and to throw the 
               <br />
               people down on this question when 
               <br />
               the proper hour would arrive. What 
               <br />
               evidence have I of this? I am glad to see 
               <br />
               the Minister of Justice in his place, and 
               <br />
               therefore I have no hesitation in referring 
               <br />
               to the eloquent way in which a few years 
               <br />
               ago he referred to a matter which is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pertin«</span> 
               <br />
               ent to the subject I am now dealing with. 
               <br />
               That hon. gentleman proclaimed the other 
               <br />
               night in this House that there could be no 
               <br />
               peace in this country until the minority had 
               <br />
               received their rights, and in 1896-97 this 
               <br />
               country was ringing with the same state- 
               <br />
               ment that there would be no peace until 
               <br />
               the minority had their rights. But in the 
               <br />
               interval, between 1897 and 1905, we had 
               <br />
               almost silence on that question; we had a 
               <br />
               lull in the storm. Now, the people are ask- 
               <br />
               ing what it all means and what is the im- 
               <br />
               pelliug cause, of the very peculiar and very 
               <br />
               striking conduct of the First Minister in
