               must have drawn the ﬁrst educational 
               <br />
               clauses of this Bill. When that statement 
               <br />
               was made I did not notice any signs of hum- 
               <br />

               of the eX-minister, taken in connection with 
               <br />
               the accompanying circumstances, be him—

               This is a great game, it seems to me. It 
               <br />
               has not been customary for the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice to sit silent when charges 
               <br />
               of that kind have been made in respect to 
               <br />
               his work. The hon. Minister of Justice does 
               <br />
               not lack courage and it is rather a peculiar 
               <br />
               position in which we ﬁnd that hon. gentle- 
               <br />
               man. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘Ve</span> see him sitting docile and calm, 
               <br />
               taking the thrusts of the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Brandon. Is it because there is any brother- 
               <br />
               ly love that we do not know of, or affection, 
               <br />
               or charity existing between these hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen? Is it out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generosixt'</span> of his 
               <br />
               heart that he is not going to pay any at- 
               <br />
               tention to these things? No, it is not that. 
               <br />
               It is a larger game, a bigger game. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Brandon knew‘, when he 
               <br />
               made that statement in reference to the 
               <br />
               draughtsman, that it was impossible for the 
               <br />
               hon. Minister of Justice to answer him. He 
               <br />
               knew he could not answer him. The hon. 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice wants a law enacted 
               <br />
               granting the privilege that the amendment 
               <br />

               <br />
               arate schools by Dominion legislation, and 
               <br />
               the hon. Minister of Justice knew that if 
               <br />
               he got up and contradicted the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Brandon in respect to the amendments 
               <br />
               being radically different from the original 
               <br />
               clauses that the‘ Minister of Justice having 
               <br />
               a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ifollowing</span> in this House and his legal 
               <br />
               advice being respected, it would change the 
               <br />
               intention and belief of the seven members 
               <br />
               from the Northwest, and he knew that if 
               <br />
               the belief of the seven members from the 
               <br />

               for Brandon were shattered they would not 
               <br />
               vote for this Bill, that there would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> 
               <br />
               other bolt and that might lead to a further 
               <br />
               bolt and the result was that the hon. Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Justice had to sit in his place and 
               <br />
               wait until every hon. member from the 
               <br />

               <br />

               chief study in the public schools of Great 
               <br />
               Britain is the study of religious dogma. The

               <br />
               ian, civic control. Prior to 1870 denomina- 
               <br />
               tional schools existed in Great Britain. They 
               <br />
               were not able to stem the tide of illiteracy 
               <br />
               and in 1870 the Forster law provided for 
               <br />
               the establishment of public and secular 
               <br />
               schools. From 1870 to 1902, forty-eight per 
               <br />
               cent of the children have been educated in 
               <br />
               these schools. The denominational schools. 
               <br />
               as they existed previous to 1870, have 
               <br />
               shrunken in number. They have fallen from 
               <br />
               100 per cent. in 1870 to 52 per cent in 1902.

               By a law passed in 1902 denominational

               In France What is the situation? In 1879, 
               <br />
               under Jules Ferry, who was appointed Min- 
               <br />
               ister of Public Instruction, a measure was 
               <br />
               adopted by which public schools were freed 
               <br />
               from all relation with the chu'rch. By a 
               <br />
               regulation of 1886 the employment in future 
               <br />
               in public schools of teachers belonging to 
               <br />
               religious orders was forbidden. At the end 
               <br />
               of 1897 there were 4,000,000 pupils going to 
               <br />
               secular schools and 1,500,000 pupils going to 
               <br />
               clerical schools. In the last few years 
               <br />
               schools ‘maintained by religious associations 
               <br />
               have been abolished. In 25 years the na-

               tional system has developed, the attendance 
               <br />
               has improved and there are better courses of 
               <br />
               study and better qualiﬁed teachers. I do

               not refer to this for the purpose of showing 
               <br />
               that the conditions which exist in England
