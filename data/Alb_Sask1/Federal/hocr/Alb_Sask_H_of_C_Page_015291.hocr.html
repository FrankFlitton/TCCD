               <br />
               The section of Athabaska which is north of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan is only partially agricultural. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend, if he will look at the Bill 
               <br />
               which was prepared by the government 01' 
               <br />
               the Northwest Territories, will see that they 
               <br />
               proposed to make one province of the dis- 
               <br />
               trict of Saskatchewan and the district 01‘ 
               <br />
               Assiniboia. to be the province of Saskatche- 
               <br />
               wan up to the 57th degree of latitude, where- 
               <br />
               as the district of Athabaska extends to the 
               <br />
               60th degree of latitude. Up to the 57th degree 
               <br />
               there is a fair agricultural country north of 
               <br />
               Saskatchewan, beyond the 57th degree of 
               <br />
               latitude the country becomes barren until it 
               <br />
               reaches absolute barrenness in Mackenzie. 
               <br />
               These are the reasons why we include Atiia~ 
               <br />
               baska in these two new provinces.
