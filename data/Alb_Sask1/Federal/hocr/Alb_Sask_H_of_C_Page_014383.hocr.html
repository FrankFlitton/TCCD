               if they had not expected to derive some 
               <br />
               party advantage from it; and when the 
               <br />
               ex-Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton) re— 
               <br />
               signed his portfolio, they concluded that 
               <br />
               their day had come and that if they could 
               <br />
               only keep up the agitation and make the 
               <br />
               storm still greater, some very great mater— 
               <br />
               ial, political beneﬁt would be the re- 
               <br />
               sult. They succeeded in getting their 
               <br />
               leader Who, we believe, up to that point 
               <br />
               Was very undecided as to the position he 
               <br />
               should take, to adopt their views and take 
               <br />
               the course he did.

               remarks to which I was referring. He said

               was put upon me by any hon. gentleman on
