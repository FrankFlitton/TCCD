               their actual position how can they dare

               courage in speaking on behalf of a motion 
               <br />
               to take away from their brothers in the

               <br />
               proud to speak. We can hear some of these

               gentlemen speaking and singing loudly on 
               <br />

               Mr. MONK. My hon. friend the Minister 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofythe</span> Interior seemed to be very much em- 
               <br />
               barrassed as to the interpretation of the 
               <br />
               amendment which I have presented to the 
               <br />
               House that even after a lengthy discussion 
               <br />
               with the leader of the opposition. he seems 
               <br />
               still not to understand the gist of it. I told 
               <br />
               my hon. friend that it might be modiﬁed. 
               <br />
               There‘is no doubt that the sub-amendment 
               <br />
               presented by the hon. member for Labelle 
               <br />
               more clearly expresses the full extent of the 
               <br />
               rights that were granted in 1870 and sub- 
               <br />
               sequently consecrated by legislation. If my 
               <br />
               hon. friend has any doubt as to the meaning 
               <br />
               of my amendment, he had better vote with 
               <br />
               me for the sub-amendment of the hon. mem- 
               <br />
               ber for Labelle. I thought my hon. friend 
               <br />
               would take a larger view of this question, 
               <br />
               and deal with it on its merits as the right 
               <br />
               hon. leader of the government did, instead 
               <br />
               of spending most of his argument in trying 
               <br />
               to cast obscurity on the amendment as I 
               <br />
               drafted it. I may say that it is only a re- 
               <br />
               petition of the law as it was drafted in 
               <br />
               1890. The Minister of Inland Revenue and 
               <br />
               the Solicitor General have said again and 
               <br />
               again—it is their hackneyed defence—that 
               <br />
               those who bring up the question of this kind 
               <br />
               do so for the purpose of creating an agita- 
               <br />
               tion. Is my hon. friend serious in that? 
               <br />
               Is it his opinion that we have such a low

               I have that intention? My hon. friend 
               <br />
               knows perfectly well that after the general 
               <br />
               election of 1896, I stated at a caucus of 
               <br />
               which a report appeared in the Montreal 
               <br />

               upon it as one of the most culpable acts a

               this important QUestion to the notice of 
               <br />
               this House, as he was in duty bound to 
               <br />
               do, he should use it afterwards for the sinis-

               men of French origin against the rest of

               every occasion has done that miserable 
               <br />
