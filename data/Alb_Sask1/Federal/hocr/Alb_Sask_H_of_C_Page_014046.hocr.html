               ment by the Board of Trade, the govern— 
               <br />
               ment is bound to consider the ﬁtness of the 
               <br />
               persons proposed, but naturally would ac- 
               <br />
               cept those recommendations unless there 
               <br />
               was cause to the contrary. At all events, 
               <br />
               that is the interpretation we have given to 
               <br />
               the statute, and I think that interpretation 
               <br />
               will be accepted by parliament. In this 
               <br />
               case the recommendations made by Toronto 
               <br />
               were accepted without dissent. So'were 
               <br />
               the recommendations made by Winnipeg. 
               <br />
               But some dissent was expressed to the re- 
               <br />
               commendations made by the Montreal Board 
               <br />
               of Trade. I do not mean that the fact that 
               <br />
               Messrs. Carrnthers and Metcalfe were 
               <br />
               passed over would indicate anything against 
               <br />
               those gentlemen. I do not think it would 
               <br />
               be fair to imply or accept anything of that 
               <br />
               kind. But the Minister of Trade and Com-
