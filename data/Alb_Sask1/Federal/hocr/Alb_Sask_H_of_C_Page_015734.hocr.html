               <br />

               <br />

               <br />

               It is well we should know exactly what 
               <br />
               the position was, viewed from :1 different 
               <br />
               point of view. I entirely agree with my 
               <br />
               right hon. friend the Prime Minister in the 
               <br />
               words he uttered this afternoon when he 
               <br />
               said that if we want to build up a nation 
               <br />
               we can only do it on the principle <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of.</span> con- 
               <br />
               ciliation and fair-play to everybody._ But if 
               <br />
               we are to put such a principle into practise 
               <br />
               there must be one law for all—one law for 
               <br />
               Protestants and Catholics alike, one law for 
               <br />
               French, English, Scotch and Irish. What 
               <br />
               has been done by the territorial government 
               <br />
               would be qualiﬁed as an infamous act of 
               <br />
               tyranny had it been done by a Catholic gov-

               ernment at the expense of a Protestant

               <br />
               condemn as infamous if done by a Catholic 
               <br />

               <br />
               Catholic minority? I leave it to the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment to decide what difference there is 
               <br />
               between the two cases. But that is not the

               members of this House. What we ask is not 
               <br />
               that the catechism be taught for half an 
               <br />
               hour during the time given to religious in— 
               <br />
               struction. I have been in one of those 
               <br />
               church schools in the province of Quebec. 
               <br />
               and there all the teaching of catechism we 
               <br />
               had only took up one hour a week. But 
               <br />
               what we claim as inseparable from separate 
               <br />
               Schools is that in the teaching of history. 
               <br />
               in the reading books, in the study of classi- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cal</span> authors, we should have the right to im- 
               <br />
               press upon the minds of the children the 
               <br />
               principles of our religion, and this again 
               <br />
               has been positively stated by Lord Her- 
               <br />
               scheli, in the second case of Manitoba. as 
               <br />
               one of the essential features of the separate 
               <br />
               school system, so far as Roman Catholics 
               <br />
               are concerned. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.Aﬂidavits</span> were produced 
               <br />
               there, just as declarations have been made 
               <br />
               here. to the effect that several Catholics 
               <br />
               did not care for that kind of religious teach- 
               <br />
               ing. But, as one of the other members of 
               <br />
               the Privy Council said: Whatever may be
