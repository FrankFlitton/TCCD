               —the Catholic minority in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories were granted rights and privi- 
               <br />
               leges to the fullest extent they could desire 
               <br />
               and enjoyed these rights and privileges down 
               <br />
               to 1892. But, I am sorry to have to confess, 
               <br />
               those rights and privileges were consider- 
               <br />
               ably curtailed in 1892 by the legislature of 
               <br />
               the Territories. They were curtailed by 
               <br />
               their own local legislature, whose members 
               <br />
               were elected by the people, whose executive 
               <br />
               council was responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the people, and 
               <br />
               to which was given the supervision of the 
               <br />
               status and condition of education in that 
               <br />
               country. The law existing previous to 1892 
               <br />
               was amended, not to the advantage of the 
               <br />
               Catholic minority, I admit, but still that was 
               <br />
               done by the local legislature elected by the 
               <br />
               people, and we must take it for granted 
               <br />
               that in amending a law, a legislature has 
               <br />
               the intention of bettering the existing con- 
               <br />
               ditions, said legislature may err, may make 
               <br />
               a mistake, but intendedly its action is sup- 
               <br />
               posed to be moved towards an improvement. 
               <br />
               It' I understood the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">memnber</span> (Mr. 
               <br />
               Sproule) correctly, he said that section 93 of 
               <br />
               the British North America Act did.not apply 
               <br />
               to the maritime provinces, did not apply 
               <br />
               to the province of New Brunswick. Mr.

               Chairman, in the course of the speech which 
               <br />
               I had the honour to deliver on the second 
               <br />

               <br />
               93 did apply to the province of New Bruns-

               did not say that section 93 of the British

               <br />
               I understood. him to say that it did not

               apply to New Brunswick. If I misunder-

               stood him, of course I accept his correction. 
               <br />
               But, at the same time, it may be as well 
               <br />
               that I should continue my argument. In 
               <br />
               New Brunswick, we had the privilege of 
               <br />
               denominational schools—both the Catholics 
               <br />
               and the Protestants; but we did not apply to 
               <br />
               the court against the law under which the 
               <br />
               schools were inaugurated. To eliminate any 
               <br />
               doubt that may exist in the minds of any of 
               <br />
               my colleagues, I may say that we had not 
               <br />
               appealed to the court on the privileges which 
               <br />
               had been granted to us by the board of 
               <br />
               education, or the inspectors under that 
               <br />
               board. The Supreme Court judges said 
               <br />
               they would be prepared to look into our 
               <br />
               claim were we coming before them upon 
               <br />
               the merits of those privileges. Instead of 
               <br />
               taking that step, after so many years of 
               <br />
               struggle, the .CatbOIic minority of New 
               <br />
               Brunswick preferred to work out their own 
               <br />
               fate. Before I go further, it may be that
