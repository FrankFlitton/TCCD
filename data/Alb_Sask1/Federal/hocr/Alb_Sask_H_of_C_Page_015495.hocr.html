               which can. in any way throw any light 
               <br />
               upon that law. We all know that the Act 
               <br />
               of 1875 was passed somewhat hurriedly; 
               <br />
               we know that section 11 was introduced 
               <br />
               after the other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provisions</span> of the statute had 
               <br />
               been discussed by the House. A subject of 
               <br />
               great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">importance,</span> such as the question of 
               <br />
               education, was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">treated</span> in a very short sec- 
               <br />
               tion and in very .few words. ‘It was passed 
               <br />
               with apparently no contentious discussion in 
               <br />
               the House; it was passed, as I remember, 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unanimously,</span> and there was no discussion 
               <br />
               whatever as to the meaning and effect of the 
               <br />
               terms used. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:We</span> know that in 1875, when 
               <br />
               this law was passed, it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:but</span> a few years 
               <br />
               after the passage of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">[Lt</span> is a matter of history 
               <br />
               that in Canada so far as legislation is

               concerned the meaning of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> words 
               <br />
               ‘sepalrate schools’ is synonymous to ‘de-

               nominational schools ’ : in the British North 
               <br />
               America Act the same sensewas attached 
               <br />
               to it as to '-the words ‘denominational 
               <br />
               schools.’ We :had only two kinds of schools 
               <br />
               in Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> that time, viz., the public 
               <br />
               school and the separate school. Separate 
               <br />
               schools were introduced in Ontario in 1860, 
               <br />
               and they were then intended to be, and 
               <br />
               have ever since been, denominational schools. 
               <br />
               So it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> in the province of Quebec; the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">separate</span> schools of the province of Quebec 
               <br />
               are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">today</span> denominational schools and so 
               <br />
               they are in Ontario. I appeal to any member 
               <br />
               in this House to poinrt to me a single instance 
               <br />

               is a separate school which is not, to all

               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BElDClOURT.</span> As far as I understand 
               <br />
               the legislation of this country, whether it 
               <br />
               has been Dominion or provincial legislation, 
               <br />
               denominational schools have been conﬁned 
               <br />
               to two classes of His Majesty’s subjects, 
               <br />
               that is the Protestants on the one hand and 
               <br />
               the Catholics on the other. That is the only 
               <br />
               distinction, that is the only division or 
               <br />
               separation which any of our laws has ever 
               <br />
               contemplated and I say when the Confeder- 
               <br />
               ation Act of 1867 was framed it was—

               Mr. R. L. BORDEN. That may be very 
               <br />
               true, but still would not what has just been

               Mr. BELCOURT. No, I do not think so. 
               <br />
               because the words ‘denominational schools ’ 
               <br />
               is used in a general sense as far as Pro~ 
               <br />
               tostants are concerned. My hon. friend 
               <br />
               must admit that the expression ‘denomin- 
               <br />
               ational sghool-s’ was a distinction between 
               <br />
               Protestant and Catholic schools, exclusive- 
               <br />
               ly, and I say all through our legislation they 
               <br />
               have been treated as such. Nobody has 
               <br />
               ever thought in speaking of denominational 
               <br />
               schools of attempting to give the Mormons, 
               <br />
               the Doukhobors. the Galicians or any 
               <br />
               other sect, separate schools, it has always 
               <br />
               been a separation, as between Protestants 
               <br />
               and Catholics only.
