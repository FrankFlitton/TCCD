               honour to represent on the ﬂoor of this 
               <br />
               House have not considered this question from 
               <br />
               the mere standpoint of party politics. nor 
               <br />
               have they allowed the agitation which has 
               <br />
               prevailed in certain quarters. nor the appeals 
               <br />

               <br />
               sion. to stir up strife and bitterness in their

               <br />
               a lofticr plane and they have treated this 
               <br />
               most delicate question with a breadth of 
               <br />
               thought and a toleration which to my mind 
               <br />
               speaks well for the future greatness of that 
               <br />
               western country. We well know that to 
               <br />
               build up a great province in the west. all

               other classes must work together for the

               common good. That, Sir. can only be ac— 
               <br />
               complished when toleration and sympathy 
               <br />
               and a respect for the opinions and feelings 
               <br />
               of others characterize the relations of one 
               <br />
               class towards the other. In conclusion I 
               <br />
               may say that the school laws of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North-</span> 
               <br />
               west Territories have in the past worked to

               the entire satisfaction of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peopie.</span> 'and 
               <br />
               I have no hesitation in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying.r</span> that the 
               <br />
               school clauses now contained in this Bill 
               <br />
               have my unqualiﬁed approval. Just one

               <br />
               1896. I do not think so. What position did

               the right hon. gentleman take in 1896, and 
               <br />
               what did he say to the people of Manitoba

               Mr. LAKE. I was accused of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making</span> 
               <br />
               a misstatement and I wish to put that right. 
               <br />
               I shall do so in as few words as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible.</span>

               The hon. gentleman quoted the resolution 
               <br />
               in general terms oifered by Mr. Haultain, 
               <br />
               and that resolution simply endorsed the de- 
               <br />
               mand for autonomy. He quoted that as a 
               <br />
               proof that the assembly did not endorse the 
               <br />
               draft Bill. There were other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolutions</span> 
               <br />
               offered later on in that House. The draft 
               <br />
               Bill was not endorsed by a speciﬁc vote of 
               <br />
               the legislature and I never said so. But the 
               <br />
               gentleman who generally spoke for the op-

               position in the legislative assembly. Mr. 
               <br />
               Bennett. introduced the following resolution:
