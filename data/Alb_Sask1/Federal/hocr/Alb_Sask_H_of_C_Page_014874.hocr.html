               legislating as we did in 1870. we exhausted 
               <br />
               the powers given us in that regard by sec-

               <br />
               of 1867. But those powers were ampliﬁed 
               <br />
               or extended by the Imperial legislation 
               <br />

               It has been a matter of wonder to me 
               <br />
               that the Imperial House did not, in its Act 
               <br />
               of 1871, content itself with simply validat- 
               <br />
               ing the Manitoba Act; but it did not stop 
               <br />
               there. It went on to treat of the admis- 
               <br />
               sion of further Territories west of Mani- 
               <br />
               toba, and gave us power to constitute them 
               <br />
               into provinces, and in the meantime to 
               <br />
               make provision for their peace, order and 
               <br />
               good government. Had it been the intention 
               <br />
               of the Imperial parliament merely to valid- 
               <br />
               ate our legislation admitting Manitoba into 
               <br />
               the union, surely that parliament would 
               <br />
               have stopped there, but instead it went on 
               <br />
               to add to our power; and in my judgment 
               <br />
               we are to-day properly acting under clause 
               <br />
               section 2 of the Imperial Act of 1871 in 
               <br />
               constituting these provinces. Acting under 
               <br />
               the power given by that Act of 1871 this 
               <br />
               Dominion parliament undertook to provide 
               <br />
               for the administration of those Territories 
               <br />
               and for the maintenance of peace, order 
               <br />
               and good government therein. The most 
               <br />
               important piece of legislation in that re- 
               <br />
               gard was Mr. Mackenzie’s Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               torial Act of 1875. In the exercise of our 
               <br />
               powers, we granted a constitution to these 
               <br />
               Territories. The educational enactment of 
               <br />
               that Act of 1875 has been so often referred 
               <br />
               to that I shall spare the House a repetition 
               <br />
               of it. Sufﬁce to say that a system of sepa- 
               <br />
               rate schools was instituted, and on that 
               <br />
               system was based the Territorial school 
               <br />
               system such as we know it to-day. Take 
               <br />
               up the debate which took place in 1875 on 
               <br />
               that measure. and you will ﬁnd the utter-

               Surely no reasonable man can read Mr.

               Blake’s remarks and not be struck 
               <br />
               by the fact that, in his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinioll</span> the

               parliament of Canada was engaged in pas-

               be the legitimate deductions from Mr.

               what the Hon. David Mills, also an Ontario
