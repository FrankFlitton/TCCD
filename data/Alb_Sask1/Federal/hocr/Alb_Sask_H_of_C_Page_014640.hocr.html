               for the purpose of securing more money

               <br />
               wer Mr. Mackenzie gave was this: Go 
               <br />
               back to your own province and see if, by 
               <br />

               in a position to grant you more ﬁnancial

               assistance. The chief fault Mr. Mackenzie

               found with them was that they had two 
               <br />
               chambers, they had a legislative council 
               <br />

               ought to abolish ﬁhe legislative council, 
               <br />
               and he promised if they would exercise 
               <br />
               economy in that matter, he would be will-

               was a govern-ment employee there at the

               time. and I remember the promise made 
               <br />
               squarely to the minority of the province, as 
               <br />
               represented in the legislative council that

               has been said, to Archbishop Tache and 
               <br />
               Mr. Ewart. We, as Protestants, do not

               If the Conservative Prime Minister chose

               have the right to do the same. But we

               draw a distinction here—the papal delegate

               <br />
               Bill been brought in minus the educational 
               <br />
               clauses, the people of the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />
               tories would have continued to enjoy the 
               <br />
               same privileges in education that they now 
               <br />
               have, unless those privileges were curtailed 
               <br />
               by the legislature we might create. But, 
               <br />
               if the legislature made such changes we be- 
               <br />
               lieve they would be within their rights.
