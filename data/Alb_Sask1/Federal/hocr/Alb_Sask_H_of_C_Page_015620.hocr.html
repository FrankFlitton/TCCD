               <br />
               been pointed out by the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Victoria (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:Sam.</span> Hughes), it is people that 
               <br />
               should count and men that should vote. 
               <br />
               The Minister of the Interior (Mr. Oliver) 
               <br />
               has asked why there has been no protest 
               <br />
               against inequalities in other provinces. if 
               <br />
               he were conversant with provincial affairs 
               <br />
               in Ontario, he would know that this has 
               <br />
               been a crying evil for many years,‘against 
               <br />
               which there have been numberless protests. 
               <br />
               At this moment the position is far from satis- 
               <br />
               factory, especially in the case of the city 
               <br />
               of Toronto. Toronto is represented in this 
               <br />
               House and in the local legislature by one 
               <br />
               member to about 45,000 or 50,000 of popula— 
               <br />
               tion, whereas rural constituencies each re- 
               <br />
               presented by a member some times have a 
               <br />
               population of 15,000. The Prime Minister 
               <br />
               rises to defend that by stating that the 
               <br />
               cities cannot be allowed the same represen— 
               <br />
               tation as a country district. I do not think 
               <br />
               he made out a very good case; certainly 
               <br />
               not a case to justify the discrepancy of 400 
               <br />
               or .500 per cent. The principle I contend 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> for is that, if there is to be one man one 
               <br />
               vote, then it should be one vote one value. 
               <br />
               The Minister of the Interior has spoken of 
               <br />
               Toronto and Montreal as places whose re— 
               <br />
               presentation as it is to—day should be pro- 
               <br />
               tested against. So far as Toronto is con- 
               <br />
               cerned, a protest has been made; and Mr. 
               <br />
               Whitney, I believe, is pledged to remedy 
               <br />
               the evil in the near future, and that, I think, 
               <br />
               will be one of the ﬁrst acts of his adminis- 
               <br />
               tration. Montreal is not quite in the same 
               <br />
               position as Toronto is. In Montreal a man 
               <br />
               may vote in every constituency in which 
               <br />
               he has property. It is possible for a man 
               <br />
               there to put in ﬁve votes. In Ontario a 
               <br />
               man may be a multi-millionaire, and own 
               <br />
               property in a dozen constituencies, but he 
               <br />
               votes only in one. There is inequality, and 
               <br />
               that inequality is being protested against, 
               <br />
               and Will be protested against until justice 
               <br />
               is done. These are inequalities that exist. 
               <br />
               But here, under this Bill, you are establish- 
               <br />
               ing these inequalities in a new province. 
               <br />
               We ought at least to start equal—inequali— 
               <br />
               ties will come with time. Some districts 
               <br />
               will increase in population, while others 
               <br />
               will not increase, or may even decrease, so 
               <br />
               that, if changes are not made in the repre- 
               <br />
               sentation, we may ﬁnd that one voter in 
               <br />
               a certain district has equal power with ﬁve 
               <br />
               voters in another. This is neither justice 
               <br />
               nor common sense. If the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior intends to uphold this distribution 
               <br />
               on grounds of reason, he should start <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> 
               <br />
               some principle—population, county boun-

               daries, geographical position or geographi- 
               <br />
               cal extent. But none of. these is laid down. 
               <br />
               but each is followed as it may suit the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> of hon. gentlemen Opposite. The 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">East</span> Minister mentioned many considera-

               tions that should govern in these matters, 
               <br />
               but he did not mention the consideration of 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DOIJ’UCEU</span> complexion. It would be a comfort

               these constituencies of very small popula-

               <br />
               fair. The Minister of the Interior (Mr. 
               <br />
               Oliver) pointed out that there was a con— 
               <br />
               ference to which Mr. Haultain was sum- 
               <br />

               <br />
               what happened. But the Minister of the 
               <br />
               Interior has told us that the question of 
               <br />
               the boundary between the provinces 
               <br />
               occupied nearly the whole time. But what 
               <br />
               we have to do with here is the boundaries 
               <br />
               between the ridings. The Minister of the 
               <br />
               interior (Mr. Oliver) and the hon. member 
               <br />

               <br />
               that the conference was held, and say that 
               <br />
               that was the time to protest. The members 
               <br />
               on this side say that they did not have this 
               <br />
               before them, and had no chance to pro-
