               In regard to the educational clauses of

               men in this House already. But at the same 
               <br />
               time the laws are not all made by the 
               <br />
               lawyers, and they are not all administered 
               <br />

               those whose special training is for the pur-

               pose of teaching geography. If I under-

               stood the law as some of our friends under-

               stand it, I certainly would vote against 
               <br />
               the educational provisions of this Bill. But 
               <br />
               I do not understand the law that way, and 
               <br />
               I am at a loss to see how they can under- 
               <br />
               stand it that way“. We have been bombarded

               here for some time with petitions in regard 
               <br />
               to this educational question; we have 
               <br />
               seen staring headlines in the papers ; there 
               <br />
               have been indignation meetings held in 
               <br />
               some parts of the country; there has been 
               <br />
               trouble, large, long and loud, all around; 
               <br />
               and what has it all been about '2 I noticed 
               <br />
               a heading in a newspaper the other day, a 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> large heading—I think it has been in 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several</span> issues of the paper. It read: ‘A 
               <br />
               Free West. a Common School, Provincial 
               <br />
               Rights, Religious Equality.’ I hear some 
               <br />
               gentlemen laugh sarcastically. I want to 
               <br />
               to say that I subscribe thoroughly to the 
               <br />
               sentiments expressed in that headline. I 
               <br />
               read further: ‘Toronto Vigorously Pro- 
               <br />
               tests Against Throttling the West.’ Well, 
               <br />
               I would like to be understood as protesting 
               <br />
               against any attempt to throttle the west. 
               <br />
               ‘Meeting emphatically protests against the

               ,visions inconsistent with their constitutional 
               <br />

               meeting in Massey Hall demanded that the 
               <br />
               government, ﬁrst should abandon the clauses. 
               <br />
