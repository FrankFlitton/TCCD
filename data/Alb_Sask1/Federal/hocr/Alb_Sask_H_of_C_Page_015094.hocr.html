               So. throughout all the documents leading 
               <br />
               up to the transfer of this territory to Can- 
               <br />
               ada, stress is laid upon the fact that when 
               <br />
               this territory becomes part of Canada. it 
               <br />
               shall do so under and in accordance with 
               <br />
               the terms of the British North America 
               <br />
               Act. Now, in that view of the case, and 
               <br />
               having the British North America Act im- 
               <br />
               ported into the Act of 1871, under which 
               <br />
               this Bill is brought down, it seems clear, 
               <br />
               according to my reason and judgment, that 
               <br />
               the whole Act applies, and that these pro- 
               <br />
               vinces are entitled to the same measure of 
               <br />
               responsibility as the other provinces under 
               <br />
               all the sections of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> except where 
               <br />
               by direct statement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> reasonable intend- 
               <br />
               ment only one or more provinces and not 
               <br />
               all the provinces is intended. That being 
               <br />
               the case, it seems to me that section 93 
               <br />
               applies to the Territories referred to in this 
               <br />
               Bill. It seems to me that section 93 applies 
               <br />
               by force and operation of the law, and, by 
               <br />
               section 2 of the Bill it is made to apply 
               <br />
               expressly, for it is so stated in the section. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> the side note states <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘BritisllNorth</span> Am- 
               <br />
               erica <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act,</span> 1867 to 1886 to apply.’ And 
               <br />
               so the minority in that province will have 
               <br />
               every beneﬁt of these sections and every 
               <br />
               beneﬁt of the law. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And,</span> whatever the 
               <br />
               law may be, in all parts of Canada, the 
               <br />
               minority equally with the majority have to 
               <br />
               submit. It may be that to-morrow the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minos</span> 
               <br />
               rity may be seeking the protection of the 
               <br />
               statute that is now being invoked; they 
               <br />
               may need the protection of the British North 
               <br />
               America Act. It does seem to me that it is 
               <br />
               better that the law should be lived up to. 
               <br />
               that in these matters we should, as it were, 
               <br />
               hue to the line, and that the law as laid down 
               <br />
               in our constitution should be maintained 
               <br />
               with regard to all classes of the community. 
               <br />
               And I believe that the minority in this coun- 
               <br />
               try have no desire to wrest from the major- 
               <br />
               ity anything to which they are not entitled. 
               <br />
               Moreover. I believe that the minority in 
               <br />
               these new provinces will receive a larger 
               <br />
               measure of justice if they are left to their 
               <br />
               legal rights.

               and demerits of separate schools did not enter

               Now, Sir, upon this legal proposition, I do 
               <br />
               ask some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> at the hands of my hon. 
               <br />
               friends. It I am right, as I think I am, I can- 
               <br />
               not endorse the view of the leader of the gov- 
               <br />
               ernment, nox- can I endorse the view of the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition, because I think that 
               <br />
               in the event of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rlitigation</span> over this 
               <br />
               Bill, it will be found that if you leave clause

               (That is clause 2 in the Bill now before 
               <br />
               the House.)

               ——-——in there as it stands—and they are certainly 
               <br />
               entitled to something like that—if you do not 
               <br />
               vary it, you will have a system of separate 
               <br />
               school-s imposed upon these provinces, a more 
               <br />
               effective system, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:in</span> the interests of supporters 
               <br />
               of separate schools, than the present clause 16. 
               <br />
               In that respect I agree with the hon. member 
               <br />
               for Beaurharnois (Mr. Bergeron), who made the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suggestion</span> last night that such would be the 
               <br />
               result. Now, if that is so, I ask again for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro‘</span> 
               <br />
               tection in that regard for those who think as 
               <br />
               [do upon that question. It is necessary to vary 
               <br />
               this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act</span> if you want to get rid of the effect of 
               <br />
               clause 93 of the British North America Act, and 
               <br />
               to do that you will have to insert in this Bill 
               <br />
               some such clause as that the provinces shall 
               <br />
               have unconditionally the exclusive right to 
               <br />
               legislate on educational matters. If you do not 
               <br />
               do that. then I say that the constitution will 
               <br />
               take its course, and the courts will decide that
