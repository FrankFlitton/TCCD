               <br />
               discipline, order <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> everything which is 
               <br />
               taught in them, you would reduce the whole 
               <br />
               matter to an absurdity. So it seems to me 
               <br />
               the common sense principle of interpretation 
               <br />
               is not in respect of quality, but in re- 
               <br />
               spect of what I have spoken about in regard 
               <br />
               to the question of ‘schools. ,Now does the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice think that if the Poles 
               <br />
               were in a majority, that under the Act of 
               <br />
               1875, and that law still has power, they 
               <br />
               could by a majority erect and establish such 
               <br />
               a school ‘as they think ﬁt,’ saying that it 
               <br />
               shall be taught by a Polish teacher, who 
               <br />
               need not have a diploma, who need not have 
               <br />
               attended a normal school, who need not 
               <br />
               teach more than two hours a day, who need 
               <br />
               not do any of these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things,</span> and yet that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> 
               <br />
               could avail themselves of the privileges of 
               <br />
               pay which go along with the erection and 
               <br />
               conduct of a school, and be a part of the 
               <br />
               system which is in vogue ? Does he think 
               <br />
               they can do that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘1</span> He does not, I do not 
               <br />
               think he can, then I think he will have to 
               <br />
               modify his interpretation of the phrase ‘ such 
               <br />
               a school as they think ﬁt.’ That is the prac- 
               <br />
               tical difficulty thart suggsets itself to my 
               <br />
               mind. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legal]</span> interpretations are some- 
               <br />
               times wonderful things, and I do not know 
               <br />
               whether I am right or wrong. But I think 
               <br />
               mine is the common sense opinion.
