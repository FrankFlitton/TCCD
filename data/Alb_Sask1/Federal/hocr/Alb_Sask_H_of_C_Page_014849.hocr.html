               treat it in the manner it ought to be treated. 
               <br />
               I think that questions of a political nature 
               <br />
               require to be dealt with on business prin~

               this is admittedly a very important ques-

               tion, and I think 11011. members on both 
               <br />
               sides should be prepared to drop all narrow 
               <br />
               political ideas and deal with it on its merits. 
               <br />
               I will not attempt to examine the British

               North America Act, as many hon. members 
               <br />
               have done, it‘ I did so I might come to a 
               <br />
               conclusion different from that of any other 
               <br />
               hon. gentleman in the House. But I will 
               <br />
               say that, using my own judgment in regard 
               <br />
               to these school clauses. I have come to the 
               <br />
               decision that it is a matter we have a right 
               <br />
               to deal with in this parliament. We are 
               <br />
               granting autonomy to these Territories and 
               <br />
               the question of provincial rights comes up. 
               <br />
               Some say that everything within the bound- 
               <br />
               aries of tDOSe provinces should be handed 
               <br />
               over entirely to the new legislatures, and 
               <br />
               that if we are granting them autonomy we 
               <br />
               should grant it without limit. W'ell, that 
               <br />
               might be all right and it might not be. I 
               <br />
               think we should deal with this question not 
               <br />
               only as regards the interests of the pro- 
               <br />
               vinces themselves. but as regards the i11- 
               <br />
               terests ot' the whole Dominion of Canada. 
               <br />
               While there are some subjects that, might 
               <br />
               properly be left to the exclusive juris- 
               <br />
               diction of the provinces, thlere <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mare</span> 
               <br />
               others which should not be left to them. 
               <br />
               We are in a different position standing 
               <br />
               in this parliament from 'what we would 
               <br />
               be if we were members of a provincial leg- 
               <br />
               islature. If we were residents of that Ter- 
               <br />
               ritory we would look at this question from 
               <br />
               a provincial standpoint altogether: whereas 
               <br />
               representing as we do the whole Dominion, 
               <br />
               we must take a broader view of the situa- 
               <br />
               tion, and we must consider the effects not 
               <br />
               only on the provinces. but on the whole 
               <br />
               Dominion. As I say. there are some matters 
               <br />
               that we can afford to leave to the provinces 
               <br />
               and others that we cannot, and education is 
               <br />
               one of these matters. The subject of edu- 
               <br />
               catiOn is not one that. at this time. I think 
               <br />
               we should leave entirely to the provinces. 
               <br />
               We are all aware that the educational <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques</span>

               <br />
               Cockshutt) has said for the past sixty years. 
               <br />
               Possibly no other question that has ever 
               <br />
               come before the people of Canada has creat- 
               <br />
               ed more friction and disturbance than this 
               <br />
               educational question. The fact is, that if 
               <br />
               we were to deal with it now in a particular 
               <br />
               way it would very likely be referred back 
               <br />
               to this parliament. If it is not settled prop-

               the Territories has been in successful opera- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> for fourteen years, it is plain and free 
               <br />
               from doubt, and that is very important. 
               <br />
               Hon. members opposite have taken the posi- 
               <br />
               tion that there is no difference between the 
               <br />
               original school clauses of the Bill and the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">xclauses</span> as they now stand amended. I 
               <br />
               think there is a good deal of difference. The 
               <br />
               original clauses of the Bill were very in- 
               <br />
               deﬁnite. Under those clauses it was open 
               <br />
               to the people to have such school laws as 
               <br />
               they had in Manitoba, or they could have 
               <br />
               the old school laws that were in existence 
               <br />
               in the Territories previous to 1890. There 
               <br />
               was just that doubt about it, but the amend- 
               <br />
               ed clauses make it more deﬁnite, the law 
               <br />
               can now be clearly understood, and there 
               <br />
               can be no question as to what law the peo- 
               <br />
               ple in the Northwest Territories will have 
               <br />
               in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">~future.</span>

            <p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               Now these school laws as they are in the 
               <br />
