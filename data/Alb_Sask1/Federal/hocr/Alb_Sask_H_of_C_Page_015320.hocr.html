               law which we have at the present time in 
               <br />
               the Territories. While I see great diiﬁculty

               in the way of placing in the Bill a section

               rid of some of those defects. The then

               That apparently ended the discussion on 
               <br />
               the Bill, and no Bill was passed. The Oh-

               <br />

               tories by the hon. gentleman who brought 
               <br />
               the matter up were: That the enumerators 
               <br />
               appointed to make up the list have power to 
               <br />
               issue certain certiﬁcates; then, after they 
               <br />
               post up their list, which, under the law, 
               <br />
               they must do eight days before the election, 
               <br />
               there is nothing to compel tin-m to remain 
               <br />
               in any particular part of the subdivision. 
               <br />
               Sometimes it is impossible to ﬁnd them. 
               <br />
               Some polling subdivisions there are as 
               <br />
               large as some Ontario constituencies ; there 
               <br />
               are no voters’ lists in the country, and the 
               <br />
               enumerator goes around about a month be- 
               <br />
               fore the election and makes up a written 
               <br />
               list. The law provides that he shall post it 
               <br />
               in two conspicuous places in the polling sub- 
               <br />
               division eight days before the election. The 
               <br />
               result is that not ﬁve per cent of the elec- 
               <br />
               tors in some of these polling subdivisions 
               <br />
               see the list. If those ~who do see it desire to 
               <br />
               have any names struck off or put on, there 
               <br />
               is no place Where the enumerator can be 
               <br />
               found. That is an objection which has ex— 
               <br />
               isted for some time. For that reason, last 
               <br />
               session, there being no member from the

               48th section of the Northwest Territories Act 
               <br />
               so as to make it as nearly as possible similar 
               <br />
               to the sections of the General Act. The pro- 
               <br />
               posed Bill says : <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">’</span>

               Every enumerator shall attach to each of the

               notice which shall be signed by him and shall 
               <br />
               designate a place and time where and when 
               <br />
               electors may conveniently ﬁnd him during at

               <br />
               for such certiﬁcates.

               That to my mind would not meet all the 
               <br />
               diﬂiculties because the areas in the polling 
               <br />
               subdivisions there are so large that a great 
               <br />
               majority of the electors have no opportunity 
               <br />
               of seeing the lists at all. The law says 
               <br />
               they shall be placed in two conspicuous 
               <br />
               places, but what may be conspicuous to the 
               <br />
               enumerators are not always conspicuous 
               <br />
               to the electors in that polling subdivision. 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tlhat</span> seems to me therefore a matter which 
               <br />
               the local legislatures can best deal with. 
               <br />
               For that reason I would not like the section 
               <br />
