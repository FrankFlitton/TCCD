               Mr. R. L. BORIDEN. I would like to 
               <br />
               say to the hon. gentleman that one of 
               <br />
               his arguments at least would lead to some 
               <br />
               extraordinary results. He says that what- 
               <br />
               ever the Dominion government provides 
               <br />
               money for, they should control. Well, the 
               <br />
               Dominion government, under the terms of 
               <br />
               this Bill, provides money for the admin- 
               <br />
               istration of justice in the new provinces, 
               <br />
               and for other matters which are under 
               <br />
               control of the provinces. All I was sug- 
               <br />
               gesting was that if the lands were under 
               <br />
               control of the new provinces, it would be 
               <br />
               proper to take into consideration the ex- 
               <br />
               pense involved in the administration of 
               <br />
               those‘ lands. He says you must not get 
               <br />
               revenue out of these lands as that would 
               <br />
               hear harshly on the people. But I did not 
               <br />
               observe him to rise here and rebuke the 
               <br />
               argument of his predecessor two years ago 
               <br />
               when he led us to believe that we would 
               <br />
               get from sixty to seventy—ﬁve million <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do]-</span> 
               <br />
               lars out of these lands. Well, it will not 
               <br />
               bear less hardly on the people if that 
               <br />
               money be taken by the Dominion than if 
               <br />
               it be taken by the new provinces. I heard 
               <br />
               no word of repudiation from the hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tleman when the ex-Minister of the Interior 
               <br />
               (Mr. ‘Sifton) announced that policy. On the 
               <br />
               contrary, he voted in support of the govern-

               ment and in support of that argument. 
               <br />
               Are we to-day having a new policy an- 
               <br />
               nounced ? Has the hon. gentleman decided 
               <br />
               to repudiate the policy of the government 
               <br />

               <br />
               ending 30th |September, 1903, was $619,234, 
               <br />

               revenue for a province with a small area,

               one half the total revenue of that pro- 
               <br />
               vince during that year. And I might add 
               <br />
               also that it is a province, only portions 
               <br />
               of which are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mineralize‘d.</span> The Annapolis 
               <br />
               valley and other very large portions of 
               <br />
               the province, which are suitable for agri- 
               <br />
               cultural purposes, are of course not min- 
               <br />
               cralized, but there is quite a large area—- 
               <br />
               between one-half and one-third—whlch 
               <br />
               might be regarded as mineralized land. 
               <br />
               If such lands Were handed over to the 
               <br />
               new provinces, probably some system of 
               <br />
               not giving away the whole of the mineral- 
               <br />
               ized land, but reserving a certain in- 
               <br />
               terest to the people in the shape of 
               <br />
               royalty, might be carried out with equally 
               <br />
               good results. In the province of Alberta, 
               <br />
               such a policy would contribute largely to 
               <br />
               the development of the country. The hon. 
               <br />
               minister may see possibly that there might 
               <br />
               be some room for reﬂection in the sugges- 
               <br />
               tion that the lands, even if the present 
               <br />
               system were maintained, would be of some 
               <br />
               use to the new provinces. The Dominion 
               <br />
               government did not propose to make 
               <br />
               $60,000,000 to $75,000,000 by doing away 
               <br />
               with the homestead entries. The prede- 
               <br />
               cessor of my hon. friend distinctly said that 
               <br />
               these homesteads must be reserved for the 
               <br />
               poor man, but he proposed to make this 
               <br />
               money out of the alternate sections which 
               <br />
               are not reserved for homestead sections.
