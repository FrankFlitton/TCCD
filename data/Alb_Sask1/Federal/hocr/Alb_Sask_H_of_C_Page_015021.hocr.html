               dom about us. Let us not endorse the un- 
               <br />
               just warfare that the Toronto ‘ News’ has 
               <br />
               indulged in for some time past with its 
               <br />
               tremendous headings : ‘ A free west, a Com- 
               <br />
               mon school, provincial rights, religious equal- 
               <br />
               ity.’ The idea conveyed by these headings 
               <br />
               is a false one. Who can deny that there 
               <br />
               is a free west, and who can deny that 
               <br />
               there are not common schools in the west ? 
               <br />
               Where is the evidence that provincial rights 
               <br />
               are infringed upon ? Are we infringing 
               <br />
               upon provincial rights before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">theylhave</span> a.

               that so far as I am concerned, that after
