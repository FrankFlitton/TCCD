               manner indicated by his speech in introduc- 
               <br />
               ing the Bill. Then he claimed that the pro-

               vince of Ontario. and even the province of 
               <br />

               pensation for these lands. Moreover. you

               domain in that portion of the territory given 
               <br />

               not owning the 73,000 miles comprised with— 
               <br />
               in its present boundaries, but owning that

               lands should be retained by the Dominion

               It is conceivable that if these lands were 
               <br />
               given to the new provinces, the policy of either
