               was very signiﬁcant of the weakness of 
               <br />
               his case. For Monseigneur Sbarretti him-

               self I have every respect.

               Mr. FOSTER. Quite a number of skeptics 
               <br />
               on that side of the House. But I show 
               <br />
               my respect for Monseigneur Sbarretti by 
               <br />
               clearing him of the imputations which the 
               <br />
               position of my right hon. friend fastens up- 
               <br />
               on him. So far as the Papal ablegate’s pos- 
               <br />
               ition in this country is concerned, so far as 
               <br />
               his position as a spiritual envoy from the 
               <br />
               Church of Rome is concerned, he is welcome 
               <br />
               to this country may he stay here and grow 
               <br />
               up with this country and help to make 
               <br />
               it great. So far as his mission is conﬁned 
               <br />
               to spiritual purposes in his own church, 
               <br />
