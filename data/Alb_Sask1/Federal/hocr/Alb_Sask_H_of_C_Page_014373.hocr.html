               Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">BEILCOURT.</span> For reasons which I 
               <br />
               am not going <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,to</span> discuss, it appears that 
               <br />
               the majority of the members of this House 
               <br />
               think that the time has arrived when the 
               <br />
               provisions of the Act of 1875 shall be chang— 
               <br />
               ed. Some of us think it might be changed 
               <br />
               in a broader sense, while others think it 
               <br />
               might be changed in a more restrictive sense. 
               <br />
               Whatever of that there has been a compro- 
               <br />
               mise: the majority in this House have 
               <br />
               agreed that the legislation of 1875 is not the 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> which should govern in the Ter— 
               <br />
               ritories to-day. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.I</span> say then, that we have a 
               <br />
               perfect right under the constitution and 
               <br />
               under the provisions of the Act of 1871 to 
               <br />
               enact for these Territories which are still 
               <br />
               under our jurisdiction, Territories over 
               <br />
               which no other jurisdiction exists, I say we 
               <br />
               have the power to crystallize by a separate 
               <br />
               enactment 01' as we are now doing as part 
               <br />
               of this measure the provisions of section 16 
               <br />
               of this Bill, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> provisions would be 
               <br />
               in existence when these two provinces come 
               <br />
               into the union on the ﬁrst of July next. In 
               <br />

               ence to education in the Northwest Terri- 
               <br />

               to repeal or modify the provisions of the

               Mr. BEDCOURT. I will give an answer 
               <br />
               which may not be convincing to my hon. 
               <br />
               friend, but may be to others. It is this.

               My hon. friend did not follow me closely. 
               <br />
               I said with reference to the special, clear, 
               <br />
               definite. speciﬁc provisions of the British 
               <br />
               North America Act, that it is not in our 
               <br />
               power to modify or change them in any 
               <br />
               way either with reference to the provinces 
               <br />
               which came in in 1867 or with reference to 
               <br />
               those coming later on and one of these is 
               <br />
               the provision with reference to education con- 
               <br />
               tained in section 93. But I say that under 
               <br />
               the Act of 1871 our power of legislation 
               <br />
               with reference to those Territories is abso-
