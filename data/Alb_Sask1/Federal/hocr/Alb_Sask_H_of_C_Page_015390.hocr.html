               <br />
               culties. A man, for instance, happens to 
               <br />
               be living in a certain locality near what Will

               <br />
               tends into the two provinces. Cases of that

               Mr. STOCKTON. It is a pretty difﬁcult 
               <br />
               matter to deal with. I remember that when 
               <br />
               we passed the Medical Act in New Bruns— 
               <br />
               wick, we provided that those who had been 
               <br />
               practising for a certain number of years 
               <br />
               should be on the register. The point of 
               <br />
               my hon. friend from Duli‘erin (Mr. Barr) is 
               <br />
               that these men are now on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> register for 
               <br />
               the whole territory, but when this legisla- 
               <br />
               tion is passed and there are two provinces 
               <br />
               they may ﬁnd themselves curtailed of their 
               <br />
               rights in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">par;</span> of the country where those 
               <br />
               rights are now unquestioned. 0n the other 
               <br />
               hand, I can see the difﬁculty raised by the 
               <br />
               Minister of Justice, that this is a matter 
               <br />
               that comes within the jurisdiction of the 
               <br />
               provinces themselves. It is a pretty difﬁ- 
               <br />
               cult question to deal with, and it is doubtful 
               <br />
               whether the minister could deal with it in 
               <br />
               this Bill in the manner suggested. Another 
               <br />
               question might arise with respect to the law- 
               <br />
               yers, who are not very well able to look 
               <br />
               after themselves, I suppose. When the two 
               <br />
               provinces come into existence under this Act, 
               <br />
               would persons be attorneys and barristers 
               <br />
               of both provinces because they are now 
               <br />
               attorneys and barristers of the Territories ?

               Mr. FITZPATRI‘GK. I must confeSS that 
               <br />
               it would naturally suggest a question. But 
               <br />
               I have accepted it, because I am acting as 
               <br />
               a client with Ibis solicitor. I am advised by 
               <br />
               the ofﬁcer of the department that the lan- 
               <br />
               guage is apt. And Mr. Newcombe, the 
               <br />
               deputy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">minister,</span> as every one knows, is em- 
               <br />

               <br />
               a matter of this sort. It has just been sug- 
               <br />
               gested to me by an ofﬁcial of the depart- 
               <br />
               ment that this law will become like the im- 
               <br />
               perial statutes, some of which are in force 
               <br />
               in Canada at the present time. Or I might 
               <br />
               give an illustration which appeals more to 
               <br />
               me. Take the body of our law in Quebec, 
               <br />
               our code—while that is merely a statute it 
               <br />
               is considered, so far as we are concerned, as 
               <br />
               similar to the system of the common law in 
               <br />
               the English-speaking provinces.

               think that I have seen expressions like this 
               <br />

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. I was going to 
               <br />
               make that observation. The deputy minis- 
               <br />
               ter is now engaged in the revision of our 
               <br />
               statutes, and I think that these words have 
               <br />
               been adopted from the consolidation of the 
               <br />
               imperial statutes, which he has before him. 
               <br />
               I .am not positive as to that. I questioned 
               <br />
               him as to the form in which the Act appears. 
               <br />
               He told me the intention, and I thought I 
               <br />
               could rely upon him to express that inten- 
               <br />
