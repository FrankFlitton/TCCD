               Look at the electric combines, look at the

               franchises that have been backed up and 
               <br />
               supported by the Liberal administration

               when they were in power in Ontario. Look 
               <br />
               at what happened yesterday; the ﬁrst 
               <br />
               thing Mr. Whitney did was to rescind and 
               <br />
               refuse to endorse that iniquitous deal made 
               <br />
               by the Ross government doubling the value 
               <br />

               <br />
               the people of Ontario are looking to the 
               <br />
               Conservative party in that province for re-

               lief from the handsprings that the Liberals 
               <br />
               of Ontario have turned in order to beneﬁt 
               <br />
               corporations. When I stated that there 
               <br />
               was not a legislature in this country that 
               <br />
               was not turning handsprings to relieve 
               <br />
               corporations and taking great care not to 
               <br />
               do anything to beneﬁt the people, I had 
               <br />
               particular reference to this parliament. It 
               <br />
