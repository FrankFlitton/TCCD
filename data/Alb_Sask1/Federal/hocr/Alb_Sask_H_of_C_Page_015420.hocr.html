               a province, they have the municipal work 
               <br />
               of a province to legislate for, they have 
               <br />
               the small provincial functions 0f road build- 
               <br />
               ing and bridge building, the duties and res- 
               <br />
               ponsibilities which belong to the ordinary 
               <br />
               routine management. They have that. But 
               <br />
               there is not a foot of their soil, not an acre 
               <br />
               of their resources outside of what are pos-

               that will belong to them. So I say it is 
               <br />
               against human nature to suppose that 
               <br />
               these two provinces will be satisﬁed with 
               <br />
               this settlement. From the very moment 
               <br />
               they begin to be provinces they will com- 
               <br />
               mence an agitation which dissatisfaction 
               <br />
               will arouse, and which dissatisfaction will 
               <br />
               push further each year, and it will be rein- 
               <br />
               forced by their necessities which will con- 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stantly</span> grow. So I say this feeling will 
               <br />
               grow as the provinces grow, it will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ac</span> 
               <br />
               centuated by their necessities; as their po- 
               <br />
               pulation increases demands upon them will 
               <br />
               become greater. They will feel more and 
               <br />
               more that in the ﬁrst place they were de— 
               <br />
               frauded of their full heritage, that they 
               <br />
               have not got what actually belonged to them. 
               <br />
               that consequently they are not a full and 
               <br />
               independent province, and they will not 
               <br />
               rest until they get these rights. As my hon. 
               <br />
               friend who sits beside me (Mr. R. L. Bor- 
               <br />
               den) well observed, the longer the thing 
               <br />
               goes on the greater the dilemma, and the 
               <br />
               more the difﬁculty there will be. Therefore I 
               <br />
               say these provinces will not be satisﬁed, 
               <br />
               because they will feel from the ﬁrst that 
               <br />
               they have not power over their own belong- 
               <br />
               ings.

               Suppose you take the converse 0f it and 
               <br />
               the argument is shown with greater strength. 
               <br />
               Suppose a proposition were made in this 
               <br />
               House to-day to take over the lands of the 
               <br />
               other provinces of the Dominion to admin- 
               <br />
               ister them and assume all the cost of ad— 
               <br />
               ministration and take all the proﬁts of ad- 
               <br />
               ministration. Is there a single province in 
               <br />
               the Dominion which would look upon a 
               <br />
               proposition like that as being fair, which 
               <br />
               would admit it for a single moment. The 
               <br />
               argument is not a bit stronger by reason 
               <br />
               of their being now already full-ﬂedged pro- 
               <br />
               vinces and in possession of their lands. 
               <br />
               than it is with reference to the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro‘</span> 
               <br />
               vinces from which you would withhold what 
               <br />
               every old province has and possesses in its 
               <br />
               own right, from which you withhold what 
               <br />
               the British North America Act considers to 
               <br />
               be and contemplates as the possession of a 
               <br />
               province. Simply because you hold the 
               <br />
               lands at the present time and refuse to 
               <br />
               give them up the argument is not a bit 
               <br />
               stronger in the one case than it is in the 
               <br />
               other and the injustice of it will be equally 
               <br />
               felt. Every year that these provinces are 
               <br />
               provinces, while this condition of things 
               <br />
               with refenence to their lands prevails they 
               <br />
               will feel more and more that they are 
               <br />
               marked -off from their sister provinces. that

               powers and consequently not the full rights 
               <br />
               which their sister provinces have. These 
               <br />
               feelings will become seeds of dissatisfac~ 
               <br />
               tion which will grow and spread and ripen 
               <br />
               into the harvest of desire and of a constant 
               <br />
               agitation until the desire be realized that 
               <br />
               they shall have their own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">birthright</span> and 
               <br />
               their own lands. As I said before you can 
               <br />
               hardly approach the question of lands with- 
               <br />
               out approaching the ﬁnancial question as 
               <br />
               well and that is the crux of the whole mat- 
               <br />
               ter. As my hon. friend has said, they 
               <br />
               would like to have their lands but they do 
               <br />
               not see how they are to get their money. 
               <br />
               As far as that is concerned it seems to me 
               <br />
               there must be some way in which that 
               <br />
               difﬁculty could be met. Taking all the 
               <br />
               information which I got from the Minister 
               <br />
               of the Interior and from the return which 
               <br />
               was brought down it seems that the grain 
               <br />
               growing, irrigating, ranching and general 
               <br />
               farming lands in the areas of the two‘pro- 
               <br />
               vinces which are to be formed will amount 
               <br />
               to 294,000,000 acres, in round numbers. 
               <br />
               No one can say just how much of that will 
               <br />
               be agricultural land, just how much will 
               <br />
               be good grazing land, just how much will 
               <br />
               be land which proper irrigation will make 
               <br />
               very valuable and very desirable, but the 
               <br />
               whole of it is returned as above. The 
               <br />
               total area, as I said, is 204,000,000 acres, 
               <br />
               deducting the water acreage. Alienatcd 
               <br />
               lands have been returned as 65,000,000 
               <br />
               and if you subtract the 05,000,000 from 
               <br />
               the 294,000,000 it will give you about 
               <br />
               228,000,000 or 228,500,000 of lands belong- 
               <br />
               ing to one or other of these categories. As 
               <br />
               I'said before, it would not probably be 
               <br />
               wise to prophesy just how much of that 
               <br />
               would be excellently good land. how much 
               <br />
               worthless, and how much would come be- 
               <br />
               tween the two: but judging from our ex- 
               <br />
               perience in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> Territories and as 
               <br />
               our knowledge has progressed it is possible 
               <br />
               that we may ourselves be surprised to dis- 
               <br />
               cover what a very large proportion of these 
               <br />
               lands are really serviceable lands, suitable 
               <br />
               for agricultural, farming and grazing pur- 
               <br />
               poses. If that be true—and I think we 
               <br />
               are not pushing the matter too far to 
               <br />
               take that as fairly true—you will have an 
               <br />
               acreage of 228,000,000 of this serviceable 
               <br />
               or fairly serviceable land. That is an im- 
               <br />
               mense patrimony. Suppose you leave the 
               <br />
               odd-numbered sections still to be used for 
               <br />
               immigration purposes, for settlement pur— 
               <br />
               poses as an inducement to the outside 
               <br />
               world for speedier, better and more rapid 
               <br />
               settlement, suppose you leave that to be 
               <br />
               deducted from the amount which still re- 
               <br />
               mains, you have still the immense acreage 
               <br />
               of 114,000,000 or 115,000,000 acres of land 
               <br />
               which would be at your disposal. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> one
