               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. That is a 
               <br />
               question which should be determined here. 
               <br />
               It is essentially, as my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               Minister of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hiterior</span> says, a question of 
               <br />
               high politics, the highest kind of politics. 
               <br />
               The question whether these matters should 
               <br />
               be determined by parliament or by the 
               <br />
               judges is never a question in England. My 
               <br />
               hon. friend refers to the policy of the Lib- 
               <br />
               eral party in Great Britain. It is always 
               <br />
               pleasant to hear my hon. friend talking of 
               <br />
               Liberal principles and never applying them 
               <br />
               paying them the tribute of empty compli— 
               <br />
               ments and nothing more. In England the 
               <br />
               duty of delimitation is not assigned to 
               <br />
               judges, but to a board of commissioners, 
               <br />
               and they are restricted to the duty of deli- 
               <br />
               mitation. They have to consult old char- 
               <br />
               ters to ascertain the limits of towns, bor- 
               <br />
               oughs. and so on, which we have not to do 
               <br />
               here. What we have to determine is what 
               <br />
               should be the basis of representation and 
               <br />
               how it should be applied. I must say that 
               <br />
               I am a little disappointed at the conduct 
               <br />
               of my hon. friends on the other side of the 
               <br />
               House. When two months ago we gave 
               <br />
               them the actual numbers of the constituen- 
               <br />
               cies and the manner in which we intended 
               <br />
               to divide the province, I expected that if 
               <br />
               they had any objection to the division, they 
               <br />
               would offer a counter proposition. But 
               <br />
               nothing of the kind has taken place. If 
               <br />
               they had come with their list of constituen- 
               <br />
               cies, we might have seen how far we could 
               <br />
               agree, and then there might have been 
               <br />
               something to refer to the judges. But 
               <br />
               nothing of the kind has taken place. Our 
               <br />
               proposition has been met with a naked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> 
               <br />
               gative and nothing else—with the state- 
               <br />
               ment that our distribution as between the 
               <br />
               south and the north is not fair. That is 
               <br />
               the only point our hon. friends on the other 
               <br />
               side of the House make. Have you heard 
               <br />
               a complaint that any of these constituencies 
               <br />
               are unfair. or that there is any attempt 
               <br />
               at what is known as a gerrymander ': You 
               <br />
               have not heard anything of the kind. The 
               <br />
               only point made up to the present time. af- 
               <br />

               <br />
               our distribution is not fair to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">south,</span> 
               <br />
               that it is in favour of the north. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend from North Toronto argued a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mo</span> 
               <br />
               iucnt ago that we had not any basis of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rep«</span> 
               <br />
               resentation, although we have shown that 
               <br />
               we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> taken as a basis all the records 
               <br />
               "hat are at our disposal—the population as 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given</span> by the census, the recorded vote and 
               <br />
               the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">registered</span> vote. and to these we have 
               <br />
               added the number of post ofﬁces. My hon. 
               <br />
               friend says there is no argument in the 
               <br />
               number of post oﬂices. He says that in 
               <br />
               the town of Calgary there is one post ofﬁce 
               <br />
               and in Stony Plain one post ofﬁce, and that 
               <br />
               the former has an urban population of some
