               He read from a document which he said 
               <br />
               was sent out by direction of the hon. mem-

               said emanated from my hon. friend from

               Grey did not produce any such document, 
               <br />
               on the contrary, he did not approve of the

               It was a resolution passed by some lodge. 
               <br />
               My hon. friend from East Grey had nothing 
               <br />
               to do with it, and yet the hon. member for 
               <br />
               Shefford gets up and attributes it to my 
               <br />
               hon. friend. He said that some little bird 
               <br />
               had whispered into the ear of my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey that a Bill of this kind was 
               <br />
               to be introduced. Did not the hon. gentle-

               man hear the speech from the Throne when 
               <br />
               the Governor General announced that these 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bills would be introduced this

               man as a little bird whispering in the ears 
               <br />
               of members of this House ? He referred to 
               <br />
               the fact that ministers had stated in the 
               <br />
               campaign that autonomy would be given. 
               <br />
               Had it depended on the statement of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">min&lt;</span> 
               <br />
               isters. no person, not even my hon. friend 
               <br />
               from East Grey, would have paid any atten- 
               <br />
               tion to it, but when the Governor General 
               <br />
               came down and announced that these 
               <br />
               Autonomy Bills would be introduced, my 
               <br />
               hon. friend from East Grey then had every 
               <br />
               right to say to his friends in the country 
               <br />
               that they were going to be introduced. The 
               <br />
               hon. member for Shefford, like every one 
               <br />
               who has preceded him in this debate, closed 
               <br />
               his remarks with a eulogy of the right hon. 
               <br />
               Prime Minister (Sir Wilfrid Laurier)——the 
               <br />
               greatest man that ever lived on earth. He 
               <br />
               would be worth millions to Barnum if he 
               <br />
               had him. That is all in line With the course 
               <br />
               pursued by other members of the party. 
               <br />
               They eulogize the minister and they take 
               <br />
               the patronage. The hon. member for Shef- 
               <br />
               ford did not deal very much with the Bill 
               <br />
               before the House; therefore, I do not pro—

               Dear Sir.—Pressure of work has prevented

               me from writing to you earlier, but ever since

               the Prime Minister introduced the now famous

               Reverend and Dear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sin—I</span> am much pleased 
               <br />
               to receive your letter of. the 15th instant, re-

               ferring to the Bills now before parliament in 
               <br />
               reference to the new provinces for the North- 
               <br />
               west. In reply I beg to say I fully agree with 
               <br />
               all you say, and am very much pleased that the 
               <br />

               The position to—day is quite different from 
               <br />
               the Manitoba question. Then it was the min- 
               <br />
               ority appealing under the provisions of the 
               <br />
               constitution for their rights. When Manitoba 
               <br />
               was given a constitution these rights of separ- 
               <br />
               ate schools were provided, but the Greenway 
               <br />
               government abolished them. The decision of 
               <br />
               the Privy Council was that the legislature had 
               <br />
               exclusive jurisdiction in dealing with educa- 
               <br />
               tional matters, but the minority had a griev- 
               <br />
               ance. and under the constitution had a. right to 
               <br />
               appeal to the Dominion parliament for remedial 
               <br />
               legislation. But it is very singular that the 
               <br />
               parties headed by Sir Wilfrid Laurier were the 
               <br />
               parties who claimed provincial rights for Mani- 
               <br />
