               to congratulate the government for being

               original one. The method adopted in this

               There is but one other question on which 
               <br />
               I wish to touch, that is the ﬁnancial terms. 
               <br />
               I am glad in that to be able to agree with 
               <br />
               the hon. member for Edmonton (Mr. Oliver). 
               <br />
               It seems to me that in discussing these terms 
               <br />
               it is not fair to make comparisons with the 
               <br />
               terms of eastern provinces. The conditions 
               <br />
               are altogether different. In the west school 
               <br />
               houses and roads have to be provided, mat— 
               <br />
               ters which are done in Ontario and Quebec 
               <br />
               by local taxation which it is practically 
               <br />
               impossible to do in that country by reason 
               <br />
               of the great distances. The ﬁnancial terms 
               <br />
               in comparison with those granted to the 
               <br />
               other provinces are none too generous, and 
               <br />
               the development of that country is proceed- 
               <br />
               ing at such a rate that it is impossible for 
               <br />
               us to sit here and calculate what its future 
               <br />

               1892, it is provided that there shall be an 
               <br />
               appeal from any judgment or any verdict 
               <br />

               <br />
               743 and 782, they will see that there is an

               by a court having superior jurisdiction in

               <br />

               <br />

               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enacted</span> in section 119 of chapter 106 of the

               unfair and unjust that the right of appeal 
               <br />
               which is given under the criminal law in 
               <br />

               section 119 of the Canada Temperance Act. 
               <br />
               Even in a case of summary conviction, in 
               <br />

               <br />
               under section 119 he has no such right of 
               <br />
               appeal in most cases, though he may have 
               <br />
