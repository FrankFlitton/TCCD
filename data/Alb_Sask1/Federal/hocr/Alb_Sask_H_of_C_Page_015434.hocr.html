               <br />
               the older provinces will have to tax them- 
               <br />
               selves practically for eleven-twelfths of that

               <br />
               ing to get for it ? I am not sure but there 
               <br />
               will be a grievance in the older provinces 
               <br />
               as well as in the new. They will say, what 
               <br />
               beneﬁt is it to us ? We are told we are 
               <br />
               going to get an immense revenue from 
               <br />
               that western country, that people will come 
               <br />
               in, and every man that comes in will be 
               <br />
               worth so much, and will contribute to the 
               <br />
               revenues of the country and make good 
               <br />
               what we tax ourselves to pay. Now I would 
               <br />
               not rely very much upon that. If the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance is going to increase the 
               <br />
               revenues in this country so as to get money 
               <br />
               to buy this immense territory of 3,000,000 
               <br />
               acres, he will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">obliged</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cripgple</span> every

               <br />
               tion down to a revenue basis in order to get 
               <br />
               money to do it; and the result will he that 
               <br />
               the old provinces of the country where in- 
               <br />
               dustrial pursuits are carried on, will be 
               <br />
               handicapped for all time to come, and the 
               <br />
               next Minister of Finance will not be able to 
               <br />
               give this country a policy which will carry 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> on successfully, and give us that prosper- 
               <br />
               ity which we all hope will continue for 
               <br />
               many years to come. Now this is a big 
               <br />
               question. It is not simply to be looked at 
               <br />
               from the little picayune .idea of whether it 
               <br />
               will be the Liberal party or the Conserva- 
               <br />
               tive party that is going to control the vote 
               <br />
               in the Northwest, whether we are going 
               <br />
               to be able, through the land agents of the 
               <br />
               Dominion government, to go to the electors 
               <br />
               who have not yet secured patents for their 
               <br />
               lands, and tell them: Now, if you vote right 
               <br />
               you will get your patent, if you do not, dear 
               <br />
               knows when you will. Now that is a mighty 
               <br />
               small consideration it: it is going to cripple 
               <br />
               the commercial industry of this country for 
               <br />
               all time to come. I think we had better 
               <br />
               broaden out our ideas; and I hope that the 
               <br />
               Minister of the Interior, now that he occu- 
               <br />
               pies this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">high‘</span> and honourable position, will 
               <br />
               throw away these picayune politics and 
               <br />
               take hold of this matter as a statesman, and 
               <br />
               be guided by statesmans-hip rather than by 
               <br />
               politics in dealing with the affairs of that 
               <br />
               great country.
