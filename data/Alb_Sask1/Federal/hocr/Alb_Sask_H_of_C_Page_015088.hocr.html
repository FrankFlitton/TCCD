               <br />
               “'ho are people who should take the most 
               <br />
               interest in this question ? Is it the people 
               <br />
               of Ontario, or should it be the people of the 
               <br />
               Northwest? That is the question. In View 
               <br />
               of the alleged shackles which we are going 
               <br />

               <br />
               full of vigour and energy has not enough 
               <br />
               vigour to go and ﬁght in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northwest</span> as

               he should have done.
