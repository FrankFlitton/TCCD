               Sir WILFRID LAURIER. I speak sub- 
               <br />
               ject to correction, but I believe I am right, 
               <br />
               when I say that all these returns are in the 
               <br />
               hands of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, 
               <br />
               who is an ofﬁcer of this House, and it seems 
               <br />
               to me that the procedure would be to have 
               <br />
               a motion made for his attendance here. I 
               <br />
               have been waiting for my hon. friend the 
               <br />
               leader of the opposition to return in order 
               <br />
               that I might confer with him on that point." 
               <br />
               I can see no objection to that. 
               <br />

               Mr. FITZPATRICK. The ﬁrst clause prac- 
               <br />
               tically re-enacts the law as we have it now ; 
               <br />
               that is to say, it provides that the minister 
               <br />
               shall invite tenders for all works of which 
               <br />
               the estimated cost exceeds $5,000, the ex- 
               <br />
               ceptions being those works which are of 
               <br />
               immediate and urgent necessity and those 
               <br />
               of which the estimated cost does not exceed 
               <br />
               $5,000. The new feature is the second para- 
               <br />
               graph, which provides that all contracts 
               <br />
               let by tender are to be let, not by the min- 
               <br />
               ister directly, but by the minister under the 
               <br />
               control and with the approval of the Gov- 
               <br />
               ernor in Council. Having looked into the 
               <br />
               law, I found it necessary to make this 
               <br />
               change. As a matter of fact, contracts for 
               <br />
               works costing less than $5.000 have been 
               <br />
               let without tender, but there has been no 
               <br />
               legislative sanction for that. I am making 
               <br />
               this change so as to provide for the full 
               <br />
               approval of council to every contract that 
               <br />
               is made.

               Mr. HAGGART. As the laws stands, I
