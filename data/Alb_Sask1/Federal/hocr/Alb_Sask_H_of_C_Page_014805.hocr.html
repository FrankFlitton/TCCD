               As many another member of this House 
               <br />
               has done, Mr. Speaker, I have carefully 
               <br />
               gone over the debate which took place at the 
               <br />
               time of the passage of this Act of 1875, and 
               <br />
               I have been convinced from my personal 
               <br />
               reading of the remarks made at that 
               <br />
               time, especially in the Senate that the 
               <br />
               men who enacted that law considered 
               <br />
               that they were passing a statute which 
               <br />
               would be a ﬁnality, or at least es- 
               <br />
               tablish a system which it was ex- 
               <br />
               pected would remain. I ﬁnd the law of 
               <br />
               1875 passed through thisHouse, introduced 
               <br />
               by the Liberal leader, Mr. Alexander Mac- 
               <br />
               kenzie, and seconded by Mr. Edward Blake ; 
               <br />
               I ﬁnd that in 1880 that same law was again 
               <br />
               consolidated and reintroduced, this time by 
               <br />
               Sir John A. Macdonald; I ﬁnd in 1886 it 
               <br />
               was again passed in this House, so that on 
               <br />
               three successive occasions that section has 
               <br />
               come up in this parliament, and on every one 
               <br />
               of these three occasions it has been passed 
               <br />
               without comment, division or debate; and 
               <br />
               so, Mr. Speaker, it is very evident that both 
               <br />
               Catholics and Protestants in this House ac- 
               <br />
               cepted that law when it was passed. It is 
               <br />
               very evident that the old-time leaders of 
               <br />
               the Liberal, as well as the Conservative 
               <br />
               party, accepted that law when it was en— 
               <br />
               acted as a ﬁnal settlement. Under the law 
               <br />
               there have been various enactments passed 
               <br />
               by the local legislature. First we ﬁnd 
               <br />
               the local ordinances of 1884, and we learn 
               <br />
               that from 1884 to 1888 there existed a dual 
               <br />
               system of schools in the Northwest very 
               <br />
               similar to that which we now have in On- 
               <br />
               tario and Quebec. We ﬁnd that in 1891 
               <br />
               that system was greatly modiﬁed, and that 
               <br />
               in 1901 practically the last vestige of cleri- 
               <br />
               cal control had disappeared. It certainly 
               <br />
               seems to me that the minority in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Can‘</span> 
               <br />
               adian Northwest, in view of the rights 
               <br />
               and privileges which they have enjoyed, and 
               <br />
               in view of the curtailment that has already 
               <br />
               come to them of those privileges, have con- 
               <br />
               ceded all that they can reasonably be asked

               ample, that there was today a Roman Cath-

               olic majority there instead of a Protestant 
               <br />
               majority. If you look back at the census 
               <br />
               of 1885, what do you ﬁnd? You ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               there were 20,295 people in the Northwest 
               <br />
               Territories, west of. the boundaries of Mani— 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">toba;</span> between Manitoba and the Rocky 
               <br />
               mountains, and of that 20,295 9,301 were 
               <br />
               Roman Catholics, or 46 per cent of the total 
               <br />
               number. Bear in mind the fact that this 
               <br />
               was about the time when the ﬁrst school 
               <br />
               ordinances were passed in the west. At 
               <br />
               that time, in the Edmonton district, six- 
               <br />
               sevenths of the population were Roman 
               <br />
               Catholics. Thus, when the population 
               <br />
               was almost equally divided, the separate 
               <br />
               school system was established without dis- 
               <br />
               cussion and without resentment of either 
               <br />
               party. It was as much a protection to the 
               <br />
               Protestants as it was to the Catholics. There 
               <br />
               was no prophesying who would go into that 
               <br />
               country. The French Canadians from Que- 
               <br />
               bec were emigrating in large numbers to 
               <br />
               the United States. Who could tell that

               did not awaken until later, but there was
