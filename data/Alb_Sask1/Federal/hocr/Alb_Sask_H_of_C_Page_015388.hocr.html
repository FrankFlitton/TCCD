               the case of Manitoba where there was no 
               <br />
               provincial power before, nor is it like the 
               <br />
               case of a province in the full exercise of 
               <br />
               its full provincial authority. It is practically 
               <br />
               dealing with a territory which has been ex- 
               <br />
               ercising almost all the powers of a province 
               <br />
               but powers which are under delegation from 
               <br />
               us. So it is a case of exceeding difﬁculty, 
               <br />
               and I want to see that in this important con- 
               <br />
               stitutional Act we are making provision for 
               <br />
               everything that can possibly arise.

               Mr. BARKER. I would like the minister 
               <br />
               to explain this. It has been understood that 
               <br />
               clause 16 is to disappear from this Bill and

               what we may call the hon. member for

               <br />
               But under section 15 as it is now worded 
               <br />
               will not section 16 come back as section 11 
               <br />
               of the Act of 1875 and be beyond the control
