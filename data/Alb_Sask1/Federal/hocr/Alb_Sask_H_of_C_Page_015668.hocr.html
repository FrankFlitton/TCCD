               we are legislating for provincial constitu-

               as between the different sections of that 
               <br />

               <br />
               quite content. I ask whether it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tight</span> that 
               <br />
               this parliament should apparently—and I

               cannot see any other object in it—take sides 
               <br />

               Mr. SCOTT. No. I contend that this par- 
               <br />
               liament is under full responsibility to do 
               <br />
               the fair thing in the premises, and I think 
               <br />
               that to do anything less for more than half 
               <br />
               the area of the province, the district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska, would not be doing the fair 
               <br />
               thing. My hon. friend admits that the 
               <br />
               whole matter hinges on the question of the 
               <br />
               capital. If he looks at the map, he will 
               <br />
               ﬁnd that the centre of the province is 100 
               <br />
               miles north <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bf</span> Edmonton. Yet our friends 
               <br />
               in the south are contending that they 
               <br />
               should have the privilege, while they com- 
               <br />
               pose perhaps nearly half the population of 
               <br />
               ﬁxing the capital far south of the centre. 
               <br />
               Mainly because that is the question. I say 
               <br />
               it is the duty of this parliament to see that 
               <br />
               fair-play is granted to the northern portion

               when that redistribution takes place.‘ the 
               <br />

               <br />
               much better at that than I am. If it is a

               good argument that because there is a large 
               <br />

               <br />
               representation. how does it happen that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman has been so blind to

               ing to the argument now put forward,

               should have been represented in this House
