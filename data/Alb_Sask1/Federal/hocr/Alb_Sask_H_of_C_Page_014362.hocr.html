               <br />

               Well, I am not talking for those who are 
               <br />
               in favour of public schools when I call the

               hon. friends who are from that province will

               against the amendment of the hon. leader of 
               <br />
               the opposition, we were opposed to the 
               <br />
               amendment the object of which was to keep 
               <br />
               the minority out of their schools ; we voted 
               <br />

               who want to render justice to the minority ;

               we voted for the motion of the right hon.

               leader of the government. That is why the
