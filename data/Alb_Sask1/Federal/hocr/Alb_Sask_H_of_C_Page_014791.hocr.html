               There is also a sum collected for marriage 
               <br />
               license fees, and that money is given en- 
               <br />
               tirely to the Protestants, because the Catho-

               lic church takes the license fees paid by 
               <br />
               Catholics. There is besides a marriage 
               <br />
               license fund which became created in this 
               <br />
               way. For some years after confederation 
               <br />
               the marriage license fees were collected by 
               <br />
               the Dominion government. In 1873 the 
               <br />
               sums collected were remitted to the provin- 
               <br />
               cial government and invested. The interest

               <br />
               and are therefore devoted to Protestant edu- 
               <br />
               cation. There is further a sum of $4,270 
               <br />
               voted annually to the high schools of Que- 
               <br />
               bec and Montreal which are Protestant 
               <br />
               schools. This is in continuation of the 
               <br />
               grants made to the two royal grammar 
               <br />
               schools of these cities which were founded 
               <br />
               in 1816, and which became merged years 
               <br />
               ago into the two high schools I have men- 
               <br />
               tioned. The compensation to Roman Catho- 
               <br />
               lics on the basis of two to one has never 
               <br />
               been questioned. The Protestants get one— 
               <br />
               third of the whole vote and the Catholics 
               <br />
               two-thirds instead of the Protestants get- 
               <br />
               ting one-eighth and the Catholics seven- 
               <br />
               eights. With regard to normal schools, the 
               <br />
               Protestants have the entire control and man- 
               <br />
               agement of their own normal schools. They 
               <br />
               control the appointment of teachers the 
               <br />
               teaching, the granting of diplomas to teach- 
               <br />
               ers and the qualiﬁcations which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">teachers</span> 
               <br />
               must have before they can be appointed. 
               <br />
               There are two Catholic normal schools and 
               <br />
               one for the Protestants. We get one-third 
               <br />
               of the money spent on those schools; and 
               <br />
               when this question came up in 1857, long 
               <br />
               before confederation, long before we had 
               <br />
               the rights guaranteed to us by the confed- 
               <br />
               eration compact, it was proposed that the 
               <br />
               Protestants should receive about one-sixth 
               <br />
               of the grant which would represent the pro- 
               <br />
               portion due them according to population. 
               <br />
               But what occurred ? The Hon. P. J. 0. 
               <br />
               Chauveau—not a Protestant, not an English 
               <br />
               speaking man, but one of the leading French 
               <br />
               Canadian Roman <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">“Catholics</span> of the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec—pointed out to his compatriots 
               <br />
               that it would cost as much to establish and 
               <br />
               conduct an eﬂicient Protestant normal school 
               <br />
               as an efﬁcient Roman Catholic one, and that 
               <br />
               consequently to restrict Protestants to their 
               <br />
               share according to population would be equi- 
               <br />
               valent to depriving them entirely of normal 
               <br />
               school privileges; therefore the Protestant 
               <br />
               normal schools ought to receive just as 
               <br />
               much as either of the two Catholic normal 
               <br />
               schools, and the legislature accepted that 
               <br />
               view of the case. Let me point out to hon. 
               <br />
               gentlemen opposite, and to Protestants who 
               <br />
               are crying out against recognizing the pri-

               June, 1904, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestant</span> inspectors re-

               <br />
               100 or just about one-fourth was paid to

               paid this sum for the last ten years out of 
               <br />
               contingencies. The expenses of the two

               committees are therefore paid indifferently, 
               <br />

               <br />

               journals of public instruction, which are

               <br />
               of $7,550, or about one—ﬁfth of the whole 
               <br />
               when, according to population, it was only 
               <br />
               entitled to one-eighth. There are several 
               <br />
               votes given indifferently to Catholics and 
               <br />
               Protestant institutions. There is a sum of 
               <br />
               $50,000 granted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">annually</span> by the government 
               <br />
               for elementary education. It is commonly 
               <br />
               known as the $50,000 grant and is distri- 
               <br />
               buted by the government of the day. I have 
               <br />
               here a statement of the secretary of the Pro— 
               <br />
               tentant Council of Public Instruction in 
               <br />
               which he says that this grant is divided gen— 
               <br />
               erally in a fair ratio according to population, 
               <br />
               but that $3,000 out of it is given to the Mc— 
               <br />
               Gill normal school for which there is no 
               <br />
               equivalent given the Catholic normal school. 
               <br />
               I think I have given here a pretty clear 
               <br />
               statement of the privileges and advantages 
               <br />
               which we Protestants enjoy in the province 
               <br />
               of Quebec, and I would like to point out 
               <br />
               that the privileges granted us to—day are 
               <br />
               not given by virtue of any law or guar- 
               <br />
               antee. Many of them have been given from 
               <br />
               time to time without any law or statutory 
               <br />
