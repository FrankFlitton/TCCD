               to which I shall advert later. The hon.

               minister set what he considered the spirit 
               <br />

               <br />
               face of that canon of construction. I now 
               <br />
               bring to his notice both the Act of 1871, 
               <br />
               containing the clause I have cited, and 
               <br />
               section 93 of the Act of 1867. The hon. 
               <br />
               gentleman also adverted to section 146 of 
               <br />
               the Act, and I shall have some observations 
               <br />
               to make hereafter in that connection. Let 
               <br />
               me ask him who is to be the judge of what 
               <br />
               is the spirit of any writing which may be 
               <br />
               submitted for construction. Surely the 
               <br />
               spirit of the Act will be varied indeﬁnitely 
               <br />
               according to the object, bent of mind or in- 
               <br />
               terest of the person who is placing a con- 
               <br />
               struction.upon it. The observations of the 
               <br />
               hon. minister would almost lead one to sup- 
               <br />
               pose that he was descendng to What is 
               <br />
               familiarly known as ‘ﬁreside law ’ and ask-

               ing us to accept <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> he would have us be- 
               <br />
               lieve is the ‘intention’ of the Act. But, 
               <br />
               Sir, the intention of any writing can only be 
               <br />
               ascertained by the words used. It must not 
               <br />
               and cannot be drawn from a history of the 
               <br />
               subject to which the writing relates nor 
               <br />
               from surrounding circumstances or attend- 
               <br />
               ant facts. The only manner in which a writ- 
               <br />
               ing can be properly construed is by a criti- 
               <br />
               cal examination of the language it uses. 
               <br />
               The hon. minister would apparently have 
               <br />
               us believe it was the part of statesman-

               <br />
               endeavour to ﬁnd out its Spirit by taking 
               <br />
               the broad view which he enunciated. Well, 
               <br />
               I have only to observe that so far as I am 
               <br />
