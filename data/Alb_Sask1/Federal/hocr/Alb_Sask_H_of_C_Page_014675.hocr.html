               sentimental relations will be favourable to 
               <br />
               Canada and t0 the British empire. We 
               <br />
               have heard a great deal of imperalism in 
               <br />
               this country. ‘Not long ago noble senti-

               <br />
               to the debt of gratitude we owe and of the 
               <br />
               continued gratitude which we expect to 
               <br />
               entertain for the British empire. I believe

               that for many years to come, for the present 
               <br />
               at least in my judgment, the best imperial-

               ism which we can offer to the British em-

               all the wheat and all the breadstuffs which

               The prospects of those new provinces are 
               <br />
               certainly brilliant and it became no doubt 
               <br />
               a hard task for this government and for 
               <br />
               the right hon. gentleman who leads the 
               <br />
               government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) to raise 
               <br />
               the foundation upon which these two pro-

               destiny and the fullest development of their 
               <br />

               <br />
               country comes and calls at the door of this 
               <br />

               the people of that portion of the Dominion

               portunities possible under the constitution. 
               <br />
               It becomes then the duty of the govern— 
               <br />
               ment and of the Prime Minister to allow 
               <br />
               such rights as may be commensurate with 
               <br />
               their future happiness and prosperity. The 
               <br />
               government has to give them that right of

               gives his son a portion at his territory, he 
               <br />
               shows still greater attention and greater 
               <br />
               parental sentiment, when he says: My 
               <br />
               child, I give you a certain domain, but I 
               <br />
