               tion in 1896 and it was found by hon. gen- 
               <br />
               tlemen opposite to be a matter of life and 
               <br />
               death. From 1878 down to that time they 
               <br />
               had attempted time and again on different 
               <br />
               issues to achieve ofﬁce, but always with 
               <br />
               the same result that they had been repulsed

               <br />
               similar to the present one loomed up on the 
               <br />
               political horizon. The hon. Minister of 
               <br />
               Justice went down through the province of 
               <br />
               Quebec and his complaint against the Tup— 
               <br />
               per government on that occasion was that 
               <br />
               the Tapper government had been recreant

               to the cause of the Roman Catholic part of 
               <br />
               the population and he said that if he went 
               <br />
               to Ottawa he would go there—to be a Lib- 
               <br />
               eral ?—No, not a Liberal. To be a Conser- 
               <br />
               vative ?—No, not a Conservative, but that 
               <br />
               if elected he would only support the party 
               <br />
               which would support a Remedial Bill. I 
               <br />
               challenge the hon. minister to-night to deny

               it was wrong on his part to pledge himself
