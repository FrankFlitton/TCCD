               aroused the enthusiasm of the gentlemen

               three parts: ﬁrst, that all could read, and

               therefore the inference was that all should 
               <br />
               understand thoroughly the meaning and the 
               <br />
               purport of this Bill, when only a few mo- 
               <br />
               ments before that the Minister of Justice 
               <br />
               had said that he did not Wish to give an ex- 
               <br />
               planation to this House because he had not 
               <br />
               his papers with him, and that he wanted an 
               <br />
               opportunity to get his papers and to collect 
               <br />
               his thoughts so that he might give us the 
               <br />
               meaning of the Bill. Now. that remark of 
               <br />
               the Minister of Finance, it appeared to me, 
               <br />
               came with a charming grace from that gen— 
               <br />
               tleman, when he stated no longer ago than 
               <br />
               yesterday that upon this question he had 
               <br />
               given his political conscience into the keep- 
               <br />
               lng of the Minister of Justice. His second 
               <br />
               head was that the hon. member for Toronto 
               <br />
               (Mr. Foster) had lost his exactness. Let me 
               <br />
               tell the Minister of Finance that in this 
               <br />
               legislation he has met with a more serious 
               <br />
               loss than the hon. member for North Toron- 
               <br />
               to; he has lost his political consistency. 
               <br />
               Then my hon. friend the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance said : look at the election of the mem— 
               <br />

               was elected as a cabinet minister because of

               <br />
               No, Sir ; I have yet to learn that the Minis- 
               <br />
               ter of the Interior has made any such state- 
               <br />
               ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘as</span> that. But the most extraordinary 
               <br />
               part of the discussion was a point made 
               <br />
               by the Minister of Justice that the proposed 
               <br />
               amendment tabled by the First Minister 
               <br />
               was not, under the rules of the House, 
               <br />
               before the committee, and would not be 
               <br />
               before the committee until it had been 
               <br />
               moved by the First Minister. What did we 
               <br />
               vote on? Was it upon clause 16 as origin- 
               <br />
               ally introduced, or upon clause 16 as pro- 
               <br />
               posed to be amended by the First Minister ‘3 
               <br />
               What made it possible for the Minister of 
               <br />
               Finance to stand with his leader ? Was it 
               <br />
               clause 16 as originally introduced, or clause

               16 as imposed to be amended by the First 
               <br />

               <br />
               told by the Minister of Justice yesterday 
               <br />
               so as to harmonize himself with the Min-

               <br />

               kind? Did they vote on the original Bill '2

               Did the members from the west vote on the

               brought back to the fold the hon. member

               language, but to myway of thinking it is 
               <br />
               imposing on the credulity of the members 
               <br />

               <br />
               Justice was discussing clause 16 as originally 
               <br />
               introduced, which we never intended to dis- 
               <br />
               cuss or vote upon. I rather concur in the 
               <br />
               view of my hon. friend from North Toronto 
               <br />
               that we should not be hard on the Minister 
               <br />
               of Justice, that we should give him time to 
               <br />
               collect his thoughts and his papers, and to 
               <br />
               give to this House a full and accurate state- 
               <br />
               ment as to the meaning of clause 16 as pro- 
               <br />
               posed to be amended by the First Minister— 
               <br />
               the difference between the Bill as ﬁrst intro- 
               <br />
               duced and the Bill as it is now proposed to 
               <br />
               amend it. If the Minister of Justice gives 
               <br />
               his attention to that as a lawyer, and gives 
               <br />
               his best judgment and opinion to the mem- 
               <br />

               <br />
               do something towards shaking the conﬁ-

               <br />
               province of Ontario and the west. If they

               follow the constitutional opinion of the Min- 
               <br />
               ister of J ustice—and he is capable of giving 
               <br />
               lt—I think they will feel that there is some- 
               <br />

               moment the position of the member for 
               <br />
