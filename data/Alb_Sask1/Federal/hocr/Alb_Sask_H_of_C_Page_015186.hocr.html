               <br />
               Speaker. The question came up once before 
               <br />
               on, I think, a precisely similar matter, and 
               <br />
               the decision was—I am speaking from 
               <br />
               memory—that as the method adopted in the 
               <br />
               House was one purely of convenience, a 
               <br />
               record of the Votes and Proceedings should 
               <br />
               be made precisely in the same way as if the 
               <br />
               division had taken place. It was only a 
               <br />
               method of saving the time of hon. gentlemen 
               <br />
               in this House. But when it comes to re- 
               <br />
               cording the names, they should appear as if 
               <br />
               the division had taken place ; that is to say. 
               <br />
               that you should have a record as if the 
               <br />
               House had actually voted, because every one 
               <br />
               in the House is supposed to consent to the 
               <br />
               course adopted.

               position. If you were to record the

               Hon. DAVID TISDALE. It seems to me 
               <br />
               that if we are to declare this record correct, 
               <br />
               we must hereafter always have the two di- 
               <br />
               visions, because I am quite certain that the 
               <br />
               gentlemen on this side of the House would 
               <br />
               have insisted on another vote if they thought 
               <br />
               they were not to be recorded again. Of 
               <br />
               course the Speaker must decide that. If the 
               <br />
               practice is that we must have a new divi- 
               <br />
               sion under these circumstances in-order to 
               <br />
               get a record of the names, then we mus-t 
               <br />
               always put the House to that trouble. I had 
               <br />
               always understood, though 1 have not 
               <br />
               bothered my head much about these rules, 
               <br />
               that when it was a division such as was 
               <br />
               agreed to last night, the names were re— 
               <br />
               corded the second time, and that when we 
               <br />
               consent to the division in that way the 
               <br />
               names are always to be recorded, because 
               <br />
               the object of the division is to have a record 
               <br />
               of the names. But if that is not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case,</span>

               be amended, if we have power to amend 
               <br />
               them. I do not know myself what proceed-

               Mr. HAGGAIRT. Mr. Speaker, you surely 
               <br />
               ought to be informed as to what the prac- 
               <br />
               tice of the House has been. This has 
               <br />
               occurred a hundred times in the House and 
               <br />
               in my opinion such votes have always 
               <br />
               been recorded as if the vote had been given 
               <br />
               at the time. You can very well ﬁnd out 
               <br />
               what the practice has been and if the prac— 
               <br />
               tice has been as I state then it is your 
               <br />
               duty to see that the Minutes of the House 
               <br />
               are revised and printed in accordance with 
               <br />
               the practice.

               Mr. SPEAKER. I desire to inform the 
               <br />
               hon. member (Mr. Haggart) that I have 
               <br />
               asked the clerk what the practice has been 
               <br />
               and he states that the practice has been to 
               <br />
               record the vote as it has been recorded and 
               <br />
               not as the hon. gentleman suggests.
