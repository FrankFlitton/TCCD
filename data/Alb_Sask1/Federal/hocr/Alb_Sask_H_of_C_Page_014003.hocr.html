               It has been stated that ‘ Experience is a

               physician called in too late’ ; and I may not 
               <br />
               be wrong in thinking that the experience 
               <br />
               acquired of late years in the province of 
               <br />
               Manitoba has been of that kind. The young 
               <br />
               men of my generation, undoubtedly, have 
               <br />
               not wholly realized the painful ordeal which 
               <br />
               our country was made to undergo at a time 
               <br />
               when the cry of race and religion prevented 
               <br />
               the quiet discussion of the question of sep- 
               <br />
               arate schools and of the use of the French 
               <br />
               language. -We were not in the heat of that 
               <br />
               battle, wherein galling epithets and hateful 
               <br />
               words were most dangerous missiles: we 
               <br />
               did not smell the powder of that fanatical 
               <br />
               warfare. But its rumblings reached our 
               <br />
               ears; we heard its echo. It may be that 
               <br />
               owing to our lack of experience, we have 
               <br />
               taken a somewhat exaggerated view of the 
               <br />
               situation; but we could not help trembling 
               <br />
               at the sight of the turmoil into which that 
               <br />
               bitter struggle of uncompromising principles 
               <br />
               might have ﬂed our country, made up of vari-

               ous elements, had not the present govern-

               ment had the happy thought of negotiating 
               <br />
               a truce which will be some day ﬁnal peace, 
               <br />
               let us hope. That result was effected, on 
               <br />
               the one hand, through the advice given to 
               <br />

               <br />
               through the gentle promptings of diplomacy, 
               <br />
               whereby the Protestant majority were in-

               duced to take a stand making concessions
