               On this basis, it will be seen that there is 
               <br />
               an excess of people south of township 38

               <br />
               of that township than to the north. The 
               <br />
               Prime Minister also takes the post ofﬁce as 
               <br />
               an indication. To show the absurdity of that 
               <br />
               contention it is only necessary to quote the 
               <br />
               district of Athabaska in which there was 
               <br />
               only one post ofﬁce up to the 1st of Febru— 
               <br />
               ary, 1905, and where they only had twelve 
               <br />
               mail deliveries during the whole year. This 
               <br />
               district that had twelve. monthly services 
               <br />
               and one, post office up to the 1st February 
               <br />
               last, is one of the arguments why they 
               <br />
               are giving more representation to the north 
               <br />
               than to the south, and they want to give two 
               <br />
               representatives to that whole district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska that has only one post oﬂice in it. 
               <br />
               That shows how absurd their contention is. 
               <br />
               to say nothing at all of the political pull that 
               <br />
               the member supporting the government has 
               <br />
               in securing a :post oﬂice for the district he 
               <br />
               represents. The same way with the school 
               <br />
               districts that have been referred to, and the 
               <br />

               <br />
               establish them or not. Now the district of 
               <br />
               Athabaska is being given two members. and 
               <br />
               Why ? The Prime Minister explains why. 
               <br />
               In his speech, on page 8006, he says :

               there are only six seats north and nine south, 
               <br />
