               again about the return I moved for showing 
               <br />
               the number of appointments made in the 
               <br />
               civil service during years past and which, 
               <br />
               I was told, would be brought down at the 
               <br />
               earliest convenient moment. I have not 
               <br />
               heard of it since. The motion for the re- 
               <br />
               turn was passed some time ago and I think 
               <br />
               the subject should receive attention.

               few days ago. I understand that all the

               The hon. gentleman must admit that it will 
               <br />
               require some time to compile a return. I
