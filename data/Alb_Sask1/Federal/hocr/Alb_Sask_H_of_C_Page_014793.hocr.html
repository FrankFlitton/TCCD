               Mr. FISHER. I therefore believe, Sir, 
               <br />
               that I voice the feeling of the Protestants 
               <br />
               of the province of Quebec. It may be said, 
               <br />
               and it has been said, that some gentlemen 
               <br />
               on the other side of the House do not believe 
               <br />
               in their vote but have to give it because of 
               <br />
               fear of their electors. That cannot be said

               of the press of the province of Quebec.

               <br />
               ‘ Witness’ which is the particular exponent 
               <br />
               of Protestant feeling in the province of Que- 
               <br />
               bec, which for years has been—I will not 
               <br />
               say ultra-Protestant but consistently and 
               <br />
               always Protestant in its ﬁrst principles. 
               <br />
               The Montreal ‘Witness’ has been that in

               all conscientiousness and all integrity, and it

               is well recognized as being essentially a

               Protestant newspaper. But listen to what
