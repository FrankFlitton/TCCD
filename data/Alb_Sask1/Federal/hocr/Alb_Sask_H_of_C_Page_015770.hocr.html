               when in spite of all those pledges, in spite

               <br />
               until 1896, and that famous clause 93, of

               cere. These people said : A grand victory ! 
               <br />
               Here is a French Canadian, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">:1</span> man of edu- 
               <br />
               cation, supposed to be the best speaker in 
               <br />
               the country, an honest man—and he is 
               <br />
               ready to put his foot on the hierarchy of 
               <br />
               Quebec; he is ready to go with us and 
               <br />
               put an end of the domination Of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hien</span> 
               <br />
               archy ;~ let us follow him. And they did 
               <br />
               follow him. And so the sluices were open 
               <br />
               to the ﬂood of fanaticism, and a great many 
               <br />
               who would have stood by the Conservative 
               <br />
               party—would not have dared to go as far 
               <br />
               as the extremists went—felt free to rejoin 
               <br />
               the extremists in what they did. And so 
               <br />
               this country was given over to that element 
               <br />
               of the population. Many of these people in 
               <br />
               Ontario and in the Maritime provinces, 
               <br />
               thought that my right hon. friend was most 
               <br />
               tolerant. They thought he was above the 
               <br />
               hierarchy. They thought that he was 
               <br />
               against separate schools. But what were 
               <br />
               the facts? He spoke yesterday of giving 
               <br />
               his ‘categorical answer’ to my hon. friend 
               <br />
