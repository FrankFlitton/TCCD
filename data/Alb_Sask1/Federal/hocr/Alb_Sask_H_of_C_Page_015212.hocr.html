               <br />

               Mr. LAKE. I think the return which was 
               <br />
               brought down to which the Minister of Fin- 
               <br />
               ance referred does give a considerable 
               <br />
               amount of information on this question 
               <br />
               which has been raised, although the return 
               <br />
               is couched in such a way that it is very 
               <br />
               difﬁcult to get the information that it con- 
               <br />
               tains clearly into one’s mind. What I would 
               <br />
               like to suggest is that although it is perfectly 
               <br />
               true that the basis of calculation is elimi- 
               <br />
               nated from the resolutions, still I think the 
               <br />
               only way in which we can arrive at a right 
               <br />
               understanding of what the calculation 
               <br />
               should be is by making a calculation 
               <br />
               based on a deﬁnite area of land and a deﬂ— 
               <br />
               nite value to be given to that area. It 
               <br />
               seems to me that is the only way in which 
               <br />
               we can arrive at anything like a safe cal— 
               <br />
               culation, and therefore I would like the 
               <br />
               Minister of Finance to give us some such 
               <br />
               calculation as that or to say whether he 
               <br />
               considers we ought to abide by the calcula- 
               <br />
               tion which was made in the original resolu- 
               <br />
               tion. I ﬁnd that in this report which was 
               <br />
               brought down it is stated that there is a 
               <br />
               total of 277,931,790 acres of land still undis- 
               <br />
               posed of in both provinces. I suppose for 
               <br />
               the purpose of rough calculation we may 
               <br />
               divide that into half, attributing one half 
               <br />
               to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">each.</span> province. That would mean nearly 
               <br />
               139.000,000 acres of land in each province 
               <br />
               still undisposed of. Of course, I am quite 
               <br />
               willing to admit that it would be very difﬁ- 
               <br />
               cult to make a close calculation as to the 
               <br />
               value of the. whole of that land ; but in that 
               <br />

               the government arrived at this capitai sum 
               <br />
               of $37,500,000, upon which they are going 
               <br />
               to distribute interest to the new provinces, 
               <br />
               according to population? What was the 
               <br />
               basis of that calculation? We ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               wheat lands in the Northwest are selling at 
               <br />
               a far greater value than $1.50 per acre. 
               <br />
               Take the sales by the Canadian Paciﬁc 
               <br />
               Railway in January this year, the average 
               <br />
               price obtained for the land was $4.10 per 
               <br />
               acre. I have looked through the report of 
               <br />
               the Department of the Interior for the years 
               <br />
               1903, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> and ﬁnd there a statement 
               <br />
               of the lands disposed of by the various land 
               <br />
               companies in the Northwest—the Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay Company, the Canadian Paciﬁc <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rail‘</span> 
               <br />
               way and other companies—and I ﬁnd that 
               <br />
               the average price obtained by the Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay Company for their lands was $5.50 per 
               <br />
               acre, by the Canadian Paciﬁc Railway $3.50 
               <br />
               per acre, and that the average price for the 
               <br />
               lands sold during the previous eleven years 
               <br />
               was about $3.50 per acre. It turns out, on 
               <br />
               totalling up these ﬁgures, that the grand 
               <br />
               total of the lands sold by the land compa- 
               <br />
               nies during those previous eleven years 
               <br />
               amounted to 10,512,349 acres. and that the 
               <br />
               sum for which they were sold totalled just 
               <br />
               about the sum which is to be allowed each 
               <br />
               of the new provinces as compensation for 
               <br />
               25 million acres of land. That is to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say.</span> 
               <br />
               the amount received by the companies 
               <br />
