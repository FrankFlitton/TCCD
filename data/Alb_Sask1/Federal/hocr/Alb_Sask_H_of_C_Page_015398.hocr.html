               Mr. LANCASTER. Yes, if the other party 
               <br />
               to the bargain knows the Dominion power 
               <br />
               can continue that protection. But then there 
               <br />
               is another way of looking at it. We are 
               <br />
               here as trustees dealing with the people’s 
               <br />
               rights and liberties, and the people’s rights 
               <br />
               and liberties not only as a Dominion but 
               <br />
               as provinces. For my part, I would not be 
               <br />
               worried about the-other contracting party. 
               <br />
               except so far as it would cause him to con— 
               <br />
               sider a claim. I am not admitting it, but to 
               <br />
               make myself understood, I would say that 
               <br />
               the government of this country might be 
               <br />
               liable for any action for damages for breach 
               <br />
               of contract for having undertaken to deliver 
               <br />
               goods that it could not deliver. But that 
               <br />
               would not be a reason for passing legislation 
               <br />
               that would be ultra vires. If we did make 
               <br />
               a bargain in order to get some one to do 
               <br />
               something else, in order to get a beneﬁt for 
               <br />
               ourselves. and if we found out afterwards 
               <br />
               that what we agreed to do we had no right 
               <br />
               to do. it might follow that the King would 
               <br />
               be liable to an action for damages if we 
               <br />
               carried out what we agreed to do, and 
               <br />
               thereby disappointed the person we were 
               <br />
               contracting with. It would not make it right 
               <br />
               for us. for the sake of getting out of an 
               <br />
               action for damages, to do something that 
               <br />
               might be entirely beyond our power.

               no exemption from taxation, they are in a 
               <br />
               different position. They made a large sur— 
               <br />
               render of lands for which they received a 
               <br />
               certain consideration in money, and the sur— 
               <br />
               render was made under certain conditions 
               <br />

               deed from the Crown of those territories <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">'2</span> 
               <br />
               If you embody this in an Act of parlia-

               ment before you constitute the provinces— 
               <br />

               ultra vircs—you place the ownership of the

               land by the Hudson Bay Company in a 
               <br />

               land by an individual in that section of the 
               <br />
               country. To my mind you take away from 
               <br />
               the province the power of eminent domain, 
               <br />
               the right of taking land for public pur-

               <br />
               out giving compensation for it. Now, if 
               <br />
               you have the power to do that under this 
               <br />
               Act, you place the property of the Hudson 
               <br />
               Bay Company in a peculiar position, in 
               <br />
               a different position. If they have the 
               <br />
               right to the property, and I believe they 
               <br />
               have, so far as the Crown can be bound 
               <br />
               in giving it, so far as the province or the 
               <br />
               Dominion does not exercise their power to 
               <br />
               legislate, then they have the right to do 
               <br />
               it in reference to property, they have all 
               <br />
               the rights which they can have without em- 
               <br />
               bodying them in this Act of parliament. I 
               <br />
               have stated that in granting autonomy to 
               <br />
               the province, the exclusive control over 
               <br />
               property and civil rights is given to the 
               <br />
               province. But you are making admittedly 
               <br />
               a curtailment of those rights, because, hav- 
               <br />
               ing made a bargain in the acquisition of 
               <br />
               that province by which the Hudson Bay 
               <br />
               Company have a right to certain properties 
               <br />
               in that province, w-e curtail that right to 
               <br />
               deal with them exclusively by saying that 
               <br />
               under that bargain they are removed from 
               <br />
               their jurisdiction. When we are on the

               <br />

               <br />
               portion within themselves Upon certain 
               <br />
               covenants which the Crown gave and upon 
               <br />
               certain covenants which they gave. There- 
               <br />
               fore they are not in the position of a per- 
               <br />
