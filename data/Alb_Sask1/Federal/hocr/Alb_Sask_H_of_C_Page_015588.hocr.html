               it has suited them to take the constituencies

               Mr. LAKE. It has been suggested that

               this scheme of representation should pro- 
               <br />
               vide for the prospective increase of votes 
               <br />
               in the future, and I think it was stated by 
               <br />
               the Minister of the Interior that that had 
               <br />
               been done in the case of the distribution

               <br />
               themselves—that they took the census of 
               <br />
               the previous year, which was not a year 
               <br />
               old, and distributed the seats exactly ac~ 
               <br />
               cording to that census, with only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">4%</span> per

               cent variation. So that I do not think 
               <br />
               it can be stated that in actual practice 
               <br />
               at any rate they took into consideration 
               <br />
               the prospective increase of population.

               Mr. LAKE. The special circumstances 
               <br />
               which made the vote in the southern part 
               <br />
               of Alberta so small in that election have 
               <br />
               already been referred to—the carrying away 
               <br />
               of the bridges over two of the main rivers. 
               <br />
               which made it practically impossible for a 
               <br />
               large number of the voters to go to the 
               <br />

               Mr. LAKE. I did not understand that 
               <br />
               the hon. gentleman was referring to Ba- 
               <br />
               toche. As far as my memory goes, the 
               <br />
               question of the prospective increase of po- 
               <br />
               pulation was not taken into consideration 
               <br />
               at all. ‘As little interference as possible 
               <br />
               was made with existing conditions. At 
               <br />
               that time we fully believed that the Do- 
               <br />
               minion government were going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">create</span>

               us into a province almost immediately, and 
               <br />
               Mr. Haultain was making an appeal to the 
               <br />
               country on the autonomy question. What 
               <br />
               would have been the use of complicating 
               <br />
               that question with questions of gerryman- 
               <br />
               der or anything of that sort? The fact 
               <br />
               remains that there was no serious criti- 
               <br />
               cism of that Redistribution Bill-in the 
               <br />
               House. I doubt if it took three hours to 
               <br />
               put it through.
