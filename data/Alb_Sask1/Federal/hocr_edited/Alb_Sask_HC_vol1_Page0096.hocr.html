<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> past, I might term him a scrapbook orator
<br />
to-day. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Whenever</span> I have
endeavoured to <br />
gather up certain pearls of thought which <br />
he has distributed in days gone by and to <br />
contrast them with the utterances made in <br />
the immediate present, the right hon gentle- <br />
man has been good enough to apply that <br />
appellation to myself and I trust that he <br />
will not resent my returning it to him on <br />
this occasion. The right hon. gentleman <br />
has told us that the measure which the <br />
government has introduced, and especially <br />
the educational clauses contained in sec- <br />
tion 16 of the Bill, as well as the provisions <br />
which have been now substituted for that <br />
section, make for unity. Well, Mr. Speaker, <br />
they may make for unity in the country if <br />
the right hon. gentleman’s own words are <br />
to be taken at their face value to-day, but <br />
certainly they have not made for unity in <br />
the cabinet nor among the right hon. gentle- <br />
man’s followers. The Prime Minister has <br />
been good enough a few days ago to charge <br />
me with having treated this question in <br />
this House lightly. I desire, in terms as <br />
strong as the usage of this parliament <br />
will permit, to repudiate to the utmost <br />
that assertion, and to say that if any <br />
man in this House has treated that <br />
question lightly it has been the right hon. <br />
gentleman himself. When I brought this <br />
question up two years ago, not he, nor any <br />
one of his colleagues in the cabinet dared <br />
to rise in his place and say one word about <br />
it. They put up the hon. member for Ed- <br />
monton (Mr. Oliver) who was then the mem- <br />
ber for Alberta, to say on behalf of the <br />
government that they were not going into <br />
any ‘blind pool,’ and when the right hon. <br />
gentleman tendered to this country and to <br />
the members of the Northwest the blindest <br />
kind of pool in the letter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
he wrote <br />
in the heat of a general election, then hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> on the other side were
all too <br />
eager to accept it without one moment's <br />
question. That was the ﬁrst occasion when <br />
he treated this question lightly. The next <br />
was when in this House he asserted, cry- <br />
ing 'hear, hear' to the words of my hon. <br />
friend from Marquette (Mr. W. J. Roche) <br />
who interpreted the remarks of the Prime <br />
Minister as meaning that provincial auto- <br />
nomy could not be granted to the Territo- <br />
ries of the Northwest for many years to <br />
come. And, in the next place, Mr. Speaker, <br />
he treated this question lightly when he <br />
brought this Bill down to parliament, telling <br />
parliament as plainly as if he had said so in <br />
express terms that this measure embodied <br />
the collective wisdom of the cabinet, when <br />
afterwards it transpired although the Bill <br />
had not even been submitted to the ex- <br />
Minister of the Interior or to the Minister of <br />
Finance, the most important members of the <br />
government. And, in the next place, Sir, <br />
my right hon. friend treated <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
question <br />
lightly when more than once I asked him <br />
across the ﬂoor of this House why it 'was <br />
that he, the leader of the House ventured <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> to mislead it with regard to the attitude
<br />
of two of his ministers. I asked him that <br />
question not once or twice, but three <br />
times, and the only answer I ever <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span> from the right hon.
gentleman <br />
was evasion and badinage. It does not <br />
lie in his mouth to charge me with having <br />
treated this question lightly in view of the <br />
fact that he has dealt with it after the fash- <br />
ion I have described. Further than that, the <br />
right hon. gentleman approaches the consid- <br />
eration of this question now without a min- <br />
ister in the Department of the Interior, al- <br />
though in the right hon. gentleman’s cor- <br />
respondence the absence of the Minister of <br />
the Interior on former occasions has been <br />
put forward as a ground for delay. So much <br />
for that. I will leave the right hon. gentle- <br />
man himself to judge whether under these <br />
circumstances he or I can most justly be <br />
charged with having treated this question <br />
lightly and not in the serious way in which <br />
it should be treated. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I do not agree, Sir, with some remarks <br />
which the right hon. gentleman made in his <br />
speech on the 21st of February. He then <br />
said : <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> A great deal has been done; in fact more <br />
has been done than we have to do to-day. We <br />
have to take the last step, but it is easy <br />
and comparatively unimportant in view of and <br />
in comparison with what has already been <br />
accomplished. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I do not know whether my right hon. <br />
friend is quite of the same opinion to-day <br />
with regard to the easy nature of the step, <br />
but I venture to say in all seriousness that <br />
the step which we are taking is the most im- <br />
portant and momentous step that has ever <br />
been taken by this parliament in regard to <br />
our northwestern country. We are doing <br />
to-day what this parliament cannot undo in <br />
the future, because the constitution which <br />
we now propose to give to the territories of <br />
the Northwest can only be altered by the <br />
imperial parliament. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I agree absolutely with the principle of <br />
this Bill so far as it is designed to give a <br />
provincial status to these territories. As <br />
leader of the Conservative party, I laid <br />
down that principle when in the northwest <br />
more than two years ago. I have stood <br />
for that principle in this House in the ses- <br />
sions of 1903 and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1904,</span> and that
principle&nbsp; I <br />
stand for today. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The mode in which the right hon. gentle- <br />
man has brought down this measure has led <br />
to the expression of strong differences of <br />
opinion throughout this country. The educa- <br />
tional clauses have been discussed almost <br />
exclusively in all parts of Canada. For the <br />
moment they overshadow other questions: <br />
they involve differences of race. When I <br />
addressed the House on the ﬁrst read- <br />
ing of the Bill I said I did not de- <br />
sire to make this a political question. Per- <br />
haps the expression was not very happily <br />
chosen, because from whatever aspect con- <br />
sidered, it must in the highest sense of- <br />
