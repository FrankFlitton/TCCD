<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Upon this point I might go further. On <br />
a previous occasion I spoke at some length <br />
on this point, and I will not go over the <br />
same ground again. However, it may not <br />
be inopportune on this occasion to inquire <br />
what is the history of clause 93 in the Bri- <br />
tish North America Act, how did it become <br />
a part of the British North America Act ? <br />
Sir, we live in an age of such intense ex- <br />
citement, we are moving with such rapidity, <br />
our lives are so much engaged in business <br />
occupations, that history is very soon for- <br />
gotten, and what is the event of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to-day</span>
is <br />
forgotten history to-morrow. It may not <br />
therefore be inopportune to look into the <br />
causes which led to the introduction of this <br />
section of 93 into the British North America <br />
Act. It was introduced at the suggestion <br />
of Mr. Galt, in the interest of the Protestant <br />
minority of the province of Quebec, at a <br />
time when he was champion and representa- <br />
tive of that minority in the old parliament <br />
of Canada. I have quoted on a former <br />
occasion, and I may be permitted to quote <br />
again, the language of the Quebec resolu- <br />
tions which formed the embryo of section <br />
93 of the British North America Act. We <br />
ﬁnd that section 43 of the Quebec resolu- <br />
tions, concludes as follows : <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_3" title="bbox 186 1307 948 1453">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Education, saving the rights and
privileges <br />
which the Protestant or Catholic minorities in <br />
both Canadas may possess as to their deno- <br />
minatlional schools at the time when the <br />
union goes into operation. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_4" title="bbox 187 1470 950 2282">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> That was section 43 which guaranteed <br />
separate schools both in Ontario and Que- <br />
bec, but did not go further. Now, Sir, it is <br />
a matter of history that the Protestant min- <br />
ority in Quebec at that time was not alto- <br />
gether satisﬁed with their condition under <br />
the system of separate schools such as it <br />
was. They wanted the system extended <br />
and improved, and they wanted this to be <br />
done before confederation, so that under the <br />
new constitution the rights and privileges <br />
secured to the Protestant minority could <br />
not be interfered with by the new legisla- <br />
ture of Quebec. Mr. Galt, who at that time <br />
as I said was the champion of the Protes- <br />
tant minority in the province of Quebec, <br />
and was also a member of the government <br />
of that day, spoke upon that subject at a <br />
meeting held in the town of Sherbrooke <br />
which he represented in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parliament.</span>
In <br />
the month of October, 1864, just a few <br />
months after the Quebec resolutions had <br />
been adopted by the conference, Mr. Galt <br />
used the following language:<br />
He would now endeavour to speak somewhat <br />
fully as to one of the most important questions, <br />
perhaps the most important that could be con- <br />
ﬁned to the legislature, the question of edu- <br />
cation. This was a question in which, in <br />
Lower Canada, they must all feel the greatest <br />
interest, and in respect to which more mis- <br />
apprehension might be supposed to exist in <br />
the minds, at any rate of the Protestant popu- <br />
lation, than in regard to anything else con- <br />
nected with the whole scheme of confedera- <br />
tion. </p>

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 976 305 1736 1347">
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It must be clear that a measure would not
be <br />
favourably entertained by the majority of Lower <br />
Canada which would place the education of their <br />
children and the provision for their schools, <br />
wholly in the hands of a majority of a different <br />
faith. It was clear that in conﬁding the general <br />
subject to the local legislatures it was abso- <br />
lutely necessary it should be accompanied with <br />
such restrictions as would prevent injustice in <br />
any respect from being done to the minority.&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>Now, this applied to Lower Canada, but it
<br />
also applied, and with equal force, to Upper <br />
Canada and the other provinces ; for in Lower <br />
Canada there was a Protestant minority, and <br />
in the other provinces a Roman Catholic min- <br />
ority. The same privileges belong to the one <br />
of right here, as belonged to the other of right <br />
elsewhere. There could be no greater injustice <br />

to a population than to compel them to have <br />
their children educated in a manner contrary <br />
to their own religious belief.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It had been stipulated that the question
was <br />
to be made subject to the rights and privileges <br />
which the minorities might have as to their <br />
separate and denominational schools. There <br />
had been grave difﬁculties surrounding the <br />
separate school question in Upper Canada, but <br />
they were all settled now, and with regard to <br />
the separate school system of Lower Canada, it <br />
was the determination of the government to <br />
bring down a measure for the amendment of the <br />
school laws before the confederation was al- <br />
lowed to go into force. He made this state- <br />
ment, because as the clause was worded in the <br />
printed resolution, it would appear that the <br />
school law, as it at present existed, was
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> <br />
continued. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Galt undertook <br />
that the school law would be amended in <br />
the following session. In the following ses- <br />
sion, that was the session of 1865, the <br />
resolutions of the Quebec conference <br />
were discussed in the legislature of <br />
Canada but no school Bill was introduced <br />
to amend the law of Lower Canada. Com <br />
plaint was made to the House by Mr. Hol- <br />
ton and others and a measure was promised <br />
the following year. In the following year, <br />
that was the year beforeconfederation, a <br />
school Bill was introduced giving to the <br />
Protestant minority much more power than <br />
they had then and giving to them the powers <br />
which they have now and which have been <br />
given them since by the legislature of the <br />
province of Quebec. Amongst the dispo- <br />
sitions of that measure were the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">following</span>
: <br />

and Protestant institutions in proportion to the <br />
respective Roman Catholic and Protestant popu- <br />
