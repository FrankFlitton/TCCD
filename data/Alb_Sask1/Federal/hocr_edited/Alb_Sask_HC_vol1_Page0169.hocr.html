seculariza- <br />
tion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the schools is largely
responsible of the <br />
evils to be found in the business and social <br />
world. Without the Bible, without Christ, <br />
Without religion. almost without morals, they <br />
can only engender atheism and inﬁdelity, and <br />
he desired the establishment of parochial <br />
schools to counteract to a certain extent the <br />
evil inﬂuence of the public schools. <br />

reco- <br />
mended the establishment of schools to be <br />
maintained by the church for this purpose. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Presbyterian synod of

of New York reported that the teachers <br />
