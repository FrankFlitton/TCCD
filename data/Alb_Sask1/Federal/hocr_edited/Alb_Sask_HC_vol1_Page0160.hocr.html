<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> yesterday that the Minister of Finance
was <br />
a wonderful swimmer, but that he had to <br />
be thrown into the water. I realize, with <br />
some degree of fear, that this debate may <br />
be protracted to a considerable length. and <br />
I wish to indicate as brieﬂy as possible to <br />
the House through what mental process I <br />
have passed, it I may use that expression, <br />
in order to arrive at the conclusion at which <br />
I have arrived in respect to this measure. <br />
The question has been treated from a con- <br />
stitutional standpoint, and certainly it ought <br />
to be treated from that standpoint. since <br />
the very grounds on which we are legisla- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> grounds. I submit. in addition. that it
must <br />
be looked at from a political standpoint— <br />
I say political in altogether the highest <br />
sense of the word. But, taking the con— <br />
stitutional standpoint, the House will per- <br />
mit me to say in what sense I understand <br />
that we are called upon to act. and how I <br />
interpret the three constitutional Acts <br />
which serve as the foundation for our le- <br />
gislation, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> must be
read together. <br />
We have the Confederation Act of 1867. <br />
the Act of 1871 and the Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1886— all</span>
<br />
imperial Acts without which we have no <br />
jurisdiction whatever. Under section 3 of <br />
the last imperial Act, the amendment of <br />
1886, these three Acts must be read toge- <br />
ther. I will not quote the sections; it <br />
would be imposing upon the attention of <br />
the H&lt;,)r1se. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">according</span>
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Co</span>n-<br />
stitutional Act of 1867, from the very <br />
ﬁrst section. it is evident that the scheme <br />
of the framers of our constitution was that <br />
the provinces should be associated together <br />
with an absolutely equal division of powers. <br />
It never entered into the minds of the fram- <br />
ers of those Acts, particularly the Act of <br />
1867, nor even into the minds of those who <br />
laid the foundations of that Act in the Que- <br />
bec conference, that there should be the <br />
slightest inequality between the provinces. <br />
You will see that if you look at the Act of <br />
1867, from section 58 to section 91. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Read section 91 and section 92 (which are
<br />
the two most important sections in regard <br />
to the deﬁnition of the ﬁeld of legislation), <br />
read section 93, section 109, section 146, and <br />
section 147 and you will come to the con- <br />
clusion that the main <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span> of
the im- <br />
perial legislature was to unite the varied <br />
provinces together and to distribute among <br />
those provinces, with the most absolute <br />
measure of equality, the different powers <br />
which were assigned to each. It is im- <br />
possible to read these Acts and not arrive <br />
at the conclusion that this is the proposition <br />
which is the outcome of the efforts made by <br />
the imperial legislature in the direction of <br />
confederation. The plan of confederation <br />
itself rests upon the absolute equality, the <br />
equal division of powers between all the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provinces,</span> parties to
confederation. Any <br />
variation, however small, from this rule is <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">destructive</span>
of the fundamental principle <br />
of our constitution. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">146</span>
which provides for the ad- <br />
mission of other provinces into the Dom- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inion</span> upon the Order in Council
of the home <br />
government, especially declares that the <br />
admission of those other provinces of Prince <br />
Edward Island and British Columbia and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span> is to be done by the mere <br />
operation of an imperial Order in Council <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />which shall bring those
provinces into <br />
confederation, subject to all the dispositions <br />
of the Confederation Act. This was so very <br />
well understood at the very inception that <br />
we ﬁnd British Columbia ﬁrst of all enter- <br />
ing into confederation by the operation of <br />
section <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1-16</span> by the mere passage
of an <br />
Order in Council bringing the province into <br />
confederation and touching in no respect <br />
whatever upon any of the powers which are <br />
to be attributed to the new provinces or <br />
upon any of those powers then lying in the <br />
lap of the new province and which were by <br />
necessary implication to be transferred to <br />
the Dominion. It is undeniable that when <br />
British Columbia and Prince Edward Island <br />
were brought into confederation. no other <br />
mention was made of the Order in Council <br />
which brought these provinces into con- <br />
federation but this that they came in with <br />
a certain representation in parliament, sti- <br />
pulated and agreed upon between the Dom- <br />
inion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">government</span> and the
provincial powers, <br />
but as to a distribution of powers nothing <br />
whatever is said ; reference is simply made <br />
to section 146 of the Confederation Act. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> is there declared that these
provinces <br />
come into the Dominion subject to that dis- <br />
tribution of powers which, according to my <br />
interpretation of our constitution, acts au- <br />
tomatically the moment the province enters <br />
the Dominion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> In the case of Manitoba there were
special <br />
circumstances. Manitoba did not enter con- <br />
federation under the ordinary rule. It was <br />
an exceptional case, and the terms upon <br />
which that province entered the Dominion <br />
were the subject of a special agreement <br />
between the representatives of that then <br />
part of the Northwest Territories and the <br />
Dominion government. An Act was passed <br />
beforehand by this parliament in order to <br />
create that province with certain rights, <br />
certain broad possibilities, and the charter <br />
of Manitoba is so little founded upon that <br />
Act of our own parliament and that Act <br />
was so clearly, in the judgment of competent <br />
lawyers, ultra vires, that it became neces- <br />
sary to pass in England the Imperial Act <br />
of 1871 which is really the charter of Mani- <br />
toba, so that Manitoba did not enter the <br />
confederation under the same machinery <br />
as that provided for other parts of British <br />
North America. Its charter is a special <br />
one, and it is taken altogether out of the <br />
ordinary rule with regard to its entering <br />
