that our immigration will largely ﬂow, and <br />
it is there that we must expect development <br />

the immediate future.  <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Why, the very form of section 16 and of <br />
the substituted section show that the govern- <br />
ment are not serious in the contention which <br />
the right hon. gentleman has made. What <br />
had they inserted in this Bill before we <br />
came to section 16? They had inserted <br />
section 2, which I will read to the House : <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 2. The provisions of the British North
America <br />
Acts 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of <br />
Alberta in the same way and to the like ex- <br />

comprised in the Dominion, as if the said pro- <br />

originally united, except in so far as varied <br />
by this Act and except such provisions as are <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Has not the right hon. gentleman over <br />
and over again in this House, both upon the <br />
ﬁrst reading of this Bill and in the speech <br />
which he made this afternoon, told us that <br />
it is his intention solely and absolutely to <br />
apply to the Northwest Territories of Can- <br />
ada the provisions of that constitution un- <br />
der which all Canadians live. Now I ask <br />
him, and I ask every hon. gentleman on <br />
the other side of the House who proposes <br />
to deal with this question, why section 2 <br />
is not sufﬁcient to apply to the Northwest <br />
Territories of Canada, every provision of <br />
the constitutional statutes which it enumer- <br />
ates ? If my right hon. friend proposes to <br />
stand on the rock of the constitution, what <br />
portion of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rock</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitution</span> is omit- <br />
ted from section 2? It goes further, I believe, <br />
in the direction in which the right hon. gen- <br />
tleman desires to persevere, than it should <br />
go having regard to the fact that this is <br />
not a province already constituted coming <br />
into the Dominion, but is a province to be <br />
created by the very Bill we are now dis- <br />
cussing. I will have something more to <br />
say about that when this Bill is in com- <br />
mittee. But putting aside for the moment <br />
that question, is or is not my right hon. <br />
friend sincere, are or are not his colleagues <br />
sincere, when they tell this House that they <br />
desire the control of education in the North- <br />
west Territories to be regulated solely by <br />
the provisions of the constitution ? If they <br />
are sincere, then I say that they have every- <br />
thing in section 2 that can possibly be given <br />
—if they stand as the right hon. gentleman <br />
says he does stand, on the rock of the cons- <br />
titution. Why, the matter is not arguable. <br />
For what reason do they insert these words? <br />

right hon. friend, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> want
to tell the <br />
hon. gentleman who is venturesome enough <br />
to say, ‘hear, hear,’ that what has agitated <br />
the people of this country is not so much <br />
what has been said by the press as the <br />
knowledge that the right hon. gentleman, <br />
in this Bill, has in express terms departed <br />
from the provisions of the constitution. The <br />
British North America Act, 1867 to 1886, is <br />
to apply to these two provinces, to apply <br />
absolutely and in their whole terms. Are <br />
they ? Let the right hon. gentleman an- <br />
swer in the terms of his own measure: <br />
No. they are only to apply ‘except in <br />
so far as varied by this Act.’ And yet <br />
with that provision staring him in the <br />
face, not only in section 2 but in section <br />
16 of the Bill, he ventures, on his authority <br />
as a public man of long experience, on his <br />
responsibility as Prime Minister of Canada, <br />
on his honour as leader of this House, to <br />
stand here and tell us that he abides by the <br />
constitution, that he stands upon the rock <br />
upon which it is founded. Why, surely, <br />
the matter is not arguable. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">If</span>
the right <br />
hon. gentleman is sincere, let him strike <br />
out these words ‘ in so far as varied by this <br />
Act,’ let him abolish section 16, and then <br />
you will have in truth and in their entirety <br />
those very provisions which are established <br />
upon the rock of the constitution. Let us <br />
look at the substituted section. It is worse, <br />
it seems to me—certainly it is no better than <br />
the original section: <br />
