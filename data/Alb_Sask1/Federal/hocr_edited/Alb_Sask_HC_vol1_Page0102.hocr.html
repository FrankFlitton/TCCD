an Act which we cannot repeal? If the <br />
authority to which I have referred is not <br />
sufﬁcient let me cite one which occasion- <br />
ally irritates my right hon. friend when it <br />
is quoted, one which is often inconsistent <br />
with his views, but nevertheless, one <br />
which, if it does not command his respect, <br />
will at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least,</span> I am sure,
attract his atten- <br />
tion. My right hon. friend himself said in <br />
this House: <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 222 703 977 1090">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> It is impossible to admit for instance
that <br />
the institutions of the Northwest are perma- <br />
nent. On the contrary they are exceptionally <br />
temporary; they deal with a state of things <br />
which is exceptional in itself; they were de- <br />
vised at a time when there was no population <br />
and they must be modiﬁed from time to time <br />
as the necessities of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span>
require. But at <br />
this moment to say they are permanent is a <br />
thing in which I cannot agree except so far <br />
as they must be permanent in every parti- <br />
cular, so long as we are not ready to give these <br />
people a more extended form of local authority. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 225 1123 980 1560">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Speaker, you do not observe in this <br />
opinion of my right hon. friend any especial <br />
reference to the permanence of this pro- <br />
vision which he now seeks to impress for <br />
ever upon the people of the Northwest Ter- <br />
ritories. But, let me not forget one other <br />
authority which I should refer to, that is <br />
the authority of Sir John Thompson, whom <br />
I have already mentioned. These words <br />
were uttered in the year 1894. Mr. McCar- <br />
thy, in the course of his speech on that oc- <br />
casion, used this language and Sir John <br />
Thompson gave the following answer :— <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 225 1584 978 2329">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> As I understood the First Minister in his
<br />
answer to the hon. member for West Assini- <br />
boia—perhaps I was wrong, but Iwould like <br />
to be corrected if I was wrong—rather in- <br />
sisted upon the view I am putting which is <br />
that if separate schools are continued until <br />
the Northwest Territories are given provin- <br />
cial autonomy they will have the right of <br />
insisting upon that being continued when pro- <br />
vincial autonomy is conferred upon them. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Sir JOHN THOMPSON. I did not say that. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. McCARTHY. Then I fail to understand <br />
the views which the First Minister holds. He <br />
seems to be on both sides of the question. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Sir JOHN THOMPSON. Not at all. If I <br />
spoke amblguously before, I was not at all <br />
conscious of it; but I cannot be said to be <br />
ambiguous after the explanation I made to <br />
the hon. member for Assiniboia. I appealed <br />
to the House to continue the present system <br />
while the territorial system continued, and I <br />
declared that in my opinion the whole sub- <br />
ject would be open and free to parliament as <br />
to what constitution we would give to the <br />
provinces when provinces were created. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now, my right hon. friend took one other <br />
ground. He says that within the four <br />
corners of the British North America Act, <br />
1867 to 1886, he has found justiﬁcation for <br />
imposing upon the people of the Northwest <br />
this restriction. I take issue with him upon <br />
this ground as strongly as upon the other. <br />
Neither in the negotiations and resolutions <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> whose legal ability I very highly esteem.
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> I do not claim to be infallible, but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <br />
given to this question a good deal of con- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> sideration and it is my duty to state the
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> conclusion I have arrived at, and which I
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> have just stated, that there is not any
pro- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> vision within the four corners of the Act
<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> which obliges or in my humble opinion

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> justiﬁes parliament in imposing this
restric- <br />
tion upon the legislative power of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span>
<br />
posed provinces. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Let us examine in the ﬁrst place the ne- <br />
gotiations upon which the British North <br />
America Act was passed. Do not forget <br />
that in the very outset the intention was to <br />
include in the confederation the very terri- <br />
tories that are now being constituted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span>
<br />
provinces. My right hon. friend (Sir <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wilfrid</span>
<br />
Laurier) has referred to the Quebec resolu- <br />
tions. Let me also refer to them. He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
<br />
referred to the 43rd article and to the 6th <br />
sub-article. I shall read that because it is <br />
important to consider it in order to judge <br />
whether, outside the strict letter of the law <br />
and within the spirit of the constitution, <br />
within the lines of the negotiations which <br />
resulted in its formation, anything is to be <br />
found which justiﬁes the present action of <br />
the government. The 43rd article enumer— <br />
ates subjects within the exclusive power of <br />
the provincial legislatures and the 6th <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sub-</span>
<br />
article is as follows :— <br />

both the Canadas may possess as to their de- <br />

syllable. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> But in construing that article do not
for- <br />
