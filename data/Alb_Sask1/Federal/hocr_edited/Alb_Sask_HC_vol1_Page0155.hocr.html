               My right hon. colleague, the Prime Minis-<br />
               ter, in introducing the Bill said its object 
               <br />
               was to secure to the minority what they 
               <br />
               now enjoy, namely, the right to have their 
               <br />
               own schools, to assess themselves for the 
               <br />
               cost of these schools, and to receive their 
               <br />

               equitable and proportionate share of the 
               <br />
               public grants for school purposes. My hon. 
               <br />
               colleague, the Minister of Justice, also de-<br />
               clared that to be the object and intent of 
               <br />
               the Bill. It was contended, however, by 
               <br />
               some that there might be a broader con- 
               <br />

               struction placed upon the general Bill than 
               <br />
               was intended, as explained by the Prime 
               <br />
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Minister</span> and the Minister of Justice, and to 
               <br />
               meet that objection, the clauses were 
               <br />
               amended so as to re-enact the existing pro- 
               <br />

               visions of the law and thus prevent any dis- 
               <br />
               pute in the future. It must be borne .in 
               <br />
               mind that those separate schools are formed 
               <br />

               to convey to the minds of some people the 
               <br />

               sense in which they are established in some 
               <br />
               other province, there is no distinction be- 
               <br />

               <br />

               ﬁcation of teachers, or the text books, or 
               <br />

               the right of state to inspection, or in the re-<br />
               ports they have to make. In every respect 
               <br />
               they are under the commissioner of educa-

               <br />
               every other public school in the Territories. 
               <br />
               All they get is what? If they desire it, pro-
