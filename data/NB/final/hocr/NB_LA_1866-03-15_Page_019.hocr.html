<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">great sympathy expressed for the mem-<br />
bers of the rural districts. I have not<br />
heard a single gentleman complain that<br />
the House was not called together soon<br />
enough. In Canada it is not called un-<br />
til the 10th of April. In Prince Edward's<br />
Island the 9th of April ; in Nova Scotia<br />
ten days or a fortnight<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> ago. He said
he <br />
thought one man had stopped the whole<br />
Legislative power of the country. I was<br />
sent to Washington by my colleagues.<br />
Mr. Cudlip was invited to meet the dele-<br />
gates, who expected to meet at New<br />
York, but he could not go. I went to <br />
St. John. Mr. Wilmot was not there,and <br />
the Government agreed that I should go to<br />
Washington to meet the other delegates.<br />
We did not expect to have to go into an<br />
elaborate discussion of the Reciprocity <br />
Treaty at all. We went with a view of<br />
obtaining from the United States an ex-<br />
tension of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> the Treaty for one year. <br />
When we got<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> there we found a Treaty <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could not be made at all, for all
Treaties <br />
made between the United States and <br />
other Governments requires the affirma-<br />
tion of the Senate, and does not require<br />
to be sent to the House of Representa-<br />
tives, for if they have power to make a<br />
commercial treaty they ignore the func-<br />
tions of that body. In the interchange<br />
of commodities it was desirable to have<br />
some arrangement made of a perman-<br />
ent character. They said whatever ar-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rangements were made should be car-<br />
ried out by future legislation in all good<br />
faith. We entered into negotiations<br />
with them ; the proposition made by us,<br />
and they answer, have been published.<br />
We felt we could not agree to their<br />
terms, in justice to our own people, and<br />
we therefore closed our negotiations. I <br />
shall not say anything further upon this. <br />
point, as I may have an opportunity of<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">explaining exactly what took place
while<br />
I was there. It has been said that the<br />
interests of the people of this Province<br />
are not safe in calling the Legislature<br />
together at so late a period. It is very<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirable to call the House together<br />
rather later, fo we know when the<br />
House breaks up before the River opens<br />
it makes it difficult for some of us to get<br />
home. Was it ever said by a member <br />
of a deliberative assembly before, that<br />
a Government should be ousted from<br />
power because they called the Legisla-<br />
ture three weeks later than usual. There<br />
is a good substantial reason why this <br />
Legislature should not be called earlier.<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It was known that Canada was anxious<br />
that our Session should be called. Why<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did they not call their own ; they have<br />
not had a Session for the last fifteen<br />
months, except a short Session, which<br />
was called last Spring to authorise a <br />
loan and impose an additional tax.<br />
When a treaty with the United States <br />
had to be made by Legislation, was it<br />
not sufficient to justify the House in not<br />
meeting at the usual period, because,<br />
if we had made an arrangement with the<br />
United State Government it would re-<br />
quire to be legislated upon by this Leg-<br />
islature. It has been brought against<br />
us that we brought forward no measures<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last Session except the Military Bill.<br />
Where is the Treasure Note Bill, or the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Post Office Bill? which has been put<br />
forward as a first step towards the re-<br />
moval of the seat of Government, but<br />
which was not thought of at all, it<br />
being merely to abolish the head of a<br />
department. It was not expected under<br />
the circumstances, that measures would <br />
be brought foward last Session, when<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">it was the desire of the Government<br />

shorten the Session and get home as<br />
soon as possible. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">My hon. friend says, we are entitled<br />
to condemnation because we brought in<br />
a Bill to abolish the office of Postmaster<br />
General, but the hon. members, fresh<br />
from their constituents, supported it<br />
thirty to nine. There is a feeling<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throughout the country that the
office<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might be abolished without detriment to<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the public service, and in connection<br />
with this, he would state that Mr. Odell<br />
had discharged the duties of the office<br />
as efficiently as any gentleman had,<br />
since its creation. When the hon. gen-<br />
tleman had told the people of York that<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they were to be destroyed, did he tell<br />
them that when Mr. Wilmot and myself<br />
formed the Goverment they had not<br />
forgotten the interests of York ? In the<br />
formation of the Government, they had<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selected one-third of the members from<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that County, viz : the hon.
Commissioner<br />
Board of Works, the Attorney General<br />
and the Postmaster General, who, being<br />
a member of the Upper House, filled<br />
one of the most important offices in the<br />
country, and being interested in the <br />
prosperity of the county of York. How<br />
dare they say to the people of this<br />
country that this Government were not<br />
going to give York fair play? How<br />
could they exect the seat of Govern-<br />
ment could be removed with one-third<br />
of the entire Government from the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">County of York <span class="unclear" title="“A" word="" seems="" to="" be="" obscured="" or="" letters="" missing.”="">?</span> I believe it was the<br />
fear of this, together with the agitation<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span>about Ferrianism, that had an
influence<br />
in the election ; for I believe the people<br />
of this country are as much against the<br />
Quebec Scheme as ever If you get a <br />
scheme that will provide for the interests<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the people, I will go for it ; but
it is<br />
not in the four corners of that scheme<br />
