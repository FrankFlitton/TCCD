<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MCCLELLAN.—In the course of his<br />
remarks the Hon. President of the Coun-<br />
cil referred <span class="unclear" title="word is smudged out">?</span>
Mr. Galt's speech, and<br />
inferred from <span class="unclear" title="word is smudged out">?</span>
that Mr. Tilley, in his<br />
address, was not actuated by proper<br />
views, and had taken ground he should<br />
not have done. I notice that the hon.<br />
President of the Council has changed<br />
his views with regard to that gentleman.<br />
In 1857 he lost his election, and the hon.<br />
President of the Council was placed in<br />
the opposition, and in a speech he then<br />
made in this House he eulogized Mr.<br />
Tilley, who was then standing in the<br />
gallery, as he was the other day when<br />
the remarks of the hon. President of the<br />
Council were not so flattering. I men-<br />
tion this merely to show that people's<br />
minds change.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. SMITH.—People change too.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCCLELLAN.—He referred to Mr.<br />
Galt's speech at Sherbrooke, and in re-<br />
ply to that I have an extract from a<br />
speech of Mr. Dorion, who is on the<br />
same side as the hon. President of the<br />
Council, which I shall read to shew his<br />
opinion of the scheme, as giving to New<br />
Brunswick a great advantage over Ca-<br />
nada, in a financial and commercial<br />
point of view. Mr. Dorion opposes the<br />
scheme because the people of New<br />
Brunswick get the best of the bargain.<br />
The hon. President quotes Galt's speech<br />
at Sherbrooke, to shew the origin of the<br />
movement, which proves nothing, un-<br />
less it be that to remove a social or po-<br />
litical evil existing amongst our Cana-<br />
dian fellow-colonists without at the<br />
same time injuring ourselves, forms an<br />
objectionable feature. Surely the hon.<br />
member ought to attach great weight to<br />
the arguments of Mr. Dorion, who, like<br />
himself, has the patriotism to oppose<br />
British interests, and Colonial pro-<br />
gress. A fellow-feeling ought to make<br />
them co-incident in opinion, if not<br />
wondrous kind to each other. An-<br />
other objection taken was, the Bills<br />
framed by the local Legislatures would<br />
be liable to be disallowed by the Gener-<br />
al Government. I do not see the point<br />
of this objection, as our local bills may<br />
now be disallowed by a power farther<br />
off, and whereas in the General Govern-<br />
ment we should have representatives to<br />
explain and support them, in England<br />
we have none at all. Then another, ob-<br />
jection was, a large expenditure of<br />
money would be made on canals in Can-<br />
ada. It is evident, however, that this is<br />
entirely dependent on the state of the<br />
finances ; it is not made a basis of the<br />
scheme, but a subject for future consid-<br />

extend the canals of Western Canada,<br />
but the lines would all be taken away,<br />
and we should not look upon Canada or<br />
New Brunswick, but upon one great<br />
united country. The hon. member has<br />
further said that our voice will not be<br />
heard in Canada ; but taking our repre-<br />
sentatives in both branches our voices<br />
would be something after all, and then<br />
we shall have more there after a while,<br />
for our increase of population is 3 per<br />
cent, while that of Lower Canada is only<br />
2 1-2 per cent. And then there is no<br />
danger of our being swamped by West-<br />
ern Canada. How has it been in the<br />
United States? Where does the popu-<br />
lation centre and increase most? Is it<br />
not on the sterile sea coasts? There the<br />
manufactories arise, there the mechanics<br />
and artizans congregate, whilst the<br />
great and fertile interior is given up to<br />
the pursuits of agriculture. The hon.<br />
President of the Council further said<br />
that our railway would, before long, be<br />
likely to pay per cent interest, and it<br />
would be folly to give this up. He must<br />
think the country is improving very<br />
fast, and that the population is also in-<br />
creasing. I want these delegates, who<br />
go home, to tell them in Downing Street<br />
the truth and the whole truth, to tell the<br />
views of the people of this Province,<br />
and the means used by the Antis to carry<br />
our their purposes. Tell them that in<br />
the Upper House there is a large majori-<br />
ty, men of the highest respectability,<br />
who are in favor of this scheme. I do<br />
not know how they regard this branch<br />
of the Legislature, but I think they de-<br />
serve the thanks of this people. To-<br />
day I learn that the third Government<br />
Bill this Session has been laid aside by<br />
that body. There was the Banking Bill,<br />
the result of twenty years study, sum-<br />
marily disposed of ; then the Treasury<br />
Note Bill, that wheel-barrow steam en-<br />
gine, double-back-action, money-pro-<br />
ducing machine, is thrown out, as it<br />
ought to have been, and now the Post<br />
Office Bill, that was to move the office<br />
to St. John, and save so much money<br />
to the country. I want the delegates to<br />
tell them that that House has a large<br />
majority in favor of Confederation. The<br />
hon. member says our railroad is good<br />
to give up, but he says nothing of the<br />
the value of public works in Canada. He<br />
does not speak of their 234 miles of<br />
canals, costing $16,000,000 ; the Vic-<br />
toria Bridge, costing $10,000,000 ; the<br />
lines of railway, 2000 miles ; their navi-<br />
gable lakes ; their 4000 miles of tele-<br />
graph &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.<br />

as to let the people know all that is go-<br />

Union on the country financially. My<br />
friends Mr. McMillan has taken up and<br />
treated on it length. Mr. Dorion thinks<br />
New Brunswick would get the best of the<br />
not most important part of the Scheme.<br />
We should be all fellow-colonists, and if<br />
one man gets a few more cents than ano-<br />
ther it is not worth talking about. In the<br />
consideration of such a question as this,<br />
I hold that taking into consideration the<br />
deductions that will be made, that we<br />
shall have enough to carry on the Gene-<br />
ral Government without taxing the peo-<br />
ple more than a few cents a head more,<br />
and this not worthy to be thought of<br />
when we look at the great principles of<br />
trade and defence relying upon it. These<br />
are the higher magnitude and more worthy<br />
of the attention of statesmen. I think<br />
that even without the Intercolonial Rail-<br />
road, it will be shown that we should<br />
have the best of the bargain, yet when we<br />
remember that we are to get over 200<br />
miles of this road built through the heart<br />
of our country, it is sufficient argument<br />
against any cry of taxation that has been<br />
raised. It may do at election times, and<br />
people may be influenced by it for a time,<br />
but when they learn that the amount we<br />
are to pay for a Steamer on the North<br />
Shore is about as much as our share of<br />
interest on the amount that would carry<br />
on the work of road, they will change<br />
their views. The hon. member for St.<br />
John spoke of the remarks he made at the<br />
dinner given to the Canadians at Stubb's<br />
hotel, where he said that they need not<br />
interpret the feelings of the people of the<br />
Province as favorable to a Union by the<br />
demonstrations with which they were re-<br />
ceived ; but did he not go on to say, what<br />
is stated as a fact, that he further observ-<br />
ed that we must either have Confedera-<br />
tion or Annexation ?<br />

Railroad to assist in carrying us into the<br />
United States. I am not averse to Wes-<br />

larger in proportion than many towns in<br />
England, while with the smaller Provinces<br />
the same still more applies. When there<br />
are so few offices, and so many to fill<br />

and be carried out on the plan of the Eng-<br />
