from this union. If you take two bean <br />
poles and bind them together, you <br />
strengthen them, but if you put them <br />
end to end, it does not increase their <br />
strength. This Union between Upper and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lower</span> Canada, has been like a cat
and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dog</span> union ; and they want to get
us to <br />
help them out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scrape.</span> The
popu- <br />

rapidly, and as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representation</span>
is by pop-<br />
ulation, we would soon be entirely <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">swamped,</span> and if the Canadians
wished to <br />
make an advantageous bargain with the <br />
United States, they could give up the <br />
fisheries of New Brunswick for the sake <br />
of getting an additional advantage for <br />
themselves. We are promised eighty <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cents</span> a head on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population.</span> We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span> <br />
to have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$63,000</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for ten</span> years, our debt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> <br />
to be increased to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$7,000,000,</span>
and a large <br />
amount of money is to be expended on the <br />
Intercolonial Railway ; but what security <br />
have we that those promises will be per- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed ?</span> Ireland was induced to
unite <br />
with England in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequence</span> of
certain <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inducements</span> being held out. They
were <br />
promised Catholic emancipation, but how <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> was it before they got it, and <br />
at what an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expense of</span>
heart-burnings be- <br />
fore it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accomplished,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twenty-nine</span> <br />
years after this union was established. <br />
This union was with a power celebrated <br />
for its integrity, but it was only after the <br />
most desperate efforts that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ireland</span>
could <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">succeed</span> in getting what she was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promis-</span> <br />
ed as a condition for her entering this <br />
union. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We,</span> on the contrary, are
asked <br />
to unite with a people, that have tricked <br />
us once in regard to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intercolonial</span>
<br />
Railway, and should not trust their <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promises again.</span> Then in reference
to this <br />
eighty cents a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head ;</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as our</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span>
in- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">creases,</span> our wants <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increase,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and we re-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">quire a larger </span>expenditur<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e for roads, <br />
schools and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bridges ; but</span>
instead of get- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ting</span> more we actually get less,
for we get <br />
$63,000 a-year for ten years, and is it to <br />
be supposed we will not want it eleven <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> hence. In a hundred years
hence, our <br />
population will have increased very large- <br />
ly, and our revenues will have increased <br />
immensely, for the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this-Province</span>
<br />
consume more duitable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">articles than</span>
Ca- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nada ;</span> therefore, it is an
outrage to say <br />
we shall <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span> only this small
amount, <br />
eighty cents a head on the population of <br />
1861. It is our duty to legislate for those <br />
who come after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us ;</span> and it is
our duty as <br />
statesmen not to give up our country to <br />
gratify a few vain individuals. When we <br />
find men, who, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead</span> of
looking after <br />
the interests of the people who have ele- <br />
vated them to a high <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position,</span>
attempt to <br />
ﬂy to still <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">higher,</span> their ﬂight
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">generally</span> <br />
downwards, like that of a man who went <br />
to the top of a house with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paper</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wings to</span> <br />
make a bird of himself. This has been <br />
the case with statesmen before, and will <br />
be so again. <br />

</span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">KERR.—A</span>
great deal of time has<br />
been taken up in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussion,</span>
and a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
large amount of money lost to the country<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
by it. I thought that the country <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
spoken out so loudly that Confederation<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
was not only dead but buried face down-<br />
ward, and so deep that, as the hon. mem-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ber for Charlotte said, it would not appear<br />
again at least for a long time. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seems,</span><br />
however, that it is not so from these reso-<br />
lutions, and the appointment of new dele-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
gates. In Northumberland there were<br />
seven candidates in the field ; six for Con-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation</span> and one against. I
conceived<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
at that time that from the threats made <br />
against us by the neighbouring republic,<br />
and the intimation that the protection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span><br />
the mother country would likely be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
drawn from us in care of difficulties aris-<br />
ing, that it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span> we
should con-<br />
tinue our united emerges to establish a<br />
power in these Colonies whose influence<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
might be felt. Under these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">circumstances,</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
I was constrained to support a Scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that would not only thus unite us, but con-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tinue to us that powerful <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protection</span>
that<br />
we so much need. I have not changed<br />
my opinions since then. I believe that<br />
Canada is destined to be a great country ;<br />
she already pays half a million of dollars<br />
to support a line of Steam Ships to and<br />
from England, and then look at the mag-<br />
nitude of her public works. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
been<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
put forth by those opposed to Union that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
she is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heavily</span> in debt ; there
is no doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of that, but then she has claims on the <br />
different Railways and other works of <br />
$40,000,000 or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$50,000,000</span>, and
the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
amount really due her is more than the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
interest on her whole debt. I believe that<br />
both the evils and benefits that would<br />
arise from a Union have been very much<br />
exaggerated<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> Let us now come down
to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the Resolutions before us. Since Res-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ponsible Government was first established <br />
here, we have never been called to delib-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
erate on such a Resolution. I say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span><br />
has never been a case where the House<br />
has been asked to appoint delegates to go<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to England to lay before that people and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
Government the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span> and
state of this<br />
Province. Last Session delegates were<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed</span> to take into
consideration <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
Union of the Maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span>
and a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
few days ago the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. President of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span><br />
Council brought in a Resolution to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span><br />
tinue those negociations ; but notwith-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standing</span> the principle of the
Initiation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span><br />
money grants being entirely in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of the Government, we now ﬁnd a private<br />
member of the House comes forward with<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolutions</span> which, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried,</span> involves <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenditure</span> of a large sum
of money,<br />
we do not know how much. I say it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span><br />
against the principle established by this<br />
House that a matter of this kind should<br />
be taken out of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands</span> of
Government.<br />
With regard to what has been said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about
a</span><br />
power to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought to</span> bear on
us to force<br />
us into this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Union,</span> I do not
believe any-<br />
thing of the kind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
contemplated. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eng-</span> <br />
land never did bring any power to bear <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to force</span> her dependencies or
colonies to<br />
unite either with her or among themselves.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">In Scotland</span> the matter was left
entirely in<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the hands of the Local Government, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the same in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Ireland ;</span> no power
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> <br />
to bear upon them to force them to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unite</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
with England. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. KERR.—Neither Nova Scotia nor<br />
Prince Edward Island, have appointed<br />
delegates to go Home, and why should<br />
we ? I do not believe that having conce-<br />
ded to us the power of self-Government,<br />
the Imperial Parliament will compel us to<br />
take any action with regard to Union that<br />
is opposed to the wishes of the people. I<br />
do not agree with the statement set forth<br />
in the Resolution that a Union of these<br />
Colonies would be politically, financially,<br />
and commercially disastrous, neither do I<br />
believe that having passed a Militia Bill<br />
that it is necessary to send Home a dele-<br />
gation to show that we are willing to do<br />
all we can to defend ourselves. As to our<br />
loyalty, that is a truism which nobody<br />
doubts, and therefore the delegates are not<br />
needed to prove it. The seventh Section<br />
of the preamble states that it is to be fear-<br />
ed that the Government and people of<br />
Great Britain are not aware of the true<br />
state of feeling here on the question of<br />
Confederation. If this is so, which I do<br />
not for a moment believe, why cannot<br />
they be informed without a delegation ?<br />
Above all, however, why does the Govern-<br />
ernment come to this House to ask our<br />
sanction to the appointment ? When we<br />
were sold to Jackson &amp; Co. for <span class="unclear" title="can't format the British pound symbol">?</span>90,000,<br />
did the Government come to this House,<br />
and on all the other delegations to Great<br />
Britain, Canada, and elsewhere, did they<br />
ask for sanction to appoint delegates? No,<br />
this is the first time since the year 1833, that<br />
such as course has been taken. Then, be-<br />
fore the principle of Responsible Govern-<br />
ment was recognized, and when a feeling<br />
was going about that the people of these<br />
Colonies were disloyal, Judge Street mov-<br />
ed for a delegation to England to lay be-<br />
fore the British Government the true state<br />
of feeling in this Province. But the pre-<br />
sent action is unprecedented—a private<br />
member brings in a Government measure,<br />
and to day the Hon. President of the<br />
Council moves to take up the order of the<br />
day. I believe that any course of action<br />
taken by the whole Government by des-<br />
patches would have more influence with<br />
the Imperial Government than anything<br />
which two delegates might be able to do<br />
by going Home. And when I see that<br />
anything which affects us must in like<br />
manner affect the other Provinces, and<br />
they have not appointed delegates, I do<br />
not see why we should take such a step.<br />
I shall therefore oppose the Resolutions.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. LEWIS.—I believe that this Union<br />
of the Provinces is a great Scheme, which<br />
would result in great good to this Pro-<br />
vince. A great deal has been said and<br />
written on the subject, it has been can-<br />
vassed and recanvassed, it has been be-<br />
fore the people in every position in which<br />
it could be represented, and the people<br />
have spoken out upon it. I looked upon<br />
it with great favor, for I believed that it<br />
would tend to build us up and make us a<br />
great people. The great want we have<br />
always experienced was the absence of<br />
great public works, and these a Union<br />
would have given us. We wanted a Rail-<br />
road running through the heart of our<br />
country, opening up our wild lands, pre-<br />
paring the way for a system of coloniza-<br />
tion, and connecting us directly with Can-<br />
ada, and this the Scheme would have<br />
given to us on much better terms than we<br />
can get it without. I believed also that<br />
it would be the means of promoting and<br />
fostering our manufactories. It has been<br />
said that we cannot manufacture for Can-<br />
ada ; but if our infant manufactories were<br />
encouraged, and a field opened up for the<br />
produce of them in the other Provinces,<br />
we should soon be able to compete with<br />
any other country. It has been said that<br />
