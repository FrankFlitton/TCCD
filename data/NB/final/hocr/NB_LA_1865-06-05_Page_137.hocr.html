<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCMILLAN.—A</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compliment</span> has <br />
been paid to me by the statement that <br />
when the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> came <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the Council<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
I was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> out against its not <br />
being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted</span> to the people.
But I<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
now state that there was not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissenting</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voice i</span>n the whole Council. The
Hon<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
Chief <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioner</span> has said that
when<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
he was in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> he found that
they<br />
would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intercolonial</span><br />
Railroad should go by any other route<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
than by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Shore,</span> and that this <br />
was decided in Nova Sco<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tia</span> and in
Eng-<br />
land.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HATHEWAY—While</span>
in Can-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ada, I heard that the Duke of Newcastle<br />
had told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. Tilley that no line
would go <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">within 15 miles of the river Saint John.<br />
</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as i was not considered safe in
case of <br />
difficulties with the United States<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCMILLAN.—I never knew that<br />
any particular route was decided on ; I<br />
thought it was to be left to England to<br />
decide. I wished, very naturally, that it<br />
should go by the North Shore ; but I did<br />
not know it was settled on. Then, it is<br />
said, there were a good many disappointed<br />
politicians who expected to go to Ottawa ;<br />
but I will not say anything about that.<br />
Now for the hon. member for St. John<br />
(Mr. Wetmore): he delivered a speech<br />
that, from the style of its delivery and its<br />
beautifully rounded periods, must have<br />
been thoroughly prepared. If unuendo,<br />
if the imputing of all manner of motives,<br />
are arguments against Confederation, then<br />
his speech is unanswerable ; but if the<br />
points are that Confederation is commer-<br />
ciall, financially and politically disastrous.<br />
then his speech is a great failure. He<br />
took up the Coles' Island Bridge, Mr.<br />
Watters' election as Mayor of St. John,<br />
and how the would-be Mayor was caught<br />
in a trap, and money interests at elections;<br />
what have these to do with Confederation?<br />
But another point that he seemed to<br />
imagine was most convincing was the ex-<br />
port duty from Canada. It appeared to be<br />
very funny, but it had little to do with the<br />
question before us. I will now only make<br />
a few general remarks in conclusion. I<br />
have referred to the history and experi-<br />
ence of the United States, and the efforts<br />
they have put out to sustain their union,<br />
but we, in our wisdom and with our popu-<br />
lation of 250,000, repudiate any such<br />
idea as union. Instead of bringing a<br />
charge against our public men, that they<br />
aspire to be Governors of Provinces and<br />
are actuated only by selfish and wrong<br />
motives, the idea ought to be fostered<br />
and encouraged. This charge came first<br />
from the hon. President of the Council,<br />
and it has been echoed by his satellites<br />
all over the country ; but it should not<br />
have any influence in such a question as<br />
this. Then what has the Government<br />
now to depend on to raise the resources<br />
of the country—what is there but lumber<br />
to depend on ? But in Confederation we<br />
should not be so dependent as now ; if<br />
lumber fails, we could fall back on the<br />
crops of Canada, and the Provincial Sec-<br />
retary would not have the difficulty he<br />
now experiences in making up his budget.<br />
I feel that I am not able for this great<br />
matter ; but, having been associated with<br />
a man who, although charged with being<br />
a "conspirator" and as using a " hidden<br />
hand" to work out his designs, has yet<br />
an intellect and financial abilities that<br />
would fit him for a high position and do<br />
honor to any land, I feel called on to speak<br />
out in his behalf. It may be said that<br />
those in favor of this scheme are subject<br />
to "cramming," but that is not likely to<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">deter me from my purpose. I regret he is<br />
not on the floors of the House to raise his<br />
voice in answer to the opponents of this<br />
measure , then there would be less said<br />
then there has been on this question, and<br />
the hon. President of the Council might<br />
again decline to enter into an argument<br />
with him.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. SMITH.—Now I wish to say,<br />
once for all, that I did not refuse to enter<br />
into an argument with Mr. Tilley. That<br />
gentleman, I believe, stated that he chal-<br />
lenged me to speak at Lingley Hall, in<br />
Sackville, but it was thus : I received an<br />
invitation from the Secretary, but he stat-<br />
ed that I should not be allowed to speak.<br />
When the statement was made that I had<br />
refused to meet Mr. Tilley, I wrote to the<br />
papers—both the Freeman and the Tele-<br />
graph—that it was not true.

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCMILLAN.—I</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">took</span> my informa- <br />
tion from the papers, but it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
no matter. <br />
Now for the resolutions—what are they ? <br />
I have no hope that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any thing I
may say <br />
will change <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> views <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> any one on the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬂoors</span> of this Honse, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> state that an <br />
election has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> place—that an
appeal <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> been made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to the</span> people—that they <br />
hav<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e</span> decided against
Confederation—that <br />
they know every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> will
be paid to <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expression</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">peo</span>ple,
and then, in <br />
the face <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they
ask</span>
that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dele-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gation</span> be sent home to tell the
people of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> all this that they
already know <br />
as well as we do. There are intimations<br />
that in Canada, in Nova Scotia, and in<br />
this Province there is some " hidden<br />
hand," and yet they do not lay their<br />
information before the House. We know<br />
that Confederation will not be forced upon<br />
us, and yet we must send men home to<br />
ask that it be not. Suppose they go, the<br />
Imperial Cabinet will ask, "What is your<br />
business, Mr. President?" "Oh, we hear<br />
that there is some underhanded work<br />
going on, and we came over to let you<br />
know that we have decided against Con-<br />
federation." This would, certainly, be<br />
very satisfactory, and well worthy of the<br />
expense to be incurred. I am opposed to<br />
the Resolutions.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. GILLMOR.—I claim to be a<br />
good listener, but have no pretensions to<br />
being a good speaker. I have listened<br />
attentively to the speeches made upon<br />
these resolutions. The hon. ex-Surveyor<br />
General has made several long speeches ;<br />
he has now made a sort of general reply<br />
to several hon. members, so I shall not<br />
attempt to follow him ;—their speeches<br />
will appear, and the public can judge of<br />
the arguments. He asks me how I feel ?<br />
In reply, I beg to inform him that I am quite<br />
well, both physically and politically ; and<br />
if we can succeed in getting a few matters<br />
set right on the other side of the water,<br />
in reference to Confederation, all will be<br />
well. I do not think it important that<br />
the question of Confederation should now<br />
be fully discussed ; it has been ably han-<br />
dled, both through the press and upon<br />
the platform, and the people in this Pro-<br />
vince have given their verdict, and it has<br />
been so decidedly in condemnation of the<br />
scheme that a wayfaring man, through a<br />
fool, need not fail to understand. The<br />
friends of this scheme had it in their own<br />
hands, and managed it in their own way ;<br />
and yet, was there ever a question upon<br />
which the people of this or any other<br />
country spoke out more plainly, and gave<br />
a decision more conclusive ? The hon<br />
member for Albert says, this question of<br />
Confederation is not new. I have been a<br />
member of the Assembly for ten years,<br />
and neither I nor any other member ever<br />
heard it discussed in this Assembly. I<br />
remember to have read a discussion had<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> between the Hon. Joseph Howe <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and, I</span> <br />
think, a Mr Uniack, some ten years ago, <br />
and occasionally <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Judge</span> Wilmot
has allud- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ed</span>
to it in some of his speeches ; and, ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cept</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occasional</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allusions</span> of this kind, it <br />
is new to the people, and not one in a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hundred</span> of the electors knew
anything <br />
about this until after the delegates re- <br />
turned from Quebec. This scheme had <br />
its origin in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada ;</span> their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessities</span> <br />
called for it, not ours. An idea of this <br />
scheme was communicated to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leading</span>
<br />
politicians of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Lower
Provinces, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> went to Quebec and held the
Con- <br />
ference. I shall make no reference to the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutionality</span> of this
delegation, but I <br />
do know that the people did not send <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> Now, if there is any class
of per- <br />
sons that are calculated to impose upon<br />
the people more than another, it is the <br />
makers and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">venders</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of </span>quack medicine. <br />
These doctors went there, and in the space <br />
of seventeen days they prepared what I call <br />
a quack <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">medicine ;</span> having got it
prepared, <br />
they next had to return and make the <br />
people feel that they were sick. They <br />
might have labelled it, “health and <span class="unclear" title="can't make out what it says">?</span> <br />
fort for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all ;"</span>
so they told them that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were ﬁnancially</span>
distressed and commer<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">c</span>ially <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depressed ;</span> that they
could not get<br />
along or expand unless they took this <br />
medicine. So they went to work recom- <br />
mending the panacea, and some of the <br />
people soon began to feel sick, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but many</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">began</span>
to ask how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span> the medicine
was <br />
going to cost. If you look into the scheme, <br />
you will see a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">medicine</span> ﬁxed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up f</span>or all the <br />
politicians ; they had certain ends to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> put into this medi- <br />
cine <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a larger</span>
amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of Soothing </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Syrup,</span> <br />
and this was especially intended for the <br />
House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lords ;</span> and it had its effect
as <br />
forcibly upon men as it does upon child-<br />
ren, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">recent</span> events have
proved, and <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expected</span> it would so
operate upon <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all the people.</span> This matter was argued <br />
out by the candidates upon both sides. <br />
and in Charlotte County the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederates</span>
<br />
had an advocate, who, for eloquence and <br />
fluency, was not inferior to the ablest ad- <br />
vocate in this Province ; and yet, in a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituency</span>
of some 3,200 voters. I do <br />
not think there were more than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">600</span>
out- <br />
and-out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederates.</span> In this I may be<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mistaken,</span> but that is my opinion. The <br />
arguments in favor of the scheme were <br />
vague and indefinite. They said our <br />
young men were going away, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
<br />
was going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">keep</span> them all at
home ; <br />
adopt this, and no fond mother was ever <br />
to weep for an absent son, and no tender <br />
lover was ever again to part from his <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sweetheart.</span> The people, however,
had <br />
no idea it was going to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produce</span>
such re- <br />
sults ; in Charlotte, this quest on, at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">least,</span>
<br />
was fairly tried. During the ten years I <br />
have been in politics, I have given the late <br />
Government my support ; and, although <br />
I have voted against some of their mea- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sures, up</span> to the time of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last</span> proroga- <br />
tion I would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> voted
against them <br />
in a direct vote of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">want of</span>
confidence. <br />
Now, if this Confederation scheme was <br />so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />old and so good, why was it never dis-<br />
cussed upon the floors of this House ;<br />
during that long term they had not dis-<br />
c<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overed</span> that we were such an
insignificant <br />
people and that our resources were so <br />
limited. On the contrary, they were con-<br />
tinually telling us that we had vast re-<br />sources, and were all right, both politi-<br />
cally and financially, and it was a favorite <br />
expression of one of the delegates. “that <br />
he had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an abiding</span> faith in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people." I</span> <br />
do not know exactly what he thinks of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that now. </span>When the late Government <br />
came into power ten <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> ago
this Pro- <br />
vince was really free <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> debt.
It was <br />
