which must shock the public mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<br />
this country and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the whole
world. <br />
(Hear, hear.) I must say of these two <br />
men, differing as I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> much
of their <br />
policy and many of their acts, that I be- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lieve</span> Mr. Lincoln, who has now
passed<br />
away, was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pure-minded</span> and
patriotic <br />
citizen of the United States—(hear)—and<br />
I will say of Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Seward</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> I deplore <br />

<br />
my friend Mr. Cartier, I will only observe<br />
that our object is not to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">weaken</span>
our ties <br />
with the mother country, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
put our-<br />

a great and growing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Colony.</span> <br />
(Cheers.) We are not coming to ask of <br />
the mother country to undertake a greater <br />
responsibility than that which has hitherto <br />
devolved upon her. On the contrary, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span>
<br />
are come to show that if this Confedera- <br />
tion be carried out, we shall be able to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assume </span>a greater <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsi</span>bility than that <br />
which has hitherto fallen upon Canada. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear.) </span> And let me add this, we
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feel</span> <br />
that the North American <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">colonies ought</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not only to be a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">support</span> to the mother <br />

there were and are difficulties ; but is it<br />
any disparagement to this cause that men<br />
are found who, seeing these difficulties,<br />
have determined to rise above them, and<br />
place these Colonies in such a position<br />
that they cannot occur again? The hon.<br />

bearing arms in time of trouble ; yet, <br />
when the Militia Bill was being discussed,<br />

the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accomplishment</span> of their

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">President</span> of the Council, and

they chose, and if the reports which
cir- <br />
culated were true, they did make offers of <br />
offices to aid them in their canvas. It <br />
has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been said</span>
that our roads, bridges and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">schools</span> would be in a worse
condition un- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">der </span>Confederation than now. But
look at <br />
the condition of the Province ; we have <br />
to pay now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£90,000</span>, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">besides</span> other sums <br />
annually to meet an interest here and at <br />
home ; under Confederation we should <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$200,000</span> beside the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$63,000</span> sub- <br />
sidy for ten years Export duty and Crown <br />
Lands annuity to nearly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$150,000,</span>
in all <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> than we have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now</span> for local purpo- <br />
ses ; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what,</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask,</span> will be our position <br />
now if the contemplated railways are car- <br />
ried on ? By the the Intercolonial Rail- <br />
way Act which was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adopted</span> in
1851, they <br />
agreed to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,000,000</span> for the
work, <br />of which we were to pay three-twelfths, <br />
which would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be $l,375,000.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">By the</span> Con- <br />
federation Scheme we should pay one-<br />
thirteenth, which makes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,153,846</span>, leav- <br />
ing a balance in favor of Confederation <br />
on this work alone of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3,221,153.</span>
The <br />
highest estimate of expenditure for Ca- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nals</span> is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$22,500,000,</span> which added to the <br />
cost of the railroad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$15,000,000</span>
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$37,-</span> <br />500,000. New Brunswick’s share of cost, <br />
one-thirteenth, equals <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2,884,615</span>
or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">490,384</span> less than the amount
assumed by <br />
our Act of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1861.</span> Thus it would
cost <br />
New Brunswick <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,490,384</span> less to
build <br />
the Canals and the Intercolonial Railway <br />
under Confederation, than it would cost <br />
us to build the railroad out of Confede- <br />
ration. I believe with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference</span>
to these <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canals</span> that they would be of
immense ad- <br />
vantage to us and that therefore we <br />
should be interested in the matter. We <br />
should be able to get our rivers improved <br />
and a Canal cut across from the Gulf to <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bay</span> of Fundy, with other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public</span> <br />
works. <br />

to our position with regard to Canada,<br />

I believe that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> have, and that we should <br />
encourage emigration so that the resour- <br />
ces of that great country might be deve- <br />
loped. Look at the Valley of the Sakat- <br />
chewan, one of the finest agricultural <br />
districts in the world, a valley 1,000 <br />
miles long and eighty wide, and capable of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supporting</span> an immense population.
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">No</span> <br />
