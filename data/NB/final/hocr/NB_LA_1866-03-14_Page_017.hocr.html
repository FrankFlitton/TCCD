<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">utterly</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong,</span> and there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scarcely</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though</span> it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposed</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put</span> an export duty <br />
on cotton and tobacco, because, they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span>
<br />
they are products in which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other</span>

the revenues <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Province

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The issue</span>
was of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> importance than <br />
any other issue that has ever been brought <br />
before the people. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complain</span>
that the
<br />
dissolution of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> the ques- <br />
tion of Confederation, last winter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span>
<br />
act of tyranny perpetrated by the advisers <br />
of His Excellency. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span>
had <br />
never been brought forward for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">con-</span>
<br />
sideration of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people—never</span>
been dis- <br />
cussed before Parliament, and according <br />
to the Constitution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thee people</span>
are here <br />
by their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives.</span> The
whole <br />
country was convulsed by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
election, <br />
which took place <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in midwinter,</span>
and in- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">volved</span> in its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">results</span> the independence, <br />
the rights and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">liberties</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people,</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> were to be surrendered up
by
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> to the rule of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span> of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">T</span>he dissolution was an act of<br />
base <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">injustice to</span> the people, as
many of <br />
them were engaged during the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">winter</span>
<br />
session <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in lumbering</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">operations.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span>n the <br />
County of Charlotte <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>
considerable por- <br />
tion of the population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> far
away in <br />
the wilderness <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engaged</span> in that
employ- <br />
ment, and it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was impossible</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> these <br />
people to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> at the polls. If
the day had <br />
happened to have been stormy, the aged <br />
people won, by their industry, have made <br />
this country what it is, would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span>
<br />
no opportunity of going to the polls, as <br />
many of them had to travel twenty or <br />
thirty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">giving</span> their vote upon <br />
this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> question. At the
election the <br />
people told the Government in a voice <br />
that could not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">misunderstood, that</span>
they<br />
had forfeited the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confidence</span> of
the people, <br />
and they had to tender their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resignation</span>
<br />
to His Excellency, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> a new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span> <br />
ment was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">formed the 1st</span> day of
April, <br />
and then some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the</span> members had
to
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">return to</span> their constituents for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-elec-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion.</span> Some of them were returned
only <br />
one or two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">days</span>
before the House met, <br />
and they had scarcely met <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forty-eight</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hours before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complaint</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <br />
we had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submitted no</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I appeal-</span> <br />
ed to the justice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this House,
and the <br />
reply was that we could not be expected <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have
measures</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared at</span> so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">short</span> a <br />
notice. We all know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the
Provincial <br />
Secretary, though he had been for some <br />
time in political life, was experienced, <br />
and had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> to prepare to
meet <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature,</span> as he was only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here two</span> days <br />
before the House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">me,;</span> which gave
him a <br />
very short time to prepare the estimates. <br />
We were compelled to call <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the
House <br />
together at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a time </span>when it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> incon- <br />
venient for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> to
leave <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> <br />
homes, and were<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anxious</span> to return. <br />
Those are the circumstances <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">under</span>
which <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> was formed, and
I think <br />
they justify us in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">calling</span> for
an
indulgent <br />
consideration and sympathy in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view</span>
of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> circumstances. It was the
duty of <br />
the Attorney General, now Judge Aller, <br />
to see what laws were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expiring, but</span>
he <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pressed</span> very much by the
duties <br />
which devolved upon him, and this Act <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">escaped his notice</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span>
have no desire <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sh</span>rink from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility,</span> for we <br />
are all liable for whatever act is commit- <br />
ted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by any</span> one member. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">We</span> all know <br />
that it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> human to err, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">" i</span>t is divine <br />
to forgive." I was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surprised</span> to
see the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">malicious joy,</span> the delight, which
seemed <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beam</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> the countenance of the <br />
learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mover of</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amendment,</span> when <br />
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated this</span> oversight. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ima-</span>
<br />
gine he embraces all the learning and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">policy</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in the</span> country. I do not intend to <br />
use <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> language which he did,
which I <br />
consider to be insulting. Was it right <br />
for him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> evince a satisfaction
yesterday <br />
when he thought this country would be <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue,</span> and he made up his mind at
once <br />
in favor of the Bill, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">first</span> he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knew of it was last</span> night. He was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ready</span> <br />
to render assistance that would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preclude</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">closely</span> into the motives of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> men who  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seek</span>
to oust the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">see</span> <br />
whether they are animated by a spirit of <br />
patriotism or not ; whether it is the good <br />
of the country they are seeking, or their <br />
own aggrandizement. When the hon. <br />

was returned to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House,
without ever <br />
leaving his office, for the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rose</span> om-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nipotent</span>
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> power to place him here, <br />
we know something of the agencies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">em-</span>
<br />
ployed to bring him here. An attack <br />
was made upon me ; it was represented to <br />
the people of the County of York that I <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their enemy,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that I </span>was anxious to <br />
remove <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seat</span> of Government. In<br />
corroboration of that it was said, he<br />
has taken <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Post Office </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">away,</span> and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> is the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">first step</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">towards</span> remov- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing the</span> seat of Government. It
was <br />
told them at the last general election, <br />
that by going for Confederation they <br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forever</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secu</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re</span>
the seat of Govern- <br />
ment at Fredericton. I will ask whether, <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debating</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a question</span> of so much import- <br />
ance to the people, it was proper and <br />
right to bring forward this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argument :</span>
"If <br />
you do not go into Confederation, the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seat</span> of Government is in peril." This <br />
great question should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussed</span>
on <br />
broad principles, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasons</span>
given why <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a charge</span> in our condition would
be for <br />
our good. We find the advocates of the <br />
Quebec scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying,</span> it is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beautiful</span> <br />
scheme, there is no darkness upon it all, <br />
and there are no reasons in the world why <br />
you should not go <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span>
Confederation. <br />
We were told by the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mover</span>
of the <br />
Amendment that he made certain <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objec-</span>
<br />
tions to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> in <br />
Quebec—that there were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceptions</span>
to <br />
it which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rig</span>ht. Did <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tell</span> the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there were <br />
exceptions to the scheme <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
they <br />
wanted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">submit</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exceptions</span>
to<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them ?</span> Did they say, do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span>
<br />
this Union until you have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fully</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consi-</span> <br />
dered it ? No. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Everything</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span>
<br />
in favor of it. It seemed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entered</span> <br />
upon this contest as paid lawyers advo- <br />
cating the interests of their clients all <br />
on one side without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">looking at the</span>
other <br />
at all. If the hon. mover of the Amend- <br />
ment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> seeking the beneﬁt of
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country, he</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would give</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> fair play ; <br />
that is all we ask. Give the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Secretary</span> <br />
an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opportunity</span> of presenting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> ac- <br />
counts <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> and I do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hesi-</span>
<br />
tate to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say they</span>
will be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">presented</span> in a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> that will give satisfaction to the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><br />
House, for he has made an improve- <br />
ment in the way in which the public <br />
accounts are kept. He can now show <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenues</span> are in a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prosperous</span> <br />
condition, and in consideration of his <br />
having been in the Legislature <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twelve</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years, and</span> never held a seat in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
Government, it would be no more than <br />
right that he should come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
House and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show</span> his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">account</span> of what he <br />
