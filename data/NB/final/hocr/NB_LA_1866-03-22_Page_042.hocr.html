<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Brunswick were the best judges of whe-<br />
ther Confederation was for their interest<br />
or not. It was not for the people of Ca-<br />
nada or the people of England, to tell<br />
them what was for their interest, but<br />
they would give due consideration to<br />
anything emanating from the Colonial<br />
Office. We are told that "union is<br />
strength." No one desies that ; but a<br />
union, to be strong, must have no discord-<br />
ant elements. In the abstract, he was in<br />
favor of union ; but if he disapproved of<br />
the grounds they went on, he would fight<br />
against it through thick and thin. He had<br />
heard them talk about loyalty. He could<br />
say that some of his ancestors had shed<br />
their blood under General Wolfe, at the<br />
taking of Quebec ; and if the time now<br />
came for a fight, and they got him in a<br />
corner, he would be found giving a kick<br />
for a kick, and a blow for a blow. The<br />
next charge brought against them was<br />
the President of the Council wished to <br />
remove the seat of Government. He <br />
then referred to the Journals of 1858 to<br />
show who voted for the removal of the<br />
seat of Government at the time.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. MCMILLAN said he had never,<br />
here or elsewhere, given as a reason for<br />
a vote of want of confidence, that they<br />
wished to remove the seat of Government.<br />
A charge was made against the mover of<br />
the amendment, that he had charged the<br />
President of the Council who doing away<br />
with the Post Office Department, was a<br />
first step towards the removal of the seat<br />
of Government. I said I stated last year<br />
in my place, when the subject was under<br />
consideration, that it was a first step to-<br />
wards doing away with Departmental and<br />
Responsible Government. I did not give<br />
a reason that I would go against the Gov-<br />
ernment because I opposed them upon<br />
that last year.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER said it was put forward<br />
in the County of York as a canvass<br />
against Mr. Pickard, that he was a sup-<br />
porter of Mr. Smith, who was going to<br />
remove the seat of Government. The<br />
hon. mover of the amendment had stated<br />
that he never stirred from his office, but<br />
he had canvassers who went through the<br />
country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER.—There never was a<br />
man went through the country by my <br />
directions.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER then slated that in one<br />
of the settlements of the County a gen-<br />
tleman, who was an ex-member of great<br />
ability and ingenuity, told the inhabitants<br />
in language that conveyed to their minds<br />
the impression that Mr. Smith intended to<br />
remove the Seat of Government. Ano-<br />
ther chrage is that they failed to discover<br />
that the Export Duty Law had expired ;<br />
all he would say in regard to this was,<br />
that it was the duty of the out-going Gov-<br />
ernment to communicate to an in-coming<br />
one every thing that concerns the inter-<br />
ests of the people or the business of the <br />
country. This was done in England. If<br />
the out-going Government knew of it,<br />
they should have told it, and if<br />
they did not know it, they were<span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”=""><br />
?</span> in the duty. Shortly af-<br />
<span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">? </span>here last
session, he had<br />
<span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">? </span>a rumour

in the Treasury now. They must consi-</p>
<hr />


















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">der the peculiar situation of the Govern-<br />
ment. They were running all those elec-<br />
tions in the month of March, and had<br />
many difficulties to contend with. Ano-<br />
ther ground of complaint is : they have<br />
been guilty of land jabbing. He thought<br />
if they had twenty such land jabbers as<br />
Mr. Gibson, the people of York would<br />
not complain, and he did not think the<br />
people fo the Spruce County of Resti-<br />
gouche would complain either. The late<br />
Government undertook to seel Mr. Gob-<br />
son 15,000 acres of land without condi-<br />
tions of actual settlement attached. Five<br />
thousand acres of this, Mr. Lindsay says,<br />
was applied for under ficticious names.<br />
He (Mr. Fraser) said they were all <span style="font-style: italic;">bona<br />
fide</span>
names<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY—If application is made</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">for land in one man's name, and another<br />
man gets the land, is it not using ficti-<br />
tious names?</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER—The whole lumbering<br />
business is done in that way. If the hon. <br />
member for Kent was to go to St. John<br />
to purchase molasses, and went to his<br />
friends and said, if I go and buy it, the<br />
dealer will take advantage of me, but if<br />
you go, he will not know who is buying<br />
it. They say the late Government did<br />
not undertake to sell the land. They or-<br />
dered a survery, and when a man gets an<br />
order to survey, he believes the Govern-<br />
ment is going to bring that land to sale.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The debate was then adjourned until<br />
to-morrow at 11 o'clock.</p>
















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. NEEDHAM called the attention<br />
of the House to a report in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Morning<br />
Telegraph</span>
of a speech made by him, in<br />
which this passage appears : "He states<br />
he was not surprised at the view taken<br />
by that 'great big toady.' Dr. Thompson,<br />
but it was no use for him 'or any other<br />
man' to try to stop the progress of every<br />
great political principle." He did not<br />
want to be misrepresented, for he did not<br />
make use of the words "great big toa-<br />
dy," nor the words that follow either. He<br />
believed it was not a misprint, but a mis-<br />
representation. He spoke this in the <br />
hearing of their paid reporter, in order<br />
that he should notice that he gave this a<br />
flat contradiction.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">House adjourned until 10 A. M. to-mor-<br />
row.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T. P. D.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">THURSDAY, MARCH 22.</p>






<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The House, moved by Mr. Anglin, went<br />
into Committee of the Whole (Mr. Scovil<br />
in the Chair) on a Bill for the purpose of<br />
winding up the affaird of the Caledonia<br />
Mining and Manufacturing Company.<br />
Bill passed without discussion or amend-<br />
ment.</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">At eleven the adjourned debate on the<br />
amendment to the 4th paragraph in the<br />
address, was taken up.</p>











<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER resumed his speech<br />
from yesterday afternoon. He said that <br />
there was the charged of which the House<br />
was <span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">? </span> Government<br />
and it was a very <span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">? </span> subject <span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">?<br />

?</span><br />
felt bound to say that the Government<br />
could not have appointed Judge Wilmot</p>
<hr />


















































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">to the position of Chief Justice and done<br />
justice to themselves. The hon. member<br />
of York (Mr. Fisher) said that there was<br />
no great political excitement at the time<br />
Judge Wilmot addressed the Grand Jury<br />
in Fredericton on the subject of Confede-<br />
ration. He wished to show that the poli-<br />
cal excitement was running very high at<br />
the time. The coutnry was agitated on<br />
the question of the Quebec Scheme. Mr.<br />
Fisher himself, who was the first who be-<br />
gan the discussion, he spoken in Carle-<br />
ton ; he was followed by his friend Mr. <br />
Needham. Mr. Tilley and Mr. Gray<br />
not long afterwards repeatedly addressed<br />
crowded audiences in the Mechanics In-<br />
stitute, St. John, and in Carleton. The<br />
excitement throughout the country was,<br />
there could be no doubt, running high. A<br />
keen political contest was looked forward<br />
to, for it was pretty well understood that<br />
the Governor was going to dissolve the<br />
House. It was amidst all this excite-<br />
ment that Judge Wilmot addressed the<br />
Grand Jury in Fredericton. His hon.<br />
colleague (Mr. Fisher) said that it was a<br />
common practice for Judges in their ad-<br />
dresses to speak on the topice of the day,<br />
and he had pointed to a precedent in the <br />
case of the late Chief Justice Parker.<br />
But there was a great difference between<br />
Judge Parker addressing a Jury on a<br />
School Law, and that of Judge Wilmot<br />
speaking with all the judicial authority of<br />
the Bench on a question affecting the very<br />
constitution of the coutnry. He denied<br />
his right to throw himself into the politi-<br />
cal excitement of the time, and his say-<br />
ing that he would, in case it was neces-<br />
sary to carry the Scheme of Confedera-<br />
tion, resign his seat up on the Bench and<br />
contest the County of York, was sufficient<br />
to condemn him in his mind. Further<br />
than that, Judge Wilmot voted against<br />
the Government of the day. If he (Judge<br />
W. chose to mix himself up with the po-<br />
litics of the day, he must as men i nthe
hum-<br />
bler situations of public trust, take the<br />
consequences : considering his position, <br />
he was bound to preserve a dignified<br />
silence.</p>


































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Fraser then proceeded to speak on<br />
the charge against the Government for<br />
not fillinf up the office of Auditor Gene-<br />
ral, and referred to the late Auditor Gen-<br />
eral, a gentleman who was well known to<br />
be a great financier, but equally well<br />
known for several years before his death<br />
to be incapable to discharge the duties of<br />
his offie. He was not pleased, he con-<br />
fessed, that the Government had filled up<br />
that office before this time, but was he to<br />
turn round, because they had not done so,<br />
and oppose them, and help probably to<br />
being in a Government that would inflict<br />
the Quebec Scheme upon the country. But<br />
he would say that as far as the business<br />
of the Audit Office was concerned, he had<br />
no fault to find with the Government. He<br />
never knew the public accounts to be pre-<br />
sented in such a clear, plain, mercantile<br />
manner as they had been this year. With<br />
regard to the Solicitor Generalship. As<br />
far as he himself was consulted in the<br />
Crown business, he had given good ad-<br />
vice, that is, in <span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">? </span> judgment, <span class="unclear" title="“illegible" text”="">? </span><br />
