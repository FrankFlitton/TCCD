<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Quebec Scheme, in all its original enor- <br />
mity would be forced upon the country. <br />
He believed, sure as the needle pointed <br />
to pole, that that would happen. Let <br />
hon. members consider the pressure that <br />
has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> brought upon the
Government <br />
to break them down. They have had the <br />
pressure of the Canadian politicians<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> them, and the Imperial
inﬂuence <br />
of the British Government, and inﬂuence <br />
from Nova Scotia. They have had the <br />
inﬂuence against them of lecturers<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> and
<br />
trading politicians, who, through the<br />
length and breadth of the Province have<br />
been disseminating poisonous stories<br />
against the Government, and attesting<br />
that a dissolution was sure to take place ;<br />
and almost the entire Press of the Pro-<br />
vince had been against them, vilifying and<br />
denouncing them. He had no doubt that <br />
the member of York (Mr. Fisher) was in <br />
constant communication with Canadian<br />
statesmen in favor of the Quebec Scheme. <br />
He saw several gentlemen in the House <br />
who were in favor of Union—taking it as<br />
a broad question. But he would ask were<br />
there ten members in the House in favor<br />
of the Quebec Scheme ? Let these gen-<br />
tlemen who were in favor of the general<br />
principle consider well before they cast<br />
their influence against the Government.<br />
They were told that the Quebec Scheme <br />
could be altered. When that was said <br />
let them harken to the testimony of the<br />
Canadian statesmen who had given birth<br />
to the scheme. Not a single letter could<br />
be altered.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Let them listen in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">testimony</span> of the <br />
Hon. D'Arey McGee :<br />

and with propriety, and the result of our<br />
proceedings is the document that has been<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">submitted to the Imperial Government,<br />
as well as to this House, and which we<br />
speak of now, as a treaty. And that there<br />
may be no doubt about our position in re-<br />
gard to that document, we say question<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">if you may, but alter it, you may not.<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hear,</span> hear.) It is beyond your

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">alter without desiring to throw out the<br />

friends who have already spoken for one<br />
party to alter a treaty, is of course to de-<br />
stroy it. Let us be frank with each other ;<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Let him call up the Hon. J. A. McDon-<br />
ald, a man who stands very high in Cana-<br />
da, and let them listen to what he said:<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">" We present it not in the precise shape<br />
we in Canada would desire it, but as in the<br />
best shape the five Colonies to be united<br />
could agree upon it. We present it in the<br />
form in whichthe five Governments have<br />
severally adopted it—in the form the Im-<br />
perial Government has endorsed it—and<br />
in the form in which we believe all the<br />
Legislatures of the Provinces will accept<br />
it. We ask the House to pass it in the<br />
EXACT form in which we have presented,<br />
for we know not how alterations may af-<br />
fect its safety in other places, and the pro-<br />
cess of alteration once commenced in four<br />
different Legislatures, who can tell where<br />
that would end "</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">From the mouth of these witnesses let</p>
<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">them judge what truth there was in the<br />
statement that the scheme could be alter-<br />
ed. If the Government were defeated be<br />
would tell them again—and another Go-<br />
vernment formed with the hon. member<br />
of York at its head—the Quebec Scheme<br />
would be carried letter by letter, line by<br />
line. There were gentlemen here in fa-<br />
vor of Union, and he would say that if<br />
they could get a Union on a fair and equit-<br />
able basis, such as would advance the in-<br />
terests of the country, it might be a ques-<br />
tion whether it would not be prudent to<br />
adopt it. He would say that the Govern-<br />
ment were prepared to renew negotiations<br />
with Canada and the other Provinces at<br />
any conference that might be called to-<br />
gether ; but not in any event to agree to<br />
the Quebec scheme. The member of<br />
York had spoken of British statesmen,<br />
and of their being listened to as superi-<br />
ors speaking to inferiors. He did not like<br />
the spirit of the remark of the hon. gen-<br />
tleman. It was not doing justice to them-<br />
selves or to their country. He had great<br />
respect for their ability, their acquire-<br />
ments and their superior culture. When<br />
they said that this Confederation Scheme<br />
would advance the interests of this coun-<br />
try—while he had much respect for their<br />
opinion—still he thought on a question<br />
affecting their own interests, men with<br />
practical judgment and common sense<br />
were the best judges ; and on this ques-<br />
tion of Confederation they respectfully<br />
differed.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Attorney General then pro-<br />
ceeded to speak of the stories repeated<br />
by the member of York, (Mr. F.) that the<br />
present Chief Justice Ritchie had <span class="unclear" title="“word" is="" unclear”="">?</span>ed<br />
with him ( Atty Gen.) If there was any<br />
one thing, he proceeded to say, that it was<br />
necessary to maintain, it was the purity of<br />
the Bench. The ermine should be kept<br />
spotless. The people should look up<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">with respect to those who files high po-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sitions, especially those who had the<br />
guardianship of their lives and properties.<br />
Up to the present time politics had never<br />
entered into a court of justice. He put<br />
it to the House if they were prepared to<br />
justify the member of York in dragging<br />
in the name of Judge Ritchie, and repeat-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing the stories set afloat that he had
ca-<br />
balled with him (Att'y Gen.) a year ago<br />
upon the position of Chief Justice. A <br />
year ago he was not in the Government.<br />
When the present Government did come<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into power, and the resignation of the<br />
Chief Justice was spoken of, was it not<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood that it Sir James Carter did<br />
resign that position should be given<br />
to Judge Robert Parker. Would the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country have justified any other ap-<br />
pointment than that of that justly rever-<br />
ed Judge, of whome he would repeat,<br />
what he had said before, that take him<br />
for all and all he was the best man he<br />
ever knew. When the member of York<br />
knew that, how could he justify himself<br />
when he said that Judge Ritchie had <br />
caballed with him (Att'y Gen.). He<br />
was not going to deprecate Judge Wil-<br />
mot ; he was not going to say that he<br />
was not a great and distinguished priest ;<br />
but he would say, when Judge Wilmot—<br />
when a great question was agitating<br />
the country from its centre to its circum-<br />
ference—upon the Bench determined<br />
against and denounced men who oppos-<br />
ed the Quebec Scheme, and lauded to<br />
the skies those who frame it, he laid<br />
himself open to remark ; he forgot the<br />
duty imposed upon him by his position ;<br />
he dragged the ermine in the mire. He<br />
heard it was said that Judge Wilmot de-<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<hr />
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">livered, from the Bench, a speech on<br />Confederation in Sunbury, and the peo-<br />ple in the Court applauded him. (Mr.<br />Glazier—they did not). He heard it<br />so stated, and he must believe it. They<br />let Judge Wilmot speak on any<br />subject, and he grained the irresistable<br />applause of his audience. Now, if the<br />people cheered him when he spoke from<br />the Bench, must they not come to the<br />conclusion, if people have a right to ap-<br />plaud him they have an equal right to<br />hiss him. They could not deny that.<br />Then what became of the respect and<br />dignity of the Bench ? He would like<br />
to see one of the Judges in England act<br />in that manner. He would like to see<br />an English Judge throw himself into the<br />discussion on the Reform Bill, and even<br />
that would be more excusable than the<br />
ease of Judge Wilmot. He would ask<br />
the House if it was ever known here<br />that a Judge took part in polities. Had<br />the member of York hown an instance<br />when a Judge went to the hustings.<br />He would ask him to point to a case<br />
when a Judge had ever voted ? The<br />
fact that Judges had never voted was<br />conclusive in his mind against Judge<br />Wilmot. While a Judge (he went on<br />to say) might speak on political sub-<br />jects, and express his views in conver-<br />sation at the social table, he has no<br />right to declaim from the Bench. The<br />Government had been charged with do-<br />ing a great wrong for not appointing<br />
Judge Wilmot Chief Justice. But he<br />thought Judge Wilmot had acted im-<br />prudently, and not in a manner that met<br />the approbation of the country. He<br />thought that no man would deny that<br />the late Chief Justice Robert Parker's<br />judgment on the Judge best qualified to<br />be successor was entitled to respect.<br />Chief Justice Parker would not have<br />taken the office if he had not known that<br />
Judge Ritchie should succeed him. He<br />
did not ask the House to believe him at<br />his word, for he had the written record<br />in proof that what he said was true. It<br />was stated that in the appointment<br />seniority prevailed. But it was not true<br />that the oldest Judges were always ap-<br />
pointed. In the majority of cases in<br />
this Province the junior Judge had been<br />
appointed over the senior, and if seni-<br />ority prevailed Judge Neville Parker<br />had the right. He would not draw in-<br />vidious distinctions between Judge<br />Ritchie and Judge Wilmot, but he would<br />say that public opinion would justify the<br />appointment of Judge Ritche, and the<br />country had the testimony of the late.<br />
Robert Parker that he was the right man<br />in the right place ; would not that testi-<br />
mony satisfy the murmurs of dissatis-<br />
faction.<br />
