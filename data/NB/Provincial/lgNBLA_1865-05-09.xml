<!-- GL, 2018-02-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

 <!--<p>
     fact that this Bill was to come before the   
     <lb/>House was well known, and if any party<lb/>felt aggrieved, they had none but them<lb break="no"/>selves to blame, although he was sure Mr.<lb/>Gibson would be willing to allow an<lb/>amendment next Session if it was found<lb/>to bear heavily on any party on the<lb/>stream.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Smith said he had looked <lb/>over the Bill, and although it was grant<lb break="no"/>ing extraordinary privileges to this gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, yet he found it properly guarded.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
    

    

            <p>
         Bill was agreed to.      
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Boyd moved the House into Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of the Whole on a Bill to provide<lb/>for the expenses of Grand Jurors.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Progress reported. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Hill moved the House into Com- <lb/>mittee of the Whole on a Bill to provide<lb/>for the Incorporation of the Saint Croix<lb/>Bridge Company. Mr. Cudlip in the<lb/>Chair.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Bill agreed to. <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    
   
            <p>
         Mr. Kerr wished to bring under the     
     <lb/>notice of the House the decease of the<lb/>Hon. J. A. Street, who died in St. John<lb/>on Wednesday last, and that his remains<lb/>are to be removed to this city for inter<lb break="no"/>ment tomorrow. Remembering the time<lb/>he occupied a prominent position in the<lb/>House - some fifty-three years - he would<lb/>move the following resolution :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>  Whereas, This House have learned that    
     <lb/>the Hon. John Ambrose Street, for twenty-<lb break="yes"/>three years a member of this House, died in<lb/>the City of Saint John on Wednesday, the<lb/>3d inst., and that his remains will be in<lb break="no"/>terred in this City on Saturday the 6th<lb/>instant ;<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    And Whereas, That lamented gentle- <lb/>man held the office of Attorney General,<lb/>and a seat in the Executive Council of<lb/>this Province for several years, and dis<lb break="no"/>charged the important duties which de<lb break="no"/>volved upon him with great zeal and in<lb break="no"/>tegrity, and deservedly gained the esteem<lb/>and confidence of the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, therefore<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Resolved, That as a tribute of respect <lb/>for the memory of the deceased, this<lb/>House do adjourn, to meet on Monday<lb/>morning at 9 o'clock.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    The Resolution was seconded by Mr. <lb/>Connell, who paid a just tribute of respect<lb/>to the memory of the deceased gentle<lb break="no"/>man.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Caie, Chairman of the Scrutiny <lb/>Committee, came before the House and<lb/>reported that they had met, and begged<lb/>to ask leave of the House to adjourn to<lb/>sit again on Friday next, the 12th inst.,<lb/>at 11 a.m.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Kerr's resolution was then put, <lb/>and the House adjourned to meet on<lb/>Monday morning at 9 a.m.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    J. M. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Monday, May 8. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Col. Boyd, by leave, brought in a Bill <lb/>relating to the Charlotte County Bank.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. McMillan said that in the official <lb/>report of the second day's proceedings of<lb/>this House, he had been reported to have<lb/>said that " he had the utmost confidence<lb/>in the present Government." He would<lb/>wish to have this corrected, as he did not<lb/>say it.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    

    
   
            <p>
         Mr. Williston presented a petition           
     <lb/>praying for a reduction in the Fees for<lb/>Marriage Licenses, and for shortening the<lb/>time required for the publication of the<lb/>Banns of Marriage.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>     Col. Boyd moved that the House go into<lb/>Committe on the further consideration of<lb/>a Bill for the payment of Grand Jurors.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Kerr said that there was a very <lb/>important principle involved in this Bill,<lb/>and it would be a serious burden upon<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     
     
     
     the revenues of the country, therefore it  
     <lb/>should be discussed in a full house, and<lb/>not now, as there were only seventeen <lb/>members present.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Hon. Mr. Botsford was of the same        
     <lb/>opinion. He knew of no country in which<lb/>Grand Juries were paid, and they should<lb/>not discuss the question now when the<lb/>members from St. John, Queen's, Carleton<lb/>and Kent were absent.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Col. Boyd said that he was anxious to      
     <lb/>get on with the business as fast as possi<lb break="no"/>ble ; but in consideration of the absence<lb/>of so many members he would withdraw<lb/>the motion.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
         Mr. Gilbert had seen it reported in the  
     <lb/>newspapers that there were two door<lb/>keepers employed by the House, and he<lb/>would ask the hon. Chief Commissioner<lb/>if it was true.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
          Hon. Mr. Hatheway replied that it      
     <lb/>was the usual practice to put questions to<lb/>the Government in writing, and they<lb/>would answer next morning ; but he would<lb/>say now, that it is a matter with which<lb/>the Government has nothing to do, and<lb/>he had no more right to answer that<lb/>question than Mr. Gilbert had.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

            <p>
     
     
         Col. Boyd said there were two door   
     <lb/>keepers here who expect to get their pay.<lb/>Some person must have ordered the se<lb break="no"/>cond door keeper to come, and they<lb/>should know who it was, so as to have<lb/>the matter settled.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Sutton said that one door keeper <lb/>had nothing to do but keep the door shut<lb/>while prayers were said, and the other<lb/>employed his time sitting on the sofa. <lb break="no"/>He might sit there as long as he liked, but<lb/>he, (Mr. Sutton) would raise his voice<lb/>against paying him for it. While he was<lb/>up he would ask the Chief Commissioner<lb/>of the Board of Works when he intended<lb/>to bring in his Report ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Hatheway then laid before <lb/>the House the " Report of the Proceed<lb break="no"/>ings of the Board of Works," and observ<lb break="no"/>ed that the report was not complete, but<lb/>he had brought before the House the<lb/>most important part at as early a day as<lb/>he possibly could. He would also say to<lb/>the House that the list of "Surveyors"<lb/>throughout the Province would be made<lb/>up this week ; and any complaints to be<lb/>made in regard to them must be made<lb/>during that time. He would further<lb/>state that he had no power to make any<lb/>change, however trifling, without first sub<lb break="no"/>mitting it to the Council.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Williston gave notce of a motion <lb/>on Thursday, praying his Excellency to<lb/>lay before the House all correspondence<lb/>and information relating to the employ<lb break="no"/>ment of Professor Hind as Geologist in<lb/>this Province.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    
   
            <p>
         Mr. Otty brought in a petition, to re-  
     <lb/>peal the " Act" making Sussex the Shire<lb/>Town of Kings, and praying that it may<lb/>be established at Ossekeag instead.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
         Col. Boyd brought in a Bill to prevent       
     <lb/>fraud in the sale of coal.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    On motion of Mr. Mehan the Bill be<lb break="no"/>fore the House relating to the Coast and<lb/>River Fisheries was referred to a Commit<lb break="no"/>tee.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
         On motion of Mr. Costigan the Bill   
     <lb/>before the House relating to imprison<lb break="no"/>ment for debt was referred to a Select<lb/>Committee.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    On motion of Mr. Otty a petition re- <lb/>lating to a Bridge to be built across Ham<lb break="no"/>mond River, in the Parish of Upham, was<lb/>received and referred to the Board of<lb/>Works.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Williston asked if it was the in<lb break="no"/>tention of the Government to make pro<lb break="no"/>vision in the estimates for a steamer on<lb/>the North Shore.<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Hatheway replied that it <lb/>was the intention of the Government to<lb/>do so. Tenders will be received until the<lb/>15th of May. They had received one<lb/>Tender and expected several more, and<lb/>the prospect of securing a steamer was<lb/>much fairer than it had ever been. Whe<lb break="no"/>ther the amount of money appropriated<lb/>in the estimates for that purpose is suffi<lb break="no"/>cient, is a question which can be discuss<lb break="no"/>ed when it comes up.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Williston wished to know whether <lb/>the Government recognized the office of<lb/>Police Magistrate on the European and<lb/>North American Railway, and whether<lb/>he received a salary from the earnings of<lb/>the road.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Hatheway said that he found <lb/>by reference to the files of the Clerk of the<lb/>Executive Council, that the Government<lb/>paid no money to the Police Magistrate<lb/>for the last twelve or sixteen months.<lb/>The late Government held that he was in<lb break="no"/>debted to the Province, instead of they<lb/>to him, and he (Mr. H.) thought that all<lb/>future Governments would come to the<lb/>same conclusion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. McClellan asked whether it was <lb/>the intention of the Government to bring<lb/>forward any of the measures foreshadow<lb break="no"/>ed in the Speech, or whether they were<lb/>to remain shadows without a substance.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Hatheway said that the hon. <lb/>member for Albert knew that the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary had fourteen days from the opening<lb/>of the House to lay before them his esti<lb/>mates, and according to a rule of the<lb/>House, the Government must allow the<lb/>public fourteen days to send in petitions.<lb/>The Secretary has been ready these two<lb/>days, and probably the estimates will be<lb/>laid before you tomorrow. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment wil be ready with their measures at<lb/>an early day.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Botsford said that an im- <lb/>portant measure had already been laid<lb/>before the House, and they were ready to<lb/>go on with the Post Office Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    House adjourned until 9 o'clock to<lb break="no"/>morrow.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    T.P.D. <lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:right">Tuesday, May 9.
            </head>

            <p>    The Speaker called the attention of <lb/>the House to a Bill relating to the Char<lb break="no"/>lotte County Bank, introduced by Mr.<lb/>Boyd yesterday. As it partook of a local<lb/>character, the Bill came under the rule<lb/>and could not be received.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Boyd said in that case he should <lb/>pursue the usual course, and he therefore<lb/>moved that the rule be suspended.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Hon. Mr. Allen said, that although <lb/>the Bill was of a somewhat public charac<lb break="no"/>ter, yet no harm could arise from its<lb/>lying over till the people were fully no<lb break="no"/>tified of the intention of the Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Cudlip thought the rule should be <lb/>suspended and the Bill be allowed to<lb/>come in. Till the affairs of the Bank are<lb/>fully wound up the people will not feel<lb/>justified in entering into new arrange<lb break="no"/>ments for the opening of another Bank.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Kerr said the Bank could carry <lb/>out their designs without the passage of<lb/>such a Bill as this. Its object is to legis<lb break="no"/>late away the rights of certain parties<lb/>holding notes on the Bank. They could,<lb/>if they choose, close down their business<lb/>under the Act without further legislation.<lb/>He believed that a bank note, payable on<lb/>demand, should be held to be good till<lb/>the demand was made. He thought the<lb/>Bill a local one.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. Thompson said full notice of the <lb/>winding up of the affairs of the Bank had<lb/>been given. The object of the Bill was<lb/>to allow shareholders to sell certain lands<lb/>

     they held and divide the proceeds among 
     <lb/>them. They would thus receive a benefit<lb/>that would not otherwise be made avail<lb break="no"/>able. The passage of the Bill would<lb/>benefit the few interested and injure no<lb/>one. The people are desirous the affairs<lb/>should be closed down, so that another<lb/>can be established there, as now they have<lb/>
    to send to a distance, which is very in<lb break="no"/>convenient. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName> said it was a principle<lb/>laid down with regard to all engagements, 
     <lb/>that unless the demand were made within<lb/>a certain time, the claim became void.<lb/>And so with regard to this Bank, unless 
     <lb/>the notes now out should be handed in<lb/>within a limited period, the Bank should<lb/>not be liable. As the Bill was of a pub<lb break="no"/>lic, as well as of a private nature, he was<lb/>favorable to the suspension of the rule. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. Anglin</persName> said several of his 
     <lb/>constituents were interested in the Bank<lb/>and were desirous the affairs should be<lb/>wound up  ; still he thought that time for 
     <lb/>the publication of the Bill should be given. 
     <lb/>The shareholders complain that their 
     <lb/>property is being squandered by the keep<lb break="no"/>ing open of an office in St. Andrews.<lb/>The Bill should be submitted to a Select<lb/>Committee to provide such safeguards as<lb/>will secure the interests of the stock<lb break="no"/>holders. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName> said :—To my mind the<lb/>interests of the new settlers, and the means<lb/>taken by the Legislature to promote these<lb/>Interests, are of great importance. I in<lb break="no"/>tended to have submitted these resolu<lb break="no"/>tions to the late Parliment, but its disso<lb break="no"/>lution prevented. I now submit them to<lb/>this new House. Looking at the industrial<lb/>resources of the country, gradually on the<lb/>wane, and seeing the people who have al<lb break="no"/>most exclusively devoted themselves to<lb/>the lumbering and shipbuilding interests<lb/>suffering from their prostration, laboring<lb/>with little or no prospect of a return com<lb break="no"/>mensurate with their labour. Seeing all<lb/>this, it is time the Legislature turn its at<lb break="no"/>tention to that branch on which the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince must chiefly depend for its prosperi<lb break="no"/>ty. I refer to its agricultural resources.<lb/>We must not lose sight of the necessity<lb/>that exists for the opening up of the <lb/>waste lands of our Province. By this<lb/>means we shall increase our population<lb/>and add to our revenue. The present<lb/>system is most objectionable, as it allows<lb/>a settler to go where he chooses, but pro<lb break="no"/>vides no roads by which he can get to his<lb/>land. This, we know, discourages him,<lb/>and he leaves the Province for another<lb/>home. If the Government would lay off<lb/>
        

<cb/>

lands in townships, and make roads<lb/>through them, new settlers would not have<lb/>this source of discouragement to contend<lb/>with. I now know many cases where a<lb/>man who has settled in the backwoods has<lb/>to carry his seed wheat and whatever else<lb/>he needs from the settlement to the place<lb/>where he lives, on his back. This is very<lb/>hard. The country here is not an open<lb/>one, as in Western Canada, but is covered<lb/>with heavy timber ; and I contend that it<lb/>is not a sound policy that a new settler<lb/>should have to spend his labor in grub<lb break="no"/>bing up stumps on the roads when all his<lb/>exertions should be put forth to clear<lb/>this growth of timber from his lands. Our<lb/>climate is healthy, our soil is fertile, and<lb/>so far as we can compete with other parts of<lb/>this continent ; but on account of the<lb/>thick growth of timber a settler cannot<lb/>get as quick a return for his labor as in<lb/>many other places on this continent. In<lb/>Upper Canada, the inducements are much<lb/>greater than here. What we want is a pop<lb break="no"/>ulation. It is this that has developed the United<lb/>States. Their prosperity is attributable<lb/>to the large immigration which they have<lb/>received. It is a subject of importance<lb/>that we offer inducements to settlers to<lb/>come here, and at the end of say five<lb/>years, to give them a free grant. When a<lb/>man has lived five years in a place he be<lb break="no"/>comes attached to it, and does not want<lb/>to leave.During that time, it may be, he<lb/>has raised a family, which, the more it in<lb break="no"/>creases, the more dutiable articles they<lb/>consume, which produces a return to the<lb/>revenues of the country. My idea is to<lb/>lay off say five or ten thousand acres of<lb/>land a year, to make free grants of alter<lb break="no"/>nate lots, and to make roads through<lb/>them. By this means the people will be<lb/>able to get hold of those large blocks of<lb/>land which now are held by speculators<lb/>in lumber, or reduce the price on them so<lb/>that new settlers can compete with them.<lb/>I hope this matter will be taken up by<lb/>the Government—a Government I expect<lb/>a great deal from—during the recess, and<lb/>that some provision will be made for it.—<lb/>If something of this kind be done, we<lb/>shall be able to get emigrants not only<lb/>from England and Ireland, but also from<lb/>the North of Europe who, knowing that<lb/>we possess a healthy climate, a fertile<lb/>soil, and that they will receive free grants<lb/>of land, and have roads made at the pub<lb break="no"/>lic expense, will be willing to come here.<lb/>All then required will be that the benefits<lb/>to be enjoyed here are made known. This<lb/>system has been adopted in Lower Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and is to be in Upper Canada. We<lb/>should act so as to come into competition<lb/>with them. We cannot expect to have<lb/>wealth without labor, nor labor without<lb/>population, nor population without induce<lb break="no"/>ments. I trust this matter will receive that<lb/>attention at the hands of the Government<lb/>that it demands.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName>.—It is my intention to<lb/>move the House into Committee on a re<lb break="no"/>solution for the saving of large sums to<lb/>the public revenues.
