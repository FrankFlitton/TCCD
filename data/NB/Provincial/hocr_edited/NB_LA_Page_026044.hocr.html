statements. As manager of one of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> City <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">papers, I had to follow them day</span> <br />
after day, and it was a very onerous duty,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
in all their wanderings and contradictory<br />
statements. They told the people that <br />
all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneﬁt</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> to be ours, and Cana- <br />
da was going to confer the greatest boons <br />
of us. But it so happened that about <br />
that time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Galt, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Finance Minister <br />
of Canada, addressed some of his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on the subject,</span> and it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">published in</span> <br />
pamphlet form. By <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mere</span> accident
I ob- <br />
tained a copy, and there I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found</span>
Mr. Galt <br />
making the very same statement, namely, <br />
that Canada was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> get all the
beneﬁt, <br />
and he was right, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whilst</span> our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span><br />
were wrong. Our tariffs were to be as-<br />
simulated, and we were to become one <br />
great nation with liberty to trade from the <br />
Atlantic to Lake Huron. I will now go<br />
into a short statement which, altho' I have<br />
not the exact <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁgures</span> before me,
are suffi- <br />
ciently near to prove the inaccuracies of <br />
the statement made by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> hon.
member <br />
from Restigouche. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1863</span> Canada
had <br />
a debt of over a million of dollars. We <br />
were to have a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span>
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194</span><br />
members, and all its operations were to<br />
be carried on without any more expense <br />
than at present. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">number</span> of
mem-<br />
bers increased from 41 to 194<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—a</span>
hovel <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exchanged</span> for a palace—a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> British <br />
North American Nationalty—and all at <br />
the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expense</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">now.</span> Then there <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> the eighty cents a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head.</span> Now this <br />
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a paltry</span> sum to us, but I ﬁnd
that to <br />
the Canadians it would be more then their <br />
expenditure by about a million of dollars. <br />
This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">added</span> to the debt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">makes</span> $2 000,000. <br />
This amount would have to be made up <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">excess</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our own</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenues.</span>
In addi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion</span> to this there was to be a
largely in- <br />
creased expense for militia. The whole <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> were to be armed and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put in</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>
<br />
complete state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defence at</span> a
cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1,-</span> <br />
000,000. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> the sum put
forth in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia</span> and New Brunswick <br />
as the cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">putting</span> us in a
complete <br />
state to defend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ourselves</span>
against the Uni- <br />
ted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States,</span> and it only met with
deserved <br />
ridicule. Then there was our revenue <br />
another milllion, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that makes</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$4,000.-</span> <br />
000, without <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">providing</span> for their
extended <br />
works, canals, &amp;c., <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
were as much <br />
a part of the Scheme as anything <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">else.</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> yet in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view</span> of all this we had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-</span> <br />
men who came before the public and sta- <br />
ted that our expenditure was to bo redu- <br />
ced. The taxation was to be lowered <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$2</span>
75 ; I am happy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to say</span> that <br />
our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people refused</span> to be
humbugged by <br />
such a statement. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> one
of the <br />
misrepresentations. Mr. Galt took the <br />
same ground, and it was doubtless <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pre-</span>
<br />
pared by him. He told the Canadians <br />
that the Canadian tariff would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be enough</span>
<br />
to meet all the expenses, that we should <br />
have to bear <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">2<span class="unclear" title="unsure how to enter the 1/2">?</span></span> per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent</span> more, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> <br />
Scotia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">7<span class="unclear" title="unsure how toenter the 1/2">?</span></span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per</span> cent more. There the <br />
Canadian tariff was to be lowered to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">17<span class="unclear" title="unsure what to enter for 1/2">?</span></span>
<br />
per cent, and thus all was to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assimula-</span>
<br />
ted. The hon. ex-Surveyor General did <br />
not take into consideration what the effect <br />
of the increase of our tariff would be. <br />
Why it would give us an increase of duty <br />
on tea, excise duties, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stamp</span>
act. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Applying the tariff of Canada to ours we</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> have to pay <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$250,000.</span> The hon. <br />
Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tilley</span> tried to controvert
my state- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment</span> when I made it, and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated that</span> <br />
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$211,000.</span> With a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff of</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">twenty</span> per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent</span> in Canada they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay</span> less <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">per head</span> than we do. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">went</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span> <br />
account of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dutiable</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">articles, and it was</span> <br />

misrepresentations. Since 1863 the Cana-<br />
dians have had to impose a much higher<br />
tariff, and yet in spite of all, their deficit<br />
is larger than ever before. This was the<br />
people we were asked to unite with to be-<br />
come prosperous. The hon. member says<br />
that they were to assume the interest of<br />
our debt, but then they were also to take<br />
all our revenues except our Crown Lands.<br />
They too were to take the liability of all<br />
our Railway works under the Facility<br />
Bill, and well they might, for they never<br />
imagined it would amount to anything.<br />
and knew that nothing would ever have<br />
been paid. With regard to the eighty<br />
cents a head, it is well known that in-<br />
crease as we may, we could never get any<br />
more. The hon. gentleman argues that<br />
we can't have the Railway without Con-<br />
federation, when I have shown that we<br />
should have had about $80,000 more for<br />
public works without it than we could get<br />
in it. </p>

flicting with that port on the one hand<br />
and with Halifax on the other, what a<br />
contemptible position we should be in.<br />
Talk about our fifteen members being<br />
able to do anything ; they could do just<br />
nothing at all. See how it is in Cana-<br />
da now. The difficulties existing there<br />
were no doubt the bottom of the whole<br />
Scheme, they hoping that these difficulties<br />
would be forgot in a larger Union ; and<br />
when Mr. Brown crossed the floors of the<br />
House and joined with Mr. Cartier, he<br />
did it to bring about a great political<br />
change, and that was to crush out the<br />
spirit of Lower Canada. This much for<br />
the financial and political points ; now<br />
for the commercial aspect. I know that<br />
one of the greatest difficulties we had to<br />
combat in St. John was the argument<br />
that the markets of all Canada would be<br />
open to our manufacturers. The parties<br />
who were manipulating this affair got up<br />
a manifesto of the manufacturers, which<br />
was not prepared by a manufacturer, and<br />
by dint of getting it sent round by some<br />
dry goods clerks in the rain, they man-<br />
aged to get ninety-one names to it. Of<br />
those on the list some were bakers, who<br />
it was presumed, would be able to get<br />
their wheat down from Canada, manufac-<br />
ture into hot rolls, and send them back to<br />
Canada for sale.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—tombstone makers. (a<br />

ters, one was a lumber dealer, who sur-<br />
veys and looks after logs on the river St.<br />
John ; one was a mason, and one whose<br />
name was down twice, in all ninety-one<br />
men. So this argument did not avail<br />
much. Mr. Lawrence delivered one of<br />
the most able lectures on the subject, and<br />
quite clearly showed the absurdity of<br />
people imagining that the Canadiens were<br />
such fools and dolts that they could neither<br />
make anything, nor imitate anything. I<br />
think many of the people have seen their<br />
delusion, and I am not willing to admit<br />
with my hon friend that Confederation is<br />
gaining ground. Why, I am told that<br />
Canadian iron and other wares sell at<br />
Little Falls at lower prices than they can<br />
be go from St. John. My colleague (Mr.<br />
Cudlip) has handed me a comparative list<br />
