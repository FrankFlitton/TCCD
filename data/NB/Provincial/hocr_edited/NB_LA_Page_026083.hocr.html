ving <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> in the office for a

years, and he had no difficulty in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">collect-</span>
<br />
ing stumpage ; he had given collectors a <br />
certain per-centage upon all lumber cut <br />
upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unlicensed</span> land. They
brought no <br />
bills, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">revenue</span>
increased. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. FISHER said he had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">faith</span> in <br />
the whole <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">timber</span> system. It had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> ef- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fect to</span> encourage inordinate
lumbering. <br />
Every square mile they kept for lumber- <br />
ing on, brought them in four or live dol- <br />
lars a year for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage ;</span> but
if they sold <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">300</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acres,</span> it brought them in a principal <br />
that pays £4 10s. a year for ever, and if <br />

the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> is unlimited,
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> it <br />
passes a law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> one must obey
it. <br />
My hon. friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spoke</span> about the
United <br />
States. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There,</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> reserve to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves</span> certain powers, and
they com- <br />
municate certain powers to the State <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Leg</span>islature, and certain other
powers to <br />
the Federal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span> an act <br />
infringes the rights of an individual he <br />
has a remedy. A gentleman in the <br />
United States undertook to run a steam- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">boat</span> on the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Penobscot</span> River ; the Courts <br />
of the State of Maine decided against it. <br />
He took the case to the higher Courts, <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> determined that the
passage up <br />
and down the Penobscot River was free <br />
to every citizen of the United States, and <br />
there was no power in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">State</span>
to limit <br />
that right. It is not so with Great Bri- <br />
tain, or with us. The moment a law <br />
passes the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Three</span> Estates and
receives the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sanction</span> of the Queen, it limits,
controls, <br />
and amends the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
<br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difference</span> between the two
Constitu- <br />
tions. He did not know <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> sup- <br />
port <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Bill</span> or not. It would
take a <br />
great deal to induce him to give up <br />
£15,000 of the public revenue ; he must <br />
be perfectly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfied</span> it was
doing right <br />
to the country, and that it was fair in <br />
principle before doing so. But, if on con- <br />
sideration of the matter, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span>
feel <br />
that he was adopting a principle that <br />
would do a great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public</span> wrong,
this <br />
money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span> in the matter. <br />
All he asked for was a little time, so that <br />
whatever they did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be the
result of <br />
deliberation, irrespective of party, or any- <br />
thing else. He was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> to
pass a <br />
Bill perpetuating this act ; but, as to the <br />
other, it appeared to him, they were <br />
going to pass it without common public <br />
decency, in regard to all the interests <br />
involved, and in regard to all who had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paid</span> money throughout the
country. It <br />
might be, that, after due <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span>
of <br />
the matter, we might say, there was no <br />
sufficient reason to interfere to prevent <br />
this money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> paid back.
Common <br />
political decency demands us, before pas- <br />
sing a law of this kind, to take time to <br />
consider and hear what every one has to <br />
say upon it. Why did not the Govern- <br />
ment call the Legislature together when <br />
they discovered this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">early</span> in
September ? <br />
It appeared to him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passing</span>
strange that <br />
they did not mention it in the Speech, or <br />
brought it up for consideration. They <br />
knew about it, but they thought they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> slide <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">along,</span> and it would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> <br />
known, until the middle of the Session. <br />
He would now repeat : pass the act to <br />
impose this duty, but give a little more <br />
time to consider the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retrospective</span>
act. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span>
MR. SMITH said, that, in
consi- <br />
dering a measure of so much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">importance</span>
<br />
to the country, they should have risen <br />
above all party <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling.</span> In
bringing this <br />
forward, the Government had no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view</span>
of <br />
exculpating themselves, and they would <br />
not shrink from any odium that might be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attached</span> to them in consequence
of this <br />
neglect; but it was unkind and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ungenerous</span>
<br />
for his hon. friend to bring in politics in <br />
considering this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question.</span> When
he says <br />
we should allow this thing to stand until <br />
the Session is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">half through,</span> he
is evidently <br />
trying to make use of it politically. He <br />
was surprised to hear that hon. gentleman <br />
state to them three or four times, that he <br />
had not made up his mind upon this ques-<br />
tion, when he knew of it last January.<br />
(Mr. Fisher—I did not say it—I said, a<br />
few weeks ago.) Well, a few weeks ago.<br />
Can you suppose that a man of his expe-<br />

<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_20" title="bbox 1268 131 1872 1690">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> rience—when he sees that a great mis- <br />
take has been made, involving the revenue <br />
to the extent of $60,000, and has not <br />
arrived at any conclusion as to what <br />
should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done—has</span> done his
duty to his <br />
country ? He <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saw</span> that a large
amount <br />
of revenue was involved, and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have turned</span> the thing in his mind
and <br />
arrived at some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conclusion about</span>
it. He <br />
(Mr. Smith) had no direct interest in this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span> himself, but some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">persons</span> con- <br />
nected with him had. His brother-in-law <br />
was interested to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extent of</span>
£600 <br />
or £700. The hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> from the <br />
County of Kent (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">DesBrisay)</span>
had <br />
taken a different view of the matter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span>
<br />
his <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage</span> comes off
private property. <br />
The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">principle</span> is the same ; for
if he buys <br />
logs, or private property, he has in view <br />
the export duty, and<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> he</span> takes it from the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man who</span> gets the lumber.
Therefore, it <br />
does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">belong</span> to him. He (Mr.
Smith) <br />
could not see how the hon. member, who <br />
had last addressed them, could hesitate, in <br />
justice to the matter.  He feared his <br />
mind was influenced by political consi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">derations.</span> This Bill, which is
for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
public interest, should pass speedily, and <br />
he trusted the House would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">support</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER said, that, although he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> discovered it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> weeks ago, he <br />
could not make up his mind ; and it was <br />
only on Friday last he had looked over <br />
the acts to see if it was really so. There- <br />
fore, in all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fairness,</span> they
should have <br />
more time to consider it.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR MCMILLAN said the proposition <br />
now before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> had two points :
one was<br />
to continue <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> export duty, the
other <br />
was to withhold money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span>
as ex- <br />
port duty. He was not disposed to de- <br />
prive the country of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$60,000</span> if
it could <br />
be held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constitutionally.</span> He
would vote <br />
for retaining this money in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treasury,</span>
<br />
although it does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">relieve</span>
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment</span> from the humiliating
position they <br />
occupy before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> country. This
House, <br />
and the country would still hold them re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sponsible</span> for allowing a law to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expire,</span> <br />
which was one of the most important <br />
means of collecting the revenues of the <br />
country. As to the principle of collect- <br />
ing this export duty, he did not endorse <br />
it entirely, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> the results were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactory.</span> If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> exacted a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stumpage</span> <br />
duty, a large portion of the lumber cut <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
the Crown Lands would be cut upon pri- <br />
vate property, causing the revenue to suf- <br />
fer largely. <br />
