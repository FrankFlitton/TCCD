<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. FISHER—The Government had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
the best means of knowing. He would <br />

prepared to give them the amplest powers<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. HATHEWAY said, two hours be-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
for Mr. Connell had risen to ask that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
question, he had received a telegram from<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the

was not a single word about alarm or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
about Fenianism. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER—There was no doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
that there was great alarm now, and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
entirely agreed with the remark of the
<br />
hon. member of York. If the Government<br />
wanted more power, he would give it<br />
them. He would give them all the re-<br />
sources of the Province, if necessary, but<br />
he would expect them to exercise a care-<br />
ful and prudent economy. The Attorney<br />
General had told them that there were<br />
five hundred rifles in Carleton ; it there<br />
were five hundred men in Carleton to<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">handle them, what force could cross the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">border that that body of men could not<br />
resist ? A great body could not be moved<br />
for the purpose of attack without all the<br />
world knowing it, and people ought to<br />
remember that the Province could not be <br />
invaded suddenly by a large force. He <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did not believe that the movement would<br />
attain any importance, nor did he think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Province was much <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exposed to attack, <br />
for it had no direct line of communica-<br />
tion with the States. Still, a show of <br />
attack might be made. But if a small<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
body—and it could only be a small body, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
did come in, they would be met. As he<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
said, he would give the Government, if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
they required it, more power. He would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
give them power to muster men and com- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL (on<br />

resuming the adjourned debate on the<br />
amendment to the Address,) said that the<br />
Bill just assented to by His Excellency<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
would remove the ground of complaint <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">  </span></span><br />
that had been preferred against the Gov-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
ernment. Ever since the time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the
<br />
error had been discovered, it had given<br />
the Government a great deal of trouble.<br />
The first time they had a knowledge of <br />
the neglect was in the month of Septem-<br />
ber, but they did not think it would have<br />
been right to have summoned the Legisla-<br />
ture at a time when the navigation was<br />
open, and when it would have been most<br />
inopportune for the business of the coun-<br />
try. They thought that it would be bet-<br />
ter to wait until the opening of the<br />
Legislature, and remove the difficulty<br />
then. The House would agree that the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
then. The House would agree <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the <br />
Government had acted prudently, and he<br />
did not think that any injury had been<br />
done to the country. He could not but<br />
repeat what he had said yesterday and<br />
the day before, that the present was not<br />
the time to shake the confidence of the<br />
country in the Government, to keep up a<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political agitation, and make changes
in<br />
the Constitution. But from the informa-<br />
tion they had received, that boded no<br />
good to the Province, he thought the<br />
time had arrived when it behooved them<br />
to
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forget party and political differences,<br />
and look to the safetyand interests of <br />
the country, Within the last few days, <br />
telegrams had been received<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> sufficient
to <br />
excite fear in the country, and he thought<br />
the time had arrived when this Legisla-<br />
ture should be united, and they should all<br />
be prepared to meet aggression. He did<br />
not think any observations he could make<br />
would have any influence in changing the<br />
minds of hon. members. The discussion<br />
must take its course. But he put it to<br />
the House, and to the country, it this was<br />
the time, when the country was agitated<br />
with fears of a hostile aggression, to press<br />
a vote of want of confidence. The hon.<br />
mover (Mr. Fisher) had been premature<br />
in moving his amendment. Before con-<br />
demning the Government for the Railway<br />
contract, he should have waited for more<br />
information. He certainly had been<br />
premature in speaking about the Rail-<br />
way contract. The country, he (Attorney<br />
General) thought had heard of a grand <br />
scheme for gridironing the Province with<br />
Railways, without burdening the coun-<br />
try, that the member of York had in his<br />
head. If that hon. member was sincere<br />
in his wish to advance the interests of the <br />
Province, if he thought he had a better<br />
way of building railways than the Gov-<br />
ernment had, he should, if prepared with<br />
his scheme, have come down. With re-<br />
gard to the contract entered into, he<br />
would suppose that the testimony of the<br />
two Nova Scotian gentlemen—both of<br />
them afterwards would have some weight<br />
with the member of York—the testimony<br />
of these gentlemen would show what <br />
truth there was in the statement made<br />
that a delegation was unnecessary, that<br />
all the Government had done in the mat-<br />
ter they might have accomplished by<br />
writing a letter at the expense of a shil-<br />
ling. The other statements—(Here At-<br />
torney General quoted from the Report of<br />
the Nova Scotia Delegates.) There was<br />
the testimony of the two Nova Scotian<br />
gentlemen who had gone to England with<br />
Mr. Allen and himself. It showed that<br />
the matter would not have been accom-<br />
plished without a joint delegation. It<br />
proved the the Legislature had been re-<br />
ciprocal. The bargain that this Pro-<br />

be constructed as speedily as possible ;<br />
but if the Company failed, he, for one,<br />
was willing to undertake it as a Gov-<br />
