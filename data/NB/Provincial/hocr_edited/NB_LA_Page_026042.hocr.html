talking on <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this Scheme, but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> had so much of it <br />
to do for the last six months. I find that <br />
the Duke of Newcastle in a despatch to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Earl Mulgrave</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">,</span> dated the 6th July. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1862,</span> <br />
says as to the authority <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the
delegates <br />
that " it should emanate in the ﬁrst in- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stance</span> from the Province, and
should be <br />
concurred in by all of them which it <br />
would affec<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">t. "</span> Here it is
directly laid <br />
down that the people should take the lead <br />
in any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measure</span> of this kind ;
yet we know <br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> delegates not only
conferred on <br />
the subject of Union, but adopted a <br />
Scheme of which the people knew noth- <br />
ing. The resolution passed by this House<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
in 1861 was<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
on a matter of the Union of<br />
the three Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> and
had no <br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference</span>
whatever to a Union with Ca- <br />
nada. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I might</span> go into the Scheme
and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thus</span> it carried out it would have <br />
proved most disastrous to the interests <br />
of this Province, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> has
been so well <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ventilated</span> that it is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary,</span> and the <br />
country has decided on it. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I want</span>
<br />
another deleg<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ation</span> appointed that
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put</span> ourselves right before the
British Go- <br />
vernment, and that they may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confer</span>
on <br />
all points that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tend</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">welfare</span> of this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province.</span> If it is wanted to put
the re- <br />
solution <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">down,</span> the House can do
it, but I <br />
think it is necessary that the question <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sh</span>ould be taken up and hon.
members can <br />
opp<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ose</span> it by any arguments they
choose <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.
MCMILLAN.</span>—The hon. mem- <br />
ber for St. John (Mr. Cudlip) has avoided <br />
touching upon the three points of his re- <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> solution, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">namely</span>
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> would <br />
prove <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disastrous to</span> this
country, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political-</span> <br />
ly, ﬁnancially, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercially.</span>
He has <br />
given no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasons</span> for the ground
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> <br />
taken in the resolution. He says <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
country has pronounced against it, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
<br />
the vote of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubtless</span> de- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cide</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> it; then I would ask, why put <br />
the country to the expense of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sending</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> home merely to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tell England</span> <br />
the wishes of the people of this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province
?</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">These</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ascertained</span>
by the late elec- <br />
tions. and are well known in England, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without</span> sending home a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">special</span> delega- <br />

Council calls on me to prove a negative. <br />
I will, however, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">answer</span> a few of
th <br />
grounds taken. The hon. member for <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> (Mr. Costigan) says with
regard <br />
to this Union, " there is no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength in</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span>
be rebellion in the country if the <br />
Scheme had been carried." This I con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sider</span> to be the highest
compliment which <br />
could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possibly</span> be paid to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederates.</span> <br />
He says in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> if there had been a<br />
majority for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Scheme, the
minority<br />
would have rebelled. The friends of <br />
Confederation did not succeed, they were <br />
found to be in a minority, and yet they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proved</span> to be as loyal as those
who
suc- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ceeded in</span> crushing the measure
by a <br />
large <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority.</span> I say this is a
high com- <br />
pliment to pay to these who were charged<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wishing to</span> dissolve the ties that
bind <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">glorious</span> mother country. He <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">"</span> the elections <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> hurried on, and <br />
that we relied on the ignorance of the <br />
people to carry it through." This is an <br />
argument that to my mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span>
cut both <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span>s. I believe that a great many
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">voted</span> <br />
against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> because
they failed <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand</span> the benefits
that would <br />
follow from it ; but the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anti-Confederate</span>
<br />
leaders threw up that great bug-bear <br />
taxation. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ANGLIN.</span>
Hear, hear. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MCMILLAN. —The hon. member <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says hear, hear </span>but he
knows such was <br />
the case, and he used <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> very
argument. <br />
On' the same ground all the great Schemes <br />
that ever came up, have been attacked,<br />
but in the end the people have seen their <br />
mistake, as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> no doubt they
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">yet will <br />
on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this questi</span>on. Then the hon.
member <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says w</span>e <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> " going to be swamped, only<br />
fifteen members from New Brunswick and <br />
so many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> Canada." He seems
to
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forget</span> what matters were to come
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> <br />
the General Government to be discussed. <br />
What is it that makes dissention and dis- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cussion ;</span> is it not the matters
that are of <br />
a local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character?</span> But there
the question <br />
of tariffs and general trade could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">caused</span> no such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dissention.</span> And then<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supposing</span>
difficulties did arise what would<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect us would in a like manner <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> Scotia, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Prince</span> Edward Island, <br />
and Lower Canada, and these together <br />
would wield <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greater influence than</span>
could <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> to bear against
them. See <br />
how it has been in Canada, although divi- <br />
sions have taken place there, the parties <br />
were so equal that a few members were<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">able to sustain or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">overthrow</span> a <br />
Government. And how shall it be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span></span></span></span></span><br />
that Upper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> h <span class="unclear" title="letter is missing">?</span> r eighty-two <br />
members will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">swamp</span> us, when we
are <br />
backed by 112 on all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discus</span>sions
of gen- <br />
eral character which alone can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span>
<br />
up. And then it has been said that Up- <br />
per Canada is increasing very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rapidly </span>in
<br />
population. Well, will they not have to <br />
contribute in proportion to their popula- <br />
lation, and then the less per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capita </span>shall
<br />
we have to pay. These are all local <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">view</span>
<br />
of the matter, but in a question of this <br />
kind, we should rise above such petty, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">narrow views, and look at the advantages</span><br />
that would accrue from our being a
large, <br />
united and free people. Next the hon. <br />
member for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Victoria</span> said that
there was <br />
no certainty or guarantee whatever that <br />
the Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be built. But
this <br />
was provided for in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme,</span>
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sanc-</span> <br />
tioned by the Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span>
He <br />
then said that Canada would go on with <br />
canals and public works and we should <br />
have to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pay</span> for them. I am not
prepared <br />
to endorse such a proposition, for with a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">population</span> ten times that of
ours. I do not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> it at all likely they will
be willing <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> tax themselves <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$10</span> for the purpose of <br />
getting <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$1</span> from us. Then as to
the Rail- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> through our Province ; it
would go<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span> the entire length,
and of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$16,-</span> <br />
000,000—entire cost—some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$9,</span>000,-
<br />
000 would be spent in this Province. <br />
The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway wou</span>ld run some 220
miles, <br />

to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enter</span> into ; but this same
argument <br />
was used in Canada with regard to New<br />
Brunswick. The 67 b Section of the <br />
Scheme however is general in the applica-  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion. I have</span> asked the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mover</span> to <br />
substantiate the three positions he as- <br />
sumes, but he has declined to do so. I <br />
have attempted to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sho</span>w that in a ﬁnancial <br />
point of view we should have been plac- <br />
ed in a better <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position,</span> and I
cannot un- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">derstand</span> how a political body
such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> we <br />
should be would injure the little Province <br />
of New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick.</span> Is it imagined
that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> Brunswick, with her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> of forty <br />
members, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eclipses</span> in importance
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194</span> <br />
members of a united <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederacy ?</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> Would <br />
not the larger <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">body</span> be
regarded as of <br />
more importance, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wield a </span>greater in- <br />
ﬂuence, and be of more weight in the eyes <br />
of the Mother Country and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Imperial</span>
<br />
Parliament than we are now ? Political- <br />
ly we should be placed is a far better po- <br />
sition, and commercially we should also <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneﬁt</span>ted. Would it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">injure</span> us that all <br />
the imaginary lines and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Custom</span>
