<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_26" title="bbox 149 866 747 2386"><p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> My object in making <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">use</span> of these<br />
ﬁgures is to lay a fair statement before <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> and I believe in
reviewing <br />
these ﬁgures it shows that if we connect <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ourselves</span> with Canada, we go with
a <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> that has resources that
we have <br />
not. We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">curtailed,</span>
circumscribed <br />
and fenced round. We are told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
our <br />
market is the United States; that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argu-</span>
<br />
ment is put forth in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of
Western <br />
Extension. Of course it is very desira- <br />
ble that we should be able to buy in the <br />
cheapest market and sell in the dearest, <br />
but this is not all. We should look at the <br />
position to which we should arrive under <br />
a Union with Canada that we cannot at-<br />
tain without it. These are some of my <br />
ideas on Confederation and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why</span>
we should <br />
not send a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> to tell <br />
the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what they already k</span>now.
Ve- <br />
ry great stress has been laid on the 14th <br />
Section of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolutions</span>
adopted by <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> delegates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">at</span> Quebec, and although it <br />
has been said in this connection that no <br />
movement dare to be made towards the <br />
carrying out of the Scheme in Nova Sco- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tia ;</span> yet I have no doubt that
the
whole <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition</span> will be laid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> that people <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> be allowed to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">express an</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinion</span> <br />
upon it. The 14th Section reads thus ; <br />
“The ﬁrst selection of the members of <br />
the Legislative Council, shall be made, <br />
except as regards Prince Edward <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Island.</span><br />
from the Legislative Council of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vari-</span>
<br />
ous Provinces, so <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">far</span> as a
sufficient num- <br />
ber be found qualified and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span>
to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">serve ;</span> such members shall be
appointed <br />
by the Crown at the recommendation <br />
of the General Executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>,
<br />
upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> nomination of the
respec-<br />
tive local Governments, and in such <br />
nomination due <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> be had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
to the claims of the members of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
Legislative Council of the opposition in <br />
each Province, so that all political parties <br />
may, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nearly</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible,</span> be fairly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">re-</span> <br />
presented.” In ﬁxing the appointment of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> Council thus,
and in mak-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span>
them permanent, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
best interests of the Colonies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span>
<br />
them. I look upon this as a safeguard <br />
against any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">encroachments</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> be <br />
made. I would not go into Confederation <br />
unless the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span> of the
Intercolonial <br />
Railway was guaranteed and prosecuted, <br />
and what an advantage it would be to this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country to have $16,000,000 laid</span>
out on <br />
this work ; the majority of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> <br />
be spent here. A few days ago the Mili-<br />
tia Bill passed, and we granted $30,000<br />
to form a Camp of Instruction, and now<br />
in such great has'e are we to show our<br />
loyalty that I find an announcement in<br />
the Royal Gazette calls the Militia out in<br />
July, when the whole country will be in<br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates,</span> who I suppose are also
to be <br />
sent in like haste, may convey to the Eng- <br />
lish people a report of what we
are doing <br />
to show our loyalty. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The Hon.</span>
President <br />
of the Council brought <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> a
Resolution <br />
with regard to a Maritime Union, but <br />
there was no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debate</span> upon it. I
think <br />
that subject should have been thoroughly <br />
discussed, so that it might have some <br />
weight on the delegates who are now to <br />
be sent home, and that it might be ex- <br />
plained for the benefit of the country ; <br />
but that did not suit their purpose. But <br />
why need the Government come down to <br />
this House to ask us to appoint <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates?</span>
<br />
Why not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appoint</span> them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves?</span> they <br />
have the power. I want to know if, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span>
<br />
delegations have been appointed before, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Government has pursued such a
<br />
course? When Messrs. Howe, Tilley, <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">others,</span> went to Canada, did
the Gov- <br />
ernment then bring down a measure to <br />
relieve them of all responsibility in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
matter? And the same will apply to our <br />
Railway delegates, the President of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council being</span> then a member of
the Gov- <br />
ernment. Oh, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span> have
changed <br />
now. Yes, a change has taken place, but <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> I think that does <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> add to the <br />
dignity if the Executive. They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">are</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-</span> <br />
pected to initiate <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> <br />
them before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for an</span> expression <br />
of an opinion, but now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they strive</span>
to get <br />
the opinion of the House without commit- <br />
ing themselves to any measures, as is evi- <br />
dent by these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Resolutions,</span> and
by
those <br />
that are to be brought in by the hon. <br />
member for St. John (Mr.Cudlip) with <br />
regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Western</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Extension.</span> The hon. <br />
President of the Council <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says</span>
the dele- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gates</span> to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Quebec</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conference</span>
had no <br />

had. <br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">authority</span>
and I take sides with the <br />
Board of Works on that point. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">That</span>
<br />
hon. gentleman made up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> mind
that he <br />
would not hold ofﬁce unless it was sub- <br />
mitted to the people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> was
done, and <br />
the Government suffered by it. The hon. <br />
Chief Commissioner took grounds against <br />
the Scheme as early <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> the first
of No- <br />
vember ; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he does</span> not tell <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> what took <br />
place between that time and the 19th <br />
January, when he resigned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span>
ofﬁce. He <br />
does not say why he did not resign be- <br />
fore, although I believe he acted consci- <br />
entiously in the matter. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
not a mat- <br />
ter of any great importance, however.<br />He complains that a despatch was re- <br />
ceived in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1364</span> that he did not
see till a <br />
long time after, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> he was
a mem- <br />
ber of the Government. He was busy, <br />
no doubt, about his office <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duties</span>
when it <br />
was received, and it was known that he <br />
was not opposed to any action with regard <br />
to Railways ; but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> into this,<br />
as the hon. member <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposite</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> Mc- <br />
Millan) will doubtless take it up and ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">plain</span> it satisfactorily. Some
observations <br />
have been made by the hon. member from <br />
Victoria, (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Costigan)</span> and
the hon. <br />
member from the County of St. John, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hon. Mr.</span> Anglin), with regard
to the <br />
hardware and stoves in Canada. It is <br />
well known that the iron of this Province <br />
is not fit for the manufacture of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hollow-</span>
<br />
ware and stoves ; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> of Canada, from <br />
the Marmora Mines, is just suited for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
purpose. But this fact is no argument at<br />
all, as those who know anything about the<br />
subject, are aware that the iron for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farm</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">implements,</span> and most other
purposes, is <br />
now imported from Scotland at consider- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">able</span>
cost, whilst in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> the iron
for <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hollow-ware is </span>found on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> own soil <br />
and manufactured. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> respect, there- <br />
fore, they have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantage</span> of
us. But <br />
it is no argument<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
against Confederation <br />
that we have to import iron. The hon. <br />
member for St. John, (Mr. Anglin), says<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the delegates</span>
were not sanctioned ; but <br />
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> well known that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> were sanction- <br />
ed, both by the Governor General and <br />
the Home Government. He says, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also,</span>
<br />
that scheming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">measures</span> were
employed to <br />
force it through the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature.</span>
There <br />
might have been scheming, but I think if <br />
such were the case, it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried</span>
on by <br />
those of whom he seems to have the most <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knowledge. With regard to the confer-</span>
<br />
ence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being conducted with closed doors,</span> <br />
I think, although such is the usual course, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />that it would have been better to have<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made it public. It is said that Confede-<br />
ration would have had on injurious influ-<br />
ence on our finances ; but the opening<br />
up of our country, the introduction of<br />
foreign capital, the cultivation of our soil,<br />
