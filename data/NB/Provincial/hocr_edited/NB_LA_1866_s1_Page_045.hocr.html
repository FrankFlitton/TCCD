when it suited my purpose, and<br />
that I am willing none to be dictated to from<br />
the same quarter ;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>and I know
that I was<br />
about as honest in the one case as I<br />
am in the other; they both answered<br />
my purposes as a politician, and he<br />
could truthfully have said what matters<br />
is how much social hate and discord I<br />
produce, or how much untruthfulness I<br />
am guilty of, if I can only succeed in<br />
defeating the Government, for I shall<br />
then be elevated to their position. Op-<br />
position means to oppose, right or wrong,<br />
at least in my case. Yes! I know these<br />
things, but who on earth could doubt my<br />
piety, my truthfulness and my loyalty, that<br />
heard me at the close of my speech re-<br />
commend peace and good will. I fixed<br />
the whole matter by throwing over all<br />
misrepresentations, this hypocritical man-<br />
tle of deception, and this quotation will<br />
give you a good description of his ap-<br />
pearance at the close:</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Then richer grown in gilts and grace,<br />
With every rite complies,<br />
And deeper lengthens down his face,<br />
And higher rolls his eyes."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The debate was then adjourned until<br />
eleven to-morrow, Hon. Mr. Gillmor to<br />
resume.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The House was then adjourned until<br />
to-morrow at nine.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">A.A.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">FRIDAY, March 23.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. MR. SMITH called the attention<br />
of the House to a communication in the<br />
Morning Telegraph, which professed to<br />
give a statement of what took place be-<br />
tween Mr. Tilley and himself. This letter<br />
was signed by "A Looker on," and he<br />
thought he knew the writer, who was one<br />
of the most malicious, unprincipled politi-<br />
cal partisans in the Province, and was a<br />
person who had frequently attempted to<br />
injure him. He would state that the<br />
statements contained in that letter were<br />
utterly untrue, which could be proved by<br />
twenty witnesses, and he would be much<br />
obliged if that paper would publish this<br />
denial of their truth.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILBERT called the attention of<br />
the Chief Commissioner of the Board of<br />
Works to the unsafe condition of the<br />
bridge over the Memramcosk River, in<br />
the County of Westmorland. He had<br />
received a letter stating that the bridge<br />
was likely to be carried away by the ice<br />
in the spring. If this took place it would<br />
cause a great deal of inconvenience.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. HATHEWAY said if his<br />
hon. friend would place the letter in his<br />
hand, he would refer it to the Supervisors,<br />
and if they reported the bridge to be in<br />
that state, he would have it repaired.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The House in Committee then agreed<br />
to "A Bill to provide for the settlement<br />
and support of the poor in this Province"</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">A BILL TO INCORPORATE THE ABERDEEN<br />
IRON COMPANY.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. CONNELL in explaining the ob-<br />
jects of the Bill, said it was<span class="unclear" title="Illegible word">?</span> <br />

desirability of introducing<span class="unclear" title="Ensuing words are illegible">?</span> the<br />
country, to open up the mines and min-<br />
erlas, which are extensive, the operations<br />
upon which are only now beginning;<br />

</div>
<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_5" title="bbox 31 319 617 392">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">under the General Act there was some<br />
doubt about holding lands, and it was<br />
necessary in operations of this kind that<br />
the company should hold a great deal of<br />
land.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. KERR said that there was no<br />
doubt whatever under the General Act<br />
but what they had power to hold lands.<br />
There were several companies of this<br />
kind got up in other parts of the Province<br />
with quite as large a capital as that pro-<br />
possed in this Bill, and the general law<br />
gave each of these corporations all the<br />
power they needed for the purchase<br />
of lands. Unless some special provisions<br />
were required, he did not see the neces-<br />
sity of this Bill.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SMITH said the company<br />
would have to go abroad to obtain capi-<br />
tal, and if the parties could show a special<br />
Act of incorporation it would, no doubt,<br />
facilitate their operations very much.<br />
Therefore, if this Bill simply contains the<br />
provisions of the General Act, it would<br />
be unwise in this Legislature to refuse<br />
to pass it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. ANGLIN stated that under an<br />
Act of this kind, stock could be secured<br />
more readily; for at the stock exchange <br />
it would be proof that the company had a<br />
real existence, although it might be a mere<br />
nominal existence, but it was something<br />
tangible, and parties could recommend<br />
themselves more readily in consequence<br />
of it. But he thought it would be ad-<br />
visable to re-enact the old rule that re-<br />
quired $30 to be paid on all private Bills<br />
that came there, because many other<br />
Bills of a like nature would be coming in.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Bill was then agreed to. The<br />
House then went into Committee on "A<br />
Bill to empower the Justices in the sev-<br />
eral Courts in this Province to act in<br />
several cases relating to Parish rates and<br />
taxes," which produced a long discussion,<br />
after which progress was reported.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S<br />
AMENDMENT</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. GILLMOR resumed<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>I re-<br />
gret I had not finished my remarks last<br />
evening, which I would have done had<br />
the House remained in session a few<br />
minutes longer.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">If any further reasons were necessary</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">to justify the personal allusions which I</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">have made to my hon. friend from York</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">(Mr. Fisher) that the attack which he</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">has made upon the Government, I can</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">give them. I entered the Temperance</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hall in Fredericton on declaration day,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">a comparative stranger to most of the</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">audience, and my friend, not satisfied with<br />
attacking the Government, referred to me</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">personally, pointing me out, and said,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"There is the Provincial Secretary; An-</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">glin has him in the hollow of his hand,</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">and can rule him as he pleases." I have</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">kept quiet upon this point until I could</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">meet him face to face in this Assembly.<br />
To be attacked in that manner before an<br />
audience in the city of Fredericton was<br />
quite enough to move the indignation of<br />
any man, and I would not be worthy to<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> neglect in not renewing the Export Duty<br />
Law." The Chief Commissioner of Pub-<br />
lia Works has acknowledged that the<br />
Government have been guilty of that<br />
omission, and none of us will deny that<br />
the present Government are responsible<br />
for it. It has given me a great deal of<br />
anxiety. I am personally responsible, as<br />
well as all my colleagues, but notwith-<br />
standing the omission, the evil has been<br />
entirely remedied, and not one cent<br />
has been lost to the people of the Pro-<br />
vince. (A member,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>You need not
thank<br />
the Government for that.) Such is the<br />
result. Who should we thank? The<br />
Government are responsible for the man-<br />
agement of public affairs, and cannot<br />
shrink from it if they would, but must<br />
bear the blame of the omission. It is<br />
not an evidence of inability, but is an<br />
oversight that might have occurred in any<br />
Government, and in extenuation of it, I<br />
will not even urge the circumstances un-<br />
der which the Government was formed,<br />
and when the country knows that no<br />
harm has resulted from it, I am sure that<br />
a generous public will not condemn us<br />
on that charge.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I was a little surprised at the remarks<br />
made by the late Surveyor General. One<br />
reason he gave for opposing the Govern-<br />
ment, was that the interests of the North<br />
had been neglected in the formation of<br />
the Government, and I thought it un-<br />
generous in him to make such an allu-<br />
sion as he did to the Hon. Mr. Hutchi-<br />
son ; from my short acquaintance with<br />
him, I believe him quite competent and<br />
quite ready to protect the northern in-<br />
terests, and, although comparisons are<br />
odious, I think he will compare favorably<br />
with that hon. gentleman, morally, intel-<br />
lectually, or as a business man, or with<br />
any man on the floor of the House. I<br />
consider him a man of prudence, ability<br />
and sterling integrity. The hon. member<br />
(Mr. McMillan) may be opposed to him<br />
politically, but that is no reason he should<br />
charge him with incapacity. (Mr. McCle-<br />
lan<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>In the absence of my friend
(Mr.<br />
McMillan) I will say I understood him to<br />
refer to his want of political experience,<br />
and not his want of ability.) I under-<br />
stood him to say both, and I do not think<br />
it fair to decry a man thus in his absence.<br />
If the interests of the North suffer, it<br />
will not be for want of capacity in Mr.<br />
Hutchison.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I should be glad indeed, if the North-<br />
ern interests could be more largely re-<br />
presented at the Council Board, but the<br />
great question decided at the last General<br />
Election precluded them from taking in-<br />
to the Executive Council those who<br />
entertained different opinions upon that<br />
question, although it would have been<br />
very gratifying to my colleagues and my-<br />
self if it could have been done. (Hon.<br />
Mr Hatheway<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>My hon. friend on my<br />
left says there were two members from<br />
the County of Gloucester who were anti-<br />
Confederates. Does he not know that<br />
there was a scrutiny going on, and while<br />
that was pending they could not become<br />
members of the Government.)</p>
