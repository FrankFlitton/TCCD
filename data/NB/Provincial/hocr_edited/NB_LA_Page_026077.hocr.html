<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">possession when the House was in Ses-<br />
sion last season ; but it did not suit their <br />
purpose to communicate it to them, be- <br />
cause it indicated to them the mind of the <br />
Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> upon the
question <br />
of Confederation ; but his hon. friends <br />
saw comfort and pleasure in the distance, <br />
and it would not do to let a House of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
Assembly know that the Imperial Govern-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ment had made up their minds upon this<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
point. When these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegations</span> go
to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England</span> on public business for
the beneﬁt<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> he was willing to
pay them <br />
for it ; but if they went for a useless pur<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
pose and spent hundreds of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pounds,</span>
he<br />
would begin to ask himself, whether or no<br />
that money would not be more wisely ex-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expended in making a road or building a<br />
bridge in some back part of his County.<br />
It is aid they went for the purpose of<br />
carrying on other negotiations, but the<br />
other negotiations are not authorised in<br />
the resolution. They went to effect a<br />
Union of the Maritime Provinces, so far<br />
as we can judge from Mr. Cardwell's reply;<br />
that seemed to be the principal part of<br />
their mission, and it was an extraordin-<br />
ary thing that they also received this<br />
despatch through Canada. He would ask<br />
if secresy was to be the rule of the Gov-<br />
ernment. He complained of them be-<br />
cause they had not taken precautionary<br />
measures in regard to the defence of this<br />
country. There is a great deal of feelings<br />
along the line in regard to some lawless<br />
attempts from armed desperadoes from<br />
the United States. It has been the<br />
fear of this country for several years<br />
that upon the close of the Ameri-<br />
can war there would be vast num-<br />
bers of disbanded soldiers who, having<br />
no other business to do, would collect<br />
in crowds around towns and cities, and<br />
make an attack upon this country. Large<br />
numbers of these returned soldiers are<br />
entirely out of employment, and being<br />
men of no principle or character, have<br />
joined an organization formed for the<br />
purpose of making an attack upon these<br />
Provinces, which has created a great<br />
alarm along the frontier. He had been<br />
one of those who had thought a large<br />
military expenditure unnecessary, for he<br />
thought it was best to expend the mo-<br />
ney in making the country fit to live in ;<br />
but now things have changed, and what<br />
they had feared for the last few years<br />
was coming upon them, and he had<br />
changed his opinion in regard to this<br />
matter. We know that a vast conspi-<br />
racy is carried on by lawless despera-<br />
does, who care not for Jew or Gentile,<br />
and we must be prepared to meet them.<br />
Have the Government of the country<br />
given any assurance that they are mak-<br />
ing any preparation to meet the danger.<br />
The House authorized the expenditure of<br />
$30,000 for a Camp of Instruction. Why<br />
not have that Camp meet in the month of<br />
March, the time of trouble. He had not<br />
been much alarmed, but if he had a wife<br />
and children on the border, he would<br />
soon decamp (laughter) ; he would take<br />
his wife and children to a place of safe-<br />
ty, and then return and defend his pro-<br />
perty. They should have the men drill-<br />
ed along the borders. They need not<br />
tell him they were going to try and get<br />
troops from the British Government. He<br />
knew the military authorities were indis-<br />
posed to send troops along the line, be-<br />
cause they would desert. The wording<br />
of his resolution had already started<br />
the Sergeants, and the House would<br />
start the Generals bye and bye.</span>—<br />
They should have selected the month of</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> March for their Camp of Instruction, for<br />
when that month was over, the time of<br />
danger would be passed away. There<br />
should be no delay in this matter. In<br />
Canada they are sending the military<br />
and troops in all directions, and making<br />
great preparation to meet the danger.<br />
We, on the contrary, are perfectly pas-<br />
sive, while our country is in a state of<br />
growing, continuous, and increasing<br />
excitement. In protecting themselves.<br />
the people of this country would not<br />
stand about pounds, shillings, and pence.<br />
In 1812, our fathers went through the<br />
wilderness to Canada. That was the<br />
spirit of 1783, and the same spirit ani-<br />
mates the people of this country now,<br />
to defend their firesides from lawless<br />
aggression. The Government has done<br />
nothing for them. The whole nature of<br />
the Government appears to have been<br />
forgotten. They have been scattered<br />
to the four winds of Heaven : one off at<br />
Washington, one one place, and one<br />
another, and when at last met together,<br />
they had to send to St. John to swear a<br />
member in to make a quorum. It ap-<br />
pears that the defence of the country is<br />
considered a small business in compari-<br />
son with sustaining themselves in office<br />
for a short time. An idea was put for-<br />
ward by his hon. friend, regarding this<br />
military business, that the Government<br />
were not responsible for the acts of the<br />
Commander-in-Chief, because he had<br />
certain powers for which he alone was<br />
responsible. He (Mr. Fisher) said,<br />
that, for every act of the Commander-<br />
in-Chief in military matters, the Execu- <br />
tive Council were responsible. The <br />
Constitution did not permit them to <br />
enquire into his conduct at all, for he is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to the Queen alone ; but for</span><br />
every act, military or civil, the Govern- <br />
ment was responsible to them. He<br />
stated this, because he had seen in the<br />
papers an account of a speech, made by<br />
the Attorney General, in which it was<br />
stated that the Commander-in-Chief was<br />
alone responsible in military matters.<br />
Three or four years ago this was a<br />
matter of small importance, but when<br />
they came to expend $30,000 a-year<br />
for this purpose it was a more serious<br />
matter. He should be sorry to have<br />
the military officers appointed from one<br />
party or the other ; but there could be<br />
no doubt that, for every one appointed,<br />
the Council were as responsible for, as<br />
for any other acts of the Government.<br />
He then stated, and read some extracts<br />
to prove, that this question was settled<br />
in England sixty years ago, which was<br />
the last time any controversy arose in<br />
regard to difficulties with the army.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The next point he would refer to was<br />
the appointment of Judges. The Gov-<br />
ernment have induced men to look to<br />
politics in regard to appointments on the<br />
Bench. In appointing the Chief Justice,<br />
they had one plain course to adopt to<br />
avoid this danger : either to appoint the<br />
Attorney General, or some other gentle-<br />
man outside the Bench, or appoint the<br />
oldest Judge on the Bench. They had<br />
seen a letter in one of the newspapers writ-<br />
ten by Mr. Boyd, in which it is stated that<br />
he heard, one year before, that upon the<br />
appointment had lessened his confidence<br />
and lessened the confidence of the people<br />
of the country in the administration of<br />
justice. He had been told that the rea-<br />
son Judge Wilmot was not appointed,<br />
was because he had voted for him, and<br />

est thing in the world for Judges in<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England to refer to matters of that
kind— <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> even a that are

(Mr. Fisher) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">then</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">eulogized.</span> Judge <br />
Wilmot very highly, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stating</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> the interests of their
common coun- <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> then referred to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">testimony</span> of <br />
