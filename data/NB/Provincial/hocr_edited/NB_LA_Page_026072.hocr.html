GILBERT read the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">report</span> of the<br />
Committee appointed to provide for the <br />
Rep<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">orting</span> and Printing the
Debates, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> the Committee had taken
great trou- <br />
ble to carry out the arrangements, and <br />
had done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> best to
economise, and se- <br />
cure the services of competent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Reporters.</span>
<br />
The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">terms</span> of the arrangement
were simi- <br />
lar to those that had been made last year. <br />
As the present Session promised to be <br />
one of the most important that had taken <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place</span> in the Province, and as it
would be <br />
desirable that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proceedings</span>
of the <br />
House should be circulated abroad, he <br />
proposed that 7000 copies of the Debates <br />
should <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be printed.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The report was then adopted. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. SUTT<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ON</span>
moved that a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commit-</span> <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. MCMILLAN contended that it was<br />
not in the city that the hon. mover of the <br />
resolution represented that the Debates <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> wanted to circulate, it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outside</span> <br />
places. In St. John they had a daily sy- <br />
nopsia of the proceedings of the House <br />
in the newspapers, and it was found that <br />
the people there did not properly appre- <br />
ciate the Debates. He hoped the hon. <br />
mover would not object to give each mem- <br />
ber of the House an equal portion. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">After</span>
a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few observations</span> from Messrs. <br />
Boyd and McClelan. Hon. G. L. Hathe- <br />
way said if the resolution was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried</span>
out <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span> John would get the sixth of
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">De-</span><br />
bates, as its population was a sixth of that <br />
of the entire Province. He agreed with<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span>ex-Surveyor General that it
was out- <br />
side places—in such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Counties</span> as
Glouces- <br />
ter and Restigouche, where the people in <br />
the back settlements did not receive the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">newspapers—that</span> the circulation
of the<br />
Debates was needed. He would much<br />
prefer that the arrangement for the dis- <br />
tribution of the Debates should remain as <br />
it was. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. LINDSAY spoke in favor of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. CAIE said that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">golden</span> rule <br />
" to do unto others as we would be done <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span>," should govern them in this
matter. <br />
He did not consider it fair play that Glou- <br />
cester or Restigouche should receive as <br />
great a portion as Kent, whose popula- <br />
tion was so much greater. He would ask <br />
if it was a question of supplying mate- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rial</span> wants, if it would be fair
pla<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">y</span> to give <br />
Restigouche as many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">barrels</span> of
flour as <br />
Kent ? It was equally necessary to pro- <br />
vide food for the mind as the body, and <br />
the same rule should apply. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.</span>
MCMILLAN said the hon. mem- <br />
ber who had just spoken seemed deter- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mined</span> to stand up for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Kent :</span> yet if he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was so</span> determined to have fair p<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lay—as</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">half </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the population <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> French in that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">County</span>—why did he not move that
the <br />
Debates be printed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">French ?</span>
He would<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
move, as an amendment, that the distri- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bution </span>of the Debates be an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equal num-</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. WETMORE<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
contended that if<br />
many of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> in St. John <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">did get</span><br />
information of the proceedings of the<br />
House from the newspapers, for those<br />
newspapers they had the supreme felicity<br />
of paying. The only fair and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reasonable</span>
<br />
way was distribution by population. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. CO</span>RAM
said that it was only the <br />
people of the city that got the advantage <br />
of the papers published in St. John ; <br />
there was a large number of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span>
<br />
throughout the County in the backwoods <br />
who did not see a paper. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. KERR supported the amendment, <br />
and argued if St. John, with its popula- <br />
tion of between thirty and forty <br />
thousand people, could make good <br />
its claim to a distribution of Debate <br />
on that basis, they might, if the prin- <br />
ciple was allowed, seek to apply it <br />
also to the distribution of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bye-road</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money</span>, which had not been dreamt
of yet. <br />
In St. John<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">, papers</span> were issued
daily <br />
ly, morning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> evening—there
the great <br />
bulk of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people received
them, and <br />
read the synopsis of the Debates ; but in <br />
the country the people could not get them, <br />
and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">many</span> cases, if they
could, they <br />
were too poor to pay for them. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought</span> that each member should
have <br />
equal rights with other members, and re- <br />
ceive an equal number. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The amendment being put to the vote, <br />
was carried. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> On motion, the House was adjourned <br />

received an offer from Mr. Day, who <br />
would mail and address them for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$5</span>
for <br />
each <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member.</span> It would be
attended with <br />
great delay to have them sent up here by <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COL.</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. SUTTON said they were address-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. CAIE said the amount to be paid <br />
the publisher should be a little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more

<br />
it was last year, as there are 7,000 instead <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. GILBERT said that last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Session</span><br />
part of them were addressed here and <br />
part in St. John. For some Counties <br />
there would be a great loss of time in <br />
having them come to Fredericton, al- <br />
though he thought the work <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could be</span>
done <br />
better under their own supervision, or the <br />
work might be done under the Post <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Office</span>
<br />

to direct them to the Way <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Offices.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. CONNELL believed that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">work</span> <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> COL. BOYD said, that in the good old <br />
times, thirty years ago, every member used <br />
to address his own debates, and he had <br />
kept to that old fashioned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span>
for a num- <br />
ber of years. He believed t cost £70 <br />
when they were addressed under the Post <br />
Office Department. He would like to <br />
have his Debates addressed in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span>
John, <br />
as they would be delayed one or two days <br />
by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">coming</span> up here. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.</span>
BEVERIDGE observed that the <br />
arrangement of last year gave <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfaction</span>
<br />
in his County, his Debates being address- <br />
ed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> a person in the employ of the<br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_20" title="bbox 1209 1166 1803 2859">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. GILBERT said he could hardly <br />
credit that the addressing of the Debates, <br />
cost £70 If they had the privilege of <br />
having the head of the Post Ofﬁce De-<br />
partment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in the</span>
House, they could get in- <br />
formation of what the labor would cost. <br />
Having <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Debates addressed in
St. <br />
John is sometimes the cause of delay, for <br />
if you received a notice from any of your <br />
constituents that they do not receive the <br />
Debates, you have to write to the pub- <br />
lisher, and several days must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elapse</span>
be- <br />
fore it can be rectified ; but if they were <br />
addressed here it could be corrected at <br />
once. Half of the Debates have to come <br />
here, and the rest would be delayed but <br />
a day and night. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ANGLIN</span>
said there was one ob- <br />
jection to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this arran</span>gement for
addressing <br />
the Debates in St. John which had been <br />
overlooked, that was, that they had no <br />
security that they should get the 7,000 <br />
copies for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> they paid. They
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depend</span> upon the honor of the
person who <br />
published and addressed them. There <br />
should be something like a receipt of de- <br />
livery. In whatever way the arrange- <br />
ments <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">may</span> be made there will be
innume- <br />
rable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complaints ;</span> but in this
case there <br />
is no security against fraud. This House <br />
should, through some officer, obtain a de- <br />
livery of the whole, and then have them <br />
distributed ; by this means persons through <br />
the country would receive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span>
earlier <br />
and more regular. He did not value the <br />
Debates, so therefore cared little about <br />
it ; but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the whole</span> cost of
addressing them <br />
should not exceed £50 or £60. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. LINDSAY said, that Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mem-</span> <br />
bers <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who</span> made out their lists,
would cer- <br />
tainly know whether they received the De- <br />
bates or not. In his district they received <br />
them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pretty</span> regular. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. WILMOT<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
remarked,
that to ensure <br />
their being received, they should be ad- <br />
dressed by the Post Office Department, <br />
for if they were not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">properly</span>
directed they <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would go to the wrong Post Office. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CORAM</span>
