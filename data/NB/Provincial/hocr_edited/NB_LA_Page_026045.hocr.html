<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Thus <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span>
manufactures we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shall</span> have <br />
little chance with them. But this is but <br />
one phase of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercial</span>
view. I <br />
have heard lectures on this subject, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as I</span> have heard them talk about
free <br />
trade with Canada, I have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked</span>
myself <br />
are these people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">such</span> fools as
not to <br />
know that if Canada <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wants</span> to get
coal <br />
from Pictou they are free to do it as <br />
they can possibly be. People <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forget</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
that there is perfect free trade between<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
us and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> cry about free<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
trade <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is not</span> the reason <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">why</span> Confedera- <br />
tion is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wanted,</span> but an hon.
member of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
the Canadian <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> has
explained<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the whole matter, when he alleged as <br />
one of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> of Union
to Cana- <br />
da, that they would be able to say to the <br />
States, we will not only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">close</span>
the St. <br />
Lawrence against you, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span>
prevent you <br />
from sending down your flour and beef <br />
and pork to St. John, and the other <br />
ports of the Lower Provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unless</span>
<br />
you come to our terms. Are we thus <br />
to be made the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cats-paw</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada?</span> <br />
are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> to be mere make-weights
be- <br />
tween <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States? <br />
Are we to have all these articles <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">shut</span>
<br />
out <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> that Canada may make <br />
us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consume</span> her corn and pork at
im- <br />
mensely <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">higher</span> prices? Great
Britain <br />
makes treaties with the United States, <br />
but she always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asks</span> our opinion
about <br />
them, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affect us.</span> <br />
When the Reciprocity <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaty</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sign-</span>
<br />
ed. Parliament <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> called
together to <br />
deliberate on it, but here we are to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
no voice <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all. Just think of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">15</span> <br />
men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standing</span> up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">among</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194 ;</span> sup- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pose</span> they all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stand</span> together for their <br />
rights, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against a</span> great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong, I</span><br />
think I hear the Canadians saying, <br />
" you came into this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> union
of your <br />
own free will, you have reaped <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
ad- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages of </span>the alliance, and
now when <br />
difficulties come you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> bear
them or <br />
do the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> you can." It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> said that <br />
union is strength, and we had it illus-<br />
trated in different ways down in St. John<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elections,</span> but I think we al- <br />
ready have a union <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that is </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span>
; <br />
we are united to Great Britain, and I do <br />
not think they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desire</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sever</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
band <br />
that unites <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us.</span> Look at the map
and <br />
see how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">New</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick</span> and Canada <br />
run up round the State of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Maine</span>
like an <br />
ox <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bow ; for</span> some distance the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strip</span> of <br />
land is not more than twenty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">miles</span>
wide, <br />
and is the bond that binds us to Canada, <br />
a link that an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> troop of
dra- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">goons </span>could snap in a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> day ; and to de- <br />
fend that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place</span> or any other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> would <br />
be no more difficulty in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turning</span>
out an <br />
available force at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">request</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Britain, than by a command from Otta-</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to bring</span> this about, and the
Saturday <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Review</span> reiterates the same <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">falsehood</span> and <br />
calumny ; when in the County of York <br />
alone there are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">over 900 majority</span>
against <br />
it. Does this mean nothing? Is it not<br />
done for some sinister purpose?</span> When <br />
I see <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr. Cartier stating at <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fishmonger’s</span> <br />
Hall that they had come to induce the <br />
people of England to carry out that<br />
scheme, I think it is time we did some-<br />
thing to counteract such scheming and<br />
falsehood. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Times says</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">again,</span>
that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these gentlemen from Canada</span> went <br />

that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">several influential</span>

Lord Palmerston, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stating</span> that
all is go- <br />

wish to say that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desire</span> to <br />
coerce us <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">felt</span> by any <br />

is gaining ground, and that it may be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">carried</span> in six months ; and when
I hear <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">another gentleman</span> in the other
branch <br />
say that the reason why <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span>
<br />

of the <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COSTIGAN</span>.—It
has been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span> by <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the hon. </span>member from Restigouche
(Mr.<br />
McMillan ) that the more the people be- <br />
came acquainted with this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would </span>like it. <br />
N<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ow,</span> if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> really thought it<br />
was a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> should not have <br />
been afraid of having it discussed. What- <br />
ever the intention of the Government may <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> been, the facts show they
did not <br />
want the people to become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acquainted</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with the Scheme. If</span> that had not
been <br />
the case they could have brought it up <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House,</span> and then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">referred</span> it to <br />
the country at the general election : peo- <br />
ple then could have all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span>
to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be derived </span>from the
correspondence with<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the additional information which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span><br />
would have gained by the question being<br />
debated on the floors of the House. This<br />
would have put the matter in a fair light ;<br />
but I believe the Government did not<br />
have confidence enough in it themselves<br />
to bring it before the House, for they did<br />
not think they could carry it through. If<br />
the Government had been really <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong,<br />
they would have been more cautious, but<br />
they were growing weaker every day, and<br />
unless something was done they would go<br />
over board. They thought this was a<br />
chance to keep them in a position they<br />
were anxious to retain. If they allowed<br />
the House of Assembly to meet again,<br />
they did not see how they could fight<br />
their way through the Session. In order<br />
to retain their power they took up this<br />
Scheme, and they thought it might place<br />
them in a higher position than before.<br />
There was always a bait held out to every<br />
man of influence, to induce him to sup-<br />
port the Scheme. A great deal has been<br />
said about the position we would occupy<br />
in the general Government. I have al-<br />
ways contended that it would be dange-<br />
rous to place ourselves in the hands</span><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">of the Confederacy. Some will say this<br />
is a narrow minded view, and we ought<br />
not to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afraid, </span>for we would
have even- <br />
handed justice. I read in a Canadian <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">newspaper</span> the opinion <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leading</span>
man <br />
in that country on a Union of the Mari- <br />
time Provinces before this Scheme was<br />
brought up. He said in case <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span>
Union of <br />
the Maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> took <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place,</span> Nova <br />
Scotia would absord the influence of New <br />
Brunswick. If that would be the case <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> smaller union, how much
more would <br />
this influence be absorbed in this greater<br />
majority of this grand Union ? Is it re-<br />
sonable to suppose that a better feeling <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span>
exist between New Brunswick and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada </span>than among the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of New <br />
Brunswick themsel<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ves ?</span> I
remember <br />
when a Bill was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> in
to increase <br />
the representation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of certain</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Counties,</span> <br />
there was a strong <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> in
the House <br />
to support it, because it had especial re-<br />
ference to the County of Carleton, as it<br />
was thought it ought to be entitled to one
<br />
additional <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative.</span> When
the vote <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question, the</span>
principle <br />
part of the members of the North were <br />
against it. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">antagonism</span> <br />
has always <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existed</span> between the
two sec- <br />
tions of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province,</span> and they
are afraid <br />
to extend the power on either side. In <br />
view of this, are we prepared to give an <br />
overwhelming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> to Upper
Canada <br />
and trust to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their liberality</span> in
dealing <br />
with us ? In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to trade,
when we are <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">able</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stock</span> our own market, it will be <br />
time enough to look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forward</span> to
increase <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the market. That time</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> hardly arriv- <br />ed. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reading</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement</span>
made in re- <br />
gard to the result of the election, and <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">votes</span> for and against the
Scheme, I <br />
have to state that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement</span> does
not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> whole of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anti-Confederate</span> <br />
vote in the Province. I think it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span>
due to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">myself,</span> as well as to the
constituency of <br />
the County of Victoria to state that there <br />
was not one vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">polled</span> for
Confedera- <br />
tion in that County. <br />

by the Provincial Secretary seeking for<br />
a Union of the Maritime Provinces. It <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was distinctly stated</span> here that the Pro- <br />

into any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">negotiations,</span>
for the matter was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to be submitted to the House. I </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">little</span> <br />
expected when we consented to the ap- <br />
pointment of that delegation that a mi-<br />
nority of the Executive Council would<br />
have gone to Canada and agreed to a<br />
proposition to unite these Colonies. I<br />
take the broad ground and put it forth<br />
without fear of contradiction, that when<br />
that Conference met at Quebec, there<br />
could be no doubt, from the language<br />
used by the delegates, that it was to be<br />
adjudicated upon by the late Legislature.<br />
If the Government of which I was a mem-<br />
ber, had been sufficiently strong to have<br />
carried that measure through the House<br />
they would have done so. It has been <br />
said that I had foresight enough to see<br />
what. would be the result of the election,
<br />
but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assert</span> and can prove <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> six hours <br />
after I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saw</span> the resolutions of
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confer-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ence,</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">took</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong objection</span>
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
