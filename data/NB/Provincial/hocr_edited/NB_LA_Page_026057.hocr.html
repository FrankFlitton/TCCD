<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCCLELLAN—Another</span> point dwelt<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon </span>was the origin of the idea
of a Union<br />
of the Colonies. I do not know whether<br />
he refers to the difference in the race and<br />
creed of the Canadians. He quotes from <br />
Mr. Galt's speech, and says these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficul-</span>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCCLELLAN.—He</span>
said the difficul-<br />
ties were sufficient in themselves to bring <br />
this about, but it might have been lapsus<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">linguce.</span> But let us look at the
opinion of<br />
the Lower Canadians on this point. Mr.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
McClellan here read from Cartier's speech,<br />
who is a Frenchman himself, to show that</span></span><br />
the difference of races and religions was<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
an additional argument in favour of Union; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
thus merging <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">everything</span> in one
general<br />
rally around one general constitutional<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government, filled from</span> petty
sectarian, or<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
national, factious, impediments and en- <br />
tanglements. That I think is a much<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">higher view to take than to bring it
down<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to a matter of creed and races, and to get<br />
her out of her difficulties while we incur <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
none ourselves by this great Union. It is <br />
somewhat embarrassing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> rise <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> speak<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
for Confederation, for we may be charged<br />
with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> actuated by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">selfish</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motives
;</span> it <br />
may be said that we are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">looking toward</span><br />
Ottawa. I should like to see the Hon. <br />
President of the Council at Ottawa. for I<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
am sure his abilities would shine there,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> and I think he would gain a wider and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> higher view of the wants of these Colo-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
nies. It is a poor principle, however, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
refuse great national benefits, because<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
some personal benefit may arise from it.<br />
If this principle were to hold then all<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
would be precluded from doing anything<br />
for the good of mankind. But all these<br />
charges of ambitious and selfish motives<br />
need not be conﬁned to one side. May<br />
we not also ask if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Hon.
President of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the Council did not in the position he took,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
see his present seat looming up in the <br />
distance ? I say nothing against it ; I am<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
glad to see him there, and should like to<br />
see him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">higher,</span> but I do not
like to see<br />
him in his present company. Is he not as <br />
open to these kind a charges as these <br />
delegates ? Did not some other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span>
<br />
even than that he now occupies open up <br />
before him ? And I do not blame him if<br />
it did. I do not say it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so,</span>
but simply<br />
that he is as open to such charges as<br />
others. He says the Government was un-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popular ; </span>why not say that they
were a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
dead weight on Confederation ? And that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
if as they went down the great talents of <br />
my hon. and learned <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> to be <br />
called <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">up,</span> there would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chance</span> opened<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for many for ofﬁce and emolument ; I
say<br />
this might have been if the principle he<br />
enunciates be true. Although this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques-</span><br />
tion has been a long time before the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
mother <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> yet it has only
been a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
short time before our people, and to take<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
up a great principle and oppose it on the<br />
simple basis of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taxation</span> is
certainly tak-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing </span>advantage of the ignorance
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">credu-</span><br />
lity of the people. This argument of the<br />
opponents of the Scheme had its weight.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
And then in the southern part of the Pro-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
vince the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were vary</span> much
guided<br />
by<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> ecclesiastical influences ; for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">although</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Archbishop</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of Halifax</span> had boldly come<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out and declared</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
yet by some means or other the priests in<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the southern part of the Province at least<br />
were combined to use their inﬂuence over<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the people to vote against it.<br />

MCCLELLAN.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—I do not know what<br />
the hon. member for the City of Saint<br />
John means by cramming and plugging,<br />
but from such expressions becoming fre-<br />
quent of late and appearing in the Re-<br />
ports, I am getting used to it. He can-<br />
not stifle free discussion in this House, if<br />
such did prevail at elections. It seems to<br />
be inferred that all who are opposed to<br />
Confederation must necessarily be in fa-<br />
vor of these Resolutions. Now although<br />
there may be a majority here against the<br />
Scheme, yet they may not all be willing to<br />
appoint the delegation, as the people of<br />
England by the Times and the action of<br />
this country know all about it. There<br />
may be many who may think the state of<br />
the country will not admit of these splen-<br />
did delegations. We heard that we were<br />
not to have so many of them as hereto-<br />
fore, but the anxiety to have one now ap-<br />
pointed puts me in mind of a boy going<br />
through a churchyard and whistling to<br />
keep his courage up. It seems as though<br />
after all the apparent carelessness as to<br />
the result that there was a feeling lest<br />
Confederation was not quite dead yet, or<br />
at least that it might after all rise up and<br />
frighten them. I do not know who the<br />
delegates will be, probably the hon. Pre-<br />
sident of the Council and the hon. mem-<br />
ber from Saint John, (Mr. Anglin) will be<br />
among them, and if so it may be as well<br />
for the one to visit the home of his child-<br />
hood and the familiar scenes that will be<br />
presented to him there, the other may<br />
perhaps go to Paris, where he would have<br />
a very nice time of course, and all at the<br />
people's expense. The Resolutions now<br />
under discussion clearly affirm that the<br />
judgment of the people has been pro-<br />
nounced, and that Her Majesty's Govern-<br />
ment has been apprised of the fact, and<br />
it goes on to ask the appointment of a<br />
delegation to go home to tell them again. I<br />
will now read a little article I have here,<br />
transcribed from the London Times to<br />
the columns of the Freeman with the com-<br />
ments of A <span class="unclear" title="unsure what this says">?</span>

position which <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have so</span> long occupied without com- <br />
plaint on our part or theirs." The hon. <br />
member, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr. Anglin)</span> quoted the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Times,</span> <br />
to justify his position. I give the above, as <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his </span>own quotation too<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>a complete
offset. <br />
The hon. President says the sayings of  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">public</span>
men can be properly referred to. <br />He was a public man in 1857, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span>
<br />
did he then say in this House of Mr. Til- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ley,</span>
when that gentleman had been reject-  <br />ed by his constituents on another question.<br />
He (Mr.Smith) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deeply</span> regretted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the ab-</span> <br />
sence from office of the late Provincial<br />
Secretary, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Tilley. To that gentle- <br />
man, who was now within his hearing—so <br />
was he yesterday—he would offer no eulo- <br />
gism ; but this he would say, his absence <br />
from the ofﬁce <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was a</span> great loss, and was <br />
so regarded throughout the whole Pro-  <br />
vince, where his talent and honesty were <br />
known and recognized. Was it such a <br />
man who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> lend himself to the
syste- <br />
matic ruin of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province ? </span>or
were hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to be</span> told by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> political pro- <br />
teous who now held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the office</span> that
Mr. <br />
Tilley was not ﬁt to discharge his duty, <br />
&amp;c.. &amp;c." What change has “come over <br />
the spirit of his dreams,"- -the political <br />
proteus, his colleague now, is converted <br />
into a miracle of finance, and the Hon. <br />
Mr. Tilley has been plotting and conspir-<br />
ing to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enslave</span>
his native country ! It is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">perfectly</span> understood that
Confederation <br />
will not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> forced on this
country, and yet <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I heard</span> an hon. member say that
unless <br />
a delegation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> sent Home
this con- <br />
spiracy would have its effect, and the <br />
country would be enslaved. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I can</span>
im- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agine</span> my hon. friend going to
Fishmonger <br />
Hall and making his mark there ; but I <br />
hope if they go they will tell not only the <br />
truth, but the whole truth. Tell them <br />
that the number of Anti-Confederate <br />
members in this House does not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corres-</span>
<br />
pond with the feeling on the question in <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> I hope that they
will show <br />
that there were not over six hundred <br />
votes <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">majority</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the Scheme in the <br />
late elections, and that many of those who <br />
opposed it then have since changed their <br />
views. This is the case I know in Albert ; <br />
I find, in conversation with intelligent <br />
men, that it is so in Fredericton, and I <br />
hear it is the same in many other parts of <br />
the country. I hope they will tell the <br />
people of England and Ireland, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where-</span>
<br />
ever they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go,</span> that the people of
this <br />
Province are not such fools as to reject <br />
Colonial Union—a Union upheld by all <br />
the colonists of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">distinction</span>
for the past <br />
half century. The Hon. Joseph Howe <br />
has always stood up for this Union, and <br />
so has Judge Johnston, a man of the <br />
highest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attainment.</span><br />
I may here advert to a remark of Lord <br />
Durham, to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">show</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> Colonial Union <br />
was necessary in the opinion of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
eminent constitutionist, in order to rid <br />
the separate colonies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the
disorders <br />
arising from the inﬂuence of designing <br />
and ambitious individuals, as by afford- <br />
ing a large scope for the desires of such <br />
men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as sha</span>ll direct their ambition into <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legitimate</span> character of
furthering, <br />
and not of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thwarting,</span> their
Government. <br />
“ By <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">creating</span> high prizes, in a
general <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> Government, we
shall <br />
immediately <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> the means of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pacify-</span> <br />
ing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the turbulent</span> ambitious, and
of em- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ploying,</span>
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worthy</span> and noble <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">occupa-</span> <br />tions, the talents which are now only<br />
exerted to foment disorder." I am <br />
anxious to give my friend, the President <br />
of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council, </span>a wider scope for
his <br />
powers and ability, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> hope
that he <br />
