<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> them ? They cannot. I have
express- <br />

<br />
had established a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">new</span> dynasty, a
new re- <br />

sible Government in operation, whether it <br />
is for weal or woe, we are bound to carry <br />
out that principle of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility</span>
in all <br />
our actions. It is something extraordinary <br />
if thirty-six members are afraid of some <br />
three or four Generals. I am not afraid <br />
of them, and I doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> any

on our <br />

I do not <br />
care how many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Generals</span> there are
on the<br />
floors of the House ; if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
principles of-<br />
responsible and departmental Government <br />
are true, t<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here</span> are no offices
but what the <br />
head officer should be a political one. <br />
These are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> political <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">views</span> I entertain <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. CONNELL.—There was a very grave <br />
reflection made <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">upon</span> me by two
hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hous</span>e.
I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expected</span>, from <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">standing</span> which those hon.
members <br />
have in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> that they
would have <br />
understood the usage of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span>
and<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> they made a statement
respect- <br />
in<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">g</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">character</span> of a late <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">head</span> of a de- <br />
partment, they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> have been
prepared <br />
to have proved it. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">challenge</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> to <br />
bring <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forward</span> their proof of the
statements <br />
they have made. I wish to show to the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> the position <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> occupy by the <br />
course <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> took with reference
to my <br />
position while head<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> of a department.
If <br />
the office had not been here, but had been <br />
kept at the City of St. John, I would not <br />
have got an important missive from the <br />
office, and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">just</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indignation</span> of the <br />
House and country would have been <br />
poured upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my he</span>ad. Happily for
me I <br />
am in a position to show to the House <br />
and country that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> state<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ments</span> are not <br />
founded in truth, and have no foundation <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whatever.</span> In refe<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rence to Elijah Clark.,<br />
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> true there was an invest<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">igation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">into</span>
<br />
this loss of a letter. It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">investigated</span>
<br />
by Mr. Johnson, and I also investigated <br />
the matter, and I found the direction of <br />
Elijah <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Clark</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> to send it by steamer <br />
from St. John ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead</span> of that
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <br />
sent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Calais,</span>
in the United <br />
States. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">department</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span> sent the <br />
letter contrary to the direction. I believed <br />
the money ought to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pa</span>id, and
I re- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ported</span> these facts without taking
any <br />
action in the matter. I was not pres<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ent</span>
<br />
during <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> sitting of the last
Legislature<br />
when these charges <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> made
against <br />
me. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">surprised</span> that no
member of <br />
the Government was found to place me <br />
in a proper position. I am now here to <br />
answer for myself. While I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">held</span>
that <br />
ofﬁce I challen<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ge</span> any man to show
where<br />
I was derelict in my duty or did not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dis-</span>

it, but I have not see wherein there will<br />
be any great amount of saving. This is<br />
a great change, and ought not to be made<br />
