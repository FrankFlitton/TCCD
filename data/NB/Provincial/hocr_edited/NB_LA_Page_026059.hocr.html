<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MCCLELLAN resumed.—There<br />
were some remarks made by my hon.<br />
friend from Charlotte, (Dr. Thomson)<br />
during the interruption yesterday, in re-<br />
ference to as statement I had made about<br />
the influence of the clergy at the late<br />
elections. I did not design any disre-<br />
spect to any denomination, and do not<br />
think any member could say I made use<br />
of offensive language at all. My hon.<br />
and learned friend from the City of St.<br />
John, (Mr. Wetmore) during the inter-<br />
ruption, made some covert insinuation,<br />
that members who undertook to address<br />
this House after having been crammed<br />
the night before, were not entitled to<br />
great consideration. I did not clearly<br />
understand the inuendo at the time, at<br />
first I thought he referred to the splen-<br />
did social affair at the Exhibition build-<br />
ing the night before, and possibly the<br />
hon. member himself may have satisfied<br />
himself to expletion on that occasion,<br />
as for me, I was not present, and did not<br />
participate in those festivities. If he<br />
referred to intellectual as cramming, I<br />
can only tell him confidentially, for this<br />
matter does not concern the public at all,<br />
that on his part it is all a matter of fancy,<br />
not of fact. It is better for hon. mem-<br />
bers to express themselves frankly and<br />
openly, and not deal in such ambiguous<br />
allusions, and if my hon. and learned<br />
friend thinks he can suppress discussion<br />
by interruptions of that kind he is very<br />
much mistaken ; it may be well to resist<br />
discussion upon important questions at<br />
an election, but it will not be so easy to<br />
strangle free discussion on the floors of<br />
the Legislature. My learned friend<br />
(the Dr.) has taken occasion to proclaim<br />
himself a representative of the Tory ele-<br />
ment ; he frankly avows his sentiments ;<br />
he said the duties and attributes of Tories<br />
were to " fear God, honor the King, and<br />
deal uprightly with all men" ; and it was<br />
upon that his political principles were<br />
founded. I recollect a story told to il-<br />
lustrate the principles of toryism. A<br />
Tory was represented as being like a<br />
toad which had been buried in the solid<br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_7" title="bbox 1555 137 1804 232"><p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> rock for a hundred years, but upon ex-<br />
posing him to the light of day and the<br />
vivifying beams of the sun he would,<br />
with twinkling eyes, pop out from his<br />
hiding place to the other toads, his com-<br />
peers, and perfectly oblivious of the fact<br />
that he is a hundred years behind the<br />
age. I do not wish to apply this to the<br />
learned Dr. from Charlotte. I am not<br />
saying that he is hopping along with<br />
the other toadies. I merely refer to this<br />
to show the sentiments and principles<br />
of Torryism. The resolution before you<br />
says Confederation will be politically,<br />
commercially and financially injurious<br />
to this Province. I shall not speak now<br />
upon the financial part of the subject,<br />
because that has been gone into by the<br />
hon. gentlemen from Carleton and Res-<br />
tigouche. I think that aspect of the<br />
question has been met, and the opposi-<br />
tion to the measure have failed to show<br />
such results would follow this union as<br />
would justify the appointment of this<br />
delegation. I feel confident that Con-<br />
federation can be sustained upon finan-<br />
cial grounds alone, without regard to<br />
the benefits arising from the construc-<br />
tion of the Inter-colonial railway, which<br />
gives us 200 miles of railway, bringing<br />
the traffic of the West into New Bruns-<br />
wick. Immense advantages will flow<br />
from that road, uniting, as it does, the<br />
coal fields of the Eastern section with<br />
the metaliferous regions of the Western<br />
part of the Province and Canada. This<br />
road is not to be built with our own<br />
money, but the money of a people who<br />
have beeen denominated by many in this<br />
House as strangers. They are not<br />
strangers, but brother colonists, united<br />
and bound one colony to another. We<br />
should have that feeling of regard for<br />
them as would induce us to legislate<br />
for their interests as well as our own.<br />
It is the correct principle for any peo-<br />
ple to so legislate that they will place<br />
themselves in a position to buy in the<br />
cheapest market and sell in the dearest.<br />
This road will not only give us an ex-<br />
tended market, but will enable us to re-<br />
ceive the surplus productions of West-<br />
ern Canada ; it will produce benefits of<br />
which we have at present no conception.<br />
A person would suppose from listening<br />
to the remarks of some of the hon-<br />
orable gentlemen that they wished to<br />
re-enact the old protection laws, which<br />
were abolished years ago. They<br />
tell us that those men who signed a<br />
document in St. John expressing their<br />
views on this question, were men of no<br />
influence. They were men doing a large<br />
business, and were favorable to the exten-<br />
sion of the principles of free trade and<br />
fair competition with their neighbours, for<br />
they felt confidence in the resources of<br />
New Brunswick. The Hon. President of<br />
the Council alluded to a statement which<br />
I had made, that in six months there would<br />
be a change in the opinions of the people<br />
on this question, and there would be a<br />
large majority of the people of this coun-<br />
try in favor of Confederation ; he took the<br />
opposite ground, and did not believe that<br />
this would be the case. I said " try it."<br />
he answered that the cause of Confedera-<br />
tion was desperate, and we were willing<br />
to try anything. I did not in my allusion<br />
refer to a dissolution of the House, but I<br />
referred to putting the matter before the<br />
country as a distinct question, outside of<br />
party difficulties and troubles altogether,<br />
so that the people could vote yea or nay<br />
upon the question, free from the entangle-<br />
ments of politics ; if it was so submitted,<br />
and means of instruction afforded them<br />
upon this question, I said they would have<br />

</div>
<hr /><div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_15" title="bbox 1011 1570 1342 1746">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> a two-thirds majority in a very short time<br />
in favor of this measure. The hon. mem-<br />
ber says that was my opinion before ; I<br />
says I never was very sanguine of carrying<br />
this question before, for I knew the<br />
strength and ability of my learned friend<br />
—I knew his declamation powers—I knew<br />
his influence in the County of Albert, and<br />
I feared the effect of that declamation ;<br />
but in that County they took hold of the<br />
question and sifted it to the bottom, and<br />
they came to the conclusion that Confed-<br />
eration would build up this country, and<br />
it would prove a benefit to them whether<br />
they were miners, farmers, or fishermen.<br />
My hon. friend says my eyes were in Ot-<br />
tawa. I can tell him that I had no aspira-<br />
tions of that kind. I had no idea of go-<br />
ing into a new arena, but was content to<br />
serve my country in that Legislature,<br />
which, to adopt their own style of argu-<br />
ments, would be a mere municipality ;<br />
therefore, I cannot see how they can stig-<br />
matize as being actuated by any views<br />
of self-aggrandizement. He has put for-<br />
ward his great magnanimity in resigning<br />
his large salary and giving up a high posi-<br />
tion to protect the country from a great<br />
infliction, as he expressed it a that time ;<br />
and he considers that a reason why the<br />
people should give him credit for being<br />
the most patriotic man in the country.<br />
Although I never was in a position to<br />
give up a salary, or an office, yet I have<br />
been in a position to refuse to accept of<br />
one ; when parties were evenly balanced<br />
in this Legislature, I was offered one of<br />
the highest positions in the country, if I<br />
would desert my political principles, but<br />
I felt that while men were only for the<br />
passing hour, principles were undying. I<br />
hope that when this delegation—or this<br />
little pleasure excursion—goes to Eng-<br />
land at the expense of both Confederates<br />
and Anti-Confederates, they will repre-<br />
sent to the British Government the true<br />
state of feeling in this country, had state<br />
that a large majority of the other branch<br />
of the Legislature are in favor of the<br />
Scheme. When they arrive in England<br />
they will receive very little sympathy<br />
from the English people, or ministry. The<br />
British Government will reply to them in<br />
this way : "Gentlemen, we knew this be-<br />
fore ; we have received information that<br />
the people of New Brunswick have reject-<br />
ed this Union, therefore we do not see the<br />
object of your mission." After they have<br />
received this rebuff they had better<br />
lengthen their excursion, and go to Africa.<br />
There, according to Dr. Livingston or<br />
Capt. Spoke, they will find little kingdoms<br />
with about 20,000 inhabitants holding<br />
their Courts with all the ceremony of lar-<br />
ger kingdoms, their interests all being<br />
centered in themselves, each one of these<br />
having its own peculiar habits and cus-<br />
toms, and it is their particular care to<br />
keep these distinctions up. There they<br />
will find the exact exemplification of the<br />
principles enunciated here. They are not<br />
willing to break down the barriers of trade<br />
and carry out the principles of liberalism<br />
and reform, neither are they willing to<br />
unite these Colonies and make them the<br />
germ of a mighty nation. They are not<br />
willing to do what would advance our best<br />
interests and prove a lasting benefit ; for<br />
to unite would prove a benefit whether we<br />
remain as a great Colonial Confederacy<br />
united under the British Government, or<br />
whether we adopt the other alternative<br />
and drift into Annexation. I can imagine<br />
the feelings of this delegation on their re-<br />
turn, after finding the matter had been<br />
fairly discussed in the House of Commons.<br />
Homeward bound, they will repeat the old<br />
nursery rhyme:—
