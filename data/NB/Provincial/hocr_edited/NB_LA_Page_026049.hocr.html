this representation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span>

should look simply to the passing hour<br />
when framing a Constitution, but should<br />
look into the future, and lay the founda-<br />
tions broad and deep, in order to meet the<br />
requirements of coming time. How is<br />
this eighty cents per head on the present<br />
population going to provide for our local<br />
wants fifty years hence, for we know that<br />
the wants of a country increases with the<br />
population ? We will have to resort to<br />
direct taxation. We will now see the<br />
amount we pay for Roads and Bridges,<br />
and what Canada pays ; for when we are<br />
invited to join our interest with Canada,<br />
we should see how she provides for her<br />
own people. We know that we have to<br />
pay $119,000 a year for our Roads and<br />
Bridges, and that it is insufficient to pro-<br />
vied for them ; but the Canadians pay, on<br />
an equal amount of population, only $15,-<br />
000 for that purpose. For Education we<br />
give $13,000 ; in the same proportion<br />
Canada gives $5,000 or $6,000. The late<br />
Surveyor General says this taxation is a<br />
" great bugbear." Bugbear, forsooth !<br />

sitions and get their <span class="unclear" title="unsure how to add the british pound sign">?</span>600 a year,

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ance to</span> those who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> to labor, and it is<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a question </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affects</span>

<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway.</span> Was it stated by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span>
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantages</span> we were to de- <br />
rive from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this road, w</span>e were to
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contribute</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Canal system ?</span> Do you
think
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">George</span> Brown would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">change</span> his mind on<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
this Railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question, unless</span> he
felt there<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
was an advantage to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gained</span>
for this<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
Canal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">system, for he is a man that has</span>
<br />
ever been characterized as having an eye<br />
single to the interests of Upper Canada.<br />
Those Canals will not only be of no ad-<br />
vantage to the people of the Lower Pro-<br />
vinces, but will be an injury to them if<br />
the Intercolonial Railway is built, because<br />
they would take the traffic in another di-<br />
rection instead of going on this Railway<br />
to Halifax. We will have to pay our<br />
share for extending those Canals, which<br />
are going to be an injury to us. Hon.<br />
members say there will be two parties in<br />
Canada, and the Lower Provinces will<br />
hold the balance of power. I am pre-<br />
pared to admit that, in general politics ;<br />
but when we come to matters of local ex-<br />
penditure they will be united in one. By<br />
way of illustration, we will say : my hon.<br />
colleague and I are in opposition, and take<br />
different sides in politics ; but when a<br />
Bill comes before the House for an ap-<br />
propriation of money for the County which<br />
we represent, we work side by side. If<br />
$20,000,000 or $30 000,000 was to be<br />
levied upon the people of the Confederacy<br />
for the extension of those Canals, those<br />
parties would be united as one ; their po-<br />
litical differences would not divide them,<br />
but they would act together and form one<br />
unbroken phalanx. In seventeen years Up-<br />
per Canada—taking the ratio of increase<br />
for the last twenty years—would have a nu-<br />
merical majority of representatives over all<br />
the rest, whereas we get no increase, but<br />
are liable to decrease ; because if Lower<br />
Canada increases faster than we do, our<br />
number will be reduced. Numerical<br />

power whether it be for our advantage or<br />
disadvantage. We are told we enter<br />
this Confederacy upon the most favor-<br />
able terms, and that Canada is going to<br />
build our railway. Where is the money<br />
to come from if they are not able to pay<br />
the interest on their own debts ? Their<br />
expenditure has been more than their re-<br />
ceipts except last year ; they have ex-<br />
hausted every resource ; they have their<br />
toll gates on the roads, and they resort to<br />
the most obnoxious taxes to which no<br />
country resorts, except in the last extre-<br />
mity ; they have imposed their stamp du-<br />
ties, which are never imposed until every<br />
other means of raising money has failed.<br />
If we entered this Confederation we would<br />
have these stamp duties, and our taxes<br />
would be increased and applied to the<br />
Canal extension in Canada, and the open-<br />
ing up of the North Western Territory. It<br />
is provided in the Scheme that " the com-<br />
munications with the North-Western Ter-<br />
ritory, and the improvements required for<br />
the development of the Trade of the<br />
Great West with the seaboard, are re-<br />
garded by this Conference as subjects of<br />
the highest importance to the Federated<br />
Provinces, and shall be prosecuted at the<br />
earliest possible period that the state of<br />
the Finances will permit." Who is to<br />
determine when the state of the Finances<br />
permit ? Who is determine when the<br />
North West Territory is to be opened up ?<br />
It will be Canada, for she has the unlimi-<br />
ted power of taxing the Confederacy, and<br />
her part of the taxes will be more than<br />
made up by the increased expenditure.<br />
Who then can say we go into Confedera-<br />
tion under more favorable circumstances<br />
than Canada ? She can make the Canals<br />
entirely free in order to attract the trade<br />
within her own bosom ; her debt being<br />
contracted for rebel losses, and the expen-<br />
diture on these Canals will never be pro-<br />
ductive, which will never yield two per<br />
cent. Our debt is incurred in construct-<br />
ing Railroads in the Province which<br />
would become the property of the Con-<br />
federation. We go into this Union with<br />
a debt of $7,000,000, and if our railroad<br />
pays six per cent, which it may do after<br />
Western Extension and the connection<br />
with Nova Scotia are built, we will go in<br />
without any debt at all ; we will give up<br />
our revenue of $700,000, and receive $0<br />
cents a head, amounting to $201,000.<br />
The control of our railroad will be in Otta-<br />
way, and any man who has a charge<br />
against the road will have to go to Cana-<br />
da to get redress. That accounts to my<br />
mind why it was that public officials con-<br />
nected with the Railway became active<br />
partizans in favor of this Scheme ; never<br />
did I see the powers of Government so<br />
completely prostrated ; they used their<br />
influence upon all persons who held of-<br />
fice, and all those who expected to get<br />
office ; they controlled thousands and<br />
thousands of votes in this country ; but<br />
the people of this country were true to<br />
their own interest, and resisted the influ-<br />
ences brought to bear, and rose in their<br />
power and rejected the Scheme with in-<br />
dignation. I should like to have some<br />
one here to speak on behalf of that dele-<br />
gation ; they have two of the delegates in<br />
the Upper House, for the people could not<br />
reach them, but every one of them the<br />
people could reach they hurled from place<br />
and power. Everything that was in the<br />
power of the Government to do, was done<br />
to carry the election ; they told the people<br />
of Fredericton they would secure the seat<br />
of Government for ever. Was that fair<br />
to appeal to people's prejudices and local<br />
feelings in order to influence them on this<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great
question ? Why was it that the offi-<br />
cers in the Post Office Department took an<br />
active part in this election? It was because<br />
every man connected with the Post Office<br />
would become independents of the people<br />
of this country. When the Custom House<br />
officers in this Province were appointed<br />
in England, the people were not treated<br />
as well as they are now. Neither would<br />
the people of this Province be satisfied<br />
or their interests served by having their<br />
officers only responsible at Ottaway. It<br />
is said now that our Legislature is too small<br />
to work out the principles of Re-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sponsible Government ; for after it is
di-<br />
vided into two parties it is difficult to<br />
find men competent to discharge the du-<br />
ties of these offices. Let us imagine this<br />
Legislature reduced to a mere Munici-<br />
pality. Would any man of talent accept<br />
a seat in it ? and this Legislature would<br />
have to keep up all the officers in the Go-<br />
vernment, as they have now in conduct-<br />
ing the administration of the country.<br />
To do what ? To issue Tavern Licenses<br />
and fix bells on sheep, as the hon. member<br />
for York has remarked. Under the pro-<br />
visions of this Bill they have agreed to<br />
give Newfoundland $150,000 per annum.<br />
According to that, the people of this Pro-<br />
vince will have to pay Newfoundland<br />
twelve or thirteen thousand dollars a-year;<br />
that is our portion of what is paid for her<br />
mines and minerals. I can conceive<br />
Newfoundland refusing to go into Confe-<br />
deration, and this was a bribe offered her<br />
to induce her to enter. I put it distinct-<br />
ly to the country, whether they are will-<br />
ing to invest to the extent of $13,000,000<br />
a-year for ever in those mines and mine-<br />
rals which are utterly valueless. Then<br />
again, it was agreed that all engagements<br />
entered into for defence, should be as-<br />
sumed by the General Government. It<br />
is well known that a delegation went<br />
home from Canada, and it was supposed<br />
they went in connection with this busi-<br />
ness, and we would be bound to contri-<br />
bute our share towards any expnse so in-<br />
curred. Is it not surprising that this Go-<br />
vernment should give its consent to a pro-<br />
position of that kind, that they should go</span><br />
blind fold into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an arrangement</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
<br />
had no voice in regard to how <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span>
<br />
should be expended. Then again <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span>
<br />
could derive no advantage <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercially,</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span>
Canada can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufacture articles</span><br />
much cheaper than we can. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I will state
to</span> <br />
you the reasons which <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> Annand
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gives</span> <br />
why Nova Scotia did not accept the offer <br />
of free trade from Canada. Some two or <br />
three years ago when it was pressed upon <br />

Finacne Minister :—<br />
