<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> elected to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oppose</span>
the scheme. Among <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span> their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">indictments,</span> I cannot see that <br />
one has been sustained. I cannot see <br />
one reason for turning out the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span>
<br />
Government. It is true, since they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">came</span>
<br />
into power <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> has been a
continual cry <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throughout</span> the country that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> <br />
had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">changed</span> their minds about
Confed-<br />
eration. In the County of King's, if <br />
there is any change, it is rather against <br />
the scheme. I admit there has been <br />
an oversight in not observing that the <br />
Export Duty Law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> about to
expire. <br />
Of that overnight the Government have <br />
taken the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility and</span> the
difficulty <br />
has been remedied without the loss of a <br />
single dollar. If they have been guilty <br />
of the omission, they might well be ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cused</span> under the circumstances.
There <br />
was a continual pressure brought to bear <br />
upon them from Canada, England, and <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederates</span> of this
Province; and <br />
the press has been most unscrupulous. <br />
The Provincial Secretary has said all I <br />
had to say about them, and I agree with <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">every</span> word he said concerning
them. <br />
My hon. friend from Carleton (Mr. Lind- <br />
say) has <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said</span> the British
Government <br />
wished us to enter into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span>
<br />
I look upon this question as one for the <br />
people of New Brunswick to decide. I<br />
do not believe we are to be dictated to <br />
even by the British Government, and we <br />
should not submit to Downing Street <br />
dictation. I have heard the hon. mover <br />
of the amendment harangue the House in <br />
former times, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">complaining</span> of the
Govern- <br />
ment being led by Downing Street dic-<br />
tation. My hon. friend has told us that<br />
if we were loyal subjects of Great Britain, <br />
we would submit to any thing. (Mr. <br />
Lindsay,—I said <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">loyalty</span>
consisted in <br />
obedience.) When I speak of the Queen <br />
I speak with respect; but those men in <br />
ofﬁce are no more than we are. They <br />
may be there to-day and out to-morrow. <br />
What does Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cardwell</span> know
about the <br />
benefits arising from Confederation? The <br />
people have told Mr. Cardwell that they <br />
do not want Confederation. but still the <br />
scheme is agitated; and we have the for- <br />
ty-second member of the House going <br />
through the length and breadth of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
land, lecturing the people upon the bene- <br />
ﬁts of the scheme—a professional poli- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tician,</span> with nothing to do but to
stir up <br />
people's minds about Confederation. He <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> now on the ﬂoors of the House,
or the <br />
next thing to it. l heard, my hon. friend <br />
(Mr. Wetmore) talk about the stuffing <br />
process. I think he is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getting</span>
as much <br />
stuffing as any other hon. member in <br />
this House, and I think my hon. friend <br />
from Westmorland is getting stuffed <br />
too. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. WETMORE.</span>—My

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> it a well-written article. I read that
dis- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">patch</span> over to a person who had
told me<br />
it was one of the worst documents he<br />
ever saw. But before I got through, he <br />
said the country ought to be proud that <br />
they had seven men, such men in the Go-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vernment,</span> who would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">honestly</span> express <br />
their opinions.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">I was always in favor of union, and <br />
when the Quebec Scheme came up, I<br />
tried, if possible, to agree with it. I<br />
sifted it, and came to the conclusion that <br />
New Brunswick would be nowhere under <br />
that scheme; for under it, I do not be-<br />
lieve the rights and interests of the people <br />
are protected. (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Lindsay,—</span>How,<br />
then, can you eulogize the men who said <br />
they were opposed to a union of
the <br />
Provinces?) I gave them credit for <br />
using those strong terms. We do not <br />
want any closer union with Canada, un- <br />
less we see the rights of the people pro-<br />
tected. (Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Wetmore,—Did</span> you
say, <br />
during the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election,</span> that you <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> in favor <br />
of union?) We had the Quebec Scheme, <br />
and we had to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">allow the</span> whole
of it or <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reject</span> it. I told the people that
l looked <br />
upon a union of the colonies as advan- <br />
tageous, but I did all I could to satisfy <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people that the Quebec Scheme
was <br />
not the scheme for New Brunswick; and <br />
I should be recreant to my trust if I <br />
went against those men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who</span>
formed this <br />
Government on those principles, for if <br />
they were ousted, I have no doubt but it <br />
would be an advantage to the scheme. I <br />
believe people are apt to change their mind.<br />
I have changed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my</span> mind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in some</span>
things. <br />
I was a young politician when I came <br />
here, and in the course of my political life <br />
in this House, I always condemned <br />
a Government for dismissing
good public <br />
servants to put others <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in their</span>
place, but <br />
I have got to be almost a smasher on <br />
that point. I used to think the
Govern-<br />
ment would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">live down</span> such
opposition, <br />
but I believe now that when a public offi- <br />
cer goes out to canvass, and uses his <br />
ofﬁce for a canvassing shop, he should be <br />
turned out of his office at once. (Mr. L. <br />
P. W. DesBrissy.—I would ask
him how <br />
he supports a Government that is unable <br />
to turn out even the meanest man holding <br />
an office in this Province?) <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. KERR spoke ﬁrst (but owing to <br />
noise in the House we could not catch <br />
the exact purport of his observations). <br />
He called the attention of the Attorney <br />
General to the Bill.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> ATTORNEY GENERAL said the <br />
observations of the hon. member of Nor- <br />
thumberland showed better than any ob- <br />
servations he could make the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effect</span>
of <br />
going into Confederation under the <br />
Quebec Scheme, with its cardinal prin- <br />
ciple of representation by population. <br />
It was said there was no danger of the <br />
Province with its limited representation <br />
being swamped. But here at home in the <br />
attitude assumed by that hon. member in <br />
this Bill, Was an illustration on a small <br />
scale of what would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">happen</span> to
the Pro- <br />
vince under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> It
had been <br />
said that if the Province went into Con- <br />
federation, that it would not be taxed <br />
for the construction of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canals</span>
in
Cana- <br />
da, for it would have a voice in the mat- <br />
ter. But how, with an overwhelming <br />
Canadian majority, and on questions af-<br />
fecting Canadian interests, could the re- <br />
presentatives of the Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">protect</span>
it <br />
against large expenditures. With re-<br />
gard to the Bill under consideration, its <br />
object was simply to extend the time <br />
given to the Company to construct the <br />
railway from two to five years. The Sub- <br />
sidy Act under which the Company was <br />
formed was now the lay of the land; <br />
there was no limitation to it. It was no <br />
act of grace; therefore to give any Com- <br />
pany the privileges of the Bill; it was a
le- <br />
gislative <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right.</span> He thought the
Com- <br />
pany ought to have the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extension</span>
of time; <br />
they were expecting aid from England, <br />
and the result would, he anticipated, be <br />
the construction of the railway. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. C<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ONNELL</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> no objection to <br />
support the Bill. With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference</span>
to the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objections</span> raised by the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> of<br />
Northumberland (Mr. Kerr), he thought <br />
that the people of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span>
Shore were <br />
much more able to take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advantage</span>
of the <br />
Subsidy Act, and build a railway in that <br />
district, than the people of St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Stephen</span><br />
and Woodstock to construct their bran-<br />
ches.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. HILL <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubted</span>
