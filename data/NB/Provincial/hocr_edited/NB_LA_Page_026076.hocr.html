<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> delayed by the <br />
Government to suit their own purposes. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> did not wish to meet the
representa- <br />
tives of the people any sooner. Why was <br />
the Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Attorne</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">y</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">General</span>
sent to Wash- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ington,</span> if the Government was so
weak <br />
they could not convene this House until <br />
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">returned ?</span> Why not have sent
a com- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mercial</span> man, or some other member
or <br />
this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House?</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Agai</span>n, look at the course <br />
they took in calling this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together ;</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proclamation</span> after <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proclamation, </span>a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span> <br />
days then, and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span> days more. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> <br />
was consistent with every other act of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">administration</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> this Government. <br />
Look at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation</span> of last
year. The<br />
Government tried to make the word anti<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation</span> the political
shibbeloth <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">throughout</span> the country. Every man
could <br />
not come to that mark was proscribed. <br />
They are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederate</span> now. You
cannot <br />
put <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">your finger</span> upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">A</span>ct
of importance <br />
passed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> the last <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Session,</span> except <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> “Military <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Act."</span> They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tried</span> to abol- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ish</span> the office of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Postmaster</span> General, but <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">considered</span> of all others that
office <br />
should be political. Why did they not <br />
ﬁll it ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Because they</span> could not
get a man<br />
who had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> chance of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> re-elected if he <br />
went <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back</span> to his constituents.
His hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend,</span> (Hon. Mr. Smith) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">laugh,</span>
<br />
but he knows it is the truth. This Gov- <br />
ernment cannot perform <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
functions of <br />
a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span> which are to
control, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regu</span>-<br />
late and influence the Legislature of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country.</span> They brought forward a
Post <br />
Office Bill as a Government measure . <br />
That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bill</span> was intended to
abolish the of- <br />
fice of political Postmaster Genreal ; but<br />
of all the Departments of the country,<br />
none are more requisite to be made politi-<br />
cal and retained so than that office. It<br />
has increased in importance very rapidly<br />
during the past nine years, and it is of<br />
importance to have the head of that De-<br />
partment in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> found <br />
they could not carry this Bill. (Hon. <br />
(Mr.Smith—We carried it here.) What <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was the good of that ? If the Govern-<br />
ment were right, why did they not<br />
persevere and carry it again ? Because<br />
they saw they were wrong. He would<br />
submit to the House whether they had<br />
performed the functions and sustained the<br />
character a Government should have done.<br />
What is the object of a Government?<br />
Old histories do not speak of such an in<br />
stitution. It was introduced when the </span><br />
Prince of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Orange</span> came to the
throne, and <br />
we, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">controversy,</span>
have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">secured</span> <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">description</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> <br />
they have in the mother country. The<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governor</span> shall be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sacred as </span>the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Queen</span> is.,<br />
and responsible to her only ; and every <br />
local act, whether military <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">or</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">civil,</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
some</span> <br />
one should be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsible</span> for.
There <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">provided
enough offices to </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> <br />
a quorum of Executive <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Councilors</span>
to dis- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charge</span> the public business. When
the <br />
great controversy occurred in Nova Sco- <br />
tia, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> Lord Grey wrote a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispatch</span> to <br />
Sir John Harvey, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> dispatch
was the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wording</span> of the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span> he said <br />
it was necessary to have five political <br />
offices with salaries in order that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov</span><br />
ernor <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might</span> have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cou</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ncil</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about</span> him. <br />
Now he would like to know how many<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hours</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Surveyor</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gene</span>ral or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Attor- <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">here</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> season.<br />
Why is it the office of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Solicitor</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Genera</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">l</span> <br />
is vacant ? It is not from a spirit of<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">economy, but it is from political <span class="unclear" title="word is faded, can't see it">?</span></span><br />
ty. The office dangles from one to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

a <br />
Crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Officer</span> here for a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> part of <br />
the year, which was a state of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">things</span>
this <br />
country would not endure. His hon. <br />
friend the Attorney General had not been <br />
at Fredericton a fortnight. They <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>
<br />
lost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> than the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">salary</span> of one of <br />
the Crown Officers by what he conceived <br />

cost of conducting the Crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">business</span>

provides for offices of this kind, and it<br />
is a violation of the Constitution not to<br />
have them filled, and if they violate it one<br />
way they will another. The year he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">went</span> to England he was compelled

would not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have allowed</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span> of Sol- <br />

It is a violation of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution</span>
not <br />
to do so. Mr. Fisher then read the law <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concerning</span> the ofﬁce, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">continued :</span> <br />
here was a law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangements</span> for <br />
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ofﬁce,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defining</span> the Auditor General's <br />
duties, and imposing upon him certain <br />
responsibilities ; he is to have to a cer- <br />
tain extent judicial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">powers.</span>
This office <br />
was woven in the woof of their Consti- <br />
tution, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> one of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">importance</span>
<br />
to the interests of this country. He did <br />
not know what the state of the depart- <br />
ment was, but he was well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfied</span>
that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> were hundreds and thousands
of <br />
entries which had never been audited. <br />
and it would now take an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efficient</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Audi-</span> <br />
tor a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> time to bring the
business up <br />
to the present time. The office is a check <br />
upon the accounts and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenses</span>
of the <br />
country. Th<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e</span> smallest body or
society <br />
in this country find it expedient to ﬁnd <br />
some man to audit their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">accounts,</span>
while <br />
the Province is without an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Auditor</span>
Gene- <br />
ral. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">This</span> is a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ground</span> of complaint, and <br />
a reason for their condemnation. That <br />
ofﬁcer has by law judicial power to sum- <br />
mon witnesses, and institute enquiries, <br />
for which purpose he is armed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
ex- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">traordinary</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">powers.</span> If they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispensed</span> <br />
with an officer of this kind they could not <br />
tell what they would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lose,</span> and
having vio- <br />
lated the law in that respect, he would <br />
ask the House to condemn them. A great <br />
deal has been said about the sale of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span>
<br />
tracts of land. He would give no opinion <br />
as to the propriety or impropriety of sell <br />
ing large tracts of land, but in this case <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">there</span> was a regulation that
forbade <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
sale of lands in the vicinity of the pro- <br />
posed line of Railway, pending the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nego-</span>
<br />
tiations for that purpose. That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regula-</span>
<br />
tion was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suspended</span> by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">request,</span> without <br />
public notice of it being <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">given.</span>
That <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> <br />
a state of things no Government should <br />
have allowed. He was told that persons <br />
in the upper part of the country who had <br />
applied for the purchase of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lands</span>
<br />
along the line <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> told that
they had no<br />
authority to sell. The Government should <br />
not have been a Government of secresy. <br />
If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> thought the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regulation</span> should <br />
have been rescinded, they should have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">notified</span> the country, for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">while</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regu-</span> <br />
lation was in existence, no one felt en- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">couraged</span> to apply <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span>

should write an answer like this Minute <br />

<br />
that was a proper manner to treat the <br />

of New Brunswick upon it, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hopes</span>
<br />
we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> alter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span> mind. With all this <br />

to <br />
some scheme for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />

to <br />
put it, and was an insult to the people of <br />

How did it happen their information in <br />

worked with him in securing to this Pro- <br />
