years in the House and had always vot-<br />

had not said a great deal about himself ;<br />
but now he begged leave to say a few<br />
words. The Attorney General said that<br />
he (Mr. D.) had gone over to the other<br />

that is, and he would like to ask on what<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. DESBRISAY—He also was op-<br />
posed to the Quebec Scheme ; but the<br />
question of Confederation had no right<br />
to absorb all the other interests of the<br />
Province. He had come out as Conser-<br />
vative and he had always voted consis-<br />
tently. When the Quebec Scheme was<br />
first agitated in the Province he was the<br />
first man of any prominence in his own<br />
County who opposed it, and he was op-<br />
posed to it still ; as he said, he was a<br />
consistent Conservative, he had been<br />
born a Conservative, he had lived a Con-<br />
servative, and a Conservative he intend-<br />
ed to remain. When the Attorney Gen-<br />
eral said that he (Mr. D.) had gone over<br />
to the other side he would like to be<br />
told what was that other side. He would<br />
like to know what was the Attorney<br />
General's side of politics? He thought<br />
he ought to get an answer.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL—When he<br />
said the hon. member of Kent had gone<br />
over to the other side, it was because he<br />
had seconded the amendment to the<br />
Address.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. DESBRISAY then proceeded to<br />
say that when he read the Speech, and<br />
the paragraph on union, he felt that he<br />
was absolved from anytie to the Govern-<br />
ment, and he appealed to the conserva-<br />
tive members if the course the Govern-<br />
ment had taken on that question, in not<br />
even consulting them, entitled them to<br />
their support. He would take the oppor-<br />
tunity to say the he had not changed his<br />
views as a Confederate, and, there-<br />
fore, he was not to be told that he had gone<br />
over to the other side. What claim, he<br />
would ask, had the Government now<br />
upon the conservative interests of the<br />
country. He wanted to ask on what side<br />
of politics the Attorney General was?<br />
Could he tell? He wanted to put forth<br />
to the country that he (Mr. D.) was a<br />
conservative, and had not acted incon-<br />
sistently. He came to the House an<br />
anti-Confederate, and he intended to <span class="unclear" title="“letters" missing,="" word="" unclear”="">?</span><br />
as an anti-Confederate. But there were<br />
other interests that hon. gentlemen had<br />
a right to advocate. On what side, he<br />
would ask, was the Attorney General ?<br />
That gentleman had in his time opposed<br />
Railway construction ; he had opposed<br />
the Militia, he had opposed King's Col-<br />
lege, he had opposed other interests.<br />
Where was he now in regard to them?<br />
He did not think it lay in his (Attorney<br />
General's) mouth to taunt him (Mr. D.)<br />
with having gone over to the other side.<br />
The Attorney General had read a division <br />
the other day upon the Post Office Bill,<br />
on which thirty names were recorded as<br />
supporters of the Government. Had the<br />
Government done their duty they would<br />
have retained that majority ; they would<br />
still have had that division to support<br />
them. Had they acted as they ought to<br />
have done? Had they filled up the poli-<br />
tical offices? Had they appointed a<br />
Solicitor General and an Auditor General?<br />
But they <span class="unclear" title="“letters" unclear,="" word="" unclear”="">va</span>scillated, afraid to move or do<br />

through the names on that division ;<br />
where were they now ? Where now, he<br />
would ask, were the conservatives?<br />
they were in the mud, and Mr. Speaker<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
was one of them. They were nowhere at<br />
all, and never would be anywhere. He<br />
was in earnest, for he felt deeply upon<br />
this matter. The Conservatives had the<br />
position in their hands, and could have</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">kept the reigns of power in their hands</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. DesBrisay then proceeded to say<br />
that on account of the vascillating course<br />
the Government had pursued, the conser-<br />
vative party had had to submit to the<br />
most humiliating and degrading position<br />
before the country. It was well known<br />
when the present Government came into<br />
power that changes should be made. But<br />
what had they done ? Nothing at all,<br />
beyond making a few changes in the<br />
Railway Department. And when the<br />
Government allowed a member in the<br />
Upper House, who was a salaried officer<br />
under them, to vote against a Govern-<br />
ment measure, he felt that the Conserva-<br />
tives had been placed into a most humilia-<br />
ting position ; a position that had allowed<br />
them to be pointed at with the finger of<br />
scorn. The Government should have<br />
taken a bold stand when they had thirty<br />
men at their back. When should they<br />
ever see such a day again ? Had the<br />
Government done their duty they would<br />
have made the changes that they were<br />
expected to make ; they would have filled<br />
up their offices at once. He spoke what<br />
he felt. He did not want anything from<br />
the Government, but he did feel he had<br />
feelings beyond <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-US">£500 a year. He felt a</span><br />
pride as a member of the Conservative<br />
party, and a determination that that pride<br />
should not be broken down. If any man<br />
attempted to do that with him he would<br />
take the course with that man which he<br />
ought to do. But when he saw the Gov-<br />
ernment vascillating and trimming before<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-US">the country, every man who was a Con-<br />
servative must have felt humiliated.</span></p>

had asked the other day if the Govern-<br />

It was impossible to draw out a direct<br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-US">been carried. Viewing the course the<br />

the vote came to be taken that they<br />
would fail to secure a majority of mem-<br />

constituency in the country they could<br />
not carry an election. Mr. D. then pro-<br />
ceeded to speak of the non-appointment<br />
of Auditor General, and the great import-<br />
ance of the office to the country, as a<br />
dereliction of duty on the part of the<br />
Government, and went on to animadvert<br />
on the course the Chief Commissioner of<br />
the Board of Works had taken with the<br />
construction of the bridge over the main<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-US">river of the Richibucto. Before the con-</span><br />
struction was commenced he thought it<br />
but reasonable that plans should be made<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-US">and shown in the country, and he had</span><br />

had answered tht it could not be done.<br />
