<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">card</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">published</span> in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Eastern</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Advocate,</span>
it <br />
made no such <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">statement.</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">stated</span> in my <br />
card that I was<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> in favor of a Union of
the <br />
North American Colonies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">based</span>
upon fair <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">equitable</span> principles, and
went on <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">showing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">benefits</span>
of uniformity in our <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariffs</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postal</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangements,
whichh</span> <br />
could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be brought</span> about by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> Union. I<br />
did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> say a word about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> Scheme, for <br />
I held it derogatory for a member to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">com-</span>
<br />
mit himself to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">details</span> of an
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrange-</span> <br />
ment which only a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">months before</span> had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been</span> laid before him. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> was at that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time</span> <br />
attending to my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">own business,</span>
and had no <br />
time to fully consider the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">merits</span>
of the <br />
Scheme ; therefore, I did not explain that <br />
I was prepared to commit myself <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to every</span>
<br />
detail, but so far <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> I had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">examined</span> the<br />
Scheme, I saw nothing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objectionable</span>
in <br />
it. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The</span> Chief Commissioner <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has on</span> two <br />
occasions allude to the influence of the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
Government in respect to the election in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the County of Albert. I say I do not feel<br />
myself in a position to acknowledge any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">favor from the Government ; there was</span><br />
no expenditure of money came from out- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side of the County of Albert to influence</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the election there. The Banking influ-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ence of men who make money out of poor</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people, who wished to retain their power</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of discounting notes, and securing money<br />
from the poverty of the country, helped<br />
to defeat Confederation. I was returned<br />
to represent the County of Albert without<br />
any influence being brought to bear<br />
either directly or indirectly ; but there<br />
may be other constituencies in the<br />
Province which are not so pure, on which<br />
money influence may be brought to bear.<br />
To prove the fearful existence of bribery<br />
at elections in some places, arising proba-<br />
bly from the fact of there being in a small<br />
Legislature so many prizes and so few<br />
blanks, I have only to refer to the testi-<br />
mony of Mr. Allen, one of the representa-<br />
tives of York in 1857, now Attorney Gen-<br />
eral. I presume matters may not have<br />
changed much, and it is therefore easy to<br />
conceive how Confederation was defeated<br />
in York.<br />

THOMSON.</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—I</span>

duty as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> subject, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with British</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
feelings, to strive to retain our privileges<br />
from the grasp of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">parties</span>
who tried to <br />
sweep away the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rig</span>hts of our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province.</span> <br />
At one time we were united <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
Nova <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia,</span> but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were</span> separated by the consent <br />
and direction of the British Government, <br />
because it was thought it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span>
be condu- <br />
cive to our welfare. This proposed<br />
Union is not for thepurpose of having <br />
one Legislature, but is a Federal Union<br />
where the dominant party will have power<br />
to tyrannise over us if they think proper.<br />
It is an old saying that we should "Give<br />
glory to God, honour to the King, and live<br />
honestly with all men." The Liberals<br />
have not done this, for they have taken all<br />
the glory to themselves, and have honored<br />
neither King, country, nor anything else.<br />
This country was not big enough for<br />
them, and they wanted to extend it, like<br />
the fable of the frog and the horse. The<br />
frog enlarged himself until he burst, and<br />
so it was with these delegates, they would<br />
not act in such a sway as was commensurate<br />
with their means;this country was too small<br />
for them, and they must get up this big<br />
scheme ; but the  " hand writing was<br />
upon the wall," and their place knew<br />
them no more. If we went into this Con-<br />
federation we would have to put up new<br />
buildings, and it would cost us as much<br />
to keep up this Central Parliament as it<br />
would be to keep a standing army of thirty<br />
thousand people. We would gain nothing<br />
by going into Confederation either direct-<br />
ly or indirectly ; we are in the habit of<br />
importing more dutiable goods than the<br />
Canadas, more particularly Lower Can-<br />
da ; therefore, we would contribute to<br />
the general revenue about double the<br />
amount that they do. The delegates may<br />
have thought that it was a good move for<br />
us to enter this Union, but they did not<br />
were over-ruled by the people of this Pro-<br />
vince. If there are any influences at<br />
work in England in regard to legislating<br />
for this Province, we should send a dele-<br />
gation home to counteract it ; we must<br />
protect ourselves, for " self-preservation<br />
is the first law of nature," This delega-<br />
tion is not for the purpose of annoying<br />
others, but for the purpose of setting our-<br />
selves right before the people and Govern-<br />

matter, if allowed to remain, will grow to<br />
something worse ; upon this ground I<br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">possible.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I shall</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">make</span>
a very short speech. <br />
I stated during the canvas at the election, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deleg</span>ates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> discussed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme</span> of a Union of the North
Ameri- <br />
can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span> was wholly
unauthorised, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and I am prepared to assert now in my</span><br />
place, that in my judgment their whole<br />
proceedings were entirely unauthorised<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />.<br><br />
<br />

History will be searched in vain to ﬁnd a <br />
parallel to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> case. If it was
necessary <br />
for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discuss</span> a <br />
Union of the Lower Provinces, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to have</span>
<br />
Legislative authority, how much more<br />
necessary was it to have authority to dis-<br />
cuss this larger Union ? I do not think<br />
another case can be found of a Go-<br />
vernment meeting in Conference and<br />
agreeing to a Scheme, making an organic<br />
change in the Constitution of a coun-<br />
try. I think before they gave their con-<br />
sent to a Scheme, and pledged themselves<br />
to carry out that Scheme with all the in-<br />
fluence their high position gave them,<br />
they should have first consulted the peo-<br />
ple. These delegates who assembled on<br />
Prince Edward Island for a particular<br />
purpose, abandoned their business and<br />
arrogated to themselves powers that did<br />
not legitimately belong to them, and un-<br />
dertook to alter the Institutions of the<br />
country and surrender the independence<br />
we have so long enjoyed. Is it not the <br />
duty of the Government to exercise their<br />
functions within the four corners of the<br />
Constitution ? Is it not their duty to<br />
preserve inviolate the independence of<br />
the people ? In my opinion these gentle-<br />
men transcended entirely their powers :<br />
they should not have gone ; or if they<br />
went upon the invitation of the Governor<br />
General, they should have gone and lis-<br />
tened to the proposition and returned, be-<br />
fore pledging themselves to use all their<br />
power, with all the agency the Govern-<br />
ment could wield, to sustain this Scheme.<br />
How did this originate ? Did not you<br />
hear in the early part of the canvas that<br />
it had emanated from the British Govern-<br />
ment ? How fraudulent was that ; noth-<br />
ing the kind had taken place. It was<br />
concocted in Canada. I will call Mr. Galt<br />
to show how it originated. Did it origi-<br />
nate in Canada for the benefit of the<br />
Maritime Provinces ? Did it not ori-<br />
ginate from their own political neces-<br />
sities? I can prove it out of the mouth of<br />
Mr. Galt himself. He says : "The circum-<br />
