the Province was full of new settle-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Counties,</span> and see whether they <br />
could not, by joining <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together,</span> raise <br />
more money for road appropriation. <br />

could go to the Government with such <br />
parties at his back he could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">break them</span>
<br />
down if they refused to comply with their <br />
request. He began to look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span>
the <br />
public accounts to see where the money <br />
could come from. He found in the <br />
course of his researches that the Govern- <br />
ment had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">collecting</span>
export duty <br />
to the amount <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> $60,0<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">00 ;</span> and he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">found,</span> <br />
on turning to the Journals, that the Re- <br />
venu<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e</span> Law expired on May 1st, 1865 ;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
and from that time until now they
had <br />
been collecting duties ille<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gally.</span> and <br />
every dollar of that $<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">60,000</span> would have <br />
to be paid <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back.</span> He fixed the blame of <br />
this gross neglect upon the Provincial<br />
Secretary and the Attorney General. <br />
He asked the House if there had been <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span>
Auditor General and a Solicitor Gen- <br />
eral, could that have happened? A min-<br />
istry in England that would be found <br />
out in so great a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neglect</span> of
duty could <br />
not last an hour<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span> He did not think that <br />
there could be found one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representative</span>
<br />
of my constituency in the Province <br />
that would dare to go back and justify <br />
so great a neglect of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">duty</span> in a Govern- <br />
ment. Here were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$60,000</span> of the
public <br />
revenue lost to the country, not a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dollar</span>
<br />of it had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legally</span>

every dollar would have to be paid back. <br />
