<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ADDRESS IN ANSWER TO HIS EXCELLEN-<br />
CY'S SPEECH.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">COL. BOYD moved the order of the<br />
day, viz :—The consideration of the<br />
"Address in answer to His Excellency's<br />
Speech," and said that he fully endorsed<br />
every word and paragraph in it, for it<br />
suited his views exactly. He could not<br />
see anything to amend in it. A vote of<br />
want of confidence was another matter ;<br />
and whether the hon. member who in-<br />
tends moving his Amendment will<br />
benefit the country by doing so, time<br />
alone will tell. For his part, he thought<br />
this Government, which they said they<br />
had no confidence in, had stood re-<br />
markably well, considering the opposi-<br />
tion it had met with.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER would like the hon.<br />
member to give some exposition of the<br />
last paragraph but one, for he would<br />
like to understand what was the design<br />
of that paragraph.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">COL. BOYD said, he believed the Go-<br />
vernment meant by this paragraph :—<br />
"* * * but in any scheme for a<br />
Union of the British North American<br />
Colonies which may be proposed, it is,<br />
in the opinion of this House, absolutely<br />
essential that full protection should be<br />
afforded to the rights and interests of<br />
the people of this Province ; and no<br />
measure which fails to obtain these<br />
objects should be adopted." That they<br />
have no objection to go into union with<br />
the other Provinces, provided good and<br />
full protection is afforded to our rights<br />
and interests, but they did not intend<br />
to swallow Confederation as concocted<br />
in Canada. They knew how well they<br />
were off, but he was not going to say<br />
they could not do better. They were<br />
perfectly willing to go into Confedera-<br />
tion upon fair and equitable terms. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HIS HONOR, THE SPEAKER, then<br />
read the Address by paragraph. Upon<br />
the reading of the 4th paragraph, which<br />
is as follows :—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">4. We learn with feelings of deep in-<br />
dignation the existence of a conspiracy,<br />
having for its avowed object the dismem-<br />
berment of the British Empire. We<br />
would hope that no attack will be made<br />
on any portion of Her Majesty's North<br />
American Dominions ; but in that event,<br />
we rejoice in being able to assure Your<br />
Excellency that but one sentiment of loy-<br />
alty animates the whole people of this<br />
Province ; and its inhabitants of every<br />
race, creed, and station, are alike ready to<br />
repel lawless aggression and to punish un<br />
provoked hostility ; and Your Excellency<br />
can confidently rely upon our cordial co-<br />
operation and support in the adoption of<br />
any measures of a precautionary charac-<br />
ter, that may be necessary to avert a cal-<br />
lamity so serious as that of the occurrence<br />
of an armed conflict within our borders.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER moved the following<br />
Amendment, viz :—To strike out all that<br />
part of the said 4th paragraph from the<br />
words " and Your Excellency," &amp;c., to<br />
the end inclusive, and insert as follow :</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"And Your Excellency may rely with<br />
confidence upon our cordial co operation<br />
and support in the adoption of such<br />
measures as may be deemed necessary<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">for the protection of the country. But<br />
we respectfully state to Your Excellency<br />
that your constitutional advisers, by<br />
their general conduct, are not entitled<br />
to our confidence."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">In moving this Amendment, MR.<br />
FISHER said that some of his friends<br />
thought that the Amendment, of which<br />
he had given notice on Saturday, was a<br />
reflection upon the United States ; there-<br />
fore, he had altered it by striking out<br />
the last section. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SMITH objected to any<br />
alteration being made to any Amend-<br />
ment of which previous notice had been<br />
given.</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER said, no power in the<br />
world could prevent him putting for-<br />
ward any proposition he pleased, if it<br />
was seconded. This Amendment con-<br />
tains all the elements of the other, but<br />
in order to meet any captious objec-<br />
tions, he had struck out a portion of<br />
it, although he intended to make that<br />
part of his argument. He was not<br />
bound to give notice at all, though<br />
courtesy required him to do it. He<br />
was there to express his opinion, and<br />
it was the peculiar beauty of their insti-<br />
tutions that they could discuss these<br />
questions ; and when they were over,<br />
whatever the result might be, it would<br />
not make them enemies to each other, for<br />
they were all there to advance the inter-<br />
ests of their common country. He com-<br />
plained of the Government that they had<br />
not called the House together sooner, for<br />
it was unfair to the representative of the<br />
people of this country, who will, after four<br />
or five weeks Session, require to go to<br />
their business occupations, especially<br />
those in different parts of the country.<br />
His friends in the Government knew it<br />
well. This was a deliberative body, and<br />
if the ordinary business of the country<br />
required sixty or seventy days to perform<br />
it, how can they get through the business<br />
of the Session in four or five weeks, when<br />
they have a new Confederation scheme<br />
foreshadowed in the Speech, with all the<br />
other great measures of that speech ?<br />
This was itself sufficient ground of<br />
complaint that they had no confidence in<br />
the Government. The newspapers said<br />
the absence of the Attorney General at<br />
Washington was the cause of the delay.<br />
In 1856 he was a member of the Govern-<br />
ment, in which they were all new hands.<br />
He was in England at that time for two<br />
or three months, for the purpose of raising<br />
money for the construction of Railways ;<br />
but it never entered their heads, nor dare<br />
they protract the meeting of this Legisla-<br />
ture. They were called <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together</span> on the <br />
14th day of February, only nine or <br />
days after he returned. In a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few</span>
days<br />
after the House opened they were met by <br />
a vote of want of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confidence,</span> but
they <br />
were sustained. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">He</span> had then to
prepare <br />
four or five Railway Bills ; there was a <br />
precedent for this Government. If they <br />
were inspired with a desire to advance <br />
the interests of this country, they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span>
<br />
have called the Legislature to meet at the <br />
usual time. Why have they not done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so ?</span>
<br />
Because they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knew</span> the public
opinion of <br />
the country was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them,</span> and they <br />
wished to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> through with the
Session <br />
in as quiet a manner as poss<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ible.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">There</span> <br />
was no time to do the business of this<br />
country in that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliberate</span>
manner in  <br />
which it should be done. He would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ask</span>
<br />
the members from the rural districts <br />
could they leave their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">farms</span> just
about <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seed</span> time, and attend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to the</span> business <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <br />
