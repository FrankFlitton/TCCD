<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with </span>such avidity and adopted
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cana</span>- <br />
dian views, without having come to this<br />
House and asked the appointment of the<br />
delegation. I think if this had been<br />
done, from my knowledge of the position<br />
they held in the estimation of the Impe-<br />
rial Government, although they ran round <br />
from place to place on a regular spring <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and autumn tour, yet they would
have been <br />
met by nothing more than a Resolution <br />
of want of Confidence. The Constitution <br />
of a country cannot be changed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">except</span>
by <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consent</span> of the people, or by
the
em- <br />
ployment of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">force.</span> In matters
that did <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> contemplate the annihilation
of the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Constitution,</span> it would have been
legiti- <br />
mate to appoint a delegation ; but to dis- <br />
cuss the Constitution under which they <br />
were acting was unconstitutional. If they <br />
had come to this House and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked</span>
for a <br />
delegation, they would have been met by <br />
a vote of want of confidence, and we <br />
should have had an incoming <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Govern-</span>
<br />
ment who would have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appointed</span> a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dele-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gation</span> which would have
represented the <br />
true ideas of the people, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">instead of</span>
a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">de-</span> <br />
legation which represented the views and <br />
feelings of the late Government only. In <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> late election in my County
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ques-</span> <br />
tion stood on that of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation ;</span>
al- <br />
though they felt the do-nothing policy of <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> they would not
make the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election turn on any thing</span> but
Confede- <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ration or non-Confederation. I say this</span><br />
Scheme, as far as I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have looked</span>
into it, is a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
one-sided <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme ;</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scheme</span>
by which <br />
the interests of Canada would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">promo-</span>
<br />
ted to our detriment ; a Scheme for the <br />
legislation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> North
America <br />
which would be entirely Westward, a ter- <br />
ritory immense when compared with ours. <br />
The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">preponderance</span> in ten years
would be <br />
largely in favor of Western Canada. <br />
This we know, and if it contemplated to <br />
open up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">canals,</span>
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">populate</span> that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great country west of Lake Superior,
that <br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increase</span> the population
greater than <br />
ever. The great influence then would be <br />
centred in Western Canada, and the <br />
power would be all in the their hands. <br />
Those delegates who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">visited</span> us
said we <br />
have the population element, and the ag- <br />
ricultural element, we want your mari- <br />
time element. If they valued our mari- <br />
time element, why did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> not
leave the <br />
seat of Government to be settled <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after-</span>
<br />
wards? Why did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">appoint St, John</span> <br />
or Halifax as the place where <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
archieves <br />
of a great people should he deposited. <br />
where ships <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> war could come
and <br />
protect <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them?</span> Why did they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">place</span> it at <br />
Ottawa, on the head waters of a river far<br />
in the interior? I look upon the choice <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the seat of Government as one
of vast <br />
importance, as of great import<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ance as</span>
<br />
when they took the capital from Ireland <br />
to England, from which inﬂuences grew <br />
up to the detriment and destruction of <br />
Ireland. Our population and our capital <br />
would all go to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada,</span> and we
should <br />
become the hewers of wood and drawers <br />
of water to them. How much do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
<br />
value our maritime element <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span>
They give <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us</span> fifteen members out of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">194,</span> according <br />
to population. Now the question of re- <br />
presentation by population is a debatable <br />
one. We have a great country, with a <br />
noble river running through <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it, one</span>
of the <br />
ﬁnest in the world, with a great extent
of <br />
sea <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">board, and a territory <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> than that <br />
of Great Britain. Why did not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dele-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gates</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">urge our importance upon them ?</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Suppose this principle were applied to</span><br />
the kingdom <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Scotland, as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">compared</span> to <br />

Would it not be unjust that a whole coun- <br />

a City, merely because her population<br />
was less? And shall we be neutralized<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. MCMILLAN.—Will the hon. mem-<br />
ber say that when they were framing the<br />
constitution of the United States that they<br />
discussed it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">openly</span>.<br />
</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">GILBERT.—There</span>
might have been<br />
some preliminaries that were attended to<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
in secret, but it was openly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debated,</span>
but<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of this Conference at Quebec we are not <br />
able to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> the opinions of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men who</span><br />
framed the Scheme ; we are shut out from<br />
asking the delegates, for they are not now<br />
in the House, and they were afraid to<br />
bring the matter before the late House.<br />
On Section 71, we require some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">informa-</span><br />
tion. It reads thus, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">‘ That</span> Her
Majesty <br />
the Queen be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">solicited to</span>
determine the<br />
rank and name of the Federated Provin-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ces.” What does that mean? Was not<br />
the idea that we should still be a Colony<br />
depending on England? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Did they</span>
intend<br />
to establish a Viceroy here with all the<br />
pomp and circumstance of Royalty <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">?</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
Would any man vote for that? Let us not<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
copy after antiquated Europe ; let us copy<br />
anything that is beneficial ; but for Hea-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ven's sake not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> antiquated
forms that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
do no good. Imagine the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-Sur-</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
veyor General, on bended knee kissing the<br />
boney hand of a Viceroy ; he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would have</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
no objection to kiss a lady's hand, that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
would be nice enough, but I do not think<br />
he would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willing</span> to try the
other. I <br />
think these Colonies have a mark to make<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
in History, when they become able to fly<br />
their own ﬂag, but that time has not yet<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
arrived. We even now can compare with<br />
almost any country save England, France,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the United States and perhaps Russia in<br />
our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">commercial</span> importance as
owners of<br />
tonnage, and if we had it all within the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">borders</span> of our own Province it
would be<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
all right ; but with a line to defend from<br />
the farther Cape of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Newfoundland</span>
to the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
head waters of Lake <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Superior,</span>
and a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">popu-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of this line, numbering only some four <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
millions, it would be folly to think of<br />
hoisting our own ﬂag and striving to guide<br />
the ship of State. Does any one suppose<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">put</span> up with dictation from
Downing <br />
Street? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Look</span> at our own House
with<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">41</span> members ; we will not
submit to<br />
their dictation in anything that we think<br />
is injurious to our inserests ; and would<br />
the united Colonies long remain attached <br />
to the mother country ? They would not ;<br />
we should soon all be "gobbled up" by<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the neighbouring republic, and I am not<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">descendant of</span> the old refu-<br />
gees, wtth the blood of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Loyalists</span>
in my<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
veins, to be annexed to the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.</span><br />
And when the time <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comes for us to go </span>off<br />
by ourselves, will this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one-sided</span>
Scheme<br />
be the one to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">adopted ?</span> No :
it
will be<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
one that is fair in every respect. We shall<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
then have a population of some ﬁfteen<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
millions, and then we may heave the an-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">most
disastrous</span>. The hon. member has <br />
referred to the Upper House of twenty-<br />
four members being able to put a veto<br />
upon anything that might prove disadvan-<br />
tageous. But it is well known that the<br />
Upper House cannot always hold out<br />
against the people's House ; this has been<br />
proved in the House of Lords in England,<br />
and at last they must yield. Our very<br />
best rights would be jeopardized, and if<br />
we have no local rights then why should<br />
we keep up a local Parliament here, and<br />
another in Nova Scotia ? We have heard<br />
of delegations proceeding from Canada, as<br />
the most influential of the British North<br />
American Colonies, to make known the<br />
state of the Provinces, and it seems they<br />
wish to bring to bear the powerful influ-<br />
ence of England, to force us to this<br />
Union. They doubtless intend to press<br />
the Scheme, and leave room for us to<br />
come in afterwards. I think the Govern-<br />
ment very wise in bringing in their reso-<br />
lutions, for although they come from an<br />
independent member, yet I presume from<br />
the remarks of the Hon. President of the<br />
Council that the Government sanction it.<br />
This is something practical, and although<br />
I am opposed to delegations as a general<br />
thing, this one under the circumstances<br />
has my support, and I think the Govern-<br />
ment will act wisely and well in sending<br />
our best men to "frustrate their knavish<br />
tricks."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCCLELLAN.—The hon. member<br />
(Mr. Gilbert) says something about frus-<br />
trating their knavish tricks, and further<br />
says that he has Loyalist blood in his<br />
veins ; I think the difference between him<br />
and his good old ancestors is, that where-<br />
as they suffered because they stood by the<br />
British Government, their descendant will<br />
not. With regard to this question, I am<br />
only anxious that the people should have<br />
a full and clear statement laid before<br />
them. The Hon. President of the Coun-<br />
cil, previous to the elections, travelled<br />
round through our part of the country<br />
expounding his views ; I had no time to<br />
reply to him then, and therefore it will be<br />
expected that I should do so now in reply<br />
to his speech of yesterday. The Hon.<br />
President of the Council said our delega-<br />
tion should have gone to the Conference<br />
and returned without pledging themselves<br />
to any Scheme.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. SMITH.—I said that it was<br />
unprecedented that a constitution should<br />
be changed without being submitted to<br />
the people. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCCLELLAN.—Now I do not know<br />
what our constitution really is ; I thought<br />
we had always been under the British<br />
Government and Constitution, and I can-<br />
not see how the fact of the delegates go-<br />
ing to Quebec to confer with regard to<br />
the management of our local Government<br />
can affect the constitution at all. It was<br />
all right they admit to go to Charlotte-<br />
town for this purpose, and why then could<br />
they not extend their operations. Since<br />
this Province has been under a seperate<br />
Government there have been a good many<br />
delegations on different subjects, some on<br />
a Union of Colonies, some on Rail-<br />
ways, to one of which the Hon. President<br />
of the Council belonged, and I think then<br />
the question of Union was discussed ; at<br />
any rate I think I can show from the<br />
Journals that the question has been dis-<br />
cussed. Nearly all these delegates went<br />
without the knowledge of the people or<br />
consent of the House, and this is a good<br />
precedent. But the delegates to Quebec<br />
had authority.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. BOTSFORD.—Sir. R. G. Mac-<br />
Donnell says they had not, and Mr. Card-<br />
well agrees with him.<br />
