<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ever</span> lived. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">When</span> he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spoke</span>
of men hold- <br />
ing on to office tor merely selfish motives. <br />
he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> have recollected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> they had <br />
been in Government together, and he (At- <br />
torney General) <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought that</span> the
course of <br />
his political life would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contrast</span>
favorably <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with tha</span>t of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member for</span> York. He <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would ask </span>him <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.F.)</span> to point out one in <br />
stance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wh</span>en he had left a
Government <br />
voluntarily, for conscien<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ce</span> sake.
He<br />
could not. But <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Attorney</span> General) <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could remember a time when he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was oust-</span> <br />
ed out of a Government. The mover of <br />
this amendment spoke of tha Govern- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ment</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">condemned</span> before the country, <br />
and holding on to office <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span>
the wishes <br />
of the people. They could not if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
<br />
would ; they would not it they could. <br />
They were in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands</span> of the
people ; <br />
they must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">give</span> a strict account
of their <br />
administration. It was the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privilege</span>
of <br />
the people to watch narrowly the acts of <br />
those in power, for the tendency of power <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">aggressive,</span> and it was their
duty to <br />
look closely that these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span> who
held <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">high</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">positions</span> fulfilled their trust.
If, when <br />
they had given an account of their actions,<br />
the peope <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> pronounce a
verdict <br />
against the Government, they would <br />
cheerfully resign <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">But</span> while it was <br />
the duty of the people to watch closely <br />
the acts of men in power, it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was no</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> duty, when it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sought</span>
to oust <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">them</span> out of office, to watch
narrowly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">motives</span>
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">who were endeavor-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ing</span> to accomplish that object. He
put it <br />
to the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">members,</span> he put it
to the <br />
country, if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mover of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this amendment</span> <br />
was actuated by a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">spirit</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">patriotism,</span> <br />
whether this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> the time for
him to take <br />
the course he had. If it was true, as he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hoped</span> to God it was not true,
that the <br />
country was threatened with a hostile in- <br />
vasion, what would be the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">position</span>
of this <br />
House, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what would</span> be the
position of the <br />
country, if this vote of want of c<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">onfidence</span>
<br />
was carried? There would be only two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ways</span>
<br />
to pursue ; one was to dissolve the House, <br />
or a new Government would have to come <br />
in, and the House would have to be pro- <br />
rogued to allow members of the new <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad-</span>
<br />
ministration to stand their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">elections.</span>
<br />
Was this the time to plunge the country <br />
into all the excitement of an election, or <br />
to leave the country without a Govern- <br />
ment when, as it had been said, the coun- <br />
try was in a state of terror and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">suspense,</span>
<br />
in danger of invasion from lawless con- <br />
spirators? </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br />

struck out that portion of the Amend- <br />

some friend was afraid that the allusion <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Attorney General then proceeded <br />
at length, to show that the authorities <br />
had kept a most careful watch over <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">safety</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province ;</span> that the <br />
Governor had been in constant communi- <br />
cation to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> Minister
at Wash- <br />
ington—Sir Frederick Bruce ;<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—that</span>
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">signified</span> their readiness <br />
to put the whole resources of the Pro- <br />
vince, at the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">disposal</span> of the
authorities, <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span> of actual <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">emergency.</span> A war <br />

now lay at the harbor of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">St.</span>
John ; <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">steps</span> <br />
had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span> to distribute
arms through <br />
out the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province ;</span> that, in

whose members had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> ﬁercely

<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Doyle,</span> were taking proper and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efficient</span> <br />
measures for the protection of St. John. <br />
He would ask the House, had the Govern- <br />

? He <br />
would ask any hon. member to point out <br />
what more the Government could do than <br />
they had already <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> The Attorney General went on to say <br />
that he did not intend, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afternoon,</span>
to <br />
occupy the attention of the House much <br />
longer, but he intended, on another occa- <br />
sion, to take up the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charges</span> in
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">long</span> <br />
bill of indictment preferred against the <br />
Government by the member of York, <br />
seriatim. After he had met and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">answer-</span>
<br />
ed those <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charges,</span> he would ask
the House <br />
if the Government were not entitled to <br />
their conﬁdence ? He then <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proceeded</span>
to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refer</span> generally to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">points</span> he <br />
intended to take up. and alluded particu- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larly</span> to the question of Union
and
the <br />
Quebec Scheme. <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Attorney General—If the hon. member <br />
of Kent had only asked that question <br />
before he had gone over to the other <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side,</span> he might have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">answered</span> him. It <br />
had been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">asked—he</span> proceeded to
say—if <br />
he was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> a Union<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> with</span> Canada. <br />
He did not know that he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> <br />
Union, if an equitable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span>
could <br />
be made ; but this he did know, that he <br />
was as strongly opposed to the Quebec <br />
Scheme as ever. He was opposed to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span> up Upper and Lower
Canada at <br />
the expense of New <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Brunswick.</span> He
did <br />
not think it was right that they should <br />

ding them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with the</span> idea of a

the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates</span> who had gone to
Quebec, <br />
that they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">refused</span> to see any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">objection</span> to <br />

not <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SMITH would be glad <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">WILMOT</span> had very little
doubt <br />
about the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">power</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature,</span> and <br />
he thought that it was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">absolutely</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neces-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sary</span> that this $60,000 which they
had <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">collected</span> since the old law had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expired</span> <br />
should not be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lost.</span> It was an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oversight</span> <br />
it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be brought forward and
reme- <br />
died immediately. <br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
Mr. MCCLELAN said this oversight <br />
had been brought to their knowledge <br />
yesterday by the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member</span> for York. <br />
(Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fisher)</span> and as there were
legal <br />
questions involved in it there should be <br />
a call of the House, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span>
the con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sideration</span> of the Bill
postponed until <br />
to-morrow morning, which would be <br />
rushing the Bill through very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speedily.</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HON.</span> MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SMITH</span> said he hoped all <br />
political feelings would be thrown aside <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discussing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">subject,</span>
for it was de- <br />
sirable to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass</span> this law as soon
as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pos-</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sible,</span> to prevent. law-suits <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being</span> enter- <br />
ed into by persons <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desirous</span> of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getting</span> <br />
this money back. His hon. friend, Mr. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Cudlip,</span> had paid during the past year  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />£1100 as export duty on lumber, and<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
another party in the County of Kent had <br />
paid £300. These men say that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
<br />
money does not belong to them, al- <br />
though they paid that money down ; but <br />
it rather belongs to every man who con- <br />
tributed to the production of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deals,</span>
<br />
because the price of deals <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> affected <br />by it.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> This was not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">case</span>
of re- <br />
trospective <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislation.</span> Some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago</span>
<br />
three <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioners</span> were
appointed in <br />
the County of Westmorland to construct <br />a Canal, and these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Commissioners,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as-</span> <br />
suming they were properly appointed, <br />
went on with the work, and expended <br />
three or four thousand pounds ; but, in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consequence</span> of some legal difficulty, the <br />
case was brought before Judge <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Parker,</span>
<br />
and he decided the Government had no <br />power to appoint them. Therefore, <br />
every man upon whose land they had <br />
gone could bring an action for trespass <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> them, involving the whole
coun- <br />
try in trouble. To prevent this an Act <br />
was passed in this House legalizing the <br />
acts of those Commissioners. That was <br />
a case similar to the present, and al- <br />
though it was exceptional legislation, <br />
it should be adopted when it tends to <br />
the public interest. He would now <br />
move that the Bill be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">committed.</span>
