            <!--<fw type="running"> DEBATES
OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866</fw> <fw type="num">19 <lb/>
            </fw>-->

<!-- GL, 2016-11-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->


           <!-- <p>great sympathy expressed for the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the rural districts. I have not<lb/>
heard a single gentleman complain that<lb/>
the House was not called together soon<lb/>
enough. In Canada it is not called un<lb break="no"/>til the 10th of April. In Prince Edward's<lb/>
Island the 9th of April ; in Nova Scotia<lb/>
ten days or a fortnight ago. He said
he <lb/>
thought one man had stopped the whole<lb/>
Legislative power of the country. I was<lb/>
sent to Washington by my colleagues.<lb/>
Mr. Cudlip was invited to meet the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, who expected to meet at New<lb/>
York, but he could not go. I went to <lb/>
St. John. Mr. Wilmot was not there,and <lb/>
the Government agreed that I should go to<lb/>
Washington to meet the other delegates.<lb/>
We did not expect to have to go into an<lb/>
elaborate discussion of the Reciprocity <lb/>
Treaty at all. We went with a view of<lb/>
obtaining from the United States an ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the Treaty for one year. <lb/>
When we got there we found a Treaty <lb/>
could not be made at all, for all
Treaties <lb/>
made between the United States and <lb/>
other Governments requires the affirma<lb break="no"/>tion of the Senate, and does not require<lb/>
to be sent to the House of Representa<lb break="no"/>tives, for if they have power to make a<lb/>
commercial treaty they ignore the func<lb break="no"/>tions of that body. In the interchange<lb/>
of commodities it was desirable to have<lb/>
some arrangement made of a perman<lb break="no"/>ent character. They said whatever ar<lb break="no"/>rangements were made should be car<lb break="no"/>ried out by future legislation in all good<lb/>
faith. We entered into negotiations<lb/>
with them ; the proposition made by us,<lb/>
and they answer, have been published.<lb/>
We felt we could not agree to their<lb/>
terms, in justice to our own people, and<lb/>
we therefore closed our negotiations. I <lb/>
shall not say anything further upon this. <lb/>
point, as I may have an opportunity of<lb/>
explaining exactly what took place
while<lb/>
I was there. It has been said that the<lb/>
interests of the people of this Province<lb/>
are not safe in calling the Legislature<lb/>
together at so late a period. It is very<lb/>
desirable to call the House together<lb/>
rather later, fo we know when the<lb/>
House breaks up before the River opens<lb/>
it makes it difficult for some of us to get<lb/>
home. Was it ever said by a member <lb/>
of a deliberative assembly before, that<lb/>
a Government should be ousted from<lb/>
power because they called the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture three weeks later than usual. There<lb/>
is a good substantial reason why this <lb/>
Legislature should not be called earlier.<lb/>
It was known that Canada was anxious<lb/>
that our Session should be called. Why<lb/>
did they not call their own ; they have<lb/>
not had a Session for the last fifteen<lb/>
months, except a short Session, which<lb/>
was called last Spring to authorise a <lb/>
loan and impose an additional tax.<lb/>
When a treaty with the United States <lb/>
had to be made by Legislation, was it<lb/>
not sufficient to justify the House in not<lb/>
meeting at the usual period, because,<lb/>
if we had made an arrangement with the<lb/>
United State Government it would re<lb break="no"/>quire to be legislated upon by this Leg<lb break="no"/>islature. It has been brought against<lb/>
us that we brought forward no measures<lb/>
last Session except the Military Bill.<lb/>
Where is the Treasure Note Bill, or the<lb/>
Post Office Bill? which has been put<lb/>
forward as a first step towards the re<lb break="no"/>moval of the seat of Government, but<lb/>
which was not thought of at all, it<lb/>
being merely to abolish the head of a<lb/>
department. It was not expected under<lb/>
the circumstances, that measures would <lb/>
be brought foward last Session, when<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>      
            <p>it was the desire of the Government<lb/>
and every member of the House, to <lb/>
shorten the Session and get home as<lb/>
soon as possible. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>My hon. friend says, we are entitled<lb/>
to condemnation because we brought in<lb/>
a Bill to abolish the office of Postmaster<lb/>
General, but the hon. members, fresh<lb/>
from their constituents, supported it<lb/>
thirty to nine. There is a feeling<lb/>
throughout the country that the
office<lb/>
might be abolished without detriment to<lb/>
the public service, and in connection<lb/>
with this, he would state that Mr. Odell<lb/>
had discharged the duties of the office<lb/>
as efficiently as any gentleman had,<lb/>
since its creation. When the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had told the people of York that<lb/>
they were to be destroyed, did he tell<lb/>
them that when Mr. Wilmot and myself<lb/>
formed the Goverment they had not<lb/>
forgotten the interests of York ? In the<lb/>
formation of the Government, they had<lb/>
selected one-third of the members from<lb/>
that County, viz : the hon.
Commissioner<lb/>
Board of Works, the Attorney General<lb/>
and the Postmaster General, who, being<lb/>
a member of the Upper House, filled<lb/>
one of the most important offices in the<lb/>
country, and being interested in the <lb/>
prosperity of the county of York. How<lb/>
dare they say to the people of this<lb/>
country that this Government were not<lb/>
going to give York fair play? How<lb/>
could they exect the seat of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment could be removed with one-third<lb/>
of the entire Government from the<lb/>
County of York <unclear n="">?</unclear> I believe it was the<lb/>
fear of this, together with the agitation<lb/>
about Ferrianism, that had an
influence<lb/>
in the election ; for I believe the people<lb/>
of this country are as much against the<lb/>
Quebec Scheme as ever If you get a <lb/>
scheme that will provide for the interests<lb/>
of the people, I will go for it ; but
it is<lb/>
not in the four corners of that scheme<lb/>
to do it. My hon. friend says, the<lb/>
            </p>
  


            <p>Quebec Sceme is in the Speech. It is<lb/>
there because the Governor is com<lb break="no"/>manded by the despatch to submit it to<lb/>
Parliament ; but we are not bound by<lb/>
this. What does the Governor say in<lb/>
his Speech last Session? He says :—</p>
            <p>"At the request of the Governor Ge<lb break="no"/>neral of Canada, and with the approba<lb break="no"/>tion of the Queen, I also appointed<lb/>
Delegates to a Conference of Represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the British North American<lb/>
Colonies, held in Quebec in the month<lb/>
of October last, with a view of arranging<lb/>
the terms of a Federal Union of British<lb/>
North America. The resolutions agreed<lb/>
to by this Conference appeared to me<lb/>
to be so important in their character,<lb/>
and their adoption fraught with conse-<lb break="maybe"/>
queces so materially affecting the<lb/>
future condition and well-being of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish America, that, in order to enable<lb/>
the people of New Brunswick to give<lb/>
expression to their wishes on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, I determined to dissolve the then<lb/>
existing House of Assembly. I now<lb/>
submit these Resolutions to your judg<lb break="no"/>ment."<lb/>
            </p>








            <p>Did he then tell us that because he<lb/>
was going to submit hese Resolutions<lb/>
and recommend them—an expression<lb/>
not used in this Speech—that we are<lb/>
committed to a scheme? I will relieve<lb/>
that hon. gentleman's mind. I will in<lb break="no"/>form this House that the Government<lb/>
are not prepared to submit any scheme<lb/>
to the House. Those papers will be<lb/>
submitted to the House, as we said in<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>




            <p>the Speech, and we will consider them<lb/>
with that respect which is due to any<lb break="no"/>thing emanating from so high a source,<lb/>
at the same time not forgetting that it<lb/>
is our duty to consent to no scheme that<lb/>
            </p>


            <p>does not contain within itself the ele<lb break="no"/>ments of security for our people. If a<lb/>
scheme could be devised that would<lb/>
promote the interests of our people. I<lb/>
for one, would go for it, and I think<lb/>
my colleagues in the Government, every<lb/>
member of the House, and every man<lb/>
in the country, would go for it too.<lb/>
Whether such a scheme is attainable, is<lb/>
a question for deliberation. </p>
            <p>MR.
NEEDHAM moved that the de<lb break="no"/>bate be adjourned until 2 P.M.<lb/>
            </p>




            <p>House adjourned until 10 A.M.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>T.P.D.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p/>-->

            <p>THURSDAY, MARCH 15.<lb/>
            </p>



            <p>After the usual routine, the House went <lb/>
into Committee— <persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. Needham</persName> in the <lb/>
C<unclear n="">?</unclear>r—on a Local Bill : a Bill to provide<lb/>
more effectually for the repairing of the<lb/>Roads, Bridges and Streets of the Parish<lb/>of Newcastle, in the County of Northum<lb break="no"/>berland. Passed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> moved that the Bill to<lb/>provide for the better secresy of the Bal<lb break="no"/>lot, be referred to a Committee to report<lb/>
thereon.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> brought in a Bill to<lb/>
extend the jurisdiction of Justices of the<lb/>Peace in civil suits. <lb/>
            </p>




            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> moved that his Bill to<lb/>
simplify the practies of law and abolish<lb/>special hail, be referred to a Committee.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> brought in a Bill to<lb/>amend the practice of the Supreme Court.<lb/>Mr. N. said he intended to move the Bill<lb/>just brought in inamendement to that of Mr.<lb/>
Gilbert. It was the Bill framed by the<lb/>
late Attorney General—the present Judge<lb/>Allen.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> moved the House into <lb/>Committee— <persName ref="pers:YOUN1">Mr. Young</persName> in the Chair—on a<lb/>Bill further to amend the law relating to<lb/>
Parish Schools.<lb/>
            </p>



            <p>The hon. mover explained the object of<lb/>the Bill was to supply a want in the origi<lb break="no"/>nal School of Bill—to extend to Counties<lb/>the same privileges as Parishes and Dis<lb break="no"/>tricts with regard to assessment for<lb/>
Schools. The Bill did not design to make<lb/>
any alteration in th School Law, but <lb/>merely to make plain what was doubtful ;<lb/>to carry out what he considered must have<lb/>been the intention of the framers of the <lb/>law.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> thought<lb/>
the Bill would require great consideration.<lb/>
It involved revenue, and he thought there<lb/>
would be great difficulty in carrying out<lb/>
practically the principle of assessment as<lb/>
regards Counties<lb/>
            </p>


            <p>A long discussion followed on the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of assessment of Schools, and final<lb break="no"/>ly progress was reported. We do not re<lb break="no"/>port the discussion on this Bill, as the <lb/>subject will come up again.<lb/>
            </p>




            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR.CONNELL</persName> said he had under<lb break="no"/>stood the Attorney General to say that<lb/>
ample arrangements had been made with<lb/>
regard to defence of the Counts of Carl<lb break="no"/>ton. But from the information he had re<lb break="no"/>ceived, he was led to believe that nothing<lb/>
whatever had been done. There was very<lb/>
great alarm in the County, and a number<lb/>
of people were selling out their property.<lb/>
            </p>

<fw type="num">20</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> 
            
 
            <p>He should like to know what the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had done.   <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> thought <lb/>
that the information he (Mr. Connell) had <lb/>
received was incorrect ; he had informed <lb/>
the members of
Carleton that there were <lb/>
five hundred rifles and ten thousand rounds <lb/>
of bail ammunition  in the
County. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment could not
help people selling out <lb/>
their property ; they could not prevent  <lb/>
that. It might be that some people go <lb/>
up an alarm designedly in
order to make <lb/>
a speculation. The Government were <lb/>
doing every thing they could. They had  <lb/>
directed
a  communication
to the Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner to have night watchmen on the  <lb/>
Railway, and directions had been given <lb/>
to have watchmen on the St. Andrew's  <lb/>
Road. The Government were heartily  <lb/>
co operating with the Lieutenant Gover<lb break="no"/>nor, who was in communication with Col. <lb/>
Cole, and also in communication with the 
<lb/>
Volunteer Officers on the border.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR.
CONNELL</persName> —He did not rise for  <lb/>
the purpose of giving alarm, but he did <lb/>
think he should have positive knowledge
<lb/>
of what the Government were doing. In  <lb/>
Woodstock there were only some thirty  <lb/>
or forty volunteers. He could only say <lb/>
that a gentleman in the County had told <lb/>
him that no preparations had been made 
<lb/>
at all. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> could not agree with his<lb/>
               hon. colleague that there was no alarm. <lb/>
               He had recevied a telegram which inform<lb break="no"/>ed him that all along the line of the Saint<lb/>
               Andrews Railway there was great alarm. 
               </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName>.—The Government had  <lb/>
the best means of knowing. He would <lb/>
do his tumost to support any measure of 
<lb/>
defence they might adopt. He was  <lb/>
prepared to give them the amplest powers <lb/>
to raise men and expend money. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <persName ref="pers:HATH1">MR. HATHEWAY</persName> said, two hours be-<lb break="yes"
               /> fore Mr. Connell had risen to ask that <lb/> question, he had received a telegram
               from<lb/> the press of Woodstock, and in it there <lb/> was not a single word about
               alarm or <lb/> about Fenianism. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> —There was no doubt  <lb/>
that there was great alarm now, and he 
<lb/>
entirely agreed with the remark of the
<lb/>
hon. member of York. If the Government<lb/>
wanted more power, he would give it<lb/>
them. He would give them all the re<lb break="no"/>sources of the Province, if necessary, but<lb/>
he would expect them to exercise a care<lb break="no"/>ful and prudent economy. The Attorney<lb/>
General had told them that there were<lb/>
five hundred rifles in Carleton ; it there<lb/>
were five hundred men in Carleton to<lb/>
handle them, what force could cross the<lb/>
border that that body of men could not<lb/>
resist ? A great body could not be moved<lb/>
for the purpose of attack without all the<lb/>
world knowing it, and people ought to<lb/>
remember that the Province could not be <lb/>
invaded suddenly by a large force. He <lb/>
did not believe that the movement would<lb/>
attain any importance, nor did he think 
<lb/>
the Province was much exposed to attack, <lb/>
for it had no direct line of communica<lb break="no"/>tion with the States. Still, a show of <lb/>
attack might be made. But if a small <lb/>
body—and it could only be a small body, <lb/>
did come in, they would be met. As he <lb/>
said, he would give the Government, if 
<lb/>
they required it, more power. He would  <lb/>
give them power to muster men and com<lb break="no"/>pel men to serve.  <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> At three o'clock, His Excellency, the <lb/>
Lieutenant Governor, came down to the <lb/>
Council Chamber and gave his assent to <lb/>
the Export Duty Bill.</p>

            <cb/>

            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> (on<lb/>

resuming the adjourned debate on the<lb/>
amendment to the Address,) said that the<lb/>
Bill just assented to by His Excellency<lb/>
would remove the ground of complaint   <lb/>
that had been preferred against the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Ever since the time that the
<lb/>
error had been discovered, it had given<lb/>
the Government a great deal of trouble.<lb/>
The first time they had a knowledge of <lb/>
the neglect was in the month of Septem<lb break="no"/>ber, but they did not think it would have<lb/>
been right to have summoned the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture at a time when the navigation was<lb/>
open, and when it would have been most<lb/>
inopportune for the business of the coun<lb break="no"/>try. They thought that it would be bet<lb break="no"/>ter to wait until the opening of the<lb/>
Legislature, and remove the difficulty<lb/>
then. The House would agree that the
<lb/>
then. The House would agree that the <lb/>
Government had acted prudently, and he<lb/>
did not think that any injury had been<lb/>
done to the country. He could not but<lb/>
repeat what he had said yesterday and<lb/>
the day before, that the present was not<lb/>
the time to shake the confidence of the<lb/>
country in the Government, to keep up a<lb/>
political agitation, and make changes
in<lb/>
the Constitution. But from the informa<lb break="no"/>tion they had received, that boded no<lb/>
good to the Province, he thought the<lb/>
time had arrived when it behooved them<lb/>
to
forget party and political differences,<lb/>
and look to the safetyand interests of <lb/>
the country, Within the last few days, <lb/>
telegrams had been received sufficient
to <lb/>
excite fear in the country, and he thought<lb/>
the time had arrived when this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture should be united, and they should all<lb/>
be prepared to meet aggression. He did<lb/>
not think any observations he could make<lb/>
would have any influence in changing the<lb/>
minds of hon. members. The discussion<lb/>
must take its course. But he put it to<lb/>
the House, and to the country, it this was<lb/>
the time, when the country was agitated<lb/>
with fears of a hostile aggression, to press<lb/>
a vote of want of confidence. The hon.<lb/>
mover (Mr. Fisher) had been premature<lb/>
in moving his amendment. Before con<lb break="no"/>demning the Government for the Railway<lb/>
contract, he should have waited for more<lb/>
information. He certainly had been<lb/>
premature in speaking about the Rail<lb break="no"/>way contract. The country, he (Attorney<lb/>
General) thought had heard of a grand <lb/>
scheme for gridironing the Province with<lb/>
Railways, without burdening the coun<lb break="no"/>try, that the member of York had in his<lb/>
head. If that hon. member was sincere<lb/>
in his wish to advance the interests of the <lb/>
Province, if he thought he had a better<lb/>
way of building railways than the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had, he should, if prepared with<lb/>
his scheme, have come down. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to the contract entered into, he<lb/>
would suppose that the testimony of the<lb/>
two Nova Scotian gentlemen—both of<lb/>
them afterwards would have some weight<lb/>
with the member of York—the testimony<lb/>
of these gentlemen would show what <lb/>
truth there was in the statement made<lb/>
that a delegation was unnecessary, that<lb/>
all the Government had done in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter they might have accomplished by<lb/>
writing a letter at the expense of a shil<lb break="no"/>ling. The other statements—(Here At<lb break="no"/>torney General quoted from the Report of<lb/>
the Nova Scotia Delegates.) There was<lb/>
the testimony of the two Nova Scotian<lb/>
gentlemen who had gone to England with<lb/>
Mr. Allen and himself. It showed that<lb/>
the matter would not have been accom<lb break="no"/>plished without a joint delegation. It<lb/>
proved the the Legislature had been re<lb break="no"/>ciprocal. The bargain that this Pro<lb break="no"/><cb/>vince had made with the Company was<lb/>much better than that made by Nova<lb/>Scotia. And he would say that but for<lb/>the advantages offered by Nova Scotia,<lb/>the mining privileges, the giving of fifty<lb/>miles of wilderness land, we could not<lb/>have treated with the Company at all.<lb/>Nova Scotia had also agreed to allow cer<lb break="no"/>tain articles needed for the construction<lb/>of the Railway to come in free of duty,<lb/>and had provided for the right of way.<lb/>The Nova Scotia delegates said to Mr.<lb/>Allen and himself : We give more than<lb/>you did ; you ought to give something<lb/>
more. But we stated that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment only authorized us to give $10,000<lb/>a mile. He (Attorney General) thought<lb/>
that a contract most highly advantageous<lb/>
to the country had been entered into.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName> — Who paid the right<lb/>
of way through this Province ?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> —The<lb/>Company ; but on representations from<lb/>them of the privileges Nova Scotia had<lb/>ceded, we agreed to pay the price of land<lb/>in excess of £50 an acre. Everything<lb/>else connected with regard to the contract<lb/>had been done consistently with law and<lb/>legislation, and yet it had been put so<lb break="no"/>lemnly forth when he was absent in the <lb/>
United States that no contract had been<lb/>
made at all ; that it was simply a pure fa<lb break="no"/>brication to help me to run my election in<lb/>
my Country. Would anyone believe that<lb/>
these Nova Scotian gentlemen, whose tes<lb break="no"/>timony he had read, would have gone<lb/>
simply to enable me to be returned !<lb/>
Yet a paper in St. John had said that the<lb/>
whole affair was a bogus transaction.<lb/>
It had been asked had any gentleman seen<lb/>
the contract ? And it had gone forth<lb/>
throughout the country that he had per<lb break="no"/>petrated a base, deliberate fraud.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>( <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. Wetmore</persName>.—What paper did the<lb/>
Attorney General allude to?)</p>
            <p>It need not signify what was the name<lb/>
of the paper. The Government had sus<lb break="no"/>tained abuse and vilification not only<lb/>
through the agency of the press, but lec<lb break="no"/>turer had gone through the length and <lb/>
breadth of the country distilling poison<lb/>
in the ears of the people. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were prepared to take the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of the arrangement that they<lb/>
had made ; but he put it to the House,<lb/>
he put it to the country, if it was fair<lb/>
that they should be subject to those in<lb break="no"/>siduous attacks, which could only be<lb/>
prompted by feelings of the deepest ma<lb/>
lignity. With regard to Western Ex<lb break="no"/>tension, he hoped that the work would<lb/>
be constructed as speedily as possible ;<lb/>
but if the Company failed, he, for one,<lb/>
was willing to undertake it as a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment work, but he hoped that <lb/>
that would not be necessary. He<lb/>
thought, as far as Railway matters<lb/>
were concerned, the House would justify<lb/>
the course of the Government, and he<lb/>
could not but think that Mr.—now Judge<lb break="no"/>Allen and he himself had dont the coun<lb break="no"/>try a substantial benefit by the Eastern<lb/>
Extension Railway contract. It was ob<lb break="no"/>jected by the mover of the amendment<lb/>
that the Government had failed to fill up<lb/>
the office of Auditor General ; and he<lb/>
thought he had got the Government into<lb/>
a fix. He (Mr. F.) had spoken a great<lb/>
deal about the Auditor General—as<lb/>
a Crown officer, and of his powers<lb/>
under the Constitution—all very wide<lb/>
of the mark. In fact, he knew<lb/>
nothing about what he was talking.<lb/>
He would say that on the formation of<lb/>
the Administration, there was on mem<lb break="no"/>ber not now in the Government who<lb/>

<fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> <fw type="num">21</fw>
        
was well qualified for the office, and<lb/>
that they had all felt then that he should<lb/>
have it. But Mr. Wilmot had retired<lb/>
from the Government without the office. <lb/>
If it had been necessary to fill up the<lb/>
office immediately, the Government<lb/>
could have done it. But if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment could show that the duties of the<lb/>
office had been conducted as efficiently,<lb/>
without an Auditor General. as
before,<lb/>
he believed the country, who did not <lb/>
care so much who ﬁlled the office as <lb/>
how its duties were performed. Instead<lb/>
of four clerks being employed, as when<lb/>
the late Mr. Partelow (who, as they all<lb/>
knew, for several years, had not been<lb/>
able to attend to the office) was Au<lb break="no"/>ditor General, there have been only <lb/>
two. For years before the death of that<lb/>
gentleman, Mr. Johnston, the chief<lb/>
clerk, had done all the duties of the<lb/>
office. He wished to do justice to Mr.
<lb/>
Johnston, who had been most assiduous<lb/>
to his duty and had proved himself a<lb/>
faithful and efficient officer. He
chal<lb break="no"/>lenged the mover of the Amendment to<lb/>
point out one single case where the<lb/>
interest of the country had suffered by<lb/>
the non-appointment of an Auditor Ge<lb break="no"/>neral. It was all very well to quote<lb/>
despatches, but let him point to one fact.<lb/>
Would the non-appointment of an Audi<lb break="no"/>tor General be sufficient in the eyes of this<lb/>
House to condemn the Government?<lb/>
He thought not.<lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> The <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Attorney Genernl</persName> proceeded to <lb/>
th charge against the Government,<lb/>
that they had not appointed a Solicitor<lb/>
General, and challenged the mover of<lb/>
the Amendment to show where the.<lb/>
public interests had suffered in conse<lb break="no"/>quence. During the absence of the <lb/>
then Attorney General (Mr. Allen) (and <lb/>
here he would remark that no appoint<lb break="no"/>ment had given more entire satisfaction<lb/>
than that of Judge Allen) provision<lb/>
was made for the conducting of the <lb/>
Criminal and Crown business of
the <lb/>
conntry, and he could assure the
House <lb/>
that, neither in the case of the absence <lb/>
of Mr. Allen, or of his own, had that <lb/>
business suffered in the hands of the <lb/>
legal gentlemen to whom it was en<lb break="no"/>trusted. He would state that no Go<lb break="no"/>vernment that had ever been formed<lb/>
in the Province—he did not ask, and he <lb/>
did not expect their sympathy, when he<lb/>
made the statement—had so many
diffi<lb break="no"/>culties and embarrassments of all kinds<lb/>
to contend against as the present Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had at its first formation. It<lb/>
was said that they had proscribed every<lb/>
one who was not an Anti-Confederate. <lb/>
But was it not absolutely necessary that<lb/>
it should be formed on an Anti-Confe<lb break="no"/>derate basis? He would ask every<lb/>
man who had taken a bold stand on the<lb/>
question that agitated the country, who<lb/>
resisted the Quebec Scheme that aimed<lb/>
at the independence of the Province, if<lb/>
it was absolutely necessary to form the<lb/>
Government on that basis? Then a cry <lb/>
was raised against the Government <lb/>
when they did not <unclear n="">?</unclear>ill
up their numbers,<lb/>
when they did not appoint a Solicitor <lb/>
General, that they were afraid to open<lb/>
a constituency. But did any one doubt<lb/>
that if the Government had consented<lb/>
to have taken the hon. member of St.<lb/>
John, on his left, (Mr. Wetmore) into<lb/>
the Government, that he would have<lb/>
been returned? Did any one doubt, if<lb/>
the Solicitor Generalship had been of<lb break="no"/>fered to the hon. member of York, on<lb/>
his right, (Mr. Fraser) that he could<lb/>
have been returned? Or if it had been<lb/>
     

            <cb/>  

         offered to the hon. member of King's<lb/>
(Mr. Otty) that he could have been<lb/>
returned? Or did any doubt that any<lb/>
one of these gentlemen would have<lb/>
done honor to the position? But at the<lb/>
time of the formation of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, it was felt that the North Shore<lb/>
was entitled to more representation and<lb/>
the office would have been filled by a<lb/>
representative of that district but for the<lb/>
basis on which the Government was<lb/>
formed. That was the fact, and all he<lb/>
could tell the House, and he thought<lb/>
the explanation sufficient, particularly<lb/>
when the member of York (Mr. Fisher)<lb/>
could not show where the interests of<lb/>
the country had suffered.<lb/>
            </p>




            <p>There was another thing. It was<lb/>
stated the Government were guilty of<lb/>
betraying the public trust and stealing<lb/>
the public property. When they heard<lb/>
the first account of the business, hon.<lb/>
members might have thought that it<lb/>
was a thousand times worse than the<lb/>
first great land stealing transaction.<lb/>
It had gone into the back settlements <lb/>
that the Government had been plunder<lb break="no"/>ing the country ; that they had entered<lb/>
into a conspiracy with Mr. Gibson to<lb/>
rob the land. A more diabolical at<lb break="no"/>tempt to injure a Government had never<lb/>
taken place. The mover of the Amend<lb break="no"/>ment knew well that the vilest injustice<lb/>
had been done to the Government by<lb/>
the accusations preferred against them.<lb/>
He knew the truth of the matter. What<lb/>
the Government had done was simply<lb/>
to carry out the intention of the late<lb/>
Government. When they came into<lb/>
power they found that an order of sur<lb break="no"/>vey had been made for which survey<lb/>
Mr. Gibson had paid $500 for a certain<lb/>
tract of land. It was said that Gibson<lb/>
got the Government to repeal the law<lb/>
in his favor, but the sale of the land<lb/>
was open and notorious. It was pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Royal Gazette</hi>,
and it was<lb/>
competent for every man who pleased<lb/>
to come in and compete. The hon.<lb/>
member of York knew all the truth<lb/>
about the transaction.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName>. He knew nothing<lb/>
about it.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. Then more<lb/>
shame for him.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName>. All he had said in<lb/>
reference to the transaction the other<lb/>
day was, that the repeal of a regulation<lb/>
should be as notorious as the regulation<lb/>
itself<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY
GENERAL</persName>. But the<lb/>
hon. member must have known,resid<lb break="no"/>ing as he did in Fredericton, and ha<lb break="no"/>ving access to the Crown Land Office,<lb/>
and he must have known when he <lb/>
heard the Government charged with <lb/>
collusion and fraud with Gibson, that<lb/>
they were charged falsely. Even if no<lb/>
repeal of the regulation had been made<lb/>
everybody must have seen in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Royal<lb/>
Gazette</hi> the advertisement of
the sale of<lb/>
the land in 100 acre lots, and that was<lb/>
as public a notice as could be made.<lb/>
Was it necessary to make repeal ? He<lb/>
wanted to show that the order, of<lb/>
which so much had been said, "that<lb/>
pending negociations for the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Inter-Colonial Railway, none<lb/>
of the Crown Lands of the Province<lb/>
shall be sold except with the condition<lb/>
of actual settlement attached," had re<lb break="no"/>pealed itself. Did not every one know<lb/>
that the law regarding the Inter-Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway had censed to be on the<lb/>
Statute Book—that it was the same as<lb/>
if it had never existed ? Did not every<lb/>
         
            <cb/>
          
one know that it had repealed itself and<lb/>fallen dead? The condition that ren<lb break="no"/>dered the regulation necessary had<lb/>ceased to exist. The transaction was<lb/>open and above board. The sale of<lb/>lands was published in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi>, and<lb/>every man must have known that it<lb/>
was the intention to sell these lands<lb/>publicly. He would ask the House<lb/>then if it was true that the Government<lb/>had given Gibson lands secretly—if he<lb/>had given him land without compe<lb break="no"/>tition ? <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR. CONNELL</persName>. Did not Mr. Gib<lb break="no"/>son hold a three years' license of these<lb/>
very lands?</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. So much<lb/>
the worse for the late Government.<lb/>You that supported the late Government<lb/>would wish to fasten their sins on us.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName>. How many acres<lb/>were sold to Mr. Gibson?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. Fifteen<lb/>
thousand in all. It it was necessary to<lb/>argue this question, he would say while<lb/>he would give every facility to the man<lb/>who desired to settle in the country,<lb/>they ought to look at the other side,<lb/>and consider that Mr. Gibson had<lb/>mills that cut twelve millions annually.<lb/>The whole country was interested in<lb/>that manufacture. Let them not look<lb/>at this question with hasty prejudice,<lb/>but let calm reason work, and let them<lb/>foster and cherish the manufacturing<lb/>interests of the country. He would<lb/>ask if the people of the Nashwaak were<lb/>not greatly interested in Mr. Gibson's<lb/>operations? He had besides been told<lb/>that the land was worthless for settle<lb break="no"/>ment and not much worth for lumber-<lb break="yes"/>in purposes, unless large sums are<lb/>spent to open up streams. Mr. Gibson<lb/>was a man that ought to be encouraged.<lb/>
He was informed his operations extend<lb break="no"/>ed to Careleton and Victoria. The<lb/>
inhabitants of Carleton derived great<lb/>
benefit from those operations.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> —The people of Carle<lb break="no"/>ton found fault with it.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> —It might<lb/>be that the great lumberers found fault ;<lb/>but would he (Mr. Lindsay) tell him that<lb/>the farmers and back settlers complained<lb/>who found sale for their oats and their<lb/>hay, and their produce? He then<lb/>proceeded to say that the Government<lb/>were bound to carry out the acts of their<lb/>predecessors, and as regarded this tran<lb break="no"/>saction they were in no way to blame.<lb/>It had been no hole and corner business,<lb/>and he did not think the House would say<lb/>
that the Government had forfeited the<lb/>confidence of the country. The hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman (Mr. Fisher) had said that the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had changed their mind upon<lb/>
the question of Confederation, and that<lb/>
the paragraph in the Address relating to<lb/>
Union involved the submittal by them of<lb/>
some scheme. But he would tell the hon.<lb/>
member that the Government would not<lb/>
submit a scheme of Confederation to the <lb/>
House. They were as strongly opposed as<lb/>
ever they were to the Quebec Scheme,<lb/>
and would maintain their attitude of op<lb break="no"/>position to it. He regretted that some of<lb/>
their friends who had fought the battle <lb/>
against that scheme had, for reasons best<lb/>
known to themselves, gone over to the<lb/>
other side. He hoped they would justify<lb/>
to their own minds the course they had<lb/>
taken. He could not see how any man<lb/>
could, when he saw all the influences at<lb/>
work, shut their eyes to the fact, that if <lb/>
this vote of confidence was carried, and<lb/>
the Government thrown out, that the  <lb/>

<fw type="num">22</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> 
        
Quebec Scheme, in all its original enor<lb break="no"/>mity would be forced upon the country. <lb/>
He believed, sure as the needle pointed <lb/>
to pole, that that would happen. Let <lb/>
hon. members consider the pressure that <lb/>
has been brought upon the
Government <lb/>
to break them down. They have had the <lb/>
pressure of the Canadian politicians<lb/>
against them, and the Imperial
inﬂuence <lb/>
of the British Government, and inﬂuence <lb/>
from Nova Scotia. They have had the <lb/>
inﬂuence against them of lecturers and
<lb/>
trading politicians, who, through the<lb/>
length and breadth of the Province have<lb/>
been disseminating poisonous stories<lb/>
against the Government, and attesting<lb/>
that a dissolution was sure to take place ;<lb/>
and almost the entire Press of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince had been against them, vilifying and<lb/>
denouncing them. He had no doubt that <lb/>
the member of York (Mr. Fisher) was in <lb/>
constant communication with Canadian<lb/>
statesmen in favor of the Quebec Scheme. <lb/>
He saw several gentlemen in the House <lb/>
who were in favor of Union—taking it as<lb/>
a broad question. But he would ask were<lb/>
there ten members in the House in favor<lb/>
of the Quebec Scheme ? Let these gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen who were in favor of the general<lb/>
principle consider well before they cast<lb/>
their influence against the Government.<lb/>
They were told that the Quebec Scheme <lb/>
could be altered. When that was said <lb/>
let them harken to the testimony of the<lb/>
Canadian statesmen who had given birth<lb/>
to the scheme. Not a single letter could<lb/>
be altered.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Let them listen in the testimony of the <lb/>
Hon. D'Arey McGee :<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> " Everything we did was done in form <lb/>
and with propriety, and the result of our<lb/>
proceedings is the document that has been<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>submitted to the Imperial Government,<lb/>
as well as to this House, and which we<lb/>
speak of now, as a treaty. And that there<lb/>
may be no doubt about our position in re<lb break="no"/>gard to that document, we say question<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>if you may, but alter it, you may not.<lb/>
(Hear, hear.) It is beyond your
power<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>or our power to alter it. There is not a<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>sentence, aye, or even a word, you can<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>alter without desiring to throw out the<lb/>
document. Alter it, and we know at <lb/>
once what you mean—you thereby de<lb break="no"/>clare yourselves anti-Unionists. On this <lb/>
point I repeat after all my honorable <lb/>
friends who have already spoken for one<lb/>
party to alter a treaty, is of course to de<lb break="no"/>stroy it. Let us be frank with each other ;<lb/>
you who do not like our work, nor do you<lb/>
like us, who stand by it, clause by clause,<lb/>
line by line, and letter by letter."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Let him call up the Hon. J. A. McDon<lb break="no"/>ald, a man who stands very high in Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and let them listen to what he said:<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" We present it not in the precise shape<lb/>
we in Canada would desire it, but as in the<lb/>
best shape the five Colonies to be united<lb/>
could agree upon it. We present it in the<lb/>
form in whichthe five Governments have<lb/>
severally adopted it—in the form the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government has endorsed it—and<lb/>
in the form in which we believe all the<lb/>
Legislatures of the Provinces will accept<lb/>
it. We ask the House to pass it in the<lb/>
EXACT form in which we have presented,<lb/>
for we know not how alterations may af<lb break="no"/>fect its safety in other places, and the pro<lb break="no"/>cess of alteration once commenced in four<lb/>
different Legislatures, who can tell where<lb/>
that would end "</p>
            <p>From the mouth of these witnesses let

            <cb/>
           
them judge what truth there was in the<lb/>
statement that the scheme could be alter<lb break="no"/>ed. If the Government were defeated be<lb/>
would tell them again—and another Go<lb break="no"/>vernment formed with the hon. member<lb/>
of York at its head—the Quebec Scheme<lb/>
would be carried letter by letter, line by<lb/>
line. There were gentlemen here in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of Union, and he would say that if<lb/>
they could get a Union on a fair and equit<lb break="no"/>able basis, such as would advance the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country, it might be a ques<lb break="no"/>tion whether it would not be prudent to<lb/>
adopt it. He would say that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were prepared to renew negotiations<lb/>
with Canada and the other Provinces at<lb/>
any conference that might be called to<lb break="no"/>gether ; but not in any event to agree to<lb/>
the Quebec scheme. The member of<lb/>
York had spoken of British statesmen,<lb/>
and of their being listened to as superi<lb break="no"/>ors speaking to inferiors. He did not like<lb/>
the spirit of the remark of the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman. It was not doing justice to them<lb break="no"/>selves or to their country. He had great<lb/>
respect for their ability, their acquire<lb break="no"/>ments and their superior culture. When<lb/>
they said that this Confederation Scheme<lb/>
would advance the interests of this coun<lb break="no"/>try—while he had much respect for their<lb/>
opinion—still he thought on a question<lb/>
affecting their own interests, men with<lb/>
practical judgment and common sense<lb/>
were the best judges ; and on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation they respectfully<lb/>
differed.<lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p>The <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Attorney General</persName> then pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to speak of the stories repeated<lb/>
by the member of York, (Mr. F.) that the<lb/>
present Chief Justice Ritchie had <unclear n="">?</unclear>ed<lb/>
with him ( Atty Gen.) If there was any<lb/>
one thing, he proceeded to say, that it was<lb/>
necessary to maintain, it was the purity of<lb/>
the Bench. The ermine should be kept<lb/>
spotless. The people should look up<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>with respect to those who files high po<lb break="no"/>sitions, especially those who had the<lb/>
guardianship of their lives and properties.<lb/>
Up to the present time politics had never<lb/>
entered into a court of justice. He put<lb/>
it to the House if they were prepared to<lb/>
justify the member of York in dragging<lb/>
in the name of Judge Ritchie, and repeat<lb break="no"/>ing the stories set afloat that he had
ca-<lb break="yes"/>
balled with him (Att'y Gen.) a year ago<lb/>
upon the position of Chief Justice. A <lb/>
year ago he was not in the Government.<lb/>
When the present Government did come<lb/>
into power, and the resignation of the<lb/>
Chief Justice was spoken of, was it not<lb/>
understood that it Sir James Carter did<lb/>
resign that position should be given<lb/>
to Judge Robert Parker. Would the<lb/>
country have justified any other ap<lb break="no"/>pointment than that of that justly rever<lb break="no"/>ed Judge, of whome he would repeat,<lb/>
what he had said before, that take him<lb/>
for all and all he was the best man he<lb/>
ever knew. When the member of York<lb/>
knew that, how could he justify himself<lb/>
when he said that Judge Ritchie had <lb/>
caballed with him (Att'y Gen.). He<lb/>
was not going to deprecate Judge Wil<lb break="no"/>mot ; he was not going to say that he<lb/>
was not a great and distinguished priest ;<lb/>
but he would say, when Judge Wilmot<lb break="no"/>when a great question was agitating<lb/>
the country from its centre to its circum<lb break="no"/>ference—upon the Bench determined<lb/>
against and denounced men who oppos<lb break="no"/>ed the Quebec Scheme, and lauded to<lb/>
the skies those who frame it, he laid<lb/>
himself open to remark ; he forgot the<lb/>
duty imposed upon him by his position ;<lb/>
he dragged the ermine in the mire. He<lb/>
heard it was said that Judge Wilmot de<lb break="no"/><cb/>livered, from the Bench, a speech on<lb/>Confederation in Sunbury, and the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the Court applauded him. ( <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr.<lb/>Glazier</persName>—they did not). He heard it<lb/>so stated, and he must believe it. They<lb/>let Judge Wilmot speak on any<lb/>subject, and he grained the irresistable<lb/>applause of his audience. Now, if the<lb/>people cheered him when he spoke from<lb/>the Bench, must they not come to the<lb/>conclusion, if people have a right to ap<lb break="no"/>plaud him they have an equal right to<lb/>hiss him. They could not deny that.<lb/>Then what became of the respect and<lb/>dignity of the Bench ? He would like<lb/>
to see one of the Judges in England act<lb/>in that manner. He would like to see<lb/>an English Judge throw himself into the<lb/>discussion on the Reform Bill, and even<lb/>
that would be more excusable than the<lb/>
ease of Judge Wilmot. He would ask<lb/>
the House if it was ever known here<lb/>that a Judge took part in polities. Had<lb/>the member of York hown an instance<lb/>when a Judge went to the hustings.<lb/>He would ask him to point to a case<lb/>
when a Judge had ever voted ? The<lb/>
fact that Judges had never voted was<lb/>conclusive in his mind against Judge<lb/>Wilmot. While a Judge (he went on<lb/>to say) might speak on political sub<lb break="no"/>jects, and express his views in conver<lb break="no"/>sation at the social table, he has no<lb/>right to declaim from the Bench. The<lb/>Government had been charged with do<lb break="no"/>ing a great wrong for not appointing<lb/>
Judge Wilmot Chief Justice. But he<lb/>thought Judge Wilmot had acted im<lb break="no"/>prudently, and not in a manner that met<lb/>the approbation of the country. He<lb/>thought that no man would deny that<lb/>the late Chief Justice Robert Parker's<lb/>judgment on the Judge best qualified to<lb/>be successor was entitled to respect.<lb/>Chief Justice Parker would not have<lb/>taken the office if he had not known that<lb/>
Judge Ritchie should succeed him. He<lb/>
did not ask the House to believe him at<lb/>his word, for he had the written record<lb/>in proof that what he said was true. It<lb/>was stated that in the appointment<lb/>seniority prevailed. But it was not true<lb/>that the oldest Judges were always ap<lb break="no"/>pointed. In the majority of cases in<lb/>
this Province the junior Judge had been<lb/>
appointed over the senior, and if seni<lb break="no"/>ority prevailed Judge Neville Parker<lb/>had the right. He would not draw in<lb break="no"/>vidious distinctions between Judge<lb/>Ritchie and Judge Wilmot, but he would<lb/>say that public opinion would justify the<lb/>appointment of Judge Ritche, and the<lb/>country had the testimony of the late.<lb/>
Robert Parker that he was the right man<lb/>in the right place ; would not that testi<lb break="no"/>mony satisfy the murmurs of dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction.<lb/>
            </p>



            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">The hon. member of York</persName> had called<lb/>
the Government a Government of hy<lb break="no"/>pocrisy ; he had characterized its mem<lb break="no"/>bers as political thimble-riggers ; but if<lb/>
there was any man in the Province re<lb break="no"/>markable for his expertness in that art<lb/>
he sat in the seat of the hon. member.<lb/>
He had done. He was now willing to<lb/>
leave the question in the hands of the <lb/>
House.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DESBRISAY</persName> said, it might ap<lb break="no"/>pear strange that he should rise to an<lb break="no"/>swer a gentleman of the ability and tal<lb break="no"/>ents of the Attorney General. He<lb/>
would give his reason. He was obliged<lb/>
to go home, as the Supreme Court, in<lb/>
Kent, was then sitting, and he had some<lb/>
very heavy suits pending. That was<lb/>
his only reason for rising to speak now.<lb/>

<fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> <fw type="num">23</fw>
 
            <p>In the first place he begged leave to<lb/>
trouble the House with some remarks<lb/>
concerning himself. He had been ten<lb/>
years in the House and had always vot<lb break="no"/>ed consistently. During that time he<lb/>
had not said a great deal about himself ;<lb/>
but now he begged leave to say a few<lb/>
words. The Attorney General said that<lb/>
he (Mr. D.) had gone over to the other<lb/>
side. He would like to ask what side<lb/>
that is, and he would like to ask on what<lb/>
side the Attorney General was?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. — Against <lb/>
the Quebec Scheme. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DESBRISAY</persName> —He also was op<lb break="no"/>posed to the Quebec Scheme ; but the<lb/>
question of Confederation had no right<lb/>
to absorb all the other interests of the<lb/>
Province. He had come out as Conser<lb break="no"/>vative and he had always voted consis<lb break="no"/>tently. When the Quebec Scheme was<lb/>
first agitated in the Province he was the<lb/>
first man of any prominence in his own<lb/>
County who opposed it, and he was op<lb break="no"/>posed to it still ; as he said, he was a<lb/>
consistent Conservative, he had been<lb/>
born a Conservative, he had lived a Con<lb break="no"/>servative, and a Conservative he intend<lb break="no"/>ed to remain. When the Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral said that he (Mr. D.) had gone over<lb/>
to the other side he would like to be<lb/>
told what was that other side. He would<lb/>
like to know what was the Attorney<lb/>
General's side of politics? He thought<lb/>
he ought to get an answer.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> —When he<lb/>
said the hon. member of Kent had gone<lb/>
over to the other side, it was because he<lb/>
had seconded the amendment to the<lb/>
Address.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DESBRISAY</persName> then proceeded to<lb/>
say that when he read the Speech, and<lb/>
the paragraph on union, he felt that he<lb/>
was absolved from anytie to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and he appealed to the conserva<lb break="no"/>tive members if the course the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had taken on that question, in not<lb/>
even consulting them, entitled them to<lb/>
their support. He would take the oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to say the he had not changed his<lb/>
views as a Confederate, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, he was not to be told that he had gone<lb/>
over to the other side. What claim, he<lb/>
would ask, had the Government now<lb/>
upon the conservative interests of the<lb/>
country. He wanted to ask on what side<lb/>
of politics the Attorney General was?<lb/>
Could he tell? He wanted to put forth<lb/>
to the country that he (Mr. D.) was a<lb/>
conservative, and had not acted incon<lb break="no"/>sistently. He came to the House an<lb/>
anti-Confederate, and he intended to <unclear n="">?</unclear>
               <lb/>
as an anti-Confederate. But there were<lb/>
other interests that hon. gentlemen had<lb/>
a right to advocate. On what side, he<lb/>
would ask, was the Attorney General ?<lb/>
That gentleman had in his time opposed<lb/>
Railway construction ; he had opposed<lb/>
the Militia, he had opposed King's Col<lb break="no"/>lege, he had opposed other interests.<lb/>
Where was he now in regard to them?<lb/>
He did not think it lay in his (Attorney<lb/>
General's) mouth to taunt him (Mr. D.)<lb/>
with having gone over to the other side.<lb/>
The Attorney General had read a division <lb/>
the other day upon the Post Office Bill,<lb/>
on which thirty names were recorded as<lb/>
supporters of the Government. Had the<lb/>
Government done their duty they would<lb/>
have retained that majority ; they would<lb/>
still have had that division to support<lb/>
them. Had they acted as they ought to<lb/>
have done? Had they filled up the poli<lb break="no"/>tical offices? Had they appointed a<lb/>
Solicitor General and an Auditor General?<lb/>
But they <unclear n="">va</unclear>scillated, afraid to move or do<lb/>
      
            <cb/> 

anything, and offering, it is said half-a-<lb break="yes"/>
dozen men the same office. He looked<lb/>
through the names on that division ;<lb/>
where were they now ? Where now, he<lb/>
would ask, were the conservatives?<lb/>
they were in the mud, and Mr. Speaker<lb/>
was one of them. They were nowhere at<lb/>
all, and never would be anywhere. He<lb/>
was in earnest, for he felt deeply upon<lb/>
this matter. The Conservatives had the<lb/>
position in their hands, and could have</p>
            <p>kept the reigns of power in their hands</p>
            <p>for twenty years, had they only acted like<lb/>
men of common judgment.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Mr. DesBrisay</persName> then proceeded to say<lb/>
that on account of the vascillating course<lb/>
the Government had pursued, the conser<lb break="no"/>vative party had had to submit to the<lb/>
most humiliating and degrading position<lb/>
before the country. It was well known<lb/>
when the present Government came into<lb/>
power that changes should be made. But<lb/>
what had they done ? Nothing at all,<lb/>
beyond making a few changes in the<lb/>
Railway Department. And when the<lb/>
Government allowed a member in the<lb/>
Upper House, who was a salaried officer<lb/>
under them, to vote against a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment measure, he felt that the Conserva<lb break="no"/>tives had been placed into a most humilia<lb break="no"/>ting position ; a position that had allowed<lb/>
them to be pointed at with the finger of<lb/>
scorn. The Government should have<lb/>
taken a bold stand when they had thirty<lb/>
men at their back. When should they<lb/>
ever see such a day again ? Had the<lb/>
Government done their duty they would<lb/>
have made the changes that they were<lb/>
expected to make ; they would have filled<lb/>
up their offices at once. He spoke what<lb/>
he felt. He did not want anything from<lb/>
the Government, but he did feel he had<lb/>
feelings beyond £500 a year. He felt a<lb/>
pride as a member of the Conservative<lb/>
party, and a determination that that pride<lb/>
should not be broken down. If any man<lb/>
attempted to do that with him he would<lb/>
take the course with that man which he<lb/>
ought to do. But when he saw the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment vascillating and trimming before<lb/>
the country, every man who was a Con<lb break="no"/>servative must have felt humiliated.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DesBrisay</persName> went on to say, he<lb/>
had asked the other day if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were prepared to submit any scheme<lb/>
of Confederation to the House, and it<lb/>
was said by the Attorney General that<lb/>
the Government did not intend to submit<lb/>
a scheme. He wished to understand the<lb/>
position of the Government, and he would<lb/>
ask them, were they prepared to go for<lb/>
any scheme brought in by any of their<lb/>
supporters?</p>
            <p>
<persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had never heard of any scheme.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DESBRISAY</persName>. That was evading<lb/>
the question. What he wished to know<lb/>
was—did the Government intend to sup<lb break="no"/>port any scheme brought in by any one<lb/>
of their supporters?</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName>. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had never heard of any scheme<lb/>
—the Government were opposed to the<lb/>
Quebec Scheme, and would not submit<lb/>
any scheme to the House.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DESBRISAY</persName>. He supposed he<lb/>
would be obliged to let that answer go.<lb/>
It was impossible to draw out a direct<lb/>
answer to a plain question from a lawyer.<lb/>
On this question of Confederation he felt<lb/>
that the Conservatives had been deceived<lb/>
by the Government. He had never been<lb/>
able to see why this question of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration should have been carried so far<lb break="no"/>why it should have absorbed all the other<lb/>
interests of the Province—why the Con<lb break="no"/><cb/>servative feeling should have been sacri<lb break="no"/>ficed to it. The Government had carried<lb/>
the Confederation feeling to the Bench of <lb/>
the country, where it never ought to have<lb/>
been carried. Viewing the course the<lb/>
Government had taken, he thought when<lb/>
the vote came to be taken that they<lb/>
would fail to secure a majority of mem<lb break="no"/>bers on their side, and he thought that<lb/>
they ought to fail. Where, he would<lb/>
like to know, were the Government? he<lb/>
did not believe they knew themselves.<lb/>
They were in this position—that in any<lb/>
constituency in the country they could<lb/>
not carry an election. Mr. D. then pro<lb break="no"/>ceeded to speak of the non-appointment<lb/>
of Auditor General, and the great import<lb break="no"/>ance of the office to the country, as a<lb/>
dereliction of duty on the part of the<lb/>
Government, and went on to animadvert<lb/>
on the course the Chief Commissioner of<lb/>
the Board of Works had taken with the<lb/>
construction of the bridge over the main<lb/>
river of the Richibucto. Before the con<lb break="no"/>struction was commenced he thought it<lb/>
but reasonable that plans should be made<lb/>
and shown in the country, and he had<lb/>
written to the Commissioner to postpone<lb/>
the building of the bridge until the plans<lb/>
were seen ; to which the Commissioner<lb/>
had answered tht it could not be done.<lb/>
After the contract was taken, the whole<lb/>
thing was thrown up. [The Chief Com<lb break="no"/>missioner here explained why the con<lb break="no"/>tract for building the new bridge was<lb/>
not carried out the present bridge was<lb/>
perfectly safe, and he did not intend to<lb/>
renew the contract this year.] The ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not—Mr. D. said—whether the<lb/>
bridge was safe or not, but why the Chief<lb/>
Commissioner should have refused to<lb/>
submit a plan of the bridge, and why,<lb/>
after entering into a contract for building<lb/>
it, they had thrown the m<unclear n="">?</unclear>r up? Nor<lb/>
could he see what could have induced<lb/>
the Government to give the contract to<lb/>
the party they did, when they knew he<lb/>
had made a botch of the lighthouse he<lb/>had contracted to build.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">MR. DESBRISAY</persName>, in concluding, said,<lb/>that
               when he left, at dinner time, he did<lb/>not expect that he would rise to
               speak<lb/>that afternoon. He had given his reason<lb/> why he had done so. He thought
               he had<lb/>explained his position satisfactorily, and<lb/> he was sure no man of
               spirit could have<lb/> felt in any other way than he had ; and<lb/>his constituence
               felt as he did. Before<lb/>sitting down, he had a proposition to put<lb/>to the
               House. He felt that they were in<lb/> a time of trouble. The Province
               was<lb/>threatened with invasion, and he did not<lb/>think it a time when party
               spirit should<lb/>prevail. He proposed that the House<lb/>should not press the
               question of want of<lb/>confidence further. Much as he con<lb break="no"/>demned the
               Government for this vascilla<lb break="no"/>tion—for their want of pluck, for
               the<lb/>trimming course of policy they had pur<lb break="no"/>sued—he, for one, was
               perfectly willing<lb/> to pass the supplies through the House<lb/> at once. Let the
               House pass an act<lb/>giving them authority to raise men and<lb/>ample service—give
               any amount of credit<lb/> and then let the House be prorogued<lb break="no"/>and let
               the members go to their homes,<lb/>where, at this time, they were most need<lb
                  break="no"/>ed. He might be wrong, but he thought<lb/> that would be the wisest
               course to pur<lb break="no"/>sue in this emergency ; it would be the<lb/>easiest way
               to get over the present diffi<lb break="no"/>culty. If the House were prorogued,
               it<lb/> would be best for the interests of the<lb/>country. <lb/>
            </p>
