<!-- GL, 2018-03-06, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
            <!--<p>
     some local difficulties respecting repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population. I did not know 
     <lb/>at the last session this Union was so ful<lb break="no"/>ly and completely approved of and endor<lb break="no"/>sed by the Imperial Government, and 
     <lb/>therefore I voted to send a delegation to 
     <lb/>England to represent our opinions on the 
     <lb/>question. I should not have voted for 
     <lb/>that delegation had I read that despatch, 
     <lb/>which was in the possession of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment at the time and withheld from 
     <lb/>the House, for I would then have under<lb break="no"/>stood the true policy of the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They do not have one policy 
     <lb/>to-day and another tomorrow; they 
     <lb/>do not come to a conclusion very hastily<lb/>upon any matter. After making enquiry 
     <lb/>into all that related to the Colonies, and 
     <lb/>the prospect of the Reiciprocity Treaty 
     <lb/>being abrogated, they had made up their 
     <lb/>minds maturely. They have, no doubt, 
     <lb/>like other men, erred in managing the 
     <lb/>affairs of this great Empire, but they do 
     <lb/>not arrive at an hasty conclusion, one 
     <lb/>that can be repealed by our sending a de<lb break="no"/>legation to have an interview of a few 
     <lb/>hours, even although it consisted of two 
     <lb/>of our ablest men. I should have thought, 
     <lb/>however, that one delegate was sufficient. 
     <lb/>The late Attorney General should have 
     <lb/>been left to look after the business of the 
     <lb/>country, while the President of the 
     <lb/>Council would have been competent to<lb/>have made lal the repreentations to the<lb/>British Government that was necessary.<lb/>By this arrangement there would have<lb/>been a saving of five hundred pounds 
     <lb/>to the tax-payer": of this Province. The 
     <lb/>last two delegations sent home by the late 
     <lb/>Government to make arrangements con<lb break="no"/>cerning the building of Railroads cost 
     <lb/>only $900 each, while this delegation cost 
     <lb/>$3,558, which is a larger sum than was 
     <lb/>given last year for all our bye roads in the 
     <lb/>County of Westmorland. I think they 
     <lb/>compete with the Government of the 
     <lb/>Mother Country, collectively and indivi<lb break="no"/>dually, in referenceÂ  to their great British 
     <lb/>Colonial policy without having a conferee 
     <lb/>to assist him, but this delegation should 
     <lb/>not have been sent at all, and I do not 
     <lb/>believe it twould have been sent if the 
     <lb/>Government, during the sitting of the 
     <lb/>House at the last session, had communi<lb break="no"/>cated to the House information which they 
     <lb/>had of the views of the Mother Country 
     <lb/>upon the question. We should economize 
     <lb/>the public money. I have always opposed 
     <lb/>delegations. The basis of all Govern<lb break="no"/>ments is money, without which we cannot 
     <lb/>pay our liabilities, or keep up with the re<lb break="no"/>quirements or the improvements of the 
     <lb/>country; therefore, we should look close<lb break="no"/>ly into the way in which the public mo<lb break="no"/>ney is expended, and although two or 
     <lb/>three thousand dollars is a small amount 
     <lb/>yet there in a principle involved in it that 
     <lb/>when money is squandered it is our duty 
     <lb/>to express our dissatisfaction; and so it<lb/>is our duty to express our dissatisfaction<lb/>when the Govenrment violate the known<lb/>laws of the country. What puts the cri<lb break="no"/>minal in the box? It is for violating the 
     <lb/>laws of his country. Should we then 
     <lb/>permit the Government , who violate the 
     <lb/>known laws of the country, as I can show 
     <lb/>their Governmental power and influence. 
     <lb/>Some years ago, in a conflict like this, 
     <lb/>my late brother, who was then a member 
     <lb/>of this House, and in whose political 
     <lb/>school I was trained, said that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of that day had violated the laws 
     <lb/>16<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     of the country in not appointing comis-<lb break="maybe"/>sioners to build the Railroad, as required 
     <lb/>
     by law , they having taken it upon them<lb break="no"/>selves to build it by private individuals. 
     <lb/>
     There was a principle involved in this, 
     <lb/>
     and my hon. colleague Mr. Smith, and 
     <lb/>
     my late brother, were side by side on 
     <lb/>
     that question. They said, if we allow the 
     <lb/>
     Government to volate the laws of the 
     <lb/>
     country in one instance, where would 
     <lb/>
     they stop them? TheGovernment of 
     <lb/>
     the day was defeated on this principle. 
     <lb/>
     l can show a like principle involved in 
     <lb/>
     this debate. (Mr. Gilbert then read the 
     <lb/>
     law regarding the appointment of Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General, and continued.) Here is the law 
     <lb/>
     which is just as much the law of the land 
     <lb/>
     as the law which creates this Parliament 
     <lb/>
     given the electors the right to vote, or 
     <lb/>
     gives the candidates the right to offer for 
     <lb/>
     this House. If you look at the public 
     <lb/>
     accounts, you will find some $25,000 re- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     mainint in the handa of the deputies at 
     <lb/>
     the end' of the present year, scattered 
     <lb/>
     throughout the Province. The Auditor 
     <lb/>
     Genertal stands between the Government 
     <lb/>
     and the people, to audit, examine and 
     <lb/>
     vouch all accounts, he having a judicial 
     <lb/>
     power to summon witnesses from any 
     <lb/>
     part of the Province, and examine them 
     <lb/>
     on oath, in explanation of proof and 
     <lb/>
     vouchers. Have not the Government 
     <lb/>
     violated the laws of the country in not 
     <lb/>appointing this officer? What can a <lb/>Government do to cause the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people to withhold their con<lb break="no"/>fidence from them, if that is not suffi<lb break="no"/>cient?<lb/>

     TUESDAY, MARCH 27.

            <p>
     The House went into Committee of the 
     <lb/>
     Whole (MR. A. C. DESBRISAY in the 
     <lb/>
     chair) on a Bill relating to the partition of 
     <lb/>lands.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILL1">MR. WILLISTON</persName> explained that the 
     <lb/>
     object of the Bill was to provide that the 
     <lb/>
     costs of the partition of land should be 
     <lb/>
     borne by parties having shares in it, ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the respective value of their 
     <lb/>
     shares; the costs should be apportioned 
     <lb/>
    according to the respective value of 
     <lb/>their respective shares. As the law 
     <lb/>stood, each party hnd to bear an 
     <lb/>equal proportion of the costs. Before 
     <lb/>introducing it, he had submitted the 
     <lb/>Bill to the Master of the Rolls, and it 
     <lb/>had been referred to a committee of legal 
     <lb/>gentlemen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     A long discussion, and technical dis<lb break="no"/>cussion followed. All the hon. members 
     <lb/>
     who spoke agreed that the principle of 
     <lb/>
     the Bill was just and equitable, and as 
     <lb/>
     far as it went, was a great improvement 
     <lb/>
     over the law as it stood. But it was 
     <lb/>
     argued; that though the Bill ought to pass 
     <lb/>
     as being a step in the right direction, it 
     <lb/>
     did not go far enough. The whole mode 
     <lb/>
    of partition of lands ought to be simplified. 
     <lb/>At present parties were obliged to go 
     <lb/>into an expensive suit in the Court of 
     <lb/>Chancery, thaat might eat up the whole 
     <lb/>estate, and it might happen that one 
     <lb/>party, out of several having shares in 
     <lb/>land, could force the others into court, 
     <lb/>and compel a division against their will, 
     <lb/>and subject them to equal costs, irrespec<lb break="no"/>tive of the value of their respective shares. 
     <lb/>It was suggested that a simpler mode 
     <lb/>might be adopted. Hon Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, Hon. Suneyor General, Mesrs. 
     <lb/>Wilmot, Anglin, Kerr, Otty, Lindsay,

     McClellan, Connel, and Dr. Thompson 
     <lb/>
     spoke. Bill agreed to. 
     <lb/>
     
     
      </p>
            <p>The adjourned debate on the amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the address stood for twelve 
     <lb/>o'clock, but was not taken up until the 
     <lb/>afternoon, when Mr. Gilbert resumed. </p>

   <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName>Â  [referring to a ques<lb break="no"/>tion put by him to hon. member from 
     <lb/>St. John (Mr. Anglin) calling on him 
     <lb/>to make known the reasons of his resig<lb break="no"/>nation.] said he thought his hon. col<lb break="no"/>league (Attorney General) had forgot<lb break="no"/>ten that he stated to the House that he 
     <lb/>did not give his reasons for resigning 
     <lb/>his seat as an Executive Councillor. 
     <lb/>He (Mr. Gilbert) had a distinct recol<lb break="no"/>lection that he did, and they were put 
     <lb/>in the Journals of the House as a Mat<lb break="no"/>ter of record. He had called upon the 
     <lb/>hon. member of St. John (Mr. Anglin) 
     <lb/>to give his reasons for leaving the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and he had been told that it 
     <lb/>was an extraordinary thing to ask that 
     <lb/>information; but he would tell his hon. 
     <lb/>friend that he had not done his duty to 
     <lb/>the country, in not making them known. 
     <lb/>For his own part he wished to under<lb break="no"/>stand the full reasons of his resignation, 
     <lb/>as it was important that everything 
     <lb/>should be known that had a bearning 
     <lb/>upon the question under discussion. He 
     <lb/>would now resume. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the great question of 
     <lb/>the union of the Colonies, and he spoke 
     <lb/>with all due deference to the able men 
     <lb/>of the Confederate party, who had 
     <lb/>framed the measure, he thought that 
     <lb/>they did submit the scheme in far too 
     <lb/>hasty a manner. It would not, he 
     <lb/>conceived, have added to the character 
     <lb/>of the people of the Province for pru<lb break="no"/>dence and sagacity, to have accepted it 
     <lb/>without deliberation and without 
     <lb/>demanding more time for serious 
     <lb/>reflection. But since the first sub<lb break="no"/>mittal of the scheme, they had had 
     <lb/>many important considerations brought 
     <lb/>before their their notice that clearly demon<lb break="no"/>strated the propriety of effecting the 
     <lb/>union of the Provinces. They had been 
     <lb/>authoritatively informed by dispatches 
     <lb/>from the Colonial Secretary, that it was 
     <lb/>the expressed and avowed policy of Her 
     <lb/>Majesty's Government, that union 
     <lb/>should take place. They had been 
     <lb/>made to understand that it was the de<lb break="no"/>sire of that Government not to have 
     <lb/>Â Canada pulling one way, Nova Scotia 
     <lb/>pulling in another, and New Brunswick 
     <lb/>in another, but to have them all united 
     <lb/>under one General Government, with 
     <lb/>one policy and one interest. Though<lb/> 
               <lb/>the sectional difficulties of the Canadas 
     <lb/>had he confessed, in the first instance 
     <lb/>stared the question, there were other 
     <lb/>reasons that had urged it on. The 
     <lb/>mother county had looked to the state 
     <lb/>of feeling towards herself in the neigh<lb break="no"/>boring Republic, and to its aggressive 
     <lb/>spirit; she had seen that the abrogation 
     <lb/>of the Reciprocity TreatyÂ was certain 
     <lb/>to happen , and viewing the question of 
     <lb/>union of these Colonies as one not alone 
     <lb/>affecting themselves, but in the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the empire at large. She de<lb break="no"/>sired their consolidation in order to 
     <lb/>continue British institutions in America.Â  
     <lb/>These were the reasons why she had 
     <lb/>taken so positive a stand and had ex<lb break="no"/>pressed a determination that the union 
     <lb/>of the Colonies should take place. And 
     <lb/>she looked to the vast county that 
     <lb/>stretched north of the Lakes, from 
     <lb/>Labrador to the Polar Sea, from BritishÂ  
     <lb/>Columbia to Baffin Bay. She looked 
     <lb/>to the Canadas with their fertile lands,Â

     and their products of grain, and saw 
     <lb/>
    that in the event of the abrogation of 
     <lb/>the Reciprocity Treaty, the products of 
     <lb/>that vast, boundless and rich territory 
     <lb/>would not be allowed to find their way 
     <lb/>to the seaboard through a hostile coun<lb break="no"/>try. She asw that the Americans, from 
     <lb/>necessity would have to put all sorts of 
     <lb/>embargoes on goods; that on account 
     <lb/>of their vast debt that it would becomeÂ  
     <lb/>absolutely necessary to impose very 
     <lb/>heavy taxes, almost amounting to pro<lb break="no"/>hibition; that they would be driven by 
     <lb/>necessity to that course, and finding 
     <lb/>their Canadian neighbors compelled to 
     <lb/>send their products throught their terri<lb break="no"/>tory, they would be subjected to very 
     <lb/>heavy imports. Therefore, in view of 
     <lb/>the commercial interests of the Cana<lb break="no"/>das, it would become absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary to have the Provinces confeder<lb break="no"/>ated, and that would lead to the build<lb break="no"/>ing of an Inter- colonial Railway. It 
     <lb/>appeared from the delays and difficul<lb break="no"/>ties attending the action of three seper<lb break="no"/>ate Legislatures to have been found al<lb break="no"/>most impracticable to build that railway 
     <lb/>out of union. It was absolutely neces<lb break="no"/>sary for the prosperity of the country 
     <lb/>that it should be built. It had become 
     <lb/>an absolute necessity to have means for<lb/>the constant transport for the ever<lb/>increasing products of the Canadas.<lb/>At the merchant's wharves at Toronto,<lb/>Montreal and Quebec, immense stores<lb/>of grain and flour were piled up, and<lb/>had to remain there during the winter<lb/>months, subject to deterioration and loss,<lb/>for want of speedy and commodious<lb/>thransport to the seaboard. The absolute <lb/>necessity of an Inter-colonial Railway,<lb/>as thus shown, might be one of the rea<lb break="no"/>sons why the British Government desired<lb/>that the Provinces should be united in<lb/>one compact.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

     The Government, by this paragraph in

     the Speech endorsed the policy of Her

     Majesty's Government. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ments, when they therein said that Union

     the policy of the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, must expect that the House would 
     <lb/>
     give an affirmative answer. There was

     no doubt about that. But that Union

     That plainly, he conceived, showed that 
     <lb/>
     Union was the policy of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     It was thus clearly seen that they had 
     <lb/>
     stultified their former position; whereas 
     <lb/>
     last year they were opposrd,they were 
     <lb/>
     this year committed, to the policy of 
     <lb/>
     Union. Then since Union was their po<lb break="no"/>licy, how were the Government going to 
     <lb/>move in the matter? He had been in<lb break="no"/>formed that the Government would not<lb/>be called upon to vote upon any of the<lb/> 
               <lb/>details, (they knew they could not get ten 
     <lb/>men to agree in one single point, or carry 
     <lb/>a scheme in detail,) but they would only 
     <lb/>be asked to affirm the general principle. 
     <lb/>All that the Mother Country was anxious 
     <lb/>about was to get the approval of the 
     <lb/>House to the general question of Union, 
     <lb/>that carried, the British Government' 
     <lb/>would arrange the details in England 
     <lb/>with the advice of men from the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince who would be there to look after 
     <lb/>their interests. The House would see 
     <lb/>that it would not be necessary to vote 
     <lb/>upon the details of the Quebec Scheme 
     <lb/>or any other Scheme. Nothing would be 
     <lb/>necessary than to pass a resolution in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of Union. That was all that was ex<lb break="no"/>pected of New Brunswick. For his own 
     <lb/>part he would not be justified by the duty 
     <lb/>ne owed to his constituents to vote for 
     <lb/>any such proposition. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Let hon. members read carefully the 
     <lb/>speeches of last year, and of the present 
     <lb/>and note the difference between them, 
     <lb/>
 
    
            <cb/>
          
     and the result of the analysis would be to 
     <lb/>
     convince the House that the Government 
     <lb/>had entered into a solemn agreement that<lb/>the present House would be committed<lb/>to union. His hon. colleague (Attorney<lb/>General) said now, that he was willing to<lb/>
    go for union and the cardinal point of re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population, provided he 
     <lb/>could get in the upper branch of the Leg<lb break="no"/>islature some check to that principle. 
     <lb/>How could he reconcile his present posi<lb break="no"/>tion on union with that taken by him last 
     <lb/>year? How reconcile the Government<lb/>policy of union with their celebrated 
     <lb/>Minute of Council, when they were as 
     <lb/>far distant from each other as the North 
     <lb/>was from the South ? His hon. colleague 
     <lb/>talked. about checks In the Upper House, 
     <lb/>to the principle of representation by 
     <lb/>population. But what check could there 
     <lb/>be unless it came from the people them<lb break="no"/>selves? Would his hon. colleague say 
     <lb/>that fifteen representatives for New<lb/>Brunswick in the Lower House in the 
     <lb/>general confederated Parliament, would<lb/>not be sufficient if the proportion of re<lb break="no"/>presentation for the Lower Provinces<lb/>remained as it was under the scheme? 
     <lb/>Would any one say that it would be a 
     <lb/>sufficient safeguard to the Province if 
     <lb/>the Lower House sought to over-ride its 
     <lb/>rights to have that increased representa<lb break="no"/>tion in the Upper Branch ? (Here the 
     <lb/>hon. member referred, in illustration of 
     <lb/>his argument that the Upper House 
     <lb/>could not check encroachment, by point<lb break="no"/>ing to the British House of Lords -- the 
     <lb/>most powerful and peculiarly privileged 
     <lb/>political body in the world - show that 
     <lb/>even that august body was unable to 
     <lb/>check the popular principle. He gave as 
     <lb/>an instance the passssage of the first Reform 
     <lb/>BillÂ  in England, when in the face of the<lb/>resolution of the majority of the House of<lb/> 
               <lb/>Lords to oppose it, they with the Iron 
     <lb/>Duke at their head, had been forced to 
     <lb/>give way to the determinationÂ  of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple that the Bill should pass ) If his hon. 
     <lb/>colleague said he would agree to repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population, if neutralized by 
     <lb/>some check in the upper branch, he was, 
     <lb/>knowing, as he must, how powerless 
     <lb/>any check there would be to the popular 
     <lb/>principle, in fact a thorough- going and 
     <lb/>as strong a unionist as George Brown 
     <lb/>himself.

     Leaving now the question of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, and the uncertain, not to say ambi<lb break="no"/>guous position of the Government in 
     <lb/>
     reference to it, he would come to another 
     <lb/>
     matter. In condemning it, he would 
     <lb/>give it as a very strong reason why he<lb/>
    voted against them and for the amend<lb break="no"/>ment. He would ask the House to look 
     <lb/>at the correspondence of Mr. Wilmot 
     <lb/>with the Government on the subject of 
     <lb/>his resignation. After reading that cor<lb break="no"/>respondence, and considering calmly the 
     <lb/>remarks that gentleman had made in ex<lb break="no"/>planation of his position, he came to the 
     <lb/>conclusion that the Government was not 
     <lb/>a truthful Government. Mr. Wilmot 
     <lb/>said that His Excellency in Council, at 
     <lb/>the time the Minute of Council was drawn 
     <lb/>up, had referred to him as not opposed 
     <lb/>to the abstract principle of union He 
     <lb/>had also given in evidence the authority 
     <lb/>of the present Judge Allen, that he had 
     <lb/>expressed strong sentiments in favor of 
     <lb/>union before he went to Canada. The 
     <lb/>Government had contravened these state<lb break="no"/>ments, and said that that honorable gen- 
     <lb break="yes"/>leman had got converted in Canada and 
     <lb/>had more than hinted at influences 
     <lb/>brought to bear upon him, to induce a 
     <lb/>sudden change of opinion. But Mr.

     Wilmot, in the course of this debate, had        
     <lb/>drawn from a member of the Government<lb/>an admission that he was correct in his<lb/>statements. The Provincial Secretary <lb/>had been forced to admit that what Mr. <lb/>Wilmot had said was true. Was it not,<lb/>he would ask hon. members, a humiliating <lb/>fact that the Government had been obliged<lb/>to state on the floors of the House, that<lb/>their statement in this public document<lb/>was not the fact? That admission on<lb/>their part was, he conceived, enough to<lb/>induce hon. members to refuse their con<lb break="no"/>fidence to the Government, and to vote<lb/>for the amendment.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
    

    

    

            <p>
     The leader of the Government, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member of the Government proceeded to 
     <lb/>
     say  hed taken a very active part in the 
     <lb/>
     Governor's  salary question. Those hon. 
     <lb/>
     members who were in the House when 
     <lb/>
     it was defeated, would remember the 
     <lb/>
     force of the speeches made by his hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague on that question,âhow he 
     <lb/>
     made the halls of the Legislature ring 
     <lb/>
     with the fervor of his eloquence. From 
     <lb/>a report of one of his speeches, in the <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Head Quarters</hi> newspaper, he found that<lb/>
    he (Attorney General) then argued that 
     <lb/>it was not money alone, but a great con<lb break="no"/>stitutional question was involved in the 
     <lb/>debate. The resolution to reduce the 
     <lb/>Governor's  salary was not carried ; but 
     <lb/>the question was settled in such a man<lb break="no"/>ner as to be understood that the Govern<lb break="no"/>or should receive it at the old rate. He 
     <lb/>(Mr. Gilbert) with his humble abilities, 
     <lb/>supported him in the position he (Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General) took. But what did they 
     <lb/>find, now that his hon. colleague was no 
     <lb/>longer in the Opposition, but the leader 
     <lb/>of a Government? Turning to the pub<lb break="no"/>lic accounts, he (Attorney General) had<lb/>allowed the Governor to draw his salary<lb/>at the advanced rate. (Here the hon.<lb/>member quoted from the public accounts<lb/>in proof, and showed that the private<lb/>secretary, whose salary was also involved<lb/>in the question, had received Â£50 more<lb/>than he was entitled to under the old<lb/>rate.) Here they found his hon. col<lb break="no"/>league, who had taken so bold a stand<lb/>then, on that question, now bending the<lb/>servile knee.<lb/>
            </p>



            <p>
     It was said the other day, in England. 
     <lb/>
     by Mr. D'Israeli, that it was an honor 
     <lb/>
     to be elected over to the Speaker's chair, 
     <lb/>
     but that it was a far higher honor to be 
     <lb/>
     elected twice. That saying might be 
     <lb/>
     applied to those members who had been 
     <lb/>
     elected twice to represent the same con<lb break="no"/>stituency. It showed that, in the fulfill<lb break="no"/>ment of their first trust they had done 
     <lb/>
     their duty and had earned the confidence 
     <lb/>
    of their constituents. With regard to 
     <lb/>himself, he had twice had the honor of 
     <lb/>representing the constituency of West<lb break="no"/>morland.  When he first came to the 
     <lb/>House he came opposed to the policy of 
     <lb/>tho Government, of which the Attorney 
     <lb/>General was then a member. Now it 
     <lb/>was rumored that he was indebted for 
     <lb/>his present seat in the Legislature to his 
     <lb/>hon. colleague, that it was his influence 
     <lb/>that had carried him in. He denied 
     <lb/>that there was any ground for the ru<lb break="no"/>mor. During the last election his col<lb break="no"/>league and himself had been thrown to<lb break="no"/>gether by the force of public opinion ;    
     <lb/>it was on the great question that was<lb/>then agitating the mind of the country 
     <lb/>that they had come together. He knew 
     <lb/>that he had lost a vast number of votes 
     <lb/>on account of his opposition to Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. It was the force of public 
     <lb/>opinion, as he had said, that had thrown 
     <lb/>them together, and it was the current of<lb/>
  
            <cb/>
         

     public opinion in the country running<lb/>against the Quebec Scheme that had<lb/>carried them into the House. The<lb/>
     County of Westmorland might be en<lb break="no"/>tirely under the guidance of his hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague ; but when it was said that he 
     <lb/>
    (Mr. Gilbert) was returned by his in<lb break="no"/>fluence, an assertion was made that was 
     <lb/>not founded on fact. From what he 
     <lb/>knew of the County of Westmorland he 
     <lb/>did not think that it lay under the dic<lb break="no"/>tation of his colleague or any other man. 
     <lb/>With reference to the position his col<lb break="no"/>league and himself stood with regard 
     <lb/>to each other, they had been opposed al<lb break="no"/>most on every question that had come 
     <lb/>up. On the subject of law reform he 
     <lb/>had been opposed by his colleague, and 
     <lb/>whenever he had brought any measure 
     <lb/>into the House he had most generally 
     <lb/>met with opposition from that quarter. 
     <lb/>His hon. colleague, the leader of the 
     <lb/>Government, was in the habit of saying 
     <lb/>that he was not actuated by desire for 
     <lb/>office. No doubt, when he expressed 
     <lb/>himself as uninfluenced by considera<lb break="no"/>tions of emolument. or personal aggran<lb break="no"/>dizement, he did so in order to give 
     <lb/>weight to his arguments. But what 
     <lb/>weight was there in all those profes<lb break="no"/>sions of disinterestedness? What had 
     <lb/>the hon. members found when this Go<lb break="no"/>vernment was first formed? Why, they 
     <lb/>found the leader of the Government ele<lb break="no"/>vated above all his <hi rendition="simple:italic">confreres</hi> and elec<lb break="no"/>ted President of the Council, an office 
     <lb/>never before heard of in any Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the Province.  He had heard of 
     <lb/>statues being raised to men who had <lb/>done some memorable deed, who had<lb/>performed some signal service to    their 
     <lb/>country ; he had read of men being 
     <lb/>honored for deeds that ought to be com<lb break="no"/>memorated, but he would ask any hon.<lb/>member to point to one single measure<lb/>that had for its object the improvement<lb/>of the country that the leader of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had introduced ; he would<lb/>any hon. member to show if he had<lb/>ever done anything that had been use<lb break="no"/>ful to the country to show any reason<lb/>why he should be elevated above his<lb/>fellows. They would look look in vain,<lb/>they would entirely fail to show<lb/>why he should be considered wor<lb break="no"/>thy of extraordinary honor. Was<lb/>not his taking the office of Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council a direct contradiction<lb/>of his repeated assertions that he was <lb/>not actuated by the desire of office ; that<lb/>he was not influenced by pride and <lb/>vain glory ? Did it not prove that he,<lb/>after all, was actuated by the motives<lb/>and feelings that influenced ordinary<lb/>men ? And that he was as eager as the<lb/>most ordinary man (notwithstanding he<lb/>made a boast, and said he cared not for<lb/>office.) for its position and emoluments.<lb/>Mr. Gilbert then proceeded to refer to<lb/>the Crown Land investigation, and the <lb/>position taken by his colleague towards<lb/>Mr. Fisher, then Attorney General of<lb/>the Government, of which he was a<lb/>member without office. Before the re<lb break="no"/>port of the committee of investigation<lb/>was submitted, before there was evi<lb break="no"/>dence of the extent to which Mr.<lb/>Fisher was implicated in the Crown<lb/>Lands transactions, it was said his col<lb break="no"/>league made a most damaging speech<lb/>against Mr. Fisher, and when Mr.<lb/>Fisher left the Government, his hon.<lb/>colleague accepted the vacated position<lb/>of Attorney General. And further, not<lb break="no"/>withstanding that he had denounced,<lb/>
    in the strongest terms, the jobbing in the<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     Crown Lands of the Province, although 
     <lb/>he should have been the man, above all<lb/>men, who should have investigated the<lb/>transaction ; notwithstanding he had<lb/>denounced the taking up of large blocks<lb/>of valuable lands by Mr. Inches and<lb/>said they had been obtained fradulently.<lb/>He never moved in the matter, but, on<lb/>the contrary, himself became the pur<lb break="no"/>chaser from Mr. Inches, and possessor<lb/>of very large quantities of that very pro;<lb/>perty ; and, moreover, he had rein<lb break="no"/>stated Mr. Inches in the office.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>
     
     His then colleague had denounced<lb/>the Inter-colonial Railway in the very<lb/>strongest terms. He had said that it<lb/>would be the ruin of the country. In<lb/>the celebrated memorandum, in which 
     <lb/>
     he set forth his reason for resigning his 
     <lb/>
     seat in the Government. speaking of the 
     <lb/>
     Inter-colonial Railway, he said that if 
     <lb/>
     it was built, that it would entail such 
     <lb/>
     an amount of debt upon the Province, 
     <lb/>
     that posterity would have to live upon 
     <lb/>
     the cold meat of yesterday. But where 
     <lb/>
     did they find his hon. colleague now? 
     <lb/>
     They found him not only willing to 
     <lb/>
     build the Inter-colonial Railway, but 
     <lb/>
     any amount of railways, at six per cent. 
     <lb/>
     He did not wish to talk in an offen<lb break="no"/>sive vein, but how could he justify<lb/>
         his position now, when he remembered<lb/>
     
     his former position. Then he prophe<lb break="no"/>sied ruin and desolation if the Province 
     <lb/>
     carried out its Railway policy. Now he 
     <lb/>
     was perfectly willing to pledge the credit 
     <lb/>
     of the Province to any amount, and build 
     <lb/>
    any quantity of Railroads. Let the 
     <lb/>House mark the inconsistency of his 
     <lb/>hon. friend. Notwithstanding his re 
     <lb/>peated avowals that he would not 
     <lb/>accept office ; notwithstanding that  he 
     <lb/>told the warm-hearted people of the 
     <lb/>County of Westmorland that he cared 
     <lb/>not for office, that it was his proudest 
     <lb/>wish and sole aim to attend to their in<lb break="no"/>terests, to serve them, and to do the 
     <lb/>country good. Notwithstanding all these 
     <lb/>disinterested declarations, they found 
     <lb/>him taking an office with Â£ 600 a year at<lb break="no"/>tached, as soon as a vacancy occurred, 
     <lb/>and that the election came off in the short<lb break="no"/>est possible time. He did not wish to 
     <lb/>throw out any insinuation against the 
     <lb/>worthy Sheriff of the County, but he 
     <lb/>would say that when he appointed the 
     <lb/>election to come off ten days after the

     <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName> then proceeded to give de<lb break="no"/>tails about the Westmorland election, 
     <lb/>
     throughout which he had been accused 
     <lb/>
     of taking a very active part in opposition to 
     <lb/>
     his hon. colleague, and in bringing out 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Palmer ; and, in consequence of the 
     <lb/>
     course he had taken, it was said a strong 
     <lb/>
     feeling against himself had been mani 
     <lb/>
    fested by the people of the County. On 
     <lb/>the day of nomination he met his hon. 
     <lb/>colleague on the hustings, and it had 
     <lb/>been published throughout the length and 
     <lb/>breadth of the land, that in reply to his 
     <lb/>colleague's attack upon him he (Mr. G.) 
     <lb/>could not get a hearing. That was false. 
     <lb/>When he did rise to answer the attack, 
     <lb/>he was prevented from speaking for 
     <lb/>about fifteen minutes by an uproar round 
     <lb/>the hustings ; that that noise and uproar 
     <lb/>was quelled, and he had afterwards the 
     <lb/>satisfaction of addressing the people of 
     <lb/>Westmorland for three quarters of an 
     <lb/>hour. It was the largest assemblage he 
     <lb/>had ever seen, on any occasion, in the 
     <lb/>County. The people might have been 
     <lb/>counted by the acre. When it was known 
     <lb/>that Palmer had withdrawn from the

     contest, the announcement fell on that 
     <lb/>vast assembly like a great calamity. The<lb/>reason why Mr. palmer did not run was<lb/>that he did not wish to expend a great deal<lb/>of money in contesting the election.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> - Did his<lb/>colleague mean to say money had any in<lb break="no"/>fluence in carrying an election in West<lb break="no"/>morland ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName>. âHe believed the con<lb break="no"/>stituency of Westmorland was as pure as 
     <lb/>any in the Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     He would now come to another charge 
     <lb/>
     againt the Government. If he had 
     <lb/>
    other reasons for giving the Government 
     <lb/>his opposition, the mode they had adopt<lb break="no"/>ed in their appointment to the Judicial 
     <lb/>Bench would be sufficient. Without say<lb break="no"/>ing a word in disparagement of Judge 
     <lb/>Ritchie, he held that the exercise of their 
     <lb/>prerogative in appointing him to the po<lb break="no"/>sition of Chief Justice and passing over<lb/>Judge Wilmot, was unjustice. Judge 
     <lb/>Wilmot had done great service for his 
     <lb/>country. and he deserved better treatment 
     <lb/>from their hands. In years gone by, 
     <lb/>when this Province lay under the rule of 
     <lb/>an oligarchy, and its dignities and its 
     <lb/>offices were monopolized by the system 
     <lb/>of family compactism that then prevailed, 
     <lb/>he remembered well hearing within the 
     <lb/>walls of this legislative hall, that system 
     <lb/>of Government denounced by the present 
     <lb/>Judge Wilmot. By the powers of his 
     <lb/>great eloquence, and the daring and 
     <lb/>straightforward course he pursued, he 
     <lb/>succeeded in introducing into this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince the system of Departmental and 
     <lb/>Responsible Government it now enjoyed. 
     <lb/>In the profession, his abilities as a lawyer 
     <lb/>had been decried, because he would not 
     <lb/>bring down his great mind to the petty 
     <lb/>technical details. But in his grasp of the 
     <lb/>great principles of law, though he might 
     <lb/>be equalled by some, he was surpassed by 
     <lb/>none. If the Government had gone out 
     <lb/>side the Bench, and appointed some mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the profession to the position, he 
     <lb/>would have said nothing. But having 
     <lb/>gone to the Bench to make the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of Chief Justice, they ought to have 
     <lb/>taken the Judge by seniority, and ap<lb break="no"/>pointed Judge Wilmot as being the senior 
     <lb/>puisne Judge of the Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
    

            <p>
     He felt bound to tell the Government 
     <lb/>
     that one of the Commissioners of the 
     <lb/>
     Railway had now in his hands from Â£500 
     <lb/>
     to Â£600 of the money of the Province, 
     <lb/>
     which had not been accounted for. He 
     <lb/>
     meant Mr. Scovil, and he alluded to the 
     <lb/>
     purchaae by him of the House known as 
     <lb/>
     the Adams House, which property he 
     <lb/>
     had purchased for the Government from 
     <lb/>
    Mr. Turner, and which had been sold by 
     <lb/>Mr. Scovil at the suit of Mrs. Bell, and 
     <lb/>the proceeds used to discharge a private 
     <lb/>debt owed by him to her. He was sorry to 
     <lb/>be obliged to mention this, and to drag<lb/>the name of Mr. Scovil (who was bro<lb break="no"/>ther-in-law to his hon. colleague) before<lb/>the public; but he felt it his duty to<lb/>bring the matter up, as the government<lb/>ought to hvae taken action by this time,<lb/>and had the money refunded. The loss<lb/>occasioned to the Province, as appeared<lb/>from the public accounts of the present<lb/>year, on account of this transaction, was no<lb/>less a sum than $1,857.47, being the defi<lb break="no"/>cency after crediting the Province for the<lb/>amount for which the property had been<lb/>sold. that amount was more than half the<lb/>amount expended on by-roads for the Coun<lb break="no"/>ty of Westmorland during the last year.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>At the beginning of the debate a great<lb/>deal had been said of the endeavor<lb/>made in the Province during the excite<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
         
ment of the last election, and the alarm 
     <lb/>
     raised by the Fenian movement set 
     <lb/>
     class against class, creed against creed, 
     <lb/>
     and to prejudice the Roman Catholics 
     <lb/>
     in the minds of the Protestant commu<lb break="no"/>nity. For his own part, he believed that 
     <lb/>
     if any difficulty arose that would call up<lb break="no"/>on the inhabitants to defend their Pro<lb break="no"/>vince agains invasion, there was no class 
     <lb/>who would answer the call to arms more 
     <lb/>readily, or defend their homes and fire<lb break="no"/>sides mÃ©re bravely than that class 
     <lb/>through whose veins Celtic blood flowed, 
     <lb/>for the Irishman was loyal to his heart's 
     <lb/>core; he was loyal to his religion, and<lb/>he was loyal to his Queen, loyal to fhe 
     <lb/>country of his birth, and to his country by 
     <lb/>adoption.Â  
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName> then concluded by saying 
     <lb/>
     that it was his intention to vote for the 
     <lb/>
     amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">HON. MR. BOTSFORD</persName> had not in<lb break="no"/>tended to make any remarks on the 
     <lb/>
     subject which now engrossed the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House, as it hd already 
     <lb/>
     been so full debated, and he had not 
     <lb/>
     yet quite recovered from a severe attack 
     <lb/>
     of sickness, but he reluctantly felt com<lb break="no"/>pelled to offer some observations in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the charges preferred against 
     <lb/>
     the Department over which he presided, 
     <lb/>
     and if, in the heat of debate, anything 
     <lb/>
     should fall from him calculated to 
     <lb/>
     wound the feelings of any hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House, he wouldl deeply re<lb break="no"/>gret it; but he could subscribe to 
     <lb/>the proposition of Mr. williston, when 
     <lb/>he depreciated the personalities used by 
     <lb/>the speakers who had preceded him in 
     <lb/>this debate, excusing the members of 
     <lb/>the Opposition and attaching all the 
     <lb/>blame to the members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment and its supporters. Mr. Botsford 
     <lb/>would ask Mr. W. who first made the 
     <lb/>attack? the terms, "mean, low politi<lb break="no"/>cal pigmies," "trators," &amp;c.. tn freely 
     <lb/>used by the Opposition, could not but 
     <lb/>call forth a corresponding response, and 
     <lb/>arouse the strongest feelings of indig<lb break="no"/>nation in the members of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to which he belonged . 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     Before entering on the discussion of 
     <lb/>
     the charges made against his Depart<lb break="no"/>ment, he would refer to some of the 
     <lb/>charges and gross personal attacks made 
     <lb/>the hon. member who preceded him. 
     <lb/>and he had listened with astonishment 
     <lb/>at the unfair and unmanly attacks made 
     <lb/>by him on the private character of a 
     <lb/>gentleman who was not here to defend 
     <lb/>himself, and which he considered a 
     <lb/>gross slander. He alluded to the charge 
     <lb/>of embezzlement against R. C. Scovil, 
     <lb/>Esq, a gentleman of high standing, 
     <lb/>respectability and integrity , and which 
     <lb/>charges Mr Gilbert would not haveÂ  
     <lb/>dared to utter in the County where he 
     <lb/>resides, and he could only tell that hon. 
     <lb/>gentleman that Mr. Scovil's character 
     <lb/>would in no way be injured by such 
     <lb/>assertions,. for Mr. Scovil stood as far 
     <lb/>above him in Westmorland as the beams 
     <lb/>of the noonday sun outshine those of 
     <lb/>the moon.Â  
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     That hon. member has stated that he 
     <lb/>
     was elected to oppose any union with 
     <lb/>
     the Canadas, and that the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme has not the test question at the 
     <lb/>
     last general election. Mr. Botsford's 
     <lb/>constituents in Westmorland are quite<lb/>
    conversant with the platform on which 
     <lb/>the members were then returned, and 
     <lb/>the principles they were pledged to 
     <lb/>maintain, and it will be interestin to 
     <lb/>trace Mr. Gilbert's inconsistent conduct 
     <lb/>from the late general election up to the 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     present time. Every one knows that 
     <lb/>the present Government was formed ex<lb break="no"/>pressly on the principle of antagonism 
     <lb/>to the Quebec Scheme, and when his 
     <lb/>honor the Speaker was proposed for 
     <lb/>that office by the hon. member for 
     <lb/>Charlotte, Mr. McClellan, a strong 
     <lb/>Â Confederate and supporter of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Scheme, was nominated in opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, and Mr. Gilber's vote is to be 
     <lb/>found recorded on the Journals against 
     <lb/>the present Speaker, and thereby ignor<lb break="no"/>ing the very principle he had solemnly 
     <lb/>pledged himself to maintain. We next 
     <lb/>find that when the address in answer to 
     <lb/>the speech last session was under con<lb break="no"/>sideration, he made a violent onslaught 
     <lb/>on the Government and their policy, 
     <lb/>notwithstanding they had only been a 
     <lb/>few days in office; then again when the 
     <lb/>Militia Bill, brought in by the late At<lb break="no"/>torney General (Judge Allen), was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed, we find his hon. colleague in 
     <lb/>direct opposition to the Govemment, 
     <lb/>and voting against the main principle 
     <lb/>of the Bill. The only measure that met 
     <lb/>the approval of Mr. Gilbert was the re<lb break="no"/>solution authorizing a delegation to 
     <lb/>proceed to England, for the purpose of<lb/>counteracting any false impression made 
     <lb/>ou the British Government by the 
     <lb/>Canadians, which Mr. G thought was 
     <lb/>fully justified at that time, but now states 
     <lb/>that he recalls that vote for the flimsey<lb/>reason that a despatch received after 
     <lb/>his vote, and only a few days before the 
     <lb/>close of the session, was not published. 
     <lb/>It reminded him the Irishman and his 
     <lb/>pig which Paddy was driving to a 
     <lb/>neighbor who had bought him. After 
     <lb/>a good deal of difficulty, Paddy suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in getting him on the right road. 
     <lb/>As he was proceeding along the road, 
     <lb/>he met a neighbor, who accosted him 
     <lb/>and asked where he was going. Paddy 
     <lb/>said to Mr. Caleroft's, a contrary way 
     <lb/>to that which he was in; his neighbor 
     <lb/>replied he was wrong, he was in the 
     <lb/>road to Mr. Bandon's, the person who 
     <lb/>had bought the pig. " Whist!" says 
     <lb/>Paddy. " if the contrary devil hears that 
     <lb/>he will go the wrong way." And so 
     <lb/>Mr. Gilbert when he finds that he has 
     <lb/>once been on the right road, like 
     <lb/>Paddy's pig, will take the other. My 
     <lb/>hon. colleague says that when he saw 
     <lb/>the memorable minute of Council which 
     <lb/>has caused so much excitement and 
     <lb/>has been styled insulting to the British<lb/>Government, he highly approved of it, 
     <lb/>and endorsed every word. That Min<lb break="no"/>ute of Council was written when the 
     <lb/>Hon. Mr. Smith was in England, and the 
     <lb/>Government had done nothing since to 
     <lb/>offend Mr. Gilbert; but whent the leader 
     <lb/>of the Government, after much solicita<lb break="no"/>tion, accepted the Attorney General<lb break="no"/>ship, and he had to return to his con<lb break="no"/>stituents. We next find Mr. Gilbert 
     <lb/>heading an opposition to defeat him. 
     <lb/>Circulars were addressed to every lead<lb break="no"/>ing Confederate in Westmorland, re<lb break="no"/>questing their attendance at the office 
     <lb/>of Mr. Steadman, one of the defeated 
     <lb/>candidates, and a strong advocate of 
     <lb/>the Quebec Scheme. Mr. Gilbert was 
     <lb/>chairman of the meeting (which he de<lb break="no"/>nies, but admits he was at it), A.L. 
     <lb/>Palmer. Esq., a defeated Confederate 
     <lb/>candidate before, was nominated at the 
     <lb/>opening of the poll, and Mr. Gilbert 
     <lb/>will remember the failure of his at<lb break="no"/>tempt to reply to the Attorney General. 
     <lb/>beforeÂ  about 2,000 of his constituents, 
     <lb/>and the indignant rumblings then 
     <lb/>heard were a sufficient warning of what 
     <lb/>

     The Surveyor General then enumer<lb break="no"/>ated the charges against his Depart<lb break="no"/>ment, as follows: lst. A sale of 5,000

     acres of land to Mr. Gibsonâ 10,000 
     <lb/>
     acres ordered to be sold by the late

     in the first place, to the 2d, 3d and 4th 
     <lb/>
     sections of the Land Regulations, which

    are as follows:

     Mr. Botsford then showed, beyond a 
     <lb/>
     doubt. that the non-publication of the 
     <lb/>
     repeal of that order had no effect what<lb break="no"/>ever Â  one way or another on the sale of 
     <lb/>
     lands. That people continuedÂ  to apply 
     <lb/>
    as befoe, who had no intention of com<lb break="no"/>plying with the conditions of actual 
     <lb/>settlement, ever since 1862. Such, for 
     <lb/>instance, as I believe the Hon. John 
     <lb/>Ferguson, 200 acres, in Gloucester; 
     <lb/>William Doherty, 200 acres in Kent; 
     <lb/>Samuel J. Scovil, 274 acres, in King's; 
     <lb/>and many others who could never pos<lb break="no"/>sibly be regarded as intending actual 
     <lb/>settlement. In the year 1862, 28,160 
     <lb/>acres were sold at auction ; in 1863, 18,<lb break="no"/>397 acres; in 1864, 18, 415 acres. and in 
     <lb/>1865, 17, 050 acres conclusively show<lb break="no"/>ing that in 1865, in the latter year when

     All under the auction system, and<lb/>without a word of conditions of actual 
     <lb/>
     settlement. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The form of land petition used pre<lb break="no"/>vious to, and after the order of 1862, 
     <lb/>
     has all along been the same, and never 
     <lb/>
     did embody the conditions of actual set<lb break="no"/>tlement. When the order was rescind<lb break="no"/>ed, the lands were advertised without 
     <lb/>conditions annexed, and the Deputy 
     <lb/>Surveyors were required to sell them 
     <lb/>absolutely. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     The Surveyor General then explained 
     <lb/>
     the sale of 10,000 acres to Mr. Gibsonâ 
     <lb/>
     twenty-five different persons applied 
     <lb/>
     for 200 acres each. They were ascer<lb break="no"/>tained to be <hi rendition="simple:italic">bona fide</hi> applicants who 
     <lb/>
     signed their own petitions. The land 
     <lb/>
     was surveyed and return thereof made 
     <lb/>
     in their names, but it was reported by 
     <lb/>
     the Deputy to be totally unfit for actual 
     <lb/>
     settlement, the usual notice of sale was 
     <lb/>
     given in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Royal Gazette</hi>, and when 
     <lb/>
     offered at auction Mr. Gibson became 
     <lb/>
     the purchaser. Some hon. members 
     <lb/>
     had condemned the system of selling 
     <lb/>
     large tracts of such land, unfit for culti<lb break="no"/>vation. He could only inform the 
     <lb/>
     House, that the wild land tax alone 
     <lb/>
     largely exceeds the sum that would be 
     <lb/>
     paid by Mr. Gibson for an annual li<lb break="no"/>cence to cut lumber, while it lasts, ex<lb break="no"/>clusive to the whole amount of the pur<lb break="no"/>chase money paid to the Government 
     <lb/>for the land. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>He would now call the attention of 
     <lb/>the House to the 10,000 acres affair. A 
     <lb/>short time after he had been in office, 
     <lb/>Mr. Gibson called, and wished the tract 
     <lb/>brought to sale, which he stated the late 
     <lb/>Government had promised to do. On 
     <lb/>investigation he found, by documen<lb break="no"/>tary evidence, that the late Surveyor 
     <lb/>General, at Mr. Gibson's request, sub<lb break="no"/>mitted this proposition to the Council.

     was It consistent? Since Mr. Gibson

            <p>When the present Government as<lb break="no"/>sumed office, Mr. Gibson requested that

     the Legislative Council in answer to the

     only an amendment adopting the Quebec

     <lb/>
     Parliamentary usage forbade him from

     alluding to the discussion on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion, nor could he make any comments on

     the way it was carried through that hon<lb break="no"/>orable body. He would assume that the

     <lb/>
     confined to his bed; that another mem<lb break="no"/>ber had been unavoidably called away, 
     <lb/>
     and that Mr. Fisher had pressed his 
     <lb/>
    Amendment through the House, and 
     <lb/>carried it by a majority of five for the 
     <lb/>purpose of affirming the Quebec Scheme. 
     <lb/>Why, with all the charges made against

     <lb/>not believe Mr. Fisher would be guilty

            </p>
            <p>He would not pass on to the charge<lb/>the hon. member, Mr. Fisher, made<lb/>with reference to his temporary ab<lb break="no"/>sence from the Crown Land Office. He<lb/>told his colleagues in the Government,<lb/>on accepting the office of Surveyor<lb/>General, that he would not ecome a<lb/>permanent resident at Fredericton, and<lb/>if accepting office involves the principle<lb/>of permanent residence at Head Quar<lb break="no"/>ters, and a necessity of being compelled<lb/>to remove one's establishment to it, and<lb/>this House should confirm the doctrine;<lb/>it will limit the appointment to persons<lb/>living in Fredericton, and the surround<lb break="no"/>ing and adjoining Counties; and he<lb/>challenged the hon. gentleman to point<lb/>out a single instance where the interest<lb/>of teh public has suffered in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of his temporary absence, to use<lb/>the ordinary expression of that hon.<lb/>gentleman, "to the bosom of his<lb/>family."<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>
     He then alluded to the card of the 
     <lb/>
    hon. member for York, at last election, 
     <lb/>where he proclaims that he has left the 
     <lb/>impress of his mind on the political in<lb break="no"/>stitutions of the country, and that he 
     <lb/>looked down on the members of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment as <hi rendition="simple:italic">political pigmies</hi>, and claim<lb break="no"/>ed that he himself would occupy a large 
     <lb/>and conspicuous place in the history of 
     <lb/>thc Province. Why, he was the onc in<lb break="no"/>dividual who was turncd out of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment by his colleagues for impro<lb break="no"/>perly acquiring public lands. And how 
     <lb/>did this same hon. gentleman, who ac<lb break="no"/>cuses the present Government of being 
     <lb/>mean, low fellows, act after this dis<lb break="no"/>grace? Like a spaniel, he was seen to 
     <lb/>lick the hand that struck him, and proved 
     <lb/>indeed the most obsequious servant of 
     <lb/>the men who treated him as unworthy 
     <lb/>of being a member of their Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Another charge made by Mr. Fisher 
     <lb/>is the appointment of Chief Justice 
     <lb/>Ritchie, which he stated was for politi<lb break="no"/>cal purposes. This he (Mr. Botsford)<lb/>denied. Judge Ritchie was appointed 
     <lb/>to that responsible situation because of 
     <lb/>his talents and standing as a Jurist, and 
     <lb/>the Government are prepared to justify 
     <lb/>it; but, if Mr. Fisher thinks that Mr. 
     <lb/>Justice Ritchie's appointment detracts 
     <lb/>from the talents and standing of Mr. Jus<lb break="no"/>tice Wilmot, he (Mr. Botsford) could not 
     <lb/>help it; but when he charges the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment with dragging in politics, 
     <lb/>and justifies Judge Wilmot's voting at 
     <lb/>elections, and taking part in political 
     <lb/>squabbles, he wholly dissented from 
     <lb/>such unsound doctrine. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     There might have been some slight 
     <lb/>
     palliation for the offence of Judge Wil<lb break="no"/>mot addressing a Grand Jury on the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec Scheme in the County of Sun<lb break="no"/>bury when the excitement ran high, and 
     <lb/>
     the country was convulsed from one 
     <lb/>
     end to the other; but when that excite<lb break="no"/>ment had subsided, and the people had 
     <lb/>
     prononuced their verdict against the 
     <lb/>
     scheme, and it was virtually dead. what 
     <lb/>
     do we find? When a vacancy took 
     <lb/>
     place in the representation of the Coun<lb break="no"/>ty of York, by the promotion of Mr. 
     <lb/>
    Justice Allen to the Bench, after a lapse 
     <lb/>of many months, when the Judge had 
     <lb/>ample time for reflection. The hon. 
     <lb/>member (Mr. Fisher) was a candidate 
     <lb/>at the election in opposition to Mr. 
     <lb/>Pickard, who was recognized as the 
     <lb/>Government candidate, and at the hust<lb break="no"/>ings proclaimed that Confederation was 
     <lb/>not the question at issue, that Fenianism 
     <lb/>and hostility to the present Government<lb/>was his avowed platform.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

    

            <p>
     He (Mr. Botsford) held that when<lb/>Judge Wilmot so far forgot his posi<lb break="no"/>tion as a Judge, and entered into that 
     <lb/>
     political contest, and ostentatiously 
     <lb/>
     voted for Charles Fisher, he prostituted 
     <lb/>
     the ermine with which he was clothed; 
     <lb/>that was his opinion, he might be wring.<lb/>
    Suppose a riot took place in the pre<lb break="no"/>sence or the Judge, between thc several 
     <lb/>partizans, and an indictment was pre<lb break="no"/>ferred against anti-Confederates en<lb break="no"/>gaged therein, and Mr. Justice Wilmot 
     <lb/>was the presiding Judge, could he pos<lb break="no"/>sibly divest himself the strong politi<lb break="no"/>al bias, which, to a certain extent, 
     <lb/>would opterate on his mind at the trial? 
     <lb/>Probably eo might, but he could not 
     <lb/>convince parties holding opposite views 
     <lb/>that. even-handed justice would be dis<lb break="no"/>pensed. Why, the other day the House 
     <lb/>was discussing a Bill authorizing a 
     <lb/>Judge to try a cause where his interest 
     <lb/>was only the seventh part of a cent. It<lb/>

     it be necessary to pass such a law in 
     <lb/>
     this instance, how much more important 
     <lb/>
     is it that a Judge should keep aloof 
     <lb/>
     from all political contests.

     The hon. member from Restigouche 
     <lb/>
     has called us " mongrels," and has con<lb break="no"/>demned us because we have alluded to 
     <lb/>
     the despatches from the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in the speech. My hon. colleague 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Gilbert) also does so.

            <p>
     There is an unerring law of nature 
     <lb/>
     applicable to the animal kingdom, that 
     <lb/>
     when certain species amalgamate they

     produce hybrids. These Counties have

     returned what I call hybrid politicians,

     <lb/>
     will be subserved .

            </p>

            <p>
     Thu Surveyor General thanked the 
     <lb/>
     House for its indulgence, and left the 
     <lb/>
     question in its hands, feeling satisfied 
     <lb/>
     that after calmly considering the evi<lb break="no"/>dence, it will triumphantly acquit the

<!-- GL, 2018-03-06, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->


            <!--<p>WEDNESDAY, MARCH 28. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p/>
   
            <p>
     On motion of MR. WETMORE, the 
     <lb/>
     House went into a Committee of 'the 
     <lb/>
     Whole on a Bill to revive. and continue 
     <lb/>
     an Act entitled an Act for the relief of 
     <lb/>
     insolvent debtors. This. Bill caused a 
     <lb/>
     long discussion. and was finally referred 
     <lb/>
     to a select Committee. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House then proceeded to the order 
     <lb/>
     of the day: ' 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     THE ADJOURNED DEBATE 0N MR. FISHER'S 
     <lb/>
     AMENDMENT. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     MR. McCLELI.AN said that before the 
     <lb/>
     Hon. Surveyor General resumed his 
     <lb/>
     speech, he would claim the indulgence of 
     <lb/>
     the House to reply to some observations 
     <lb/>
     which that gentleman made yesterday 
     <lb/>
     when he (Mr. McC.) was not in his seat. 
     <lb/>
     He was informed that the Hon. Surveyor 
     <lb/>
     General had complained of his having 
     <lb/>
     made an unfair statement concerning the 
     <lb/>
     granting of twenty-seven acres to Mr. 
     <lb/>
    Gibson without public sale. What he 
     <lb/>( Mr. McClellan) stated was as follows: 
     <lb/>That on enquiry at the Land Office he 
     <lb/>had ascertained that amongst other lands 
     <lb/>granted to Mr. Gibson, were two small 
     <lb/>lots detached from the main body, one of 
     <lb/>fifty acres at the Nashwaak Falls, and 
     <lb/>another of twenty- seven acres at the head 
     <lb/>of the river, and commanding the waters 
     <lb/>of St. Mary's Lake, that the latter, 
     <lb/>though advertised in the Gazette, along 
     <lb/>with the other lands applied for at the 
     <lb/>time, was not sold publicly but granted 
     <lb/>to Mr. Gibson without being offered to 
     <lb/>public competition at all, but that the 
     <lb/>clerk had told him in justification of the 
     <lb/>proceeding, that this lot was so granted 
     <lb/>to Mr. gibson to compensate him for a 
     <lb/>deficiency in another lot which he (Mr. 
     <lb/>Gibson) held. The Hon. Surveyor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral could not have noticed the whole re<lb break="no"/>ference,, or he would not have imputed 
     <lb/>any unfairness in the statement. Several 
     <lb/>other hon. members could assert that he 
     <lb/>had so stated the case, every word of 
     <lb/>which he (Mr. McClellan) could substan<lb break="no"/>tiate. He did not censure this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment particularly in this matter, but the 
     <lb/>system was open to suspicion. and if this 
     <lb/>was the proper time to discuss the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of the crown lands, he was quite 
     <lb/>prepared to show that however much the<lb/>
            </p>

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Government might veneer or whitewash 
     <lb/>
     their system of management, a close in<lb break="no"/>spection would reveal the fact, that the 
     <lb/>
     interests of the people were neglected 
     <lb/>
     and a great public wrong inflicted by the 
     <lb/>
     present administration in connection with 
     <lb/>
     this matter. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. MR. SMITH rose to order, and 
     <lb/>
     said this was not the proper time to argue 
     <lb/>
     the question further, when the Hon. Sur<lb break="no"/>veyor General was entitled to the floor. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. ANGLIN said the Hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Albert (Mr. McClelan) had stated the 
     <lb/>
     case most unfairly and unjustly yesterday, 
     <lb/>
     and he was now putting it in exactly the 
     <lb/>
     same light again. His impression, from 
     <lb/>
     what his hon. friend had stated, was that 
     <lb/>
     these twenty-seven acres were part and 
     <lb/>
     parcel of the 10,000 acres sold to Mr. Gib<lb break="no"/>son, and these twenty-seven acres were sold 
     <lb/>
     to him by the present Surveyor General 
     <lb/>
     without competition, because they com<lb break="no"/>manded tha head waters of the St. Mary's 
     <lb/>
     Lake. This was the impression convey<lb break="no"/>ed to every member of the House, with 
     <lb/>
     the exception of the late surveyor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral. The sale of this land took place in 
     <lb/>
     1860, by order of the Government, and it 
     <lb/>
     passed through sereral hands before Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gibson bought it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. McCLELAN, in reply, said that 
     <lb/>
     the hon. member from St. John would do 
     <lb/>
     well to keep cool, for if it became a ques<lb break="no"/>tion of veracity between that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man and himself, he (Mr. McClelan) had 
     <lb/>
     no fear that his assertion would have. as 
     <lb/>
     much weight with the people of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick as that of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     from St. John. He had stated only facts, 
     <lb/>
     which he was prepared to prove, and he 
     <lb/>
     had done so, too, frankly and openly, and 
     <lb/>
     without any prevarication or distortion 
     <lb/>
     and concealment.Â  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon MR. SMITH again rose to order, 
     <lb/>
     and. amidst considerable confusion, the 
     <lb/>
     standing order of the House was insisted 
     <lb/>
     on by Mr. Needham, and the discussion 
     <lb/>
     was continued with closed doors. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     AFTERNOON SESSION 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Hon MR. BOTSFORD.âBefore the 
     <lb/>
     recess my hon. friend from the County 
     <lb/>
     of Albert (Mr. McC.) was making some 
     <lb/>
     explanation with reference to what I 
     <lb/>
     considered a charge made by him 
     <lb/>
     against. the Government. I charged 
     <lb/>
     him with imparting to the people erone- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ous information in regard to the twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     seven acres of land which Mr. Gibson 
     <lb/>
     purchased from Mr. Chipman at the rate 
     <lb/>
     of $3 per acre. In his explanation he 
     <lb/>
     still conveys the same eroneous impres<lb break="no"/>sion, that this land was purchased from 
     <lb/>
     the Government without competition. 
     <lb/>
     It has been stated here that I maintain<lb break="no"/>ed the doctrine that all information re<lb break="no"/>garding Crown Lands should be sought 
     <lb/>
     for at the head office of the department, 
     <lb/>
     l never made any such assertion. I 
     <lb/>
     never said information should not be 
     <lb/>
     imparted at the deputies' office. I said 
     <lb/>
     that when they wanted information on 
     <lb/>
     which to ground a charge against the 
     <lb/>
     head of the department, it, was a fair, 
     <lb/>
     open, manly way to come to the head 
     <lb/>
     office for information. Â  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In reference to the charge that notice 
     <lb/>
     was not given in the Royal Gazette of 
     <lb/>
     the rescinding of this Order of Council, 
     <lb/>
     it will be borne in mind tha from 1862t 
     <lb/>
     until June, 1865, all notices in the Royal 
     <lb/>
     Gazette for the sale of land, under auc<lb break="no"/>tion, was subject to a condition of ac<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>tual settlement, but from the time that<lb/>order was rescinded in 1865, that notice<lb/>requiring actual settlement was left out. 
     <lb/>
     The very moment that condition was 
     <lb/>
     not annexed to the advertisements, the 
     <lb/>
     land would be sold at auction to the 
     <lb/>
     highest bidder. therefore this gave it. 
     <lb/>
     every possible publicity. (Mr. Lind<lb break="no"/>sayâ The Royal Gazette says the condi<lb break="no"/>tions will be explained at the time of 
     <lb/>
     sale, and the deputy said he had no in<lb break="no"/>structions only those which he had re<lb break="no"/>ceived some years ago, and he was led 
     <lb/>
     to suppose the same regulations still 
     <lb/>
     continued.) If any person will take the 
     <lb/>
     Gazette and look at the advertisements 
     <lb/>
     for the sale of land by auction, from last 
     <lb/>
     June, he will find that there are no con<lb break="no"/>ditions of actual settlement attached to 
     <lb/>
     those sales after the rescinding of the 
     <lb/>
     Order of Council, thereby conclusive<lb break="no"/>ly showing to every deputyâthrough 
     <lb/>
     this Gazette, which is his rule and 
     <lb/>
     guideâthat no condition of actual set<lb break="no"/>tlement was required. Notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing that notice did take place, itdid not 
     <lb/>
     increase the sales of land, neither did 
     <lb/>
     the publication of the rescinding of the 
     <lb/>
     Order of Council, and the comments 
     <lb/>
     thereon in the St. John paers, in Sep<lb break="no"/>tember. In the_ month of July there 
     <lb/>
     were two thousand one hundred acres 
     <lb/>
     sold, in August three thousand one hun<lb break="no"/>dred, September three thousand, Octo<lb break="no"/>ber three thousand two hundred. Nov<lb break="no"/>ember two thousand seven hundred, 
     <lb/>
     December three thousand. This shows 
     <lb/>
     very conclusively that the sales of land 
     <lb/>
     did not increase after the rescinding of 
     <lb/>
     the Order of Council was published 
     <lb/>
     throughout the length and breadth of 
     <lb/>
     the land. The next charge was made 
     <lb/>
     in reference to the non-appointment of 
     <lb/>
     an Auditor General. (Mr. Botsford 
     <lb/>
     then read the law regarding the office.) 
     <lb/>
     We have gone according to law and the 
     <lb/>
     accounts in that office have been made 
     <lb/>
     up, so that they could see at a glance 
     <lb/>
     the state of the finances of the country. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Westmorland 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Gilbert) has alluded to a vote of 
     <lb/>
     want of confidence, which he says has 
     <lb/>
     taken place in the other branch of the 
     <lb/>
     Legislature. I do not know as it is 
     <lb/>
     parliamentary to speak  of the proceed - 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     ings of that body, but I think that I have 
     <lb/>
     a right to do so, as the subject has been 
     <lb/>
     introduced. It has been represented 
     <lb/>
     that that vote of want of confidence is 
     <lb/>
     no more or less than that they are favor<lb break="no"/>able to a union in any way whatever. 
     <lb/>
     This means nothing more or less than 
     <lb/>
     that they are favorable to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme. It has been stated by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     mover of the amendment, that it is per<lb break="no"/>fectly futile for any member of the 
     <lb/>
     House of Assembly to object to this 
     <lb/>
     question of representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion, as it was a sine qua non with Upper 
     <lb/>
     Canada. Therefore, the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council, knowing they could get no 
     <lb/>
     other scheme, have by their vote of 
     <lb/>
     want of confidence declared themselves 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the Quebec Scheme. (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     WilmotâThe leader of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, so far as I understood him, ad<lb break="no"/>mitted that he would consent to repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population, provided there 
     <lb/>
     were checks in the Legislative Council. 
     <lb/>
     I put the question to him and he ad<lb break="no"/>mitted it clearly and distinctly.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     HON. MR. SMITHâI made no such 
     <lb/>
     statement. I said I never would 
     <lb/>
     go for representation, pure and simple. 
     <lb/>
     I would not go for it without checks and 
     <lb/>
