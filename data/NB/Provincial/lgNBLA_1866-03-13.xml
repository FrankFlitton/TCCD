<fw type="num">10</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> 
    
<!-- GL, 2016-11-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->       

 <!--<p>possession when the House was in Ses<lb break="no"/>sion last season ; but it did not suit their <lb/>
purpose to communicate it to them, be<lb break="no"/>cause it indicated to them the mind of the <lb/>
Imperial Government upon the
question <lb/>
of Confederation ; but his hon. friends <lb/>
saw comfort and pleasure in the distance, <lb/>
and it would not do to let a House of<lb/>
Assembly know that the Imperial Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had made up their minds upon this<lb/>
point. When these delegations go
to<lb/>
England on public business for
the benefit<lb/>
of the country he was willing to
pay them <lb/>
for it ; but if they went for a useless pur<lb/>
pose and spent hundreds of pounds,
he<lb/>
would begin to ask himself, whether or no<lb/>
that money would not be more wisely ex-<lb break="yes"/>
expended in making a road or building a<lb/>
bridge in some back part of his County.<lb/>
It is aid they went for the purpose of<lb/>
carrying on other negotiations, but the<lb/>
other negotiations are not authorised in<lb/>
the resolution. They went to effect a<lb/>
Union of the Maritime Provinces, so far<lb/>
as we can judge from Mr. Cardwell's reply;<lb/>
that seemed to be the principal part of<lb/>
their mission, and it was an extraordin<lb break="no"/>ary thing that they also received this<lb/>
despatch through Canada. He would ask<lb/>
if secresy was to be the rule of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. He complained of them be<lb break="no"/>cause they had not taken precautionary<lb/>
measures in regard to the defence of this<lb/>
country. There is a great deal of feelings<lb/>
along the line in regard to some lawless<lb/>
attempts from armed desperadoes from<lb/>
the United States. It has been the<lb/>
fear of this country for several years<lb/>
that upon the close of the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can war there would be vast num<lb break="no"/>bers of disbanded soldiers who, having<lb/>
no other business to do, would collect<lb/>
in crowds around towns and cities, and<lb/>
make an attack upon this country. Large<lb/>
numbers of these returned soldiers are<lb/>
entirely out of employment, and being<lb/>
men of no principle or character, have<lb/>
joined an organization formed for the<lb/>
purpose of making an attack upon these<lb/>
Provinces, which has created a great<lb/>
alarm along the frontier. He had been<lb/>
one of those who had thought a large<lb/>
military expenditure unnecessary, for he<lb/>
thought it was best to expend the mo<lb break="no"/>ney in making the country fit to live in ;<lb/>
but now things have changed, and what<lb/>
they had feared for the last few years<lb/>
was coming upon them, and he had<lb/>
changed his opinion in regard to this<lb/>
matter. We know that a vast conspi<lb break="no"/>racy is carried on by lawless despera<lb break="no"/>does, who care not for Jew or Gentile,<lb/>
and we must be prepared to meet them.<lb/>
Have the Government of the country<lb/>
given any assurance that they are mak<lb break="no"/>ing any preparation to meet the danger.<lb/>
The House authorized the expenditure of<lb/>
$30,000 for a Camp of Instruction. Why<lb/>
not have that Camp meet in the month of<lb/>
March, the time of trouble. He had not<lb/>
been much alarmed, but if he had a wife<lb/>
and children on the border, he would<lb/>
soon decamp (laughter) ; he would take<lb/>
his wife and children to a place of safe<lb break="no"/>ty, and then return and defend his pro<lb break="no"/>perty. They should have the men drill<lb break="no"/>ed along the borders. They need not<lb/>
tell him they were going to try and get<lb/>
troops from the British Government. He<lb/>
knew the military authorities were indis<lb break="no"/>posed to send troops along the line, be<lb break="no"/>cause they would desert. The wording<lb/>
of his resolution had already started<lb/>
the Sergeants, and the House would<lb/>
start the Generals bye and bye.<lb break="no"/>They should have selected the month of<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
            <p> March for their Camp of Instruction, for<lb/>
when that month was over, the time of<lb/>
danger would be passed away. There<lb/>
should be no delay in this matter. In<lb/>
Canada they are sending the military<lb/>
and troops in all directions, and making<lb/>
great preparation to meet the danger.<lb/>
We, on the contrary, are perfectly pas<lb break="no"/>sive, while our country is in a state of<lb/>
growing, continuous, and increasing<lb/>
excitement. In protecting themselves.<lb/>
the people of this country would not<lb/>
stand about pounds, shillings, and pence.<lb/>
In 1812, our fathers went through the<lb/>
wilderness to Canada. That was the<lb/>
spirit of 1783, and the same spirit ani<lb break="no"/>mates the people of this country now,<lb/>
to defend their firesides from lawless<lb/>
aggression. The Government has done<lb/>
nothing for them. The whole nature of<lb/>
the Government appears to have been<lb/>
forgotten. They have been scattered<lb/>
to the four winds of Heaven : one off at<lb/>
Washington, one one place, and one<lb/>
another, and when at last met together,<lb/>
they had to send to St. John to swear a<lb/>
member in to make a quorum. It ap<lb break="no"/>pears that the defence of the country is<lb/>
considered a small business in compari<lb break="no"/>son with sustaining themselves in office<lb/>
for a short time. An idea was put for<lb break="no"/>ward by his hon. friend, regarding this<lb/>
military business, that the Government<lb/>
were not responsible for the acts of the<lb/>
Commander-in-Chief, because he had<lb/>
certain powers for which he alone was<lb/>
responsible. He (Mr. Fisher) said,<lb/>
that, for every act of the Commander-<lb break="maybe"/>
in-Chief in military matters, the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council were responsible. The <lb/>
Constitution did not permit them to <lb/>
enquire into his conduct at all, for he is <lb/>
responsible to the Queen alone ; but for<lb/>
every act, military or civil, the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was responsible to them. He<lb/>
stated this, because he had seen in the<lb/>
papers an account of a speech, made by<lb/>
the Attorney General, in which it was<lb/>
stated that the Commander-in-Chief was<lb/>
alone responsible in military matters.<lb/>
Three or four years ago this was a<lb/>
matter of small importance, but when<lb/>
they came to expend $30,000 a-year<lb/>
for this purpose it was a more serious<lb/>
matter. He should be sorry to have<lb/>
the military officers appointed from one<lb/>
party or the other ; but there could be<lb/>
no doubt that, for every one appointed,<lb/>
the Council were as responsible for, as<lb/>
for any other acts of the Government.<lb/>
He then stated, and read some extracts<lb/>
to prove, that this question was settled<lb/>
in England sixty years ago, which was<lb/>
the last time any controversy arose in<lb/>
regard to difficulties with the army.</p>
            <p>The next point he would refer to was<lb/>
the appointment of Judges. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have induced men to look to<lb/>
politics in regard to appointments on the<lb/>
Bench. In appointing the Chief Justice,<lb/>
they had one plain course to adopt to<lb/>
avoid this danger : either to appoint the<lb/>
Attorney General, or some other gentle<lb break="no"/>man outside the Bench, or appoint the<lb/>
oldest Judge on the Bench. They had<lb/>
seen a letter in one of the newspapers writ<lb break="no"/>ten by Mr. Boyd, in which it is stated that<lb/>
he heard, one year before, that upon the<lb/>
appointment had lessened his confidence<lb/>
and lessened the confidence of the people<lb/>
of the country in the administration of<lb/>
justice. He had been told that the rea<lb break="no"/>son Judge Wilmot was not appointed,<lb/>
was because he had voted for him, and<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>

            <p> made two speeches in favor of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to Grand Juries. It is the common<lb break="no"/>est thing in the world for Judges in<lb/>
England to refer to matters of that
kind<lb break="no"/>to great even a that are
transpiring. He<lb/>
(Mr. Fisher) then eulogized. Judge <lb/>
Wilmot very highly, stating
that he had <lb/>
been a schoolmate, and read out
of the <lb/>
same book ; that they had run an
election <lb/>
together, and he had assisted in advocat<lb break="no"/>ing the interests of their
common coun<lb break="no"/>try in getting this country a Constitution. <lb/>
He then referred to the testimony of <lb/>
Judge Parker and the Hon John A.Street <lb/>
in regard to his learning and integrity,
<lb/>
and said he believed the bright
light of <lb/>
that Judge was shining in all its
original <lb/>
lustre, and that he was one of
the grand <lb/>
ornaments of the country.<lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> MR. Fisher
then referred to the <lb/>
Speech, and asked what it meant, and <lb/>
whether they were going to
improve upon <lb/>
the present Confederation scheme. He <lb/>
believed the most objectionable feature in <lb/>
it was unchangeable- that was represen<lb break="no"/>tation by population. He was not going <lb/>
to speak upon the question now, but he, <lb/>
believed they would have this union yet. <lb/>
Could they wonder that the people here
<lb/>
should have been excited when the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor read that passage. What was the<lb/>
cause ? Approbation. (Mr. Anglin<lb break="no"/>" Good training.") The men were as <lb/>
respectable as the hon. member
from St. <lb/>
John. They were some of the
first mer<lb break="no"/>chants of Fredericton, and farmers from <lb/>
the vicinity. They have required a posi<lb break="no"/>tion and property, and loving the Queen <lb/>
as they do, they could not help expressing <lb/>
their feelings when her representative <lb/>
read that a union of the British North <lb/>
American Colonies was an object
much <lb/>
to be desired.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The debate was adjourned until 2 P.M., <lb/>
and the House was adjourned to meet <lb/>
again at 10 A.M., to-morrow. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>T. P. D. <lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">DEBATE ON THE AMENDMENT TO THE 4TH <lb/>
PARAGRAPH OF THE ADDRESS</head>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> resumed <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName>,
on resuming, said, he <lb/>
would refer to the principal points put <lb/>
before the House yesterday, when
he <lb/>
said, that the very fact that the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture had no been convened till one <lb/>
month after the usual time, showed an <lb/>
utter disregard of the wants and wishes of <lb/>
the people, and was in itself sufficient to <lb/>
condemn the Government before the <lb/>
country. The absence of the
Attorney <lb/>
General at Washington was no
sufficient <lb/>
excuse. He had referred to the vacilla<lb break="no"/>tion of the Government, and their failure <lb/>
to fill up the public offices. as against
the <lb/>
ends and spirit of the Constitution ; that <lb/>
provided there should be a certain num<lb break="no"/>ber of salaried and responsible officers
; <lb/>
yet, during the time the Government had <lb/>
held office, there was hardly one to be <lb/>
found in his place—one officer was off to <lb/>
one place and another to another place. <lb/>
He had referred to the Government not <lb/>
filling up the office of Solicitor
General. <lb/>
The Constitution demanded that
the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor should have the advice of hon. <lb/>
gentlemen to conduct the business
of the <lb/>
country ; while the Attorney
General was<lb/>
off to England and to Washington the <lb/>
country had been without the advice of a <lb/>
Crown Officer. When he (Mr. F.) was <lb/>
Attorney General he never had left home
<lb/>
for two days but he found that
letters and <lb/>
documents had been flowing in
conti<lb break="no"/>nuously demanding his attention. Things <lb/>
must have marvellously changed since
he <lb/>
was in power, if, with the advancing pro<lb break="no"/>perity of the country, with the advancing <lb/>
tide of civilization, there was not siill the <lb/>
same flow of business—the name need
of <lb/>
the constant advice of the officers of the <lb/>
Crown. The Government had kept the <lb/>
office of Solicitor General dangling before <lb/>
the country because they could
not find <lb/>
one man who was willing to take
it, and <lb/>
run the risk of an election. That
fact <lb/>
showed the Government was
sinking, and <lb/>
since it had come into power, it
had <lb/>
sunk lower and lower, till it was difficult <lb/>
to imagine it would sink any
lower. And <lb/>
the salary of the Solicitor
General had <lb/>
not been saved to the country. He knew <lb/>
           
            <cb/>  
          
 enough
of the value of the services of <lb/>
legal gentlemen retained to do
the busi<lb break="no"/>ness, to know that. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He had
referred to the fact that there <lb/>
was not an efficient office of Audit. He <lb/>
had gone into the Audit Office
and
found <lb/>
that of all the entries, amounting
to <lb/>
$700,000, not one account had been <lb/>
legally audited. He knew that the
office <lb/>
of Auditor General was one of the most <lb/>
important in the country. Ha had shown <lb/>
that it formed part of its Constitution ; <lb/>
that among the arrangements
made,when <lb/>
the Civil List was surrendered, was one<lb/>
that there should be an efficient Office of <lb/>
Audit ; that it was in fact, the crowning
<lb/>
consequence and result of that arrange<lb break="no"/>ment. Mr. Fisher quoted the dispatch of
<lb/>
Lord Glenelg, of September, 1836, in <lb/>
proof.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> " Among
the
objects," His Lordship ob<lb break="no"/>served, " to which it is my purpose to <lb/>
devote a portion of this surplus, is the <lb/>
institution of an efficient Office of Audit <lb/>
within the Province for all the
Revenues <lb/>
raised and expended in it. I am, of <lb/>
course, aware that, at present, it is the <lb/>
custom of the House of Assembly to <lb/>
appoint, from time to time. Committees <lb/>
of that Body to whom are
referred such <lb/>
financial returns as are laid on the table, <lb/>
and also, in fact, exercise the power of <lb/>
auditing the accounts specified
in
such <lb/>
returns. It is far from my
intention to <lb/>
undervalue the labors of these Commit<lb break="no"/>tees, or to question the advantage which <lb/>
must accrue to the public
service from the <lb/>
rigid supervision, by the Representatives
<lb/>
of the people, of the expenditure
of the <lb/>
Executive Government ; but, at the same <lb/>
time, Committees of a popular
Body are <lb/>
but an inadequate substitute for a per<lb break="no"/>manent and responsible officer
whose <lb/>
duty it would be to inspect the accounts <lb/>
of the public departments. The expe<lb break="no"/>rience and practical skill, the
intimate <lb/>
and continuous knowledge which
are ne<lb break="no"/>cessarily acquired by such an
officer, give <lb/>
him many advantages over any
fluc<lb break="no"/>tuating body. It is also to be
observed <lb/>
that the appoinment of an
Auditor im<lb break="no"/>mediately, responsible to His Majesty,
is <lb/>
more consistent with the Constitution and <lb/>
practice of the Kingdom than the con<lb break="no"/>signing of the duty of examining
the <lb/>
PUBLIC ACCOUNTS ALTOGETHER TO THE<lb/>
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> I will lose no time in communicating <lb/>
with the Lords of the Treasury to prepare
<lb/>
in concert with them the
necessary ar<lb break="no"/>rangement for the constitution of an<lb/>
efficient Officer of Audit." <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>
then
went on to show what <lb/>
were the powers and duties of Auditor <lb/>
General. He was invested with judicial <lb/>
powers ; he might require
accounts
on <lb/>
oath and witnesses, and books or
papers <lb/>
to he produced, and if not within six <lb/>
months to disallow them. He had the <lb/>
power of Justice of the Peace, and might <lb/>
examine witnesses on oath ; he was re<lb break="no"/>viewer by certeorare ; no proceedings <lb/>
could be bad for the recovery of any sums <lb/>
of money until the Auditor General had <lb/>
made a report on them. He
might send <lb/>
his clerk abroad to examine into the facts <lb/>
of an account, and a certified
copy of au<lb break="no"/>dit and order of council was evidence in <lb/>
all cases, and argued
that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been guilty of a
violation of the <lb/>
law and the Constitution of the country <lb/>
in not appointing an Auditor General ; <lb/>
they had been derelict in their
duty, and <lb/>
did not deserve the confidence
of the <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
          
House. He had referred to the legisla<lb break="no"/>tion of the Government ; the only thing <lb/>
they had done was to pass a Treasury <lb/>
Note Bill, which had not yet received the<lb/>
approval of Her Majesty. He had never
<lb/>
thought much of paper money, and of as<lb break="no"/>signats ; he preferred the good old gold,
<lb/>or some solid equivalent, yet looking <lb/>
abroad at the tendency of the
times, he <lb/>
was afraid the Province would be
forced <lb/>
to adopt them. He had referred to the<lb/>
Post Office Bill, and must express his<lb/>
surprise that after the Bill had been <lb/>
thrown out in the Upper House,
a gentle <lb/>
man of that body should have been elect<lb break="no"/>ed to fill the office of Postmaster General.<lb/>
He had referred to the Crown Land<lb/>
               <lb/>

Office, and maintained that when the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment wished to break down regula<lb break="no"/>tions, in common justice to
the country <lb/>
the repeal should have been notorious as <lb/>
the framing
itself. He had referred to <lb/>
the despatch of the l2th of April, 1865,<lb/>
and he put it to the House if they would <lb/>
countenance a Government in keeping <lb/>
back despatches received from the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Government. We had been talk<lb break="no"/>ing very largely of the greatness of the <lb/>
Province, and of the humiliation of being <lb/>
connected with Canada and Nova Scotia ; <lb/>
but was it consistent with that greatness
<lb/>
that the Province should receive the first <lb/>
news that such a dispatch had bean writ<lb break="no"/>ten through these sources ? <lb/>
            </p>








            <p> [ <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> here quoted part of the said  <lb/>
dispatch, which expressed the approval <lb/>
of Her Majesty's Government of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec scheme, on the ground that it was <lb/>
eminently calculated to promote effectual <lb/>
provisions for general defence, directing <lb/>
the Governor to bring the scheme before <lb/>
his advisers ; showing that New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, as a separate Province, could make <lb/>
no adequate provision for its
own defence, <lb/>
and that the Government should
reason<lb break="no"/>ably attach great weight to the views and <lb/>
wishes of England.] 
</p>




            <p> He maintained no one could justify <lb/>
the Government in keeping back such a <lb/>
dispatch ; it was an infraction of the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. Why was the dispatch
so im<lb break="no"/>portant ? Because, if laid before the <lb/>
House when it should have been
last <lb/>
Session, there would have been no need <lb/>
to send a delegation home, which had, it <lb/>
was said, cost the country £800.
In pri<lb break="no"/>vate life, suppose a case where one of the <lb/>
parties to a contract kept back on impor<lb break="no"/>tant paper, what would that be called ? <lb/>( <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. Wetmore</persName>, -I might call it fraud.)<lb/>
What he (Mr.
F.) complained of in the<lb/>
Government was
if they erred in small <lb/>
things, they would err, if occasion
offer<lb break="no"/>ed, in great. He had referred to the <lb/>
delegation, and be must say,
after the <lb/>
glorifications of the press of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, he felt sorry, he felt humiliated,
at <lb/>
the manner our delegates had
been receiv<lb break="no"/>ed compared to those of Canada.
While <lb/>
the Canadian Ministers had been present<lb break="no"/>ed to the Queen, and had every honor paid <lb/>
them, our men had been snubbed. He<lb/>
had referred to the other
dispatch of the <lb/>
28th July, in the reply to the delegates.<lb/>
published in Canada but never in New <lb/>
Brunswick, in which Mr.
Cardwell said : <lb/>

<fw type="num">12</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw>

            <p> He had referred to the insulting minute <lb/>
of the 12th July, in answer to a
dispatch <lb/>
of Mr. Cardwell of the 24th
June, on the <lb/>
subject of the conference between the<lb/>
Imperial Government and the Canadian <lb/>
Deputation, in which the
advantages of <lb/>
union was discussed in its
various aspects, <lb/>
and its absolute importance in a military <lb/>
point of view pointed out, and
asserting <lb/>
the authority of the Imperial Government <lb/>
to urge upon the Province what they con<lb break="no"/>sidered expedient for defence, and closing <lb/>
with the hope that, after a careful consid<lb break="no"/>eration of the subject, they
would perceive <lb/>
the advantage of union. What was
the <lb/>
answer to that dispatch ? What
he con<lb break="no"/>demned the Government for was
that they <lb/>
did not clothe that answer to the commu<lb break="no"/>nication to the Queen in gentlemanly,
at <lb/>
least if not in elegant language. He <lb/>
considered it also highly indecorous and <lb/>
unprecedented that, in a grave
dispatch <lb/>
reference should have been made
to a<lb/>
newspaper article. He would read it, <lb/>
and ask the House if it was not an insult<lb break="no"/>ing document. For himself, he
wished <lb/>
to relieve himself of the odium
of it. <lb/>
Nothing he had found, the Government <lb/>
had done had roused such a feeling in his <lb/>
own County. He had been met by peo<lb break="no"/>ple from all parts, who said to him during <lb/>
the last election : You must, on
the hust<lb break="no"/>ings, refer to and denounce that minute <lb/>
of council. <lb/>

            <p> He (Mr

like that before. He thought the
country <lb/>
had occasion to know that the British <lb/>
Government knew better what was going <lb/>
on than we did ourselves. It was <lb/>
the people who wrote that paper—refer<lb break="no"/>ring to the statements of a newspaper <lb/>
writer—that showed their ignorance. <lb/>
Was that a fair statement ? Was the <lb/>
writer of the despatch conscious
that the <lb/>
scheme proposed to restore to the Cana<lb break="no"/>das their local institutions, and that in <lb/>
case of a failure to carry it out, its authors <lb/>
were pledged to restore to Upper and <lb/>
Lower Canada a great measure of
the lo<lb break="no"/>cal independence surrendered in 1840. <lb/>

            <p>He had referred to the Judicial ap<lb break="no"/>pointments, and the evidence of
an emi<lb break="no"/>nent legal gentleman on Judge Wilmot's <lb/>

administra<lb break="no"/>tion of justice, and that a generation <lb/>
would pass away before the
people would <lb/>
have the same confidence in it they had <lb/>
two months ago. He had referred
to <lb/>
Judge Wilmot's two speeches on Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, and said that, surely, could not <lb/>
have been the cause of his rejection. It <lb/>
was nothing strange for a Judge to speak <lb/>
on the topics of the day. He had himself <lb/>
heard Judge Parker speak on a
new
<lb/>
School Law ; be had referred to what <lb/>
Judge Coleridge had done in
England.<lb break="no"/>He believed that the matter of the <lb/>
appointment of Judge Ritchie to
the <lb/>
Chief Justice
had been arranged a year <lb/>
ago. He had heard so much to that

            </p>


            <p> ( <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. Anglin</persName>.—How
did the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment know that Judge Parker
would<lb/>
die ?) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>.—They
could not know <lb/>
that ; but they knew that Sir
James Car<lb break="no"/>ter would resign. He (Mr. F.) had made <lb/>
some observation with regard to the Mi<lb break="no"/>litia, in answer to what
the Government <lb/>
had said last year regarding
their irre<lb break="no"/>sponsibility in regard to Militia matters, <lb/>
and showed four transactions, during the <lb/>
administration of Lord Granville, that <lb/>
had taken place in England 60
years ago, <lb/>
that the control of all military
matters, <lb/>
formerly in the hands of the King,
were <lb/>
vested in those of the Executive
Council, <lb/>
with the proviso that no change in the go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the army should be
carried in<lb break="no"/>to effect without the knowledge and appro<lb break="no"/>bation of the King. It was the same in <lb/>
this Province, where the
Constitution was a <lb/>
copy in miniature of that of the Imperial <lb/>
Constitution. The Governor acted with <lb/>
        
            <cb/>

 and by
the advice of his Council—re<lb break="no"/>sponsible to the Queen, but his every act <lb/>
the act of his Government. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He would ask the House to condemn<lb/>
the Government because they had made<lb/>
no sufficient preparations for the defence<lb/>
of the country. He knew that they had <lb/>
a lot of men in camp during summer, but <lb/>
that effected nothing. What he com<lb break="no"/>plained of in the Government was that<lb/>
they had not spent the $30,000 voted for <lb/>
militia purposes, and that had been wasted <lb/>
with little purpose on the Camp of In<lb break="no"/>struction, in making arrangements tor <lb/>
drilling men over the Province.
If they <lb/>
had worked out such on arrangement
in <lb/>
the month of March, some preparation <lb/>
would have been made for the defence of <lb/>
the country. If the present crisis passed
<lb/>
away without difficulty, they would at <lb/>
least have a body of drilled men at an ex<lb break="no"/>pense little above the sum that had been <lb/>
thrown away, he must say, upon
the Camp <lb/>
of Instruction. He never had thought there <lb/>
was
much good in the militia heretofore, <lb/>
but the times were changed, and
the peo<lb break="no"/>ple now demanded that there should be a <lb/>
proper system of defence. Had the <lb/>
country a Government according
to the <lb/>
Constitution,—h:id there
been, as the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution demanded, gentlemen on
the <lb/>
spot to give advice, the people would not <lb/>
have been crying out. Proper provisions <lb/>
would have been made for drilling
men all <lb/>
along the frontier. and the people would
<lb/>
have had assurance that something was <lb/>
being done. The feeling in the country<lb/>
was the same as had animated the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince in 1812,
and the men of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince this day were as willing
to make sa<lb break="no"/>crifices and undergo hardships, if occa<lb break="no"/>sion demanded, as then. What the coun<lb break="no"/>try had reason to complain of,
what he <lb/>
called on the House to condemn
the Go <lb/>
vernment for was, they had failed in their <lb/>
duty to the country at this time. But he <lb/>
was not surprised that the
Government <lb/>
had not done anything ; nor surprised <lb/>
that they had been scattered to
the four <lb/>
winds of Heaven. He was
not astonished <lb/>
that they had not made an Auditor Gene<lb break="no"/>ral ; he did not wonder they had
not crea<lb break="no"/>ted a Solicitor General, because he be<lb break="no"/>lieved they did not know where they were <lb/>
themselves. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> He would now speak on Confederation.<lb/>
He would much like to know where the <lb/>
Government were. He should soon <lb/>
know,  for he had written to a gentleman <lb/>
in Canada who knew pretty much all that <lb/>
was going on ; he should know before <lb/>
this debate closed what the Government
<lb/>
were doing. This Government was <lb/>
formed on an Anti-Confederate basis<lb break="no"/>but where were they
now ? We find that <lb/>
there was put in the Speech a paragraph <lb/>about Confederation, and that involved a <lb/>
measure of Union to be submitted by <lb/>
them. A year ago, they argued that the <lb/>
country would be ruined by Confederation,
<lb/>
and now they were
ready to submit some <lb/>
scheme themselves. When Confederation <lb/>
was first mentioned in the Province, they
<lb/>
found
that opposition to it was a capital<lb/>
piece
of political
clap trap to hoist them<lb break="no"/>selves into office. But where
were they <lb/>
now ? The Speech said that the
Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were going to put forth a measure <lb/>
of Confederation. He would
like to <lb/>
know some. of the foreshadowings
of that <lb/>
measure. He would like to know at what <lb/>
hour, what time or the day, in
what parti<lb break="no"/>cular place, they changed their
minds, in <lb/>
order that they might hold on to office ? <lb/>
But he could tell them they would not be <lb/>
allowed to hold on to office
much longer. <lb/>

he could not respect any man, or
any set <lb/>

You might cajol the people for a time,

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> went
on to show that the <lb/>
Government, by their Minutes, had
ex-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederation, and that up to the 14th of<lb/>
February they had evinced no symptoms<lb/>
of a change of opinion. Why ? How<lb/>
was it that they come to change
their <lb/>
mind ? If they would not tell the <lb/>
House, he thought he would be
able to <lb/>
do so in three or four days. It was an <lb/>
extraordinary circumstance that he should
<lb/>
read the statement made by the
Hon. J. <lb/>
A. McDonald, at a public dinner
in Cana<lb break="no"/>da, that union would he effected in three <lb/>
weeks. He believed there was some
con<lb break="no"/>nection between that statement
and the <lb/>
avowed policy of the Government. If the <lb/>
Attorney General had made an arrange<lb break="no"/>ment with the Canadian Minister,
he <lb/>
would like to know what the principal <lb/>
points of the arrangement were.
What <lb/>
did they think of the statements
the <lb/>
Government
had made of the Canadian <lb/>
statesmen ? He would tell the House <lb/>
that while these Canadian
Ministers would <lb/>
be held in honor—would he famed
and <lb/>
celebrated for all time to come—these
<lb/>
men would be forgotten forever, or if ever <lb/>
remembered, it would be only to be men<lb break="no"/>tioned with contempt, as men who, to<lb/>
hold on to power,—(no, they had place<lb/>
but not power)—forgot their principles<lb/>
and their honesty ; if remembered, it would <lb/>
be as the first of the Canadian statesmen <lb/>
of New Brunswick who had forgotten her <lb/>
interests and their own responsibility. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> A great
flourish had been made about <lb/>
a Railway contract. That was one of<lb/>
        
            <cb/>
       
 the great
matters that took a delegation <lb/>
of two our members of Government<lb/>
to England. He was opposed to that<lb/>
contract, though he was not opposed to<lb/>
Railways. His objection was that the <lb/>
contract with the Company would never <lb/>
be carried out. His opinion was that<lb/>
the object of the Company was to lock up<lb/>
the road and make a handsome sum
by <lb/>
selling out when the
Inter-colonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way came to be built. All that the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had done in the matter of this <lb/>
contract could have been done for one <lb/>
shilling. All they had to do was
to sat<lb break="no"/>isfy themselves as to the ability of the <lb/>
Company to build the Railway, and that <lb/>
they might have done by letter.
They <lb/>
had agreed to give the Company a fur<lb break="no"/>ther facility by agreeing to pay land <lb/>
damages. Who authorised
the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to do that ? The Facility
Bill only <lb/>
authorised the giving of a subsidy of <lb/>
$10,000 a mile. He would like to know, <lb/>
since the Government had opened the <lb/>
door, could they refuse to give
further <lb/>
aid to the St. Stephen,
Woodstock and <lb/>
Fredericton branches, and to Western <lb/>
Extension ? They transcended
their <lb/>
power when they gave the
Company <lb/>
that additional subsidy. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Then the
Government had made a<lb/>
most extraordinary arrangement with <lb/>
regard to the North Shore Steamer. It <lb/>
went all the way to Boston. The
Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had not shown much
attention <lb/>
to the interests of the Province by that
<lb/>
arrangement. (Hon. Mr. Hatheway<lb break="no"/>it was made with the concurrence of <lb/>
every representative of the North Shore.) <lb/>
He had stated what was the fact.

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>
then proceeded to speak <lb/>
of the reference made in the speech to <lb/>
financial matters. <lb/>
            </p>
 
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p> " An account of the Income and Ex<lb break="no"/>penditure of the past year will be laid <lb/>
before you. Although the Revenue
was<lb/>
considerably less than that
received in<lb/>
1864,
it yet exceeded the estimate ; and <lb/>
1 am happy to inform you that since the <lb/>
close of the financial year, it has steadily
<lb/>
improved. The estimates, which will<lb/>
be immediately submitted to you, have<lb/>
been framed with as close an
attention <lb/>

            </p></quote>

            <p> Was
that the whole truth ? People <lb/>
might suppose, by this statement, that
<lb/>
the Revenue of the last year had exceed<lb break="no"/>ed the expenditure ; but he had taken <lb/>
the trouble to inform himself on this <lb/>
subject. He had found that the
receipts<lb/>
for the fiscal
year, 1865, amounted to <lb/>
$840,390.44, while
the expenditure had <lb/>
been $930,000, leaving a
deficiency of <lb/>
$90,000. Although the revenue
had ex<lb break="no"/>ceeded the estimate—the whole trouble <lb/>
had not been stated—the expenditure<lb/>
had exceeded the total receipts. He<lb/>
did not pretend to know much about<lb/>
financial matters, but what I have stated
<lb/>
is the truth. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>( <persName ref="pers:GILL1">Hon. Provincial Secretary</persName> —The
<lb/>
statement in the speech is the truth ) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, but not the whole truth.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>
went on to speak of his <lb/>
election, and the object he had been elect<lb break="no"/>ed for, to oppose the present Government;
<lb/>
how he had to fight the
whole strength<lb/>
and influence of that Government<lb break="no"/>when he thought of all that the
great<lb/>
constituency of York had done for
him<lb break="no"/>he had never been an ungrateful
man ; <lb/>
he resolved in his mind what he would <lb/>
do to show his gratitude. He
thought <lb/>
         
            <cb/>
         
 of the country—what
hardships the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the back settlements were
sub<lb break="no"/>jected to for want of roads--and he be<lb break="no"/>gan to think it something could not be<lb/>
done for them. He remembered that <lb/>
the Province was full of new settle<lb break="no"/>ment ; and he thought he would
go to <lb/>his friends in Sunbury and Queen's, and<lb/>
other Counties, and see whether they <lb/>
could not, by joining together, raise <lb/>
more money for road appropriation. <lb/>
That was his idea. He thought if he <lb/>
could go to the Government with such <lb/>
parties at his back he could break them
<lb/>
down if they refused to comply with their <lb/>
request. He began to look through
the <lb/>
public accounts to see where the money <lb/>
could come from. He found in the <lb/>
course of his researches that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had been collecting
export duty <lb/>
to the amount of $60,000 ; and he found, <lb/>
on turning to the Journals, that the Re<lb break="no"/>venue Law expired on May 1st, 1865 ; <lb/>
and from that time until now they
had <lb/>
been collecting duties illegally. and <lb/>
every dollar of that $60,000 would have <lb/>
to be paid back. He fixed the blame of <lb/>
this gross neglect upon the Provincial<lb/>
Secretary and the Attorney General. <lb/>
He asked the House if there had been <lb/>
an
Auditor General and a Solicitor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, could that have happened? A min<lb break="no"/>istry in England that would be found <lb/>
out in so great a neglect of
duty could <lb/>
not last an hour. He did not think that <lb/>
there could be found one representative
<lb/>
of my constituency in the Province <lb/>
that would dare to go back and justify <lb/>
so great a neglect of duty in a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Here were $60,000 of the
public <lb/>
revenue lost to the country, not a dollar
<lb/>of it had been legally
collected, and <lb/>
every dollar would have to be paid back. <lb/>
Mr. Fisher concluded by summing
up <lb/>
his charges against the Government. <lb/>
            </p>
   <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> said,—From<lb/>
the position be occupied as the leader of <lb/>
the Government, he was called upon to <lb/>
answer the speech of the mover of the <lb/>
amendment. He had not been at all sur<lb break="no"/>prised at the course pursued by that gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, because he had heard of the way <lb/>
he had vilified and traduced the members <lb/>
of the Government at the time
of the last <lb/>
election in York. He had waited to hear <lb/>
it the hon. member was prepared to make <lb/>
the same statements on the floor of the<lb/>
House as he had made on the hustings
<lb/>
He had waited to hear if he would dare <lb/>
say now as he said then, that the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was a disreputable and disloyal<lb/>
Government, and that the traitor Anglin,
<lb/>
the Roman Catholic, was its dictator. <lb/>
Would he dare make those statements <lb/>
now ? He wondered how he (Mr. Fisher)
<lb/>
had dared to make them ; he
wondered <lb/>
that he could reconcile
them with his con<lb break="no"/>science. What had been the course that <lb/>
gentleman had pursued? It was  said,<lb/>
and he believed it, that he had his emis<lb break="no"/>saries out, and that from hamlet to ham<lb break="no"/>let, village to village, from school-house <lb/>
to school house, they went, sowing
the <lb/>
seeds of strife, awakening the elements of <lb/>
religious discord in the breasts of the <lb/>
people, stirring up sect
against sect. <lb/>What had been the political canvas <lb/>
throughout the country ? How had he <lb/>
tried to frighten the people, excite hos<lb break="no"/>tility agninst him, (Attorney General)
<lb/>
and poison their minds against the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment ? What was the cry raised ? <lb/>
Why, if the Government, if was said, was<lb/>
allowed to stand, if the men who held the <lb/>
reins were not ousted from power, the <lb/>
seat of Government would be removed, <lb/>

<fw type="num">14</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw>
      
 Fredericton and York would be ruined: <lb/>
unless Smith was crushed, the seat of <lb/>
Government would be lost. It might be <lb/>
thought that from the position the hon<lb/>
member had assumed it denouncing the <lb/>
Government, that he was one of the most <lb/>
extraordinary and immaculate men that <lb/>
ever lived. When he spoke
of men hold<lb break="no"/>ing on to office tor merely selfish motives. <lb/>
he should have recollected that they had <lb/>
been in Government together, and he (At<lb break="no"/>torney General) thought that the
course of <lb/>
his political life would contrast
favorably <lb/>
with that of the member for York. He <lb/>
would ask him (Mr.F.) to point out one in <lb/>
stance when he had left a
Government <lb/>
voluntarily, for conscience sake.
He<lb/>
could not. But he (Attorney General) <lb/>
could remember a time when he was oust<lb break="no"/>ed out of a Government. The mover of <lb/>
this amendment spoke of tha Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as condemned before the country, <lb/>
and holding on to office against
the wishes <lb/>
of the people. They could not if they
<lb/>
would ; they would not it they could. <lb/>
They were in the hands of the
people ; <lb/>
they must give a strict account
of their <lb/>
administration. It was the privilege
of <lb/>
the people to watch narrowly the acts of <lb/>
those in power, for the tendency of power <lb/>
was aggressive, and it was their
duty to <lb/>
look closely that these men who
held high <lb/>
positions fulfilled their trust.
If, when <lb/>
they had given an account of their actions,<lb/>
the peope should pronounce a
verdict <lb/>
against the Government, they would <lb/>
cheerfully resign office. But while it was <lb/>
the duty of the people to watch closely <lb/>
the acts of men in power, it was no
less <lb/>
their duty, when it was sought
to oust <lb/>
them out of office, to watch
narrowly the <lb/>
motives
of those men who were endeavor<lb break="no"/>ing to accomplish that object. He
put it <lb/>
to the hon. members, he put it
to the <lb/>
country, if the mover of this amendment <lb/>
was actuated by a spirit of patriotism, <lb/>
whether this was the time for
him to take <lb/>
the course he had. If it was true, as he <lb/>
hoped to God it was not true,
that the <lb/>
country was threatened with a hostile in<lb break="no"/>vasion, what would be the position
of this <lb/>
House, what would be the
position of the <lb/>
country, if this vote of want of confidence
<lb/>
was carried? There would be only two ways
<lb/>
to pursue ; one was to dissolve the House, <lb/>
or a new Government would have to come <lb/>
in, and the House would have to be pro<lb break="no"/>rogued to allow members of the new ad<lb break="no"/>ministration to stand their elections.
<lb/>
Was this the time to plunge the country <lb/>
into all the excitement of an election, or <lb/>
to leave the country without a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment when, as it had been said, the coun<lb break="no"/>try was in a state of terror and suspense,
<lb/>
in danger of invasion from lawless con<lb break="no"/>spirators? <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> He had asked the mover why he had <lb/>
struck out that portion of the Amend<lb break="no"/>ment that referred to the lawless conspi<lb break="no"/>rators from the neighboring Republic, <lb/>
and he had given as a reason, because <lb/>
some friend was afraid that the allusion <lb/>
might give offence to the United
States ! <lb/>
Was
there any one so weak and childish
<lb/>
as to believe that ? Where were the <lb/>
men who were afraid to give offence to
<lb/>
the United States ? No ; that
was not <lb/>
the reason. He had seen, when the mem<lb break="no"/>ber of Carleton (Mr. Lindsay) made last <lb/>
Saturday, that violent speech against
the <lb/>
Government in which he pictured the <lb/>
terror and alarm in the country, and de<lb break="no"/>manded to know what the Government<lb/>
were doing for its defence, what was the<lb/>
game that they were going to play.<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>  
            <p> They had shown their hands, however, <lb/>
and quickly. He (Attorney
General) was<lb/>
satisfied that what he then stated the<lb/>
Government had done to meet any dan<lb break="no"/>ger that might be
threatened, had shown <lb/>
that they were thoroughly awake
to the <lb/>
emergency and were prepared to do <lb/>
their duty. <lb/>
            </p>
   <p> The <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Attorney General</persName> then proceeded <lb/>
at length, to show that the authorities <lb/>
had kept a most careful watch over <lb/>
the safety of the Province ; that the <lb/>
Governor had been in constant communi<lb break="no"/>cation to the British Minister
at Wash<lb break="no"/>ington—Sir Frederick Bruce ;—that
the <lb/>
Government had signified their readiness <lb/>
to put the whole resources of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, at the disposal of the
authorities, <lb/>
to case of actual emergency. A war <lb/>
steamer had been sent from Halifax, and <lb/>
now lay at the harbor of St.
John ; steps <lb/>
had been taken to distribute
arms through <lb/>
out the Province ; that, in
Carleton— one <lb/>
whose members had so fiercely
denounced <lb/>
the Government— there were, at
this pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, five hundred rifles
and ten <lb/>
thousand rounds of ball ammunition ; <lb/>
and that the Governor, acting in con<lb break="no"/>junction with Col. Cole, and General
<lb/>
Doyle, were taking proper and efficient <lb/>
measures for the protection of St. John. <lb/>
He would ask the House, had the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment been recreant to their duty
? He <lb/>
would ask any hon. member to point out <lb/>
what more the Government could do than <lb/>
they had already done. <lb/>
            </p>
   <p> The <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Attorney General</persName> went on to say <lb/>
that he did not intend, that afternoon,
to <lb/>
occupy the attention of the House much <lb/>
longer, but he intended, on another occa<lb break="no"/>sion, to take up the charges in
the long <lb/>
bill of indictment preferred against the <lb/>
Government by the member of York, <lb/>
seriatim. After he had met and answer<lb break="no"/>ed those charges, he would ask
the House <lb/>
if the Government were not entitled to <lb/>
their confidence ? He then proceeded
to <lb/>
refer generally to some of the points he <lb/>
intended to take up. and alluded particu<lb break="no"/>larly to the question of Union
and
the <lb/>
Quebec Scheme. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> [ <persName ref="pers:DESB2">Mr. Desbrisay</persName> said he would like to <lb/>
know distinctly whether the
Government <lb/>
had or had not a scheme which they in<lb break="no"/>tended to submit to the House
?] <lb/>
            </p>
   <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Attorney General</persName> —If the hon. member <lb/>
of Kent had only asked that question <lb/>
before he had gone over to the other <lb/>
side, he might have answered him. It <lb/>
had been asked—he proceeded to
say—if <lb/>
he was against a Union with Canada. <lb/>
He did not know that he was against <lb/>
Union, if an equitable arrangement
could <lb/>
be made ; but this he did know, that he <lb/>
was as strongly opposed to the Quebec <lb/>
Scheme as ever. He was opposed to <lb/>
building up Upper and Lower
Canada at <lb/>
the expense of New Brunswick. He
did <lb/>
not think it was right that they should <lb/>
surrender up their independence, delu<lb break="no"/>ding them with the idea of a
grand <lb/>
nationality. He charged it against
the <lb/>
Delegates who had gone to
Quebec, <lb/>
that they refused to see any objection to <lb/>
the scheme, or to admit that it could be <lb/>
altered for the better ; it was
with them <lb/>
all "<hi rendition="simple:italic">coleur de rose</hi>." <lb/>

            <!--<p> WEDNESDAY,
MARCH 14th <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> HON. MR.
SMITH brought in a Bill <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> to revive and continue an Act in the Re<lb break="no"/>vised Statutes concerning the Export <lb/>
Duty on Lumber, and said he
was de<lb break="no"/>sirous that the Rules of the House should <lb/>
be suspended in order to enable
them <lb/>
to go into Committee on this Bill, as <lb/>
there was no provision at present
for <lb/>
collecting this duty.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
MR. MCMILLAN said, although it
was <lb/>
a matter of importance which should be <lb/>
attended to at once, yet they should
not <lb/>
go into Committee upon it in the absence <lb/>
of so many of the legal gentlemen. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. MR. SMITH would be glad to <lb/>
see every member in his place.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
MR. WILMOT had very little
doubt <lb/>
about the power of the Legislature, and <lb/>
he thought that it was absolutely
neces<lb break="no"/>sary that this $60,000 which they
had <lb/>
collected since the old law had expired <lb/>
should not be lost. It was an oversight <lb/>
it should be brought forward and
reme<lb break="no"/>died immediately. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
Mr. MCCLELAN said this oversight <lb/>
had been brought to their knowledge <lb/>
yesterday by the hon. member for York. <lb/>
(Mr. Fisher) and as there were
legal <lb/>
questions involved in it there should be <lb/>
a call of the House, or have
the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the Bill
postponed until <lb/>
to-morrow morning, which would be <lb/>
rushing the Bill through very speedily.
<lb/>
HON. MR. SMITH said he hoped all <lb/>
political feelings would be thrown aside <lb/>
in discussing this subject,
for it was de<lb break="no"/>sirable to pass this law as soon
as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, to prevent. law-suits being enter<lb break="no"/>ed into by persons desirous of getting <lb/>
this money back. His hon. friend, Mr. <lb/>
Cudlip, had paid during the past year  <lb/>
£1100 as export duty on lumber, and <lb/>
another party in the County of Kent had <lb/>
paid £300. These men say that this
<lb/>
money does not belong to them, al<lb break="no"/>though they paid that money down ; but <lb/>
it rather belongs to every man who con<lb break="no"/>tributed to the production of the deals,
<lb/>
because the price of deals was affected <lb/>by it. This was not the first case
of re<lb break="no"/>trospective legislation. Some years ago
<lb/>
three Commissioners were
appointed in <lb/>
the County of Westmorland to construct <lb/>a Canal, and these Commissioners, as<lb break="no"/>suming they were properly appointed, <lb/>
went on with the work, and expended <lb/>
three or four thousand pounds ; but, in <lb/>
consequence of some legal difficulty, the <lb/>
case was brought before Judge Parker,
<lb/>
and he decided the Government had no <lb/>power to appoint them. Therefore, <lb/>
every man upon whose land they had <lb/>
gone could bring an action for trespass <lb/>
against them, involving the whole
coun<lb break="no"/>try in trouble. To prevent this an Act <lb/>
was passed in this House legalizing the <lb/>
acts of those Commissioners. That was <lb/>
a case similar to the present, and al<lb break="no"/>though it was exceptional legislation, <lb/>
it should be adopted when it tends to <lb/>
the public interest. He would now <lb/>
move that the Bill be committed.
<lb/>
            </p>









            <p> MR FISHER said, passing a law for <lb/>
the future is one thing, and passing a <lb/>
law to cover all the past is
another. It <lb/>
would be better to separate these two <lb/>
propositions. They had better provide <lb/>
a law for the future and let the
other <lb/>
matter stand over a few days, until we <lb/>
have more time to consider it, for it is a <lb/>
question of great importance,
and will <lb/>
be a precedent for future legislation. If
<lb/>
this was a case of so much emergency, <lb/>
why did not they call the Legislature <lb/>
together in September, at which
time <lb/>
they state they first discovered
it ? They <lb/>
should have called the Legislature
to<lb break="no"/>
