    <!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->  
     
     
    <!-- would have to thank the hon. member  
     <lb/>for Kent for defining his position, and at<lb/>the same time for his gratoitous attack<lb/>upon the Government. It would be imm-<lb break="maybe"/>gined that when it was known that the<lb/>Government were in the throes of disso-<lb break="maybe"/>lusion, any man possessing a heart with<lb/>the least sentiment of feeling would have<lb/>refrained from any expression of reproof<lb/>of condemnation. But such an attack,<lb/>be held, was ungenerous and unfeeling in<lb/>the extreme. They did not ask for a<lb/>suspension of business on their own ac-<lb break="yes"/>account, but only that the business of the <lb/>country might be carried on according to<lb/>the principles which had been laid down<lb/>and accepted.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr,. FISHER said that everything was         
     <lb/>passing along smoothly and pleasantly,<lb/>but the hon. member for St. John (Mr.<lb/>Anglin) had thrown a firebrand into the<lb/>discussion, and called forth the remarks of<lb/>the hon. member for Kent.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. ANGLIN</persName> was not aware that he   
     <lb/>had thrown any firebrand, and if the hon.<lb/>member for Kent did not know anything<lb/>about the time required to get together<lb/>and form a new Government, he should<lb/>have refrained from making the remarks<lb/>he had. He said that it was only courtesy<lb/>to the retiring Government and to the<lb/>Opposition, to adjourn, that they might<lb/>have time, on the one hand, to obtain<lb/>their reply, and on  the other to mature <lb/>new plans.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HILL said he should like to see       
     <lb/>the business go on, but it was patent to<lb/>all, that all might be done would<lb/>amount to nothing. The House would<lb/>probably be adjourned, prorogued or dis<lb break="no"/>solved this week, and there would be<lb/>no time to Bills which might pass the<lb/>House, to be got through the Legislative<lb/>Council.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     Mr. FRASER said this was not only  
     <lb/>the case, but the business would not be<lb/>constitutional. The Governor was at the<lb/>present time without advisers, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently the House could not go on<lb/>with the business of the country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. NEEDHAM</persName> said he had no doubt 
     <lb/>of the unconstitutionality of the House<lb/>proceeding with business, and should<lb/>move that the House adjourn til to-mor-<lb break="maybe"/>row at half-past two P.M.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     
     
     Mr. KERR said he did not wish to go 
     <lb/>on if any reasonable objection could be<lb/>shown. There was a precedent in the<lb/>matter, for on the 28th of October, 1865, the<lb/>House passed the address and on the <lb/>30th went in a body to  Government <lb/>House. On the 31st met and proceeded<lb/>with business without adjournment till<lb/>Mr. Ritchie came down and announced<lb/>that a new Government was formed, and<lb/>writes issued for a new election.  The <lb/>House was then prorogued. If this was<lb/>the case, then why could not business go<lb/>on now. This, he believed, was the only<lb/>precedent, and business was carried on<lb/>from day to day. He did not wish, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to act discourteously to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but as the Bill he had introduced <lb/>was entirely local, he could not see how<lb/>it could in any way embarrass or affect<lb/>them.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     HON. Mr.  HATHEWAY  said the posi      
     <lb/>tion of affairs was different now from that<lb/>referred to. On that  occasion  Mr. <lb/>Ritchie came to the House and announced<lb/>the resignation of the Government, and <lb/>that the Governor had called upon others<lb/>to carry on the business. No such com<lb break="no"/>munication had been made now.<lb/>
            </p>

     of the Government,, and he thought it       
     <lb/>was a case in point.<lb/>Mr. FISHER, said he went to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House on that one aion, and they<lb/>were two days ferating the new adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, and when Mr. Ritchie came to<lb/>the house the new members had been<lb/>sworn in. He hoped the hon. member<lb/>for Northumberland would withdraw <lb/>his motion and allow the House to adjourn.<lb/> Mr. KERR complied, and the House<lb/>then adjourned til to-morrow, at half-<lb break="yes"/>past two P.M.<lb/>J. March.<lb/>

            <p>
     
     
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">HON. Mr. SMITH</persName> stated that the cor<lb break="no"/>respondence had not yet closed concern<lb break="no"/>ing the resignation of the Governemnt,<lb/>as they had not received a reply which<lb/>his Excellency had promised them; un<lb break="no"/>der these circumstances, he thought they<lb/>should proceed with the business of the<lb/>country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The House in Committee agreed to "A 
     <lb/>Bill to establish an additional polling <lb/>place in the County of Your."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Also "A Bill to amend the law relating <lb/>to the widening of Cross Street in Saint<lb/>John."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" A Bill to incorporate the President, <lb/>Directors and Company of the Northern<lb/>Bank."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"A Bill to authorize the Corporation<lb/>of St. John to become Shareholders in<lb/>the European and North American Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company for its extension from St.<lb/>John Westward."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CORA1">Mr. CORAM</persName> said the bill was to au<lb break="no"/>thorize the Corporation of St. John to<lb/>take stock in that Railway to the extent<lb/>of $60,000 and to issue debentures for<lb/>that purpose.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. ANGLIN</persName> said if the road was<lb/>likely to be built by the Company he<lb/>would be willing to pledge the credit of<lb/>St. John for a much larger amount, but<lb/>he saw no prospect of this, for it had<lb/>been five months since the Company had<lb/>commenced operations, and he believed<lb/>that not one dollar of the Company's<lb/>stock had been paid up by the stockhold<lb break="no"/>ers. The day he came up to Fredericton<lb/>he saw but 17 men employed on the road,<lb/>and he thought it was a bogus transaction<lb/>from beginning to end. He did not know<lb/>whether to oppose the bill or not, particu<lb break="no"/>larly as it was only a Permissive Bill.<lb/>Mr. CORAM said the Common Count-<lb break="maybe"/>cil would not sell these debentures with<lb break="no"/>out they were certain that the Company<lb/>would carry out their arrangement, and<lb/>build the road.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HILL said he was authorized by   
     <lb/>Mr. Burpee to state that there were sev-<lb break="maybe"/>enty-five men working on the road. He<lb/>(Mr. Burpee ) said that he had no doubt<lb/>but what they were in a position to go on<lb/>and complete the work. He (Mr. H.)<lb/>thought it was the duty of the House to<lb/>render all the assistance they could to the<lb/>Company, as that was the only means of<lb/>preventing its being built as a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment work.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName> thought the City of  
     <lb/>St. John should give a bonus to the Com<lb break="no"/>pany of that amount, as the building of<lb/>this Railroad would prove a great benefit<lb/>to that city, as was the building of the<lb/>Grand Trunk Railroad to Portland, which<lb/>increased that value of property there four<lb break="no"/>fold.  He was surprised that his hon. <lb/>friend from St. John (Mr. Anglin) oppos-<lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     ed everything that came up regarding   
     <lb/>Western Extension. He (Mr. Anglin)<lb/>was afraid he was going to be a false pro-<lb break="maybe"/>phel fo he had stated that a foot of<lb/>Railway never would be built under the<lb/>Subsidy Act.  He (Mr. L) thought St.<lb/>John would be a gamer if they gave four<lb/>times that amount as this road would<lb/>bring the trade from the interior to the<lb/>sea-board. He would do all he could for<lb/>the company, but he was opposed to Rail<lb break="no"/>ways being built as Government works.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     
     
     Mr. GILBERT said his hon. friend      
     <lb/>from St. John, (Mr. Anglin), who should<lb/>be well informed in regard to the ability<lb/>of this Company to build the road, be<lb break="no"/>ing lately a member of the Government,<lb/>called this a bogus Railway Company.<lb/>We should, therefore, hesitate before<lb/>passing a bill authorizing the Corpora<lb break="no"/>tion of St. John to tax the citizens to<lb/>aid this company. He wished to encour<lb break="no"/>age the building of Railroads, as it open<lb break="no"/>ed up the country and leads to emigra<lb break="no"/>tion and the settlement of the country.<lb/>but he considered that a company that<lb/>undertook the work of building Western<lb/>Extension should have a very large capi<lb break="no"/>tal to carry on the work successfully.<lb/> <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Nr. ANGLIN said his hon. friend    
     <lb/>(Mr. Gilbert) could judge for himself.<lb/>The road would cost $2,500.000, and<lb/>there had not been one dollar paid up or<lb/>called for.  The Company had already<lb/>a subsidized stock of $140,000, and they<lb/>want this $60,000 in addition. If it was<lb/>not permissive Bill, he would give it<lb/>his most strenuous opposition.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. FISHER</persName> said the only objection  
     <lb/>he had to the Bill was that the amount of<lb/>stock to be taken in St. John was not<lb/>one-tenth of what it should be. The<lb/>town of Woodstock, with only two thou<lb break="no"/>sand inhabitants, had given $40,000 in<lb/>aid of their branch line, and surely St. <lb/>John, with its wealth and population,<lb/>should give $500,000. He would vote for<lb/>the Bill.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     
     
     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName> said that Common  
     <lb/>Council had sent this Bill up to the House<lb/>and they had no right to reject it without<lb/>sufficient cause. The Corporation would<lb/>not take stock in it if they thought it was<lb/>likely to prove a bogus company.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The Bill was then agreed to, after which       
     <lb/>some Bills were introduced, and the<lb/>House adjourned to meet at 10 A.M. to<lb break="no"/>morrow.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> said the ballot system<lb/>had now been in operation for two years,<lb/>but it was notorious that the voter was<lb/>not sufficiently protected in his approach<lb/>to the ballot box.

far enough. There are many evils that<lb/>might be remedied, and although this did<lb/>not take hold of them all, yet it was a<lb/>step in the right direction, and he trusted<lb/>it would not be opposed on that ground.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> would not speak on<lb/>the merits of the Bill, but as it was un<lb break="no"/>derstood yesterday that no Bill of a gen<lb break="no"/>eral nature should be brought before the<lb/>House under existing circumstances, he<lb/>should move that progress be re<lb break="no"/>ported.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LEWI1">MR. LEWIS</persName> said that in Albert<lb/>County the ballot had been found to work<lb/>unsatisfactorily, and he was opposed to<lb/>it.

            <p>Progress was then reported.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">RESIGNATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.<lb/>
            </head>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">HON. MR. SMITH</persName> said he was expect<lb break="no"/>ed on this occasion to make some ex<lb break="no"/>planation of the position he and his<lb/>colleagues occupied before the House<lb/>and country. They prepared their re<lb break="no"/>signation on Mondy last, and sent it<lb/>up on Tuesday a little before noon.<lb/>Last night (Thursday) about six o'clock<lb/>he had received his Excellency's reply,<lb/>accepting the same. He was not aware<lb/>whether another Government had been<lb/>framed, but if not, the House and coun<lb break="no"/>try occupied a novel and unparallelled<lb/>position. If one had been formed,<lb/>it was somewhat extraordinary that<lb/>no announcement of the fact had<lb/>been made to the public. They<lb/>were now brought down to the pos<lb break="no"/>ition that the great question of Res<lb break="no"/>ponsible Government had to be fought<lb/>over again. The great question to be<lb/>decided by the House and country was<lb/>whether they should submit to the whim<lb/>and will of a nominee of Downing street,<lb/>or be governed by a Government respon<lb break="no"/>sible to the people for all their acts. He<lb/>was now going to speak of the Governor,<lb/>and whilst he wished to speak respectfully<lb/>of the high position His Excellency occu<lb break="no"/>pied as the representative of Royalty in<lb/>this Province, he should yet speak of him<lb/>as a man, for they must remember that<lb/>however lofty the position he occupied,<lb/>he was still but a man. High birth and<lb/>lofty position, a cocked hat and gold<lb/>lace, did not make the man, and many a <lb/>lowly garb and humble position covered<lb/>up greater worth than is sometimes pos<lb break="no"/>sessed by men in high and commanding <lb/>positions. He should, therefore, stand<lb/>there to defend his actions and position<lb/>against the charges which had been<lb/>brought against him from whatever source<lb/>they might come. It had been charged<lb/>and whispered about, that great revela<lb break="no"/>tions were to be made in His Excellency's<lb/>reply to the resignation of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and one of these statements was,<lb/>that he (Mr. S.) was bound hand and <lb/>foot by certain papers which he had<lb/>signed, conclusively proving him to be <lb/>traitor to his country, and by his actions<lb/>to have compromised the best interests<lb/>of the people.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> asked if the papers re<lb break="no"/>lating to the resignation were not to be<lb/>read.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> intended to read the cor<lb break="no"/>respondence that had passed between the<lb/>Government and the Governor, and he<lb/>should also read, as part of his speech, a<lb/>paper he had prepared, which he believed<lb/>would fully justify him in the eyes of the<lb/>House and of the people. It had come<lb/>down to a point of veracity between him<lb/>and the Governor, and when he was<lb/>through the House would be able to de<lb break="no"/>cide who was to be believed.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> said it seemed as<lb/>though the hon. member was making an<lb/>attack on the Governor, and he would<lb/>like to know whether the correspondence<lb/>was to be submitted, and if so, he thought<lb/>it would be wise (if the correspondence<lb/>was not concluded) to wait until it was<lb/>closed before going on with the matter.<lb/>The Lieutenant Governor was not repre<lb break="no"/>sented on the floors of the House, and<lb/>had no means of replying to any attack<lb/>made on him. Under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances it would be best to wait until the<lb/>paper in which the Attorney General had<lb/>answered the charges of the Governor<lb/>
         


    
            <cb/>
       
was sent to him and an answer ob<lb break="no"/>tained.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said the resignation of<lb/>the Government had been accepted, and<lb/>he was not bound to reply to his Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's long paper. He might, and pro<lb break="no"/>bably should, send it to him, but he was<lb/>bound to lay the reasons of his actions<lb/>before the House and justify himself be<lb break="no"/>fore the people of this Province. It had been<lb/>rumored about that strange and<lb/>startling developments were to be made<lb/>in his Excellency's reply, and among them<lb/>the fearful charge that he (Mr. S.) had<lb/>signed a paper which in his present posi<lb break="no"/>tion would destroy his character and<lb/>blacken his reputation for ever. But let<lb/>them bring that paper forward and prove<lb/>the assertion made ; he felt that he stood<lb/>there before the members of that House<lb/>and the people of this country, true to<lb/>his integrity. True, he had been placed<lb/>in positions of extraordinary temptation<lb/>and difficulty—offers of a very alluring<lb/>character had been made to him dur<lb break="no"/>ing the past summer, but he thanked<lb/>God he had been able to withstand them.<lb/>He would speak of some of the sacrifices<lb/>he had made to the principles he profess<lb break="no"/>ed, not in a spirit of egotism, but to clear<lb/>up the charges made against him, for he<lb/>had made sacrifices, and with the help of<lb/>God he was prepared to make still more.<lb/>A time of trial was coming, when men<lb/>would have to prove their principles—<lb/>conspirators within and enemies without—<lb/>and the rights of the people must be<lb/>maintained against all who attempt to<lb/>override them. Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment they had had, but now it lay bleed<lb break="no"/>ing before the people of this Province.<lb/>He did not wish to speak hastily of the<lb/>Lieut. Governor, but while he would keep<lb/>in mind the high position he held, he<lb/>should yet treat him as a man.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> again said he should like<lb/>to see the whole papers laid before the<lb/>House.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said if he would wait with<lb/>patience, he and the House should know,<lb/>and the people should know, all about it. It<lb/>had been rumored that when the Governor's<lb/>communication was made known, some<lb break="no"/>thing extraordinary was going to occur.<lb/>He (Mr. S.) was to be politically destroy<lb break="no"/>ed for life. If the country, and the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the people demanded it, he<lb/>was willing to suffer political martyr<lb break="no"/>dom, but if he was to be sacrificed to<lb/>the Scheme of Confederation, he would<lb/>resist to the last. This was the plan<lb/>they had laid to destroy him. Was there<lb/>ever such an occurrence before, that<lb/>whilst a Want of Confidence debate was<lb/>going on, plans should be devised and<lb/>carried out to effect the overthrow of a<lb/>Government ? For four weeks he had<lb/>sat in that House while the debate was<lb/>pending, and knowing what was tran<lb break="no"/>spiring, he had no hesitation in saying<lb/>that life had been a burden to him. All<lb/>knew that he would have willingly done<lb/>anything to be relieved of the burden<lb/>which was resting upon him, but duty<lb/>and the circumstances compelled him to<lb/>stand to his principles, while his charac<lb break="no"/>ter had been maligned and his reputa<lb break="no"/>tion attacked in a manner he had not<lb/>deserved. When the hon. member for<lb/>the city of St. John (Mr. Wetmore) made<lb/>his onslaught upon him, he felt hurt be<lb break="no"/>yond measure. For that gentleman he<lb/>had feelings of personal friendship<lb/>for more than fifteen years. Every step<lb/>in advancement made by him in his<lb/>profession had given him unmeasured<lb/>

     delight.  The House knew, for it had  
     <lb/>been told them by the hon. member for<lb/>St. John (Mr. Wilmot), that when the<lb/>offer of the Attorney Generalship was<lb/>proffered him he did not wish to take<lb/>i, but strongly urged that it should be<lb/>given to Mr. Wetmore. Behind his<lb/>back he had even spoken favourably of <lb/>him. He appealed to his friends to tes<lb break="no"/>tify that he would not take the office<lb/>till they had urged it upon him again<lb/>and again with the statement that the<lb/>well-being of the party rendered it in<lb break="no"/>dispensably necessary for him to accept.<lb/>For this he had been attached, and duty<lb/>called on him to reply. He did not <lb/>wish to speak so much of himself, but<lb/>he knew the House would pardon him<lb/>if he spoke for a moment of some of<lb/>the sacrifices he had made in this strug<lb break="no"/>gle. On the death of Chief Justice<lb/>Parker, that post became vacant - a post<lb/>that any man might be pardoned for<lb/>applying to, and one worthy to be fitted<lb/>by and anabler and better man than him<lb break="no"/>self. He would now return his thanks<lb/>to his hon. collegues for the offer they<lb/>had then unanimously made him. They<lb/>said, "you have fairly won the spurs and <lb/>should wear them." This was a great<lb/>temptation, and it was made stronger by<lb/>the urging of all his friends to accept the<lb/>office. They said." We have worked for you<lb/>for years, and have elected you six or<lb/>seven times, now here is the office for you,<lb/>where you can retire from all the turmoil<lb/>and strife of political life. What more<lb/>do you want?" But he told them he<lb/>had received a trust from the people, and<lb/>duty called upon him to fulfil that trust<lb/>faithfully, and so he refused. He would<lb/>appeal to his friends on the floors of the<lb/>House and to his friends throughout the<lb/>country, to substantiate this fact. He <lb/>invoked the expression of the knowledge<lb/>of his honour the Speaker, whether, after<lb/>the death of Chief Justice Parker, he<lb/>had not met him at his home, and told him<lb/>how great the temptation, was, but that<lb/>duty would not allow him to accept; that<lb/>he might die in a workhouse, but would<lb/>never sacrifice the interest of the people<lb/>to save him from it. It was charged that<lb/>he had proved false to his friends and<lb/>false to his country, but those who<lb/>brought the charge had proved them<lb break="no"/>selves unable to substantiate their position<lb/>False to his friends and the people? Had<lb/>he sold his integrity for gold? No, he had<lb/>his shortcomings, but thank God, he<lb/>stood firm to the principles he had pro-<lb break="yes"/>professed and the trust of the people. It<lb/>was said that he had never brought for<lb break="no"/>ward any measures of importance, but for<lb/>fourteen years he had sat in the House,<lb/>and only on one day during that length-<lb break="yes"/>ended period had been absent from his <lb/>seat. He had taken a fair share in all the<lb/>discussions of the House, and had never<lb/>deviated from the path that conscience<lb/>told him he should pursue. He might<lb/>not have introduced great measures, but<lb/>for the discharge of his public duties he<lb/>stood with clear conscience before him<lb break="no"/>self and his God. If confederation was <lb/>to come by the means now being adopt<lb break="no"/>ed, all he could say was, then let it come.<lb/>But he had an abiding sense that the peo<lb/>ple would speak differently. His consti<lb break="no"/>tuents might reject him, but he should<lb/>neverless return to them. A dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion was now demanded, and the people<lb/>were entitled to it.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He would now proceed to read the cor<lb break="no"/>respondence that had passed between the<lb/>Government and His Excellency.<lb/>

            <p>
     The Reply so given by your Excellency

            <p>
     
     
     
     
     1st. That in any measure involving an   
     <lb/>organic change in the Constitution and<lb/>political rights and privileges of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, they should be consulted, and unless<lb/>approved of by them no such measure<lb/>should be adopted or forced upon them.<lb/>

     2d. That in march last a dissolution

            <p>
     3d. That the Representatives of the 
     <lb/>people at the last Session of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture passed resolutions condemnatory of<lb/>such Scheme, by a majority of twenty-<lb break="yes"/>nine to ten.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     4th That the Legislative Council are       
     <lb/>not elected by the people, and are not <lb/>constitutionally responsible to them for<lb/>their Legislative conduct and have no<lb/>right authority to pray Her Majesty to<lb/>give effect, by Imperial Legislation, to<lb/>any measure which the people have re<lb break="no"/>jected.<lb/>

            <p>
     5th. That such proceeding violates

            </p>
   
            <p>
     6th. That such a course is calculated 
     <lb/>to bring the Legislative Council and<lb/>House of Assembly into collusion, and dis<lb break="no"/>turb that harmony that should subsist<lb/>between them, and manifests an entire<lb/>disregard of the power and majesty of the <lb/>people.<lb/>

            <p>
     On Saturday the 7th instant, about   
     <lb/>11 o'clock A. M., I called at Govern<lb/>ment House and had an interview with<lb/>His Excellency, and in the course of con<lb break="no"/>versation, the proceedings of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council were referred to, when I<lb/>spoke in terms of disapproval of the<lb/>course which they had adopted in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the subject of Union. Something<lb/>was said about the presentation of the<lb/>Address, and His Excellency's Reply<lb/>thereto, when he asked me what answer I <lb/>would advise, I replied that in my opinion<lb/>the answer to be given should simply be<lb/>that he would transmit it to Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty. His Excellency said that he would<lb/>think of it and see me again. He did not<lb/>state that he intended to receive them<lb/>that day, and I had not the most distant<lb/>idea that he intended to do so. I then<lb/>parted with him.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     A few minutes before three o'clock of    
     <lb/>the afternoon of the same day, in my<lb/>place in the House of Assembly, I re<lb break="no"/>ceived a note from him saying that he<lb/>wished to see me at once. I immediate<lb break="no"/>ly repaired to Government House, and<lb/>after a short conversation with him upon<lb/>other matters, he informed me that he<lb/>was going to receive the Legislative<lb/>Council with their Address at three<lb/>o'clock. I expressed my surprise at<lb/>this, and inquired what answer he in<lb break="no"/>tended to make. He then handed me a<lb/>paper which contained his proposed an<lb break="no"/>swer, accompanied with a Memorandum<lb/>for the Executive Council. I expressed<lb/>my disapproval of it, and complained<lb/>that he had not advised with his Council<lb/>before preparing it; that as they were<lb/>responsible for it, they should at least<lb/>be consulted before it was given. He<lb/>remarked that, if they did not approve<lb/>of it, they could relieve themselves of<lb/>responsibility. I replied, even if that<lb/>were true, was it courteous and fair that<lb/>the Council should be treated in that<lb/>way ; that what they asked from His<lb/>Excellency was fair play, not as a favor,<lb/>but as a matter of right? He then pro<lb break="no"/>posed that I should drive down to the<lb/>House of Assembly and see me collea<lb break="no"/>gues, and return in half an hour, and he<lb/>would keep the Legislative Council (who<lb/>in the meantime had arrived at Govern<lb/>ment House) waiting until I returned.<lb/>I said I could not do this, that the De<lb break="no"/>bate on the Vote of Want of Confidence<lb/>was going on, and that they could not<lb/>leave the House, and besides, they could<lb/>not possibly consider so important a<lb/>question in a few minutes. His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency then proposed to send one of the<lb/>carriages that were standing at the door<lb/>for them. I then stated they could not<lb/>leave the House. He replied, " I sup<lb break="no"/>pose not." I further stated that it was<lb/>unfair and ungenerous, and not such<lb/>
            

            <cb/>
         
treatment as the Council had a right to<lb/>expect, to be called upon in this sudden<lb/>and extraordinary way in a matter so<lb/>important. I expressed my condemna<lb break="no"/>tion of the course adopted by the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, and urged the impropriety<lb/>of their praying Her Majesty the Queen<lb/>to cause a Law of the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to be passed, giving effect to a<lb/>scheme of Union which both the People<lb/>and the House of Assembly had rejected<lb/>by overwhelming majorities, and that I<lb/>never would consent to any Address<lb/>which authorized the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to pass an Act for Union without<lb/>reference to the people. I thought His<lb/>Excellency seemed disposed to yield the<lb/>point and strike out the last paragraph<lb/>of the answer, which I consider very ob<lb break="no"/>jectionable. He then asked me to ex<lb break="no"/>cuse him, and left the room to consult,<lb/>as I thought at the time, and from infor<lb break="no"/>mation received since, I am confirmed in<lb/>that opinion, a gentleman of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and a member of the Legislative<lb/>Council, who was in the House at the<lb/>time. He returned in a few minutes,<lb/>and after some conversation similar to<lb/>that already detailed, told me that he<lb/>would deliver the answer as it was, and<lb/>send me a copy in the evening. I re<lb break="no"/>monstrated against such conduct, but<lb/>concluded by saying that if he had re<lb break="no"/>solved upon that course, it was in vain to<lb/>protract the interviews. I then left<lb/>him.<lb/>

     He wanted this matter tried before the 
     <lb/>House and the country fairly and impar<lb break="no"/>tially, as between a Judge and a crimi<lb break="no"/>nal, for it had been whispered about that<lb/>he stood before the country as little bet<lb break="no"/>ter than a criminal. He maintained that<lb/>it was not himself alone who was ag<lb break="no"/>grieved. The Governor might treat him<lb/>with contempt and contumely, but while<lb/>he held a position from the people, he<lb/>would stand a claim for them their<lb/>constitutional rights. The grounds of<lb/>the resignation were now before the<lb/>House and the people, and it was for them<lb/>to decide if they had done right.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It was not necessary to touch on the 
     <lb/>point of the unconstitutionality of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor's consulting with, and taking the<lb/>advice of, members of the Opposition.<lb/>Was there ever a time when the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion were more vigilant, cunning, and<lb/>politically unscrupulous as they had been<lb/>on this question? If it was true that the<lb/>Governor had done this, and he believed<lb/>it was true, for he had many times re<lb break="no"/>monstrated with His Excellency on the<lb/>subject, to allow the Government to pass<lb/>into the hands of the Opposition under<lb/>such circumstances and by such means,<lb/>would have been prejudicial to the best<lb/>interests of the people The most extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary measures had been employed to<lb/>win and bribe the members of the House<lb/>from the path of duty ; but to their honor<lb/>he would say it, the efforts put forth had<lb/>miserably failed. These facts becoming<lb/>known, and the Opposition, fully con<lb break="no"/>scious that on constitutional grounds the<lb/>Government could not be defeated, other<lb/>means had to be, and were, devised and<lb/>executed to accomplish their object, and<lb/>to-day the members of the Government<lb/>stood relieved from the cares of office by<lb/>the accomplishment of their schemes.<lb/>The paper he had read was signed by<lb/>all the members of the Government ex<lb break="no"/>cept Messrs Gillmor and Hutchinson.<lb/>The latter was away in England, and<lb/>the former had notified them that he<lb/>agreed in their decision. That gentleman<lb/>was called away from his official duties<lb/>to soothe the dying moments of a father,<lb/>and whilst engaged in that sacred duty<lb/>the mine was sprung under their feet.<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
    
He would now call the attention of the<lb/>House to the answer returned to their<lb/>communication by His Excellency.<lb/>

     The Address in answer to His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's Speech at the opening of the Ses<lb break="no"/>sion, even as originally proposed, con<lb break="no"/>veyed an assurance that those papers<lb/>should receive a careful and respectful<lb/>attention from the Legislative Council.<lb/>

            </p>
   
    

            <p>It is neither constitutional nor reason<lb break="no"/>able to maintain that the Legislative<lb/>Council is incompetent to act with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to a Scheme thus submitted to them,<lb/>until after its previous approval by the<lb/>House of Assembly, nor can it be imagin<lb break="no"/>ed that the Legislative Council alone is<lb/>debarred from that right of appeal to<lb/>Her Majesty which is accorded to all<lb/>Her subjects without distinction.<lb/>

            <p>This was the reason given. Not the<lb/>first concession that it was the right of<lb/>the people that their Government should<lb/>be consulted. Not at all. The great<lb/>battle for constitutional rights and liber<lb break="no"/>ties had been fought and won. It had<lb/>been conceded that the people should<lb/>govern themselves. This was part of the<lb/>great Magna Charta ; yet now the Gover<lb/>nor commits his Government to an Ad<lb break="no"/>dress expressing opinions contrary to<lb/>those entertained by them, when that<lb/>Government is responsible to the people.<lb/>Was it right in ethics that a Government<lb/>should be made responsible for the acts<lb/>of a Governor, in reference to which<lb/>they had not been consulted? It would<lb/>be for the country to decide on this ques<lb break="no"/>tion. Here was the House and Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in Session, the Governor liv<lb break="no"/>ing within a short distance of the House,<lb/>all the members of the Government here<lb/>with the exception of Messrs.

            </p>
            <p>It has been charged that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had committed themselves to Con<lb break="no"/>federation in the Address of His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency at the opening of the Session.

            <p>
     Now then the successors of the late 
     <lb/>Government must endorse the action of<lb/>those who have gone out of office. This<lb/>was constitutional. Let no man attempt<lb/>to justify on the floors of the House the<lb/>action of the Legislative Council. That<lb/>body had no delegated power as the<lb/>Lower House had. If the prayer of the<lb/>Legislative Council should be responded<lb/>to, then the Legislature, the rights and <lb/>liberties of the people would be demol<lb break="no"/>ished and taken away. Had the people<lb/>been consulted on the question of union ?<lb/>They had. What was their reply ? The<lb/>reply was emphatic and decisive. " No,<lb/>that scheme would only deprive us of our<lb/>rights, and we will have nothing to do<lb/>with it."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     He would now make a slight degres<lb break="no"/>sion. When he first saw the scheme and<lb/>read the terms of the proposed union, he<lb/>saw it was prepared with the special<lb/>intention to give it life and activity. He<lb/>said at once, It will go through the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council. He heard it stated in the<lb/>Upper House the other day that in con<lb/>sequence of the provisions of that scheme<lb/>ten men of that Council should not vote<lb/>on the question before them, as without<lb/>doubt they were provided for in the ar<lb break="no"/>rangement. He heard the whole of that<lb/>debate, and his friend the Hon. Mr.<lb/>Hazen and his coadjutors saw and said<lb/>that it was useless to oppose it. The<lb/>House would doubtless be surprised when<lb/>he informed them they had passed an ad<lb break="no"/>dress to the Queen, calling for an Im<lb break="no"/>perial enactment to consummate a scheme<lb/>of union which had never been read before<lb/>the House, either by the President or<lb/>either of the Speakers, in their advocacy<lb/>of union under its provisions. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion now to be decided by the people was,<lb/>shall the Legislative Council govern<lb/>this country ? It might be said that the<lb/>scheme was read by the members indi<lb break="no"/>vidually ; but he would ask what of that ?<lb/>It was passed by them in a few minutes,<lb/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>and as was the case with the Hon. Mr.<lb/>Steves, who was supposed to represent<lb/>

     the County of Albert, yet he moved to 
     <lb/>St. John and still held his seat as for Al<lb break="no"/>bert. If this should occur, they would<lb/>be left without a representative in the<lb/>Upper Branch. Was not this a case for<lb/>careful consideration by this House and<lb/>people? He thought the Council had<lb/>shown most extraordinary haste; they<lb/>had passed their Address on one day,<lb/>it was received by His Excellency the<lb/>next, and sent on to England the day af<lb break="no"/>ter. But he had too much confidence in<lb/>the integrity, uprightness and sense of<lb/>justice of the British Government to sup<lb break="no"/>pose that they would accede to the re<lb break="no"/>quest.<lb/>

            <p>He would again appeal to his friends in<lb/>the House as to what he had told them<lb/>had passed between the Governor and<lb/>himself on this question.

It was to<lb/>appoint a select committee, not indeed to<lb/>draw up and pass resolutions, but<lb/>to report and suggest objections to<lb/>the Quebec Scheme. And now in what<lb/>a new and strange position did they stand.<lb/>At that moment the people of the coun<lb break="no"/>try were without a Government and His<lb/>Excellency without advisers. He had to<lb/>doubt the position was satisfactory to His<lb/>Excellency, and that he would be glad to<lb/>assume the whole responsibility of gov<lb break="no"/>erning the country without any Council<lb/>at all.</p>

            <p>" His Excellency has never ceased to<lb/>urge on Mr. Smith, the expediency, and<lb/>indeed necessity of a bold avowal of his<lb/>intended policy ; nor has he failed to ex<lb break="no"/>press his apprehensions as to the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of delay in doing so, believing<lb/>until that avowal was made, Mr.<lb/>Smith would become daily more and more<lb/>entangled in contradictory pledges, from<lb/>which he would find it impossible to ex<lb break="no"/>tricate himself, and which might act<lb/>most prejudicially on the prospects of the<lb/>cause ; whilst at any time circumstances<lb/>might call for such action on the part of<lb/>His Excellency as would place him in a<lb/>position of apparent antagonism to his<lb/>Council and prove productive of very<lb/>serious embarrassment. This course,<lb/>however, the Government did not pur<lb break="no"/>sue, and it became more and more apear<lb break="no"/>ently clear to His Excellency that they<lb/>lacked the power—he will not suppose<lb/>they lacked the will—to carry out their<lb/>original intentions. Their opposition to<lb/>the particular form of union agreed to at<lb/>Quebec, was distinct and emphatic,<lb/>whilst their approval of even an abstract<lb/>union of an uncertain character, became<lb/>daily more vague and uncertain."<lb/>

     <lb/>
     who had stood by them and who would do 
     <lb/>
     so again. His Excellency acknowledges  
     <lb/>
     that a Select Committee was to have been  
     <lb/>
     appointed to consider a plan of Union, 
     <lb/>
     yet before the Answer in  Reply to the 
     <lb/>Address had passed through the House,<lb/>before any papers had been, or could be<lb/>brought down, whilst a vote of Want of<lb/>Confidence was pending, and before it<lb/>was possible to take any action in regard<lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     to the matter, the Governor coolly informs 
     <lb/>
     his Council that it was apparent to him 
     <lb/>that they lacked the power to carry out<lb/>their intentions. When, he would ask,<lb/>did the Government say they lacked the<lb/>power ? Never.<lb/>

            <p>" Declarations were, it is said, publicly<lb/>made that no proposition for an Union<lb/>would be made during the present Ses<lb break="no"/>sion, and arguments were reported to be<lb/>used by members and supporters of the<lb/>Government not only against the Quebec<lb/>Scheme, but of a character applying with<lb/>equal force to any plan of whatever de<lb break="no"/>scription, for a closer Union with Can<lb break="no"/>ada.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On more than one occasion His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency noticed these facts to Mr. Smith,<lb/>who replied that the reports received by<lb/>His Excellency as to the language used<lb/>were inaccurate ; that it was desirable not<lb/>to indicate too soon the line he meant to<lb/>take, as it would give an advantage to<lb/>his opponents and might estrange some<lb/>of his friends."<lb/>

            <p>The Government explained their<lb/>position to His Excellency, and desired<lb/>that he should not reply to the address<lb/>of the Upper Branch till the address in<lb/>reply had passed through the House.<lb/>They, however, would not ask it as a<lb/>favor, but desired him to act constitu<lb break="no"/>tionally. In spite, however, of their<lb/>expressed wishes, and contrary to all<lb/>experience and practice, the Governor<lb/>saw fit to receive and reply to the ad<lb break="no"/>dress of the Upper House.

Who, he would ask,<lb/>frightened His Excellency with this<lb/>idea? Was it the friends of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment? Was it their enemies? It<lb/>was not hard to decide. They found<lb/>that the Government had a majority on<lb/>the no confidence motion then going<lb/>on, and to bring matters to an issue<lb/>they had to act in this way, and so pre<lb/>vented the Government from appoint<lb/>ing a Special Committee.<lb/>

            <p>In retiring from office, the members of<lb/>the Government had left no constitutional<lb/>right impaired.

            </p>
            <p>The Committee of the Legislative<lb/>Council did not wait on His Excellency<lb/>till after 12 o'clock, and until the terms of<lb/>Address was in his possession, he could<lb/>not officially communicate with the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil on the subject of his Reply to it.<lb/>

            <p>If the statement the Governor here<lb/>made were true, if he was really desirous<lb/>to make them acquainted with the con<lb break="no"/>tents and nature of the reply he intended<lb/>to deliver, why did he not do it?

     He would here observe that up to a

He was<lb/>always against the clause on Representa<lb break="no"/>tion by Population without some neutral<lb break="no"/>izing power. He had corroborative evi<lb break="no"/>dence of all he had said.

The son of an honest and<lb/>industrious father, he had by the exercise<lb/>of these virtues reared himself to the po<lb break="no"/>sition of trust which he was called to fill,<lb/>and knowing by experience the value of<lb/>every dollar, he was sparing in letting it<lb/>go. He ever regarded the public money<lb/>as sacred, and to be used as he would<lb/>have done his own. He might not be the<lb/>most brilliant, nor the most able, al<lb break="no"/>though his talents were far above the<lb/>common, but he certainly had never been<lb/>excelled, and he could say, and be borne<lb/>out in the statement, that this Province<lb/>never had a better Provincial Secretary<lb/>than Arthur H. Gilmor. Mr. Odell, too,<lb/>the Postmaster General, was a man of ho<lb break="no"/>nor, integrity and prudence, and as a Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, he challenged those who should<lb/>follow them, to watch, look, and examine<lb/>into their actions, and shew that they had<lb/>been guilty in the slightest degree of any<lb/>malpractice. They go out with clean<lb/>hands, without, since the opening of this<lb/>correspondence, appointing a magistrate<lb/>or voting a penny to gain political influ<lb break="no"/>ence, and he challenged their opponents<lb/>to show a point in which they had proved<lb/>direlect to the public interests. There<lb/>was his friend, too, the Chief Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of the Board of Works, Mr. Hath<lb break="no"/>eway, though he had been most foully<lb/>abused, yet the greatest complaint they<lb/>could bring against him was that it he<lb/>had more money put into hands he would<lb/>spend it all on the roads and bridges.<lb/>These things even the Opposition would<lb/>agree with. And when he heard the at<lb break="no"/>tack of the hon member for York (Mr.<lb/>Fisher) on Mr. Botsford because of his<lb/>absence for a few days from his office,<lb/>when that gentleman had returned home<lb/>to his family to minister to a sick daugh<lb break="no"/>ter, he felt hurt and indignant.

<!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->



           <!-- <p>MONDAY , APRIL 16th.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>After the Journals were read, His<lb/>Honor the Speaker remarked that it was<lb/>unnecessary to proceed with the third<lb/>reading of the Bills before them, because<lb/>there would be no time for the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council to assent to them, as the<lb/>duct. He would now call attention to<lb/>o'clock.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName>, in resuming, said he un<lb break="no"/>derstood that the Government had conde<lb break="no"/>scended to give him permission to reply<lb/>to a speech made by a member of the<lb/>Government in the Legislative Council,<lb/>which was an attack upon him. He<lb/>trusted that they would not exercise and<lb/>prostitute the prerogative of the Crown<lb/>to prevent any person speaking upon a<lb/>point upon which they feel they have a<lb/>right to speak. (Mr. Wilmot said that<lb/>he had not been informed that the House<lb/>was to be prorogued at three o'clock.)<lb/>Mr. Smith said that showed the way the<lb/>business was carried on. The leader of<lb/>the Government states—after the an<lb break="no"/>nouncement made by you—that he does<lb/>not know that this House is to be pro<lb break="no"/>rogued at three o'clock. Who governs<lb/>the country, the Governor or his consti<lb break="no"/>tutional advisers ? It is extraordinary<lb/>that we have had no announcement made<lb/>yet whether the public departments are<lb/>filled or not, although it is nearly a week<lb/>since the late Government resigned. This<lb/>conduct cannot be justified. Responsible<lb/>Government, which took us so long to<lb/>win, and which we have cherished with<lb/>such jealous care, seems to be laid pros<lb break="no"/>trate before the power of despotism, and<lb/>we are told by His Excellency that it<lb/>was the result of accident. If the people<lb/>have an opportunity of having a voice in<lb/>this question, they will try to bring it<lb/>back again. He (Mr. S) had been told<lb/>that he had been charged by a member<lb/>of the Government in the Upper House<lb/>with an act of discourtesy to Captain<lb/>Hallowes. It was said that the Govern<lb break="no"/>or's answer to their resignation delivered<lb/>to him by Captain Hallows, was to be re<lb break="no"/>turned. We sent in our resignations at<lb/>one P. M. on Tuesday, and did not get an<lb/>acceptance of it until Thursday at 6½<lb/>P. M. The next day they met to prepare<lb/>an answer to it, and while there, Captain<lb/>Hallowes came and requested him to re<lb break="no"/>turn the paper. He (Mr. S.) replied<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
    

    

            <p>that they wanted the paper in order to<lb/>prepare their answer, which it would take<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>which his Excellency wished to make,<lb/>taking them away with him and seeming<lb/>satisfied, for he made no complaint. It<lb/>is a novel proceeding to ask for a paper<lb/>of that importance to be returned while<lb/>the controversy was going on, but the<lb/>most remarkable thing is that one paper<lb/>was sent to them, and a different one was<lb/>published in the Royal Gazette, in which<lb/>material alterations had been made.<lb/>That very night another paper, in which<lb/>other alterations were made, was tele<lb break="no"/>graphed through to St. John without<lb/>waiting for their answer, and for this the<lb/>public will have to pay. Should that pa<lb break="no"/>per, in which serious charges were made<lb/>against him, have been published in the<lb/>Royal Gazette without his reply? He<lb/>would leave it to the House and country<lb/>to said if that was fair. In reference to<lb/>Responsible Government, he would read<lb/>a passage from His Excellency's commu<lb break="no"/>nication as published in the Royal Ga<lb break="no"/>zette :<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     " His Excellency may be in error, but 
     <lb/>he believes that a vast change has alrea<lb break="no"/>dy taken place in the opinions held on<lb/>this subject in New Brunswick. He ful<lb break="no"/>ly anticipates that the House of Assembly<lb/>will yet return a response to the commu<lb break="no"/>nication made to them not less favorable<lb/>to the principle of Union than that given<lb/>by the Upper House."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     They were elected upon the anti-Cou- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>federate ticket, and His Excellency ex<lb break="no"/>presses the hope that they will be recreant<lb/>to their trust, and that they will, like the<lb/>Legislative Council, pass an Address<lb/>adopting the Quebec Scheme, and ask<lb/>Her Majesty to force it upon the people<lb/>of this country by Imperial Legislation.<lb/>His Excellency goes on to say :<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     " In any event he relies with confidence 
     <lb/>on the desire of a great majority of the<lb/>people of the Province to aid in building<lb/>up a powerful and prosperous nation un<lb break="no"/>der the sovereignty of the British Crown.<lb/>To their verdict His Excellency is ready<lb/>and willing to appeal."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     This last clause was not in the manu<lb break="no"/>script submitted to the Government. One<lb/>paper was given to them, another publish<lb break="no"/>ed in the Gazette, and another sent to<lb/>St. John, and these three were all differ-<lb break="yes"/>end. There is no justification for these<lb/>alterations. In another part he says :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" The Lieutenant Governor, of course,<lb/>feels that previous communication be<lb break="no"/>tween himself and his advisers as to any<lb/>step he is about to take, is, when prac<lb break="no"/>ticable, both desirable and essential."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The word essential seems to imply that<lb/>it was his duty to consult his Council,<lb/>but that word is not in the manuscript<lb/>submitted to them, but has been substi<lb break="no"/>tuted for the word convenient.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> said there was a very<lb/>rough copy of the original kept, which<lb/>was the reason His Excellency wished it<lb/>sent back in order that they could have a <lb/>copy of it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR WILLISTON said that if he right<lb break="no"/>ly understood Mr. Smith he agreed at the<lb/>time to give the paper back.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said he told Captain Hal<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>lowes that he could not return it, as an<lb/>answer had to be prepared to it. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency goes o to make other alterations.<lb/>He says :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" [illegible] was His Excellency's wish<lb/>that the contents of his Reply should be<lb/>known to the Council before its deli<lb break="no"/>very."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That was added to the paper submitted<lb/>to them, and it puts a different face upon<lb/>the document. He (Mr. S.) would ask<lb/>the House why it was, if His Excellency<lb/>had so strong a wish for the contents of<lb/>his reply to be known to his Council, that<lb/>he used such unbecoming haste in re<lb break="no"/>turning an answer ? Did he expect this<lb/>effort of the Legislative Council would be<lb/>successful, and the British Government<lb/>would force the Quebec Scheme upon the<lb/>people of this country. As sure as the<lb/>sun sets in the west they will rebel<lb/>against any such attempt. He (Mr. S.)<lb/>felt satisfied that many of those gentle<lb break="no"/>men who desired Confederation wished<lb/>to obtain it by constitutional means, and<lb/>did not desire by coercion to force Con<lb break="no"/>federation upon the people. He believed<lb/>they would resist any such attempt to<lb/>force upon the people of this country a<lb/>scheme which they have rejected. There<lb/>must be a hidden hand in the matter, for<lb/>the answer of His Excellency to the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council was known to several<lb/>members of the Opposition a day or tw<lb/>before it was delivered. If that be true<lb/>is it not lamentable and outrageous that<lb/>such a state of things exist. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion to be considered is not Confederation<lb/>or anti-Confederation, but it is a great<lb/>constitutional question. If he (Mr. S.)<lb/>was the worst man that ever lived, it<lb/>would be not excuse for His Excellency<lb/>not consulting with his advisers, against<lb/>whose character he could say nothing,<lb/>for it was due to them that they should be<lb/>consulted. The intelligence of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country has been insulted by<lb/>His Excellency's telling them that his not<lb/>consulting his Executive Council was the<lb/>result of an accident. He (Mr. S.) felt<lb/>assured that many of the members of the<lb/>Legislative Council would now be willing<lb/>to retrace their steps, for they feel that<lb/>an injustice has been perpetrated upon<lb/>the country. He did not know whether<lb/>the House was prorogued in view of a <lb/>dissolution or not, but he was satisfied<lb/>that this transaction must inevitably end<lb/>in a dissolution, in order that the people<lb/>may express an opinion upon their con-<lb break="maybe"/> <lb/>some resolutions which were now pend<lb break="no"/>ing before the House, in order that they<lb/>may see exactly the position they were in.<lb/>There was an important principle in these<lb/>resolutions, for they contained not only a<lb/>want of confidence in the Government,<lb/>but in the Governor himself. Mr. Smith<lb/>then read the following Resolutions, mo<lb break="no"/>ved by Mr. Otty :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" Whereas the Legislative Council in<lb/>Provincial Parliament assembled, did, on<lb/>the 6th of April instant pass an Address<lb/>to Her Majesty, praying that Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty might be graciously pleased to cause<lb/>a measure to be submitted to the Imperial<lb/>Parliament for the purpose of uniting<lb/>the Colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, New<lb/>Brunswick, Newfoundland and Prince<lb/>Edward Island, in one Government, such<lb/>union to be based upon the resolutions<lb/>adopted at the Conference of Delegates<lb/>from the several Colonies, held at Quebec<lb/>on the 10th October, 1664 :<lb/>
