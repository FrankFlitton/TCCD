     men who were five hundred miles away 
     <lb/>from Cawnpore, and had never heard of<lb/>
    the massacre there, executed without trial 
     <lb/>or condemnation. I placed the facts be<lb break="no"/>fore the public then, as I did in the more 
     <lb/>recent affair in Jamaica. where men have 
     <lb/>been summarily put to death without one 
     <lb/>tittle of evidence against them, and this 
     <lb/>affaur is now being enquired into through 
     <lb/>a commission appointed by the British 
     <lb/>Government, through the influence of re<lb break="no"/>ligious bodies in England. Fortunately 
     <lb/>for the blacks, they happened to be mem<lb break="no"/>bers of a denomination which is just now 
     <lb/>very powerful in London; if it was not 
     <lb/>so, there might never have been a com<lb break="no"/>mission appointed. lt makes no differ<lb break="no"/>ence to me whether a man is a Protestant 
     <lb/>or a Papist. I deal to all the same mea<lb break="no"/>sure of justice. I would stand up for the 
     <lb/>Musselman, if unoffending, as freely as I 
     <lb/>would stand up for my own countrymen. 
     <lb/>I am in favor of freedom of speech, and I 
     <lb/>attempt to find fault with no man who   
     <lb/>chooses to address his fellow men as he 
     <lb/>pleases ; but there is a limit to freedom 
     <lb/>of speech.   License is not freedom of 
     <lb/>speech. A man may utter falsehoods, but 
     <lb/>the people; when they find how they have 
     <lb/>been deceived, will turn on those men 
     <lb/>and teach them a lesson which they ne— 
     <lb/>ver will forget. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>
     It is much to be regretted that this Fe<lb break="no"/>nian association exists in the United<lb/>States. We here can do nothing to in<lb break="no"/>terfere in any way to lessen its power. 
     <lb/>
     There are various opinions in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the object of that association. Some peo<lb break="no"/>ple may think they are the greatest scoun<lb break="no"/>drels that ever disgraced the face of the 
     <lb/>
    earth; others may consider them mistaken 
     <lb/>men who, goaded by the remembrance of 
     <lb/>bitter wrongs, are led into foolish paths. 
     <lb/>It is hard for anyone who has witnessed the 
     <lb/>famine of 1848 to speak harshly of them. 
     <lb/>At that time, hundreds of my countrymen 
     <lb/>died on the streets of starvation day 
     <lb/>after day they disposed of their property 
     <lb/>at a sacrifice, to prolong their lives, and 
     <lb/>when that was gone, they huddled into 
     <lb/>some back place to starve on a pile of 
     <lb/>straw, exposed to the pittiless rain and 
     <lb/>cold winds; and thus, day after day, they 
     <lb/>pined away until they died, and morning 
     <lb/>after morning their bodies were thrown 
     <lb/>into some pit, and often but half covered 
     <lb/>up. Those who have witnessed such 
     <lb/>scenes can hardly speak harshly of those 
     <lb/>men, whatever they may think of their 
     <lb/>present undertaking. If this body of 
     <lb/>men should come and attempt to conquer 
     <lb/>this Province. their project would not 
     <lb/>only be foolish but most wicked, for these 
     <lb/>provinces have never given them cause 
     <lb/>of offence, but have always oflered an 
     <lb/>asylum and a home to their fellow coun<lb break="no"/>trymen. No hope of redressing the 
     <lb/>wrongs of their native country can justify 
     <lb/>them in invading this Province ;   and if 
     <lb/>they did, they would find the Irish people 
     <lb/>of this Province ready to take the fore<lb break="no"/>most rank to meet and repel such inva<lb break="no"/>sion. If there was danger, at the time of 
     <lb/>the York election, that these parties 
     <lb/>would come down upon us like wolves in 
     <lb/>the fold, was that the time to create jeal<lb break="no"/>ousy in the country, by setting race 
     <lb/>against race, man against man. Can any 
     <lb/>man who really values the peace and wel<lb break="no"/>fare of his country, think of such proceed<lb break="no"/>ings without horror? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I spoke yesterday of an address pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the Canadians to Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>
     asking her to submit to the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament a Bill for a Union of these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, contrary to our expressed wishes. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     I did not expect that conduct to be 
     <lb/>repeated by the members of our Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council to-day. I hold in my hand a<lb/>document which I think will startle and<lb/>alarm the people of this Province. I <lb/>want to speak with respect of the other<lb/>
    branch of the Legislature. I presume 
     <lb/>that in this matter the hon. members of 
     <lb/>that House have acted as they thought 
     <lb/>best, and I do not want to question their 
     <lb/>motives, but they have placed themselves   
     <lb/>in a most unenviable position. Under 
     <lb/>the Quebec Scheme, ten of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Councillors are selected from the 
     <lb/>small body of eighteen members in the 
     <lb/>Upper House. This is a large bribe to 
     <lb/>offer them, for they sit there for life. 
     <lb/>where, as has been remarked, they can 
     <lb/>see acres of plaster and miles of cornice. 
     <lb/>They ought to be careful not to give the 
     <lb/>people of this country the slightest cause 
     <lb/>of suspicion that they were influenced by 
     <lb/>anything of that kind. They are not the 
     <lb/>representatives of the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and they have no authority to 
     <lb/>speak in their behalf. They, acting with<lb break="no"/>out the concurrence of this House, will 
     <lb/>scarcely be regarded more than a mere 
     <lb/>aggregation of individuals. Shall it be 
     <lb/>said that gentlemen selected as they have 
     <lb/>been, by the Government—by the Crown, 
     <lb/>representatives of the men appointed to 
     <lb/>choose them, some of them not represen<lb break="no"/>tatives at all—shall be heard above the 
     <lb/>representatives of the people? They 
     <lb/>have undertaken to address Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>asking her not simply to give a favorable   
     <lb/>consideration to Confederation, but bold<lb break="no"/>ly asking her to lay a Bill before the 
     <lb/>Imperial Parliament to sweep away the 
     <lb/>independence of this Province. I regret 
     <lb/>it exceedingly on their own behalf, but 
     <lb/>beyond that I am delighted, as it shows 
     <lb/>their animus. It shows what they think 
     <lb/>of the people and the people's rights. 
     <lb/>The address is as follows :— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     "To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty : 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     "MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN: We<lb/>your Majesty's faithful and loyal subjects,<lb/>the Legislative Council in Provincial Par<lb break="no"/>liament assembled, humbly approach your<lb/>Majesty with the conviction that a union<lb/>of all your Majesty's British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Colonies based on the resolutions 
     <lb/>
     adopted at the Conference of delegates 
     <lb/>
     from these several Colonies, held at Que<lb break="no"/>bec on the 10th day of October, 1864. is 
     <lb/>
     an object highly to be desired, essential 
     <lb/>
     to their future prosperity and influence. 
     <lb/>
     and calculated alike to strengthen and 
     <lb/>
     perpetuated the ties which bind them to 
     <lb/>
     your gracious Majesty's throne and Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and humbly pray that your 
     <lb/>
     Majesty may be graciously pleased to 
     <lb/>
     cause a measure to be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     thus uniting the Colonies of Canada, 
     <lb/>
     Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfound<lb break="no"/>land and Prince Edward's Island into 
     <lb/>
     one Government." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     These gentlemen may have acted from 
     <lb/>
     the best motives, but they had no right 
     <lb/>
     to act in that way, while the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people were debating the 
     <lb/>
     same subjects and in so doing they have 
     <lb/>
     insulted the Government. They should 
     <lb/>
     not have gone beyond passing a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion in favor of adopting the scheme and 
     <lb/>
     asking the concurrence of the House. 
     <lb/>
     That would have been going to the ex<lb break="no"/>treme limit of their power and authority, 
     <lb/>
     and I think the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     have too high a regard for constitutional 
     <lb/>
     principles to pay the slightest attention 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     to a document of that kind. They will 
     <lb/>regard it as an attempt of those men to<lb/>get possession of those ten seats in the <lb/>upper House at Ottawa. Should this<lb/>scheme come before us, we will speak on<lb/>behalf of the people and say, in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter the people of the Province are the<lb/>parties who have a right to speaj and<lb/>determine concerning this matter.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     
      MR. WETMORE.— Will this anti-Con- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>
     federate Government permit an answer to 
     <lb/>
     be given to this address, unless they 
     <lb/>
     think proper to take the entire and com<lb break="no"/>plete responsibility of it?' 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. ANGLIN.—My hon. friend may 
     <lb/>
     put his question to the Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. GILBERT.— Before my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend concludes his addess, I would like 
     <lb/>
     to ask him whether he is opposed to all   
     <lb/>
     political union with Canada.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     MR. ANGLlN.—The hon. member has 
     <lb/>
     put a serious question which requires an 
     <lb/>
     extended answer. I do not believe at 
     <lb/>
     the present time a political union of any 
     <lb/>
     kind can be formed with Canada which 
     <lb/>would be a benefit to the people of this<lb/>Province. I do not know of any one op<lb break="no"/>posed to union in the abstract, but my <lb/>impression is that the time has not ar<lb break="no"/>rived for any kind of union, and I will 
     <lb/>oppose it to the last. At present the 
     <lb/>Provinces are distinct communities with 
     <lb/>conflicting interests, and the Quebec<lb/>Scheme does not reconcile them, and the <lb/>difficulties can only be overcome by sacri<lb break="no"/>ficing the Lower Provinces altogether.<lb/>lf any new scheme comes up, it will be 
     <lb/>for the people to decide upon its merits, 
     <lb/>and I trust they will retain the power in 
     <lb/>their own hands to finally settle the des<lb break="no"/>tiny of this Province. I will now thank 
     <lb/>the House for their attention and close 
     <lb/>my remarks.    
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The House was adjourned until 10 
     <lb/>
     o'clock Monday morning, the debate to 
     <lb/>
     be resumed at 11 A. M.

     If the circumstances thst were mentioned

            </p>
            <p>HON MR. SMITH then rose and said,<lb/>that he had hoped to have been ready to<lb/>give the reasons why the Government had<lb/>tendered their resignations, but regretted<lb/>he was not yet in a position to do so.<lb/>He had just received a note from the<lb/>Governor saying that he could not give a<lb/>reply to them till four or five o'clock, and<lb/>as under these circumstances it was usual<lb/>to adjourn from day to day, he was com<lb break="no"/>pelled again to ask the indulgence of the<lb/>Houser.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. KERR thought that local matters<lb/>could be gone on with without affecting<lb/>the position of the Government. If he<lb/>imagined that anything could arise to<lb/>affect them, he would [illegible] made [illegible]<lb/>motion. It would probably be three or<lb/>four days before that would be [illegible]<lb/>take up any business of general interest,<lb/>but in the meantime he should like the<lb/>local business to be transacted.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. FISHER said they should remem-<lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>ber that the request for adjournment came<lb/>from the Government, and though he felt<lb/>the necessity of proceeding with the local<lb/>business yet he could not feel it his duty<lb/>to proceed against their motion. He did<lb/>not look for the effect the going on might<lb/>have on the past or present, but on the<lb/>future, and as it was usual to adjourn, he<lb/>was in favor of allowing the Government<lb/>time to conclude their correspondence.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. BOYD said, as the House had<lb/>heard from the Attorney General that the<lb/>Governor had not yet returned an answer<lb/>to their resignation, it was their duty to<lb/>adjourn in compliance with the request of<lb/>the Government.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. SUTTON could see no reasona<lb break="no"/>ble objection to the House proceeding<lb/>with local business whilst the correspon<lb/>dence between the Government and the<lb/>Governor was pending.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">HON. MR. SMITH</persName> reiterated that it<lb/>was usual to adjourn the House from day<lb/>to day under such circumstances as the<lb/>Government were now placed, but it was<lb/>in the hands of the House to adjourn or<lb/>go on, as they saw fit.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. GILBERT said this Province was<lb/>not a Crown Colony, but was ruled by a<lb/>Government responsible to the people,<lb/>and exigencies having arisen to cause the<lb/>Government to tender their resignation,<lb/>and a reply to the same not having been<lb/>yet received, he though the House must<lb/>adjourn in compliance with the request of<lb/>the Attorney General. The difficulty<lb/>would be to distinguish between general<lb/>and local business, or where the line<lb/>should be drawn. Under responsible and<lb/>departmental Government all business<lb/>transacted by this House must be con<lb break="no"/>sidered as affecting the general interests<lb/>of the Province, and although business<lb/>might be retarded for a few days by the<lb/>adjournment, yet a precedent must be es<lb break="no"/>tablished that the Government must be in<lb/>a working condition for the business to<lb/>be constitutional, and he should, there<lb break="no"/>fore, support the motion for adjournment.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. THOMPSON said they knew what<lb/>the rules of the British Government were<lb/>on this point, and though time was lost,<lb/>yet it enabled the members to know ex<lb break="no"/>actly how matters stood. He wanted to<lb/>go on constitutionally, manly and fairly,<lb/>and to see the principles established car<lb break="no"/>ried out. A change was made in our<lb/>Constitution about fifteen years ago, by<lb/>those who he believed were seeking office,<lb/>yet having now a responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or having had it up to within the<lb/>past few days, he thought the House<lb/>should adjourn, or they would be like a<lb/>balloon with the cords cut, and go up<lb/>God knows where. To proceed consti<lb break="no"/>tutionally required time, and as the At<lb break="no"/>torney General had asked for an adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment they should do so and save the<lb/>trouble and bother that would otherwise<lb/>arise. The hon. member for York (Mr.<lb/>Fisher) was one of the framers of the plan<lb/>of departmental Government, and he did<lb/>not want to see him like a child with a<lb/>card house, up foot and knock down all<lb/>his work. He was little of a politician,<lb/>and had taken up very little of the time<lb/> <lb/>given to talking, but rather to listening,<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     and had only spoken now to jog the mem<lb break="no"/>ory of the hon, member for York, as they<lb/>all knew the least drop was sometimes<lb/>sufficient to stimulate.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. ANGLIN said it was always the<lb/>case under circumstances like the present<lb/>to adjourn from day to day. He did not<lb/>like this lounging about, not at work, yet<lb/>he believed that a number of hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers had been hard at work during the<lb/>past few days, and they looked as though<lb/>they had heavy care upon their minds.<lb/>The Government might be considered in<lb/>a moribund condition, and as the hon.<lb/>member, the late head of the Opposition,<lb/>but who now, he supposed, he must ad<lb break="no"/>dress as the hon. member for York, would<lb/>naturally be very busy, he thought time<lb/>should be given those forming a new admin<lb break="no"/>istration to mature their plans, and as<lb/>under the circumstances it could not be<lb/>expected that the members of the mori<lb break="no"/>bund Government, as well as the leading<lb/>members of the Opposition, would be able<lb/>to be in their seats, there would be very<lb/>few to discuss the questions that came<lb/>before them, if they should decide to go<lb/>on with Bills of a local character. Under<lb/>such circumstances, matters might be<lb/>brought before the House of great im<lb break="no"/>portance, and carried without the know<lb break="no"/>ledge of many of the members. The hon.<lb/>member for Charlotte (Mr. Thompson)<lb/>had spoken of Responsible Government<lb/>as a balloon with its cords cut, and gone<lb/>off, no one knows where, but he rather<lb/>regarded it as gone up and collapsed.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     HON. MR. HATHEWAY sid the 
     <lb/>Provincial Secretary was away attending<lb/>the supposed death-bed of his father, and<lb/>as soon as the memorandum had been<lb/>sent to and received from him, the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had laid their resignations be<lb break="no"/>fore the Governor. Time must be given<lb/>to prepare the reply, and the Government<lb/>was not to blame for any delay. His<lb/>hon. friend from Northumberland (Mr.<lb/>Kerr) had never been a member of a Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. If he had, he would not find<lb/>it so very comfortable.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. WILMOT said the delay was first<lb/>charged to the Opposition, and then to<lb/>the Government. He had been in many<lb/>Governments, and had resigned three<lb/>times. The last time it took from Janu<lb break="no"/>ary till April to get a reply accepting it,<lb/>and now the question was, how long would<lb/>it take by the rate of proportion to get a <lb/>reply to the resignation of eight men ?<lb/>He did not understand his hon colleague's<lb/>(Mr. Anglin) reference to the time re<lb break="no"/>quired by what he had termed the " late<lb/>Opposition," but he could assure his hon.<lb/>friend and the House that, so far as he<lb/>was concerned, he was ready to go on<lb/>with the business.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY would en<lb break="no"/>dorse the sentiments of the hon. member<lb/>for St. John, (Mr. Wilmot), and further<lb/>state that there was no question of "cour<lb break="no"/>tesy" to the Opposition. They do not<lb/>ask for the " courtesy" of time to be<lb/>granted to mature plans, and did not<lb/>want it. He came here an independent<lb/>member, and when it was remembered<lb/>that he came to support the Government,<lb/>said that Government had [illegible] to intro<lb break="no"/>duce measures for the good of the coun<lb break="no"/>try.<lb/>
