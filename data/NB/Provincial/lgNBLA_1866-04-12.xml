     <!--would have to thank the hon. member  
     <lb/>for Kent for defining his position, and at<lb/>the same time for his gratoitous attack<lb/>upon the Government. It would be imm-<lb break="maybe"/>gined that when it was known that the<lb/>Government were in the throes of disso-<lb break="maybe"/>lusion, any man possessing a heart with<lb/>the least sentiment of feeling would have<lb/>refrained from any expression of reproof<lb/>of condemnation. But such an attack,<lb/>be held, was ungenerous and unfeeling in<lb/>the extreme. They did not ask for a<lb/>suspension of business on their own ac-<lb break="yes"/>account, but only that the business of the <lb/>country might be carried on according to<lb/>the principles which had been laid down<lb/>and accepted.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr,. FISHER said that everything was         
     <lb/>passing along smoothly and pleasantly,<lb/>but the hon. member for St. John (Mr.<lb/>Anglin) had thrown a firebrand into the<lb/>discussion, and called forth the remarks of<lb/>the hon. member for Kent.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. ANGLIN</persName> was not aware that he   
     <lb/>had thrown any firebrand, and if the hon.<lb/>member for Kent did not know anything<lb/>about the time required to get together<lb/>and form a new Government, he should<lb/>have refrained from making the remarks<lb/>he had. He said that it was only courtesy<lb/>to the retiring Government and to the<lb/>Opposition, to adjourn, that they might<lb/>have time, on the one hand, to obtain<lb/>their reply, and on  the other to mature <lb/>new plans.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. HILL said he should like to see       
     <lb/>the business go on, but it was patent to<lb/>all, that all might be done would<lb/>amount to nothing. The House would<lb/>probably be adjourned, prorogued or dis<lb break="no"/>solved this week, and there would be<lb/>no time to Bills which might pass the<lb/>House, to be got through the Legislative<lb/>Council.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     Mr. FRASER said this was not only  
     <lb/>the case, but the business would not be<lb/>constitutional. The Governor was at the<lb/>present time without advisers, and con<lb break="no"/>sequently the House could not go on<lb/>with the business of the country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. NEEDHAM said he had no doubt 
     <lb/>of the unconstitutionality of the House<lb/>proceeding with business, and should<lb/>move that the House adjourn til to-mor-<lb break="maybe"/>row at half-past two P.M.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     
     
     Mr. KERR said he did not wish to go 
     <lb/>on if any reasonable objection could be<lb/>shown. There was a precedent in the<lb/>matter, for on the 28th of October, 1865, the<lb/>House passed the address and on the <lb/>30th went in a body to  Government <lb/>House. On the 31st met and proceeded<lb/>with business without adjournment till<lb/>Mr. Ritchie came down and announced<lb/>that a new Government was formed, and<lb/>writes issued for a new election.  The <lb/>House was then prorogued. If this was<lb/>the case, then why could not business go<lb/>on now. This, he believed, was the only<lb/>precedent, and business was carried on<lb/>from day to day. He did not wish, how<lb break="no"/>ever, to act discourteously to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but as the Bill he had introduced <lb/>was entirely local, he could not see how<lb/>it could in any way embarrass or affect<lb/>them.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     HON. Mr.  HATHEWAY  said the posi      
     <lb/>tion of affairs was different now from that<lb/>referred to. On that  occasion  Mr. <lb/>Ritchie came to the House and announced<lb/>the resignation of the Government, and <lb/>that the Governor had called upon others<lb/>to carry on the business. No such com<lb break="no"/>munication had been made now.<lb/>
            </p>

     Mr. WILMOT said he was a member

            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     of the Government,, and he thought it       
     <lb/>was a case in point.<lb/>Mr. FISHER, said he went to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House on that one aion, and they<lb/>were two days ferating the new adminis<lb break="no"/>tration, and when Mr. Ritchie came to<lb/>the house the new members had been<lb/>sworn in. He hoped the hon. member<lb/>for Northumberland would withdraw <lb/>his motion and allow the House to adjourn.<lb/> Mr. KERR complied, and the House<lb/>then adjourned til to-morrow, at half-<lb break="yes"/>past two P.M.<lb/>J. March.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">HON. Mr. SMITH</persName> stated that the cor<lb break="no"/>respondence had not yet closed concern<lb break="no"/>ing the resignation of the Governemnt,<lb/>as they had not received a reply which<lb/>his Excellency had promised them; un<lb break="no"/>der these circumstances, he thought they<lb/>should proceed with the business of the<lb/>country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The House in Committee agreed to "A 
     <lb/>Bill to establish an additional polling <lb/>place in the County of Your."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Also "A Bill to amend the law relating <lb/>to the widening of Cross Street in Saint<lb/>John."<lb/>

            <p>" A Bill to incorporate the President, <lb/>Directors and Company of the Northern<lb/>Bank."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"A Bill to authorize the Corporation<lb/>of St. John to become Shareholders in<lb/>the European and North American Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company for its extension from St.<lb/>John Westward."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CORA1">Mr. CORAM</persName> said the bill was to au<lb break="no"/>thorize the Corporation of St. John to<lb/>take stock in that Railway to the extent<lb/>of $60,000 and to issue debentures for<lb/>that purpose.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. ANGLIN</persName> said if the road was<lb/>likely to be built by the Company he<lb/>would be willing to pledge the credit of<lb/>St. John for a much larger amount, but<lb/>he saw no prospect of this, for it had<lb/>been five months since the Company had<lb/>commenced operations, and he believed<lb/>that not one dollar of the Company's<lb/>stock had been paid up by the stockhold<lb break="no"/>ers. The day he came up to Fredericton<lb/>he saw but 17 men employed on the road,<lb/>and he thought it was a bogus transaction<lb/>from beginning to end. He did not know<lb/>whether to oppose the bill or not, particu<lb break="no"/>larly as it was only a Permissive Bill.<lb/>Mr. CORAM said the Common Coun<lb break="no"/>cil would not sell these debentures with<lb break="no"/>out they were certain that the Company<lb/>would carry out their arrangement, and<lb/>build the road.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL1">Mr. HILL</persName> said he was authorized by   
     <lb/>Mr. Burpee to state that there were sev<lb break="no"/>enty-five men working on the road. He<lb/>(Mr. Burpee ) said that he had no doubt<lb/>but what they were in a position to go on<lb/>and complete the work. He (Mr. H.)<lb/>thought it was the duty of the House to<lb/>render all the assistance they could to the<lb/>Company, as that was the only means of<lb/>preventing its being built as a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment work.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName> thought the City of  
     <lb/>St. John should give a bonus to the Com<lb break="no"/>pany of that amount, as the building of<lb/>this Railroad would prove a great benefit<lb/>to that city, as was the building of the<lb/>Grand Trunk Railroad to Portland, which<lb/>increased that value of property there four<lb break="no"/>fold.  He was surprised that his hon. <lb/>friend from St. John (Mr. Anglin) oppos<lb break="no"/>
           

         <cb/>
         

     ed everything that came up regarding   
     <lb/>Western Extension. He (Mr. Anglin)<lb/>was afraid he was going to be a false pro<lb break="no"/>phet, for he had stated that a foot of<lb/>Railway never would be built under the<lb/>Subsidy Act.  He (Mr. L) thought St.<lb/>John would be a gamer if they gave four<lb/>times that amount as this road would<lb/>bring the trade from the interior to the<lb/>sea-board. He would do all he could for<lb/>the company, but he was opposed to Rail<lb break="no"/>ways being built as Government works.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     
     
     <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> said his hon. friend      
     <lb/>from St. John, (Mr. Anglin), who should<lb/>be well informed in regard to the ability<lb/>of this Company to build the road, be<lb break="no"/>ing lately a member of the Government,<lb/>called this a bogus Railway Company.<lb/>We should, therefore, hesitate before<lb/>passing a bill authorizing the Corpora<lb break="no"/>tion of St. John to tax the citizens to<lb/>aid this company. He wished to encour<lb break="no"/>age the building of Railroads, as it open<lb break="no"/>ed up the country and leads to emigra<lb break="no"/>tion and the settlement of the country.<lb/>but he considered that a company that<lb/>undertook the work of building Western<lb/>Extension should have a very large capi<lb break="no"/>tal to carry on the work successfully.<lb/> <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. ANGLIN</persName> said his hon. friend    
     <lb/>(Mr. Gilbert) could judge for himself.<lb/>The road would cost $2,500.000, and<lb/>there had not been one dollar paid up or<lb/>called for.  The Company had already<lb/>a subsidized stock of $140,000, and they<lb/>want this $60,000 in addition. If it was<lb/>not permissive Bill, he would give it<lb/>his most strenuous opposition.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. FISHER</persName> said the only objection  
     <lb/>he had to the Bill was that the amount of<lb/>stock to be taken in St. John was not<lb/>one-tenth of what it should be. The<lb/>town of Woodstock, with only two thou<lb break="no"/>sand inhabitants, had given $40,000 in<lb/>aid of their branch line, and surely St. <lb/>John, with its wealth and population,<lb/>should give $500,000. He would vote for<lb/>the Bill.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     
     
     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName> said that Common  
     <lb/>Council had sent this Bill up to the House<lb/>and they had no right to reject it without<lb/>sufficient cause. The Corporation would<lb/>not take stock in it if they thought it was<lb/>likely to prove a bogus company.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The Bill was then agreed to, after which       
     <lb/>some Bills were introduced, and the<lb/>House adjourned to meet at 10 A.M. to<lb break="no"/>morrow.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. GILBERT said the ballot system<lb/>had now been in operation for two years,<lb/>but it was notorious that the voter was<lb/>not sufficiently protected in his approach<lb/>to the ballot box.
