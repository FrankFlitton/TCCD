<fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> <fw type="num">111</fw>
            
<!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

<!--<p> be kept up directly or indirectly as it
has <lb/>
been done. Statements have been
put <lb/>
forth by the press that we will have to <lb/>
come into this Confederation,
because i <lb/>
will be forced upon us We ought
to ex<lb break="no"/>press an opinion in this House, and en<lb break="no"/>dorse that by a delegation confirming
that <lb/>
opinion that they never need hope to <lb/>
carry Confederation in New Brunswick,
<lb/>
and I think we would save money in the <lb/>
end by so doing. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. MCMILLAN.—It
is amusing to find <lb/>
the Anti-Confederate patty asking for <lb/>
this expensive delegation in order to <lb/>
set themselves right before the people of <lb/>
England. It shows that they are
not <lb/>
satisfied with the position they
hold in <lb/>
the eyes of the English people
in refer<lb break="no"/>ence to this question. What were the <lb/>
arguments put forth by the member
of <lb/>
the Government, and the leading members <lb/>
of the Anti-Confederate party in reference
<lb/>
to the appropriation of money for the Mili<lb break="no"/>tia ? They said it would be a waste of mo<lb break="no"/>ney so far as defence was concerned, but<lb/>
they stood in an unfavorable position in<lb/>
the opinion of the British public, and to<lb/>
prove their loyalty they voted the peo<lb break="no"/>ple's money for this purpose. They are<lb/>
not satisfied with asserting that two<lb/>
thirds of the people are against Confed<lb break="no"/>eration, but it becomes necessary to ap<lb break="no"/>point another delegation to make known<lb/>
the fact, for they feel they are not in a<lb/>
right position before the British public.<lb/>
The hon. member for Victoria (Mr. Cos-<lb break="maybe"/>
tigan) said that the more the people dis<lb break="no"/>cussed this question the more unpopular<lb/>
it would become. My experience is<lb/>
right the reverse of this ; the question<lb/>
came upon them so suddenly, and so<lb/>
few months elapsed before they were re<lb break="no"/>quired to vote at the polls, that they had<lb/>
not time enough to form a correct opin<lb break="no"/>ion upon the subject, and the general<lb/>
tendency of the people, when they do<lb/>
not understand a question, is to vote<lb/>
against any change until they do under<lb break="no"/>stand it. If that question was submitted<lb/>
to the people to-morrow, and the people<lb/>
were required to deposit their votes in<lb/>
the ballot box, either for or against it,<lb/>
two thirds of the people in the Province<lb/>
of New Brunswick would vote in favor<lb/>
of it.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr.
NEEDHAM.—The hon ex-Surveyor<lb/>
General wants to know how this scheme<lb/>
would ruin us, politically. What would<lb/>
we have been had Confederation taken<lb/>
place under this scheme ? Would we<lb/>
have been a Province? certainly not.<lb/>
O, it is said we can have a local legisla<lb break="no"/>ture ; so we could, and its powers would<lb/>
be confined to making laws to prevent<lb/>
cows from running on the commons,<lb/>
providing that sheep shall wear bells,<lb/>
and to issue tavern licences. Hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers may talk about their loyalty and dis<lb break="no"/>loyalty. I would like to ask some of the<lb/>
members of the late Government whether<lb/>
their idea was not this—that they would<lb/>
not have gone for Confederation if they<lb/>
had not believed that it was the first step<lb/>
towards the independence of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. (Mr. McMillan—it is not true.)<lb/>
I have no hesitation in saying that thous<lb break="no"/>ands of men believed in Confederation,<lb/>
honestly and sincerely, but they do not<lb/>
seem willing to give us any credit for<lb/>
sincerity ; they think they have all the<lb/>
argument, all the honesty and all the<lb/>
loyalty. We have now a direct com<lb break="no"/>munication with the Home Government,<lb/>
as they appoint our Governor ; but if we<lb/>
go into Confederation our Governor<lb/>
would be appointed by the Governor<lb/>
General ; that would raise our dignity<lb/>
very much, to have a local Governor<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>appointed by the Governor General ;<lb/>
would not that be derogatory to our po<lb break="no"/>litical standing, both at home and<lb/>
abroad. I heard a Judge, in addressing<lb/>
a Grand Jury, in the County of York,<lb/>
strive to impress upon their minds the<lb/>
necessity for this " Great British Nation<lb break="no"/>ality as he termed it. Great British <lb/>
Humbug! I should like to know
where <lb/>
there is any nationality in this Confed<lb break="no"/>eration scheme that we have not got <lb/>
now. We are " par excellence"
Blue<lb break="no"/>noses ; those born in Ireland are
Irish<lb break="no"/>men, in Bath Englishmen, in Wales <lb/>
Welshmen, but we are all British
sub<lb break="no"/>jects. Are not we British subjects
as <lb/>
much as if we were born "
Cockneys." <lb/>
We have the real British nationality, and <lb/>
because we did not want any
other we <lb/>
rejected the great Botheration or Confed<lb break="no"/>eration scheme, for it all amounts to
the <lb/>
same thing ; thus it is that so
far as poli<lb break="no"/>tics are concerned we are not going to <lb/>
gain anything. I will now allow you that <lb/>
it will be financially disastrous. We will <lb/>
have to give
up all our revenues to Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and they will only refund $201,000;.<lb/>
(Mr. McMillan, will not they assume  <lb/>
our
debts.) We. are prepared to assume <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> our own debts.
Canada has to borrow <lb/>
money
to pay the interest on her own <lb/>
debts, and then wants to assume
ours. <lb/>
It is
like a bankrupt wanting to assume <lb/>
the debts of a rich man. The General <lb/>
Government will give us
$201,000 a year <lb/>
for all time to come. That is, financi<lb break="no"/>ally, the position we are in. No mat<lb break="no"/>ter
how much
the population may in<lb break="no"/>crease in
twenty years, or how many <lb/>
new  roads,
bridges or schools may be <lb/>
required in that time, we can
receive no <lb/>
more
than
that sum. If a man had a <lb/>
million dollars
a year, and he owed the <lb/>
sum
of five millions, and had plenty of <lb/>
friends
to back him, do you suppose he <lb/>
would want to make arrangements
with <lb/>
another
man to take his debt and give <lb/>
him just enough to live on until he died. <lb/>
If he would do that he would he
a fit <lb/>
subject for the Lunatic Asylum.
It was <lb/>
enough to condemn the scheme, that
<lb/>
this
delegation assented to tho proposi<lb break="no"/>tion that whatever arrangements
made <lb/>
between
Canada and the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment from that time
to the time Confed<lb break="no"/>eration
went into
operation should form <lb/>
part and parcel of the obligations to be <lb/>
assumed
by the General
Government. <lb/>
At
that very time England had said
to <lb/>
Canada—what are you prepared to do <lb/>
in
reference to your own defence ? Did <lb/>
she say that to New Brunswick, Nova <lb/>
Scotia or Prince Edward island ? No ! <lb/>
Why ?
Because she knew from
the his<lb break="no"/>tory of
the past that these colonies would <lb/>
when
the time arrived;
they would be <lb/>
ready at a moment's notice to
gather <lb/>
round the British flag; but there was a <lb/>
time
in the history
of Canada when it <lb/>
was otherwise,
and there was a neces<lb break="no"/>sity
for asking the question of Canada. <lb/>
At
that very time Canada sent home a <lb/>
delegation charged with a power to <lb/>
agree with the British
Government. to <lb/>
expend a million of money for
their de<lb break="no"/>fence, to be borne not only by  Canada, <lb/>
but
by all
that Confederation. There <lb/>
would
be a direct tax upon every man. <lb/>
woman and child
in this Province, to <lb/>
pay their proportion of that money. <lb/>
When I
saw that
agreement I felt as <lb/>
every
son of New Brunswick ought to
<lb/>
feel,
that if it cost me my life, my
all. <lb/>
Confederation
should
never be carried <lb/>
if I could
help it. It has not come. I <lb/>
do not say I stopped it, but if I was but <lb/>
one little entering wedge I am satisfied
<lb/>
for
the remainder of my life ; so far as <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 




that is concerned I have done my duty, <lb/>
            <p>
and am sincere in my opposition, and it <lb/>
is a matter of moonshine whether they <lb/>
acknowledge it or not. Canada has
<lb/>
sent home a delegation to influence the <lb/>
British people in favor of this Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. I do not say that this scheme is <lb/>
going to be forced upon us,
but they<lb/>
may pass a provisional Confederation<lb/>
Bill, but we do to not want that
or any <lb/>
thing to look like it. Forty-eight
thou<lb break="no"/>sand men in this Province have said we <lb/>
don't want Confederation, and
that <lb/>
should be an end of it. They have said<lb/>
this, notwithstanding
all the influences <lb/>
that have been brought to bear by the <lb/>
Government, telling them the
Inter- <lb break="yes"/>
colonial railway was going past every <lb/>
man's door, whether he lived at Freder<lb break="no"/>icton. Sussex, or the North Shore. <lb/>
Statesmen in framing a scheme of this <lb/>
kind should look forward to future
<lb/>
ages. In this scheme of Confederation, <lb/>
fifty years hence, Upper Canada
would <lb/>
have a majority of thirty-five over
all the <lb/>
other Provinces. This is the position
<lb/>
We would be in, and we are called to <lb/>
pay homage to the statesmen who framed
<lb/>
this scheme, as though they possessed
<lb/>
all the wisdom in the world.<lb/>
            </p>



            <p> House
adjourned until 9 A. M., to<lb break="no"/>morrow.  <lb/>

            <p>WEDNESDAY, May 31. <lb/></p>
           
 <p>
<persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr. BOYD</persName>.—I thought this subject had <lb/>
been so well ventilated that we should <lb/>
never hear any more about it, but since <lb/>
the matter has been brought in I suppose<lb/>
it has been considered necessary. The <lb/>
first thing I heard of this Union
question <lb/>
was the appointment of delegates
to con<lb break="no"/>fer at Prince Edward Island, on a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Union of the Maritime Provinces. <lb/>
It seems they went there and commenced <lb/>
their deliberations, but some gentlemen <lb/>
from Canada came down.
pooh-poohed at <lb/>
the idea of such a Scheme, proposed a <lb/>
larger Union, to embrace all the Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, and that was the last of
their mission. <lb/>
Next we find them going off to
Canada <lb/>
without any power from this Legislature, <lb/>
or any other. They met, but it was
impos<lb break="no"/>sible to find out what they were doing ; <lb/>
after a time they returned, yet nothing <lb/>
was known as to their proceedings. This <lb/>
attempt at secrecy roused the
public feel<lb break="no"/>ing, and the press clamoured for informa<lb break="no"/>tion. At last it all came out by
a paper <lb/>
in Prince Edward Island publishing the <lb/>
whole Scheme. When I read it first I <lb/>
was somewhat favourably impressed
by it, <lb/>
but as I read on and came to the Section <lb/>
which provided that the Governor General <lb/>
should have the appointment of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernors of the Lower Provinces, I said at <lb/>
once, then the last link that binds us to <lb/>
England will be broken. I went on fur<lb break="no"/>ther and found that New Brunswick
was <lb/>
to be represented in the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment by only fifteen members and I then <lb/>
felt that we should be swamped by Upper <lb/>
Canada. The fact was Canada found her<lb break="no"/>self overwhelmed with debt and wanted to <lb/>
get the support of these Provinces to re<lb break="no"/>lieve her, and so we were to be bought <lb/>
and sold for eighty cents a head. Our <lb/>
people had been content with their posi<lb break="no"/>tion, and if they ever desired a change, it <lb/>was that we might enter into a Union of <lb/>
the Lower Provinces. Then came
the <lb/>
disolution of the House a a time when <lb/>
the people were little prepared for it, and <lb/>
for the first time in the history
of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince we find men who had occupied the <lb/>
highest position in the Government <lb/>
stumping the country to carry their <lb/>
Scheme. But they could not make the  <lb/>

people believe
the story they told, and <lb/>
the result was that every one of
then<lb/>
were rejected at the elections. I do
not <lb/>
intend to go further into the subject. I <lb/>
simply make these remarks as an opening, <lb/>
as it will be taken up and treated
on by <lb/>
abler men than myself. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>. —The hon. mover of <lb/>
these resolutions should expound
his <lb/>
views. and lay before the House the rea<lb break="no"/>sons for the position he takes,
so that hon. <lb/>
members who are opposed to him
may <lb/>
have an opportunity of replying to his re<lb break="no"/>marks.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CUDL1">Mr. CUDLIP</persName> —If this subject were be<lb break="no"/>ing debated in the whole House
with the <lb/>
Speaker in the chair, this would be the <lb/>
right way to proceed,
but in Committee <lb/>
every hon. member should be at liberty to <lb/>
speak freely. I have no objection to ex <lb/>
pound the reasons why I brought in this
<lb/>
resolution, but I am weary of
talking on <lb/>
this Scheme, but I have had so much of it <lb/>
to do for the last six months. I find that <lb/>
the Duke of Newcastle in a despatch to <lb/>
Earl Mulgrave, dated the 6th July. 1862, <lb/>
says as to the authority of the
delegates <lb/>
that " it should emanate in the first in<lb break="no"/>stance from the Province, and
should be <lb/>
concurred in by all of them which it <lb/>
would affect. " Here it is
directly laid <lb/>
down that the people should take the lead <lb/>
in any measure of this kind ;
yet we know <lb/>
that the  delegates not only
conferred on <lb/>
the subject of Union, but adopted a <lb/>
Scheme of which the people knew noth<lb break="no"/>ing. The resolution passed by this House <lb/>
in 1861 was
on a matter of the Union of<lb/>
the three Lower Provinces, and
had no <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> reference
whatever to a Union with Ca<lb break="no"/>nada. I might go into the Scheme
and <lb/>
show thus it carried out it would have <lb/>
proved most disastrous to the interests <lb/>
of this Province, but that has
been so well <lb/>
ventilated that it is not necessary, and the <lb/>
country has decided on it. But I want
<lb/>
another delegation appointed that
we may
<lb/>
put ourselves right before the
British Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, and that they may confer
on <lb/>
all points that tend to the welfare of this <lb/>
Province. If it is wanted to put
the re<lb break="no"/>solution down, the House can do
it, but I <lb/>
think it is necessary that the question <lb/>
should be taken up and hon.
members can <lb/>
oppose it by any arguments they
choose <lb/>
to bring. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Hon. Mr.
MCMILLAN</persName>.—The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for St. John (Mr. Cudlip) has avoided <lb/>
touching upon the three points of his re<lb break="no"/>solution, namely
that Confederation would <lb/>
prove disastrous to this
country, political<lb break="no"/>ly, financially, and commercially.
He has <lb/>
given no reasons for the ground
he has <lb/>
taken in the resolution. He says the
<lb/>
country has pronounced against it, and
<lb/>
the vote of this House will doubtless de<lb break="no"/>cide against it; then I would ask, why put <lb/>
the country to the expense of sending
<lb/>
gentlemen home merely to tell England <lb/>
the wishes of the people of this Province
? <lb/>
These were ascertained
by the late elec<lb break="no"/>tions. and are well known in England, <lb/>
without sending home a special delega<lb break="no"/>tion to tell them of it. The hon. mover <lb/>
has declined to sustain the three positions <lb/>
he assumes. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr.
SMITH</persName> —You can disprove <lb/>
them.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr.
MCMILLAN</persName>.—Yes, that is a very <lb/>

logical idea. The hon. President of th <lb/>
Council calls on me to prove a negative. <lb/>
I will, however, answer a few of
th <lb/>
grounds taken. The hon. member for <lb/>
Victoria (Mr. Costigan) says with
regard <lb/>
to this Union, " there is no strength in
it." <lb/>
No strength in it ! Union is not strength<lb/>
then,—a proposition contrary to what I <lb/>
have always heard He says, " there <lb/>
         
            <cb/>

would
be rebellion in the country if the <lb/>
Scheme had been carried." This I con<lb break="no"/>sider to be the highest
compliment which <lb/>
could possibly be paid to the Confederates. <lb/>
He says in effect that if there had been a<lb/>
majority for the Scheme, the
minority<lb/>
would have rebelled. The friends of <lb/>
Confederation did not succeed, they were <lb/>
found to be in a minority, and yet they <lb/>
proved to be as loyal as those
who
suc<lb break="no"/>ceeded in crushing the measure
by a <lb/>
large majority. I say this is a
high com<lb break="no"/>pliment to pay to these who were charged<lb/>
with
wishing to dissolve the ties that
bind <lb/>
us to the glorious mother country. He <lb/>
says, " the elections were hurried on, and <lb/>
that we relied on the ignorance of the <lb/>
people to carry it through." This is an <lb/>
argument that to my mind will
cut both <lb/>
ways. I believe that a great many
voted <lb/>
against Confederation because
they failed <lb/>
to understand the benefits
that would <lb/>
follow from it ; but the anti-Confederate
<lb/>
leaders threw up that great bug-bear <lb/>
taxation. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>. —The hon. member <lb/>
says hear, hear but he
knows such was <lb/>
the case, and he used this very
argument. <lb/>
On' the same ground all the great Schemes <lb/>
that ever came up, have been attacked,<lb/>
but in the end the people have seen their <lb/>
mistake, as I have no doubt they
yet will <lb/>
on this question. Then the hon.
member <lb/>
says we were " going to be swamped, only<lb/>
fifteen members from New Brunswick and <lb/>
so many from Canada." He seems
to
<lb/>
forget what matters were to come
before <lb/>
the General Government to be discussed. <lb/>
What is it that makes dissention and dis<lb break="no"/>cussion ; is it not the matters
that are of <lb/>
a local character? But there
the question <lb/>
of tariffs and general trade could have
<lb/>
caused no such dissention. And then<lb/>
supposing
difficulties did arise what would<lb/>
affect us would in a like manner affect <lb/>
Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, <lb/>
and Lower Canada, and these together <lb/>
would wield greater influence than
could <lb/>
be brought to bear against
them. See <lb/>
how it has been in Canada, although divi<lb break="no"/>sions have taken place there, the parties <lb/>
were so equal that a few members were<lb/>
always able to sustain or overthrow a <lb/>
Government. And how shall it be said<lb/>
that Upper Canada,
with h ? r eighty-two <lb/>
members will swamp us, when we
are <lb/>
backed by 112 on all discussions
of gen<lb break="no"/>eral character which alone can be brought
<lb/>
up. And then it has been said that Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada is increasing very rapidly in
<lb/>
population. Well, will they not have to <lb/>
contribute in proportion to their popula<lb break="no"/>lation, and then the less <hi rendition="simple:italic">per capita</hi> shall
<lb/>
we have to pay. These are all local view
<lb/>
of the matter, but in a question of this <lb/>
kind, we should rise above such petty, <lb/>
narrow views, and look at the advantages<lb/>
that would accrue from our being a
large, <lb/>
united and free people. Next the hon. <lb/>
member for Victoria said that
there was <lb/>
no certainty or guarantee whatever that <lb/>
the Railway would be built. But
this <lb/>
was provided for in the Scheme,
and sanc<lb break="no"/>tioned by the Imperial Government.
He <lb/>
then said that Canada would go on with <lb/>
canals and public works and we should <lb/>
have to pay for them. I am not
prepared <lb/>
to endorse such a proposition, for with a <lb/>
population ten times that of
ours. I do not <lb/>
think it at all likely they will
be willing <lb/>
to tax themselves $10 for the purpose of <lb/>
getting $1 from us. Then as to
the Rail<lb break="no"/>way through our Province ; it
would go<lb/>
through the entire length,
and of the $16,<lb break="no"/>000,000—entire cost—some $9,000,<lb break="no"/>000 would be spent in this Province. <lb/>
The Railway would run some 220
miles, <lb/>
       
            <cb/>

opening up and increasing the value of <lb/>
our Crown Lands at least four fold for all <lb/>
time to come for our own particular bene<lb break="no"/>fit. Another point made is that our popu<lb break="no"/>lation would not increase. This is cer<lb break="no"/>tainly new to me ; what is it that brings <lb/>
people to a country, is it not that trade is <lb/>
flourishing ? And would it not
give
an <lb/>
impetus to trade to have the barriers that <lb/>
exist in other countries broken down ? <lb/>
And it would become a matter of indiffer<lb break="no"/>ence whether goods were made in Mon<lb break="no"/>treal, or Toronto or St. John, as the maxim <lb/>
would be to " buy in the cheapest market
<lb/>
and sell in the dearest." The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for York (Mr. Needham) says
we <lb/>
were to be sold for $201,000. He evid<lb break="no"/>dextly
has forgotten that the General <lb/>
Government would have assumed
a large <lb/>
amount of our liabilities. There was <lb/>

            <p> which we get over and above the Rail<lb break="no"/>road, Free Trade and all the advan<lb break="no"/>tages to arise from them. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Now supposing
Western Extension were <lb/>
built according to our Facility Bill , and <lb/>
the Intercolonial according to the laws
<lb/>
now on our Statute Book, with the Civil<lb/>
List and all the expenses of the
local Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, we should require a revenue <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> of $l,l38,340. Whilst it is only $785, 589.
<lb/>
We should therefore get out of
the Con<lb break="no"/>federacy according to our own
lav? $352,<lb break="no"/>751 more than we contribute. How then <lb/>
can it be said that we were to be sold for<lb/>
$201,000 ? Another objection raised by <lb/>
the hon. member for York (Mr.Needham) <lb/>
and that is, that we should be bound by <lb/>
any arrangement Canada should choose
<lb/>
to enter into ; but this same
argument <lb/>
was used in Canada with regard to New<lb/>
Brunswick. The 67 b Section of the <lb/>
Scheme however is general in the applica<lb break="no"/>tion. I have asked the hon. mover to <lb/>
substantiate the three positions he as<lb break="no"/>sumes, but he has declined to do so. I <lb/>
have attempted to show that in a financial <lb/>
point of view we should have been plac<lb break="no"/>ed in a better position, and I
cannot un<lb break="no"/>derstand how a political body
such as we <lb/>
should be would injure the little Province <lb/>
of New Brunswick. Is it imagined
that <lb/>
New Brunswick, with her House of forty <lb/>
members, eclipses in importance
the 194 <lb/>
members of a united Confederacy ? Would <lb/>
not the larger body be
regarded as of <lb/>
more importance, and wield a greater in<lb break="no"/>fluence, and be of more weight in the eyes <lb/>
of the Mother Country and the Imperial
<lb/>
Parliament than we are now ? Political<lb break="no"/>ly we should be placed is a far better po<lb break="no"/>sition, and commercially we should also <lb/>
be benefitted. Would it injure us that all <lb/>
the imaginary lines and Custom

 barriers between the Provinces should be <lb/>
removed, that we should be enabled to <lb/>
extend our trade, and enlarge our enter<lb break="no"/>prise? If we have manufactures in the <lb/>
country is it not for our benefit
that they <lb/>
should be extended? Will it hurt us to <lb/>
have plenty of customers ? We have man<lb break="no"/>ufactures in this country, and all we need <lb/>
is that we should have a large market and <lb/>
more field for our enterprise.
Why did <lb/>
we agree to the Reciprocity Treaty with <lb/>
the United States? Was it not to get a <lb/>
wider field of operations ? And if we, <lb/>
with a population of 250,000, can sustain <lb/>
manufactories, could we not do it much <lb/>
better if we were 4,000,000 ? How then <lb/>
can it be that we should be ruined com<lb break="no"/>mercially, by this Union ? And now for <lb/>
the resolutions themselves. The
third <lb/>
clause of the preamble says " Whereas, <lb/>
the loyalty and attachment of the people <lb/>
of this Province to the Throne
and Go<lb break="no"/>verment of Great Britain cannot justly be <lb/>
impunged, &amp;c." Now this is a
most ex<lb break="no"/>traordinary proposition and one
that I can<lb break="no"/>not understand. It reminds me of
a say<lb break="no"/>ing of the hon. President of the Council, <lb/>
that for a man to be always speaking of <lb/>
his honesty looks as though there was <lb/>
some cause to doubt it. This
very talk <lb/>
about our loyalty tends to cast a doubt on <lb/>
it. Satisfy the British
Government ! <lb/>
Conciliate the British Government! What <lb/>
for ? Because we are Antis? Is this <lb/>
why we grant a sum of $30,000 for our<lb/>
militia, and again are called on to pay for <lb/>
delegates to go home to tell the people of <lb/>
England what they know as well as
we <lb/>
do ? But I will go on " And whereas,
in the <lb/>
exercise of the right of internal self-go<lb break="no"/>vernment enjoyed by this Province, its <lb/>
people are entitled to deliberate
and de<lb break="no"/>cide upon all questions affecting
their <lb/>
own local interests in such
manner as to <lb/>
them may seem best calculated to pro<lb break="no"/>mote their prosperity and welfare, &amp;c." <lb/>
What evidence in there before the House <lb/>
that the British Government intend to de<lb break="no"/>prive us of Responsible Government, or <lb/>
self-government ? for this is the only in<lb break="no"/>ference that can be drawn from this pa<lb break="no"/>graph.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CUDL1">Mr. CUDLIP</persName>,—I
will just explain. It <lb/>
was contemplated to carry out the Union <lb/>
of the Colonies by chicanery, by
o joling. <lb/>
by deception, and by bribery in
high <lb/>
places, the same as it was in Ireland when <lb/>
she was united to England. But the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this Province were too wide awake <lb/>
for them, and decided against
their plot<lb break="no"/>ings.<lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>.—The hon. member <lb/>
says the country has decided against
Con<lb break="no"/>federation, and now I ask him to justify <lb/>
the grounds on which he asks the House
<lb/>
to send delegates home. If any thing
<lb/>
more is necessary why not shew by an <lb/>
Address to Her Majesty, or by sending <lb/>
home a copy of the public
Journals what <lb/>
has been the result,. After admitting that <lb/>
the vote of this House will be, to ask for<lb/>
delegates to he appointed, appears to me <lb/>
to be a very childish thing. The hon. <lb/>
member for Charlotte (Mr. Boyd)
says he <lb/>
is in favour of a Union of  the
Maritime <lb/>
Provinces. I would ask him what ad<lb break="no"/>vantages will this give us that the large<lb/>
one would not confer?<lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr.
MCMILLAN</persName>.—If it is an advantage <lb/>
to get into connection with 300,000 or <lb/>
400,000, would not the advantages be still <lb/>
greater if we were to join ourselves to <lb/>
3,000,000 or 4,000,000? It has been sta<lb break="no"/>ted that the delegates had no right to<lb/>
meet in Conference on a Union with the<lb/>
      
            <cb/>
    
other Colonies, when it is well known <lb/>
       
that by a despatch from the Imperial Go<lb break="no"/>vernment to the Governor of Nova Sco<lb break="no"/>tia on this question, power was
given <lb/>
to the Governor General to call <lb/>
them together for this very
purpose.<lb/>
Mr. Cardwell also says in his despatch <lb/>
to the Lieut. Governor, " with the <lb/>
sanction of the Crown. &amp;c.,
they as<lb break="no"/>sembled." But apart from all this I dis<lb break="no"/>sent from this objection on general prin<lb break="no"/>ciples. I believe that men should
meet <lb/>
together to confer upon subjects <lb/>
pertaining to the welfare of the <lb/>
whole of the Provinces. A great deal <lb/>
has been said about the manner in which <lb/>
the delegation was carried on ;
it is said <lb/>
they had champagne, and a jolly
time of <lb/>
it, and yet those who condemned the meet<lb break="no"/>ing of these delegates, want now to send <lb/>
other delegates home to go
through the <lb/>
same. But Mr. Cardwell's eulogy on the <lb/>
men who composed that delegation, and <lb/>
the manner in which they carried on their <lb/>
proceedings is quite sufficient
justification <lb/>
of the course pursued. What does <lb/>
he say ? " Animated by the warmest sen<lb break="no"/>timents of loyalty and devotion to their <lb/>
Sovereign, earnestly desirous to secure <lb/>
for their posterity throughout
all future <lb/>
time, the advantages which they enjoy as <lb/>
subjects of the British Crown ; steadfast<lb break="no"/>ly attached to the institutions under which <lb/>
they live, they have conducted
their deli<lb break="no"/>berations with patient sagacity, and have <lb/>
arrived at unanimous conclusions on ques<lb break="no"/>tions involving many difficulties,
and cal<lb break="no"/>culated under less favorable auspices to <lb/>
have given rise to many differences of <lb/>
opinion." Such an event is in the highest <lb/>
degree honorable to those who have taken <lb/>
part in these deliberations. It must
in<lb break="no"/>spire confidence in the men by
whose <lb/>
judgment and temper this result has been <lb/>
attained. Another ground taken by my <lb/>
hon. friend from Charlotte (Mr. Boyd.) <lb/>
was that our own men should not be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed to the Governor's chair. What! I <lb/>
would ask, is not the hon. President of the <lb/>
Council able to fill that position ? I say <lb/>
that we have men who are able not only <lb/>
to fill the office, but who are able to teach <lb/>
the Governors who are sent out to us, so <lb/>
that they go home better and wiser men <lb/>
than when they came out. But apart <lb/>
from this there are objects that should <lb/>
animate us with a spirit of progress. <lb/>
What is the cry of England? " Free trade, <lb/>
free trade with the world," and this should<lb/>
be our motto, not as I said the other day,<lb/>
to build a china wall around us and crop us<lb/>
up in our little egg shell, and call all outside<lb/>
of us barbarians. This is not the principle<lb/>
of the day ; this should not be our policy,<lb/>
but to enter into an alliance that will en<lb break="no"/>able us to have free trade with our neigh<lb break="no"/>bours ; and this Union of the Provinces,<lb/>
I maintain, would be commercially the<lb/>
best step we could take. I have already<lb/>
gone into the figures and shown that<lb/>
financially we should have been much bet<lb break="no"/>ter off, and I shall not now take up any<lb/>
more of the time of the House, but hold<lb/>
myself ready to answer any thing that<lb/>
may be brought up as the debate pro<lb break="no"/>ceeds.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon.
Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.—The hon. ex-Sur<lb break="no"/>veyor General has worked himself
up <lb/>
into a fervor on this subject, which I con<lb break="no"/>fess I do not experience. I feel an apathy <lb/>
and coldness on this question.,for so much <lb/>
has been said and heard upon it that all<lb/>
must be tired of it. The hon. member in <lb/>
all his long speech has brought out no<lb break="no"/>thing new—nothing but what has been re<lb break="no"/>futed a thousand times. Last Session<lb/>
this House appointed delegates to confer<lb/>
as to the feasibility of a Union of the<lb/>
 
            <cb/>    

Lower Provinces. They met at Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town, and although ostensibly deliberating<lb/>
a few days they did nothing but wait for<lb/>
the Canadian delegates to propose ano<lb break="no"/>ther Union. It is evident from the whole<lb/>
proceedings that they all went there pre<lb break="no"/>pared to go into the larger Scheme. The <lb/>
Canadians came down in a steamer, and <lb/>
then commenced a round of festivities <lb/>
which ended by giving to us a Scheme by <lb/>
which our rights and revenues were to be <lb/>
bartered away for ever. In the mean<lb break="no"/>time we find a most insignificant body in<lb/>
St. John—the Chamber of Commerce<lb break="no"/>insignificant in numbers and
influence<lb break="no"/>we find them set to work by some secret <lb/>
influence, inviting not any Commercial <lb/>
body like themselves, but the whole of <lb/>
the Legislature of Canada, on their own <lb/>
responsibility, to pay us a visit. We
<lb/>
know that when the invitation reached <lb/>
Canada the Legislature was in the last <lb/>
throes of dissolution. After awhile the <lb/>
matter was renewed, and some of the <lb/>
members of the new House came down. <lb/>
They were received with that hospitality <lb/>
and kindly treatment which strangers al<lb break="no"/>ways receive in St. John, and at
a dinner <lb/>
given in their honor at Stubbs' Hotel, <lb/>
although I did not wish to speak, I was <lb/>
called on, and in a most guarded manner <lb/>
told them that they need not imagine <lb/>
from the demonstrations of the people,<lb/>
that they were all in favor of a Union <lb/>
with Canada. The delegates, if such they <lb/>
may be called, for they only claim to <lb/>
have acted on a despatch which had been <lb/>
received from the Imperial Government <lb/>
some years before, when they returned <lb/>
from Canada soon let us know that false<lb break="no"/>hood and misrepresentation were the en<lb break="no"/>gines to be used in this country to for<lb break="no"/>ward the Scheme. We were at first told <lb/>
that the people were not to he informed <lb/>as to what had been done, till the Scheme <lb/>
had been sent to England, and come out<lb/>
again ; it would have been a breach of <lb/>
etiquette to let the people, who were most <lb/>
interested, know anything about it till it <lb/>
had been laid before the Imperial Cabi<lb break="no"/>net ; and there is no doubt at
all but that <lb/>
it was intended to withhold all particulars <lb/>
till the House met, and then to force it  <lb/>
through before time could be given for <lb/>
the people or their representatives to <lb/>
think on the matter. A gentleman who <lb/>
has done much for Confederation asked <lb/>
the Provincial Secretary whether
they <lb/>
intended to submit it to the people, or to <lb/>
push it through
the House, and he replied <lb/>
that it had not yet been decided. Ru<lb break="no"/>mour said that the question did come up <lb/>in the Council, and that Mr. McMillan <lb/>the then hon. Surveyor General was the <lb/>
only one who said it ought to be submit<lb break="no"/>ted. They then determined at once to <lb/>
dissolve the House. and have a new elec<lb break="no"/>tion. I think it is hardly fair
for those <lb/>
who then forced an election on the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and made the people travel
for miles <lb/>
through snow and mud to hear them ex<lb break="no"/>pound their pet Scheme, to charge their <lb/>
failure on the ignorance of the people, es<lb break="no"/>pecially as they did all they could to en<lb break="no"/>lighten them. Then the statements that <lb/>
were put forth by the different delegates <lb/>
were most contradictory. One of
them in <lb/>
Carleton County told the people that the <lb/>
Intercolonial Railroad was to come down <lb/>
past Woodstock, and another over at the <lb/>
North Shore made a very different state<lb break="no"/>ment, intimating it would come
by their <lb/>
doors. One said it would pass down the <lb/>
West Side of the River St. John, and <lb/>
another that it would take the Central <lb/>
route for the especial benefit King's.<lb/>
And even in St. John the two delegates <lb/>
on the same platform could not agree in <lb/>

<fw type="num">114</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> 
        
 their
statements. As manager of one of <lb/>
the City papers, I had to follow them day <lb/>
after day, and it was a very onerous duty,
<lb/>
in all their wanderings and contradictory<lb/>
statements. They told the people that <lb/>
all the benefit was to be ours, and Cana<lb break="no"/>da was going to confer the greatest boons <lb/>
of us. But it so happened that about <lb/>
that time Mr. Galt, the Finance Minister <lb/>
of Canada, addressed some of his people
<lb/>
on the subject, and it was published in <lb/>
pamphlet form. By mere accident
I ob<lb break="no"/>tained a copy, and there I found
Mr. Galt <lb/>
making the very same statement, namely, <lb/>
that Canada was to get all the
benefit, <lb/>
and he was right, whilst our delegates<lb/>
were wrong. Our tariffs were to be as-<lb break="yes"/>
simulated, and we were to become one <lb/>
great nation with liberty to trade from the <lb/>
Atlantic to Lake Huron. I will now go<lb/>
into a short statement which, altho' I have<lb/>
not the exact figures before me,
are suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently near to prove the inaccuracies of <lb/>
the statement made by the hon.
member <lb/>
from Restigouche. In 1863 Canada
had <lb/>
a debt of over a million of dollars. We <lb/>
were to have a great Legislature
of 194<lb/>
members, and all its operations were to<lb/>
be carried on without any more expense <lb/>
than at present. The number of
mem<lb break="no"/>bers increased from 41 to 194—a
hovel <lb/>
exchanged for a palace—a great British <lb/>
North American Nationalty—and all at <lb/>
the same expense as now. Then there <lb/>
was the eighty cents a head. Now this <lb/>
is a paltry sum to us, but I find
that to <lb/>
the Canadians it would be more then their <lb/>
expenditure by about a million of dollars. <lb/>
This added to the debt makes $2 000,000. <lb/>
This amount would have to be made up <lb/>
in excess of our own revenues.
In addi<lb break="no"/>tion to this there was to be a
largely in<lb break="no"/>creased expense for militia. The whole <lb/>
Provinces were to be armed and put in a
<lb/>
complete state of defence at a
cost of $1,<lb break="no"/>000,000. This was the sum put
forth in <lb/>
Canada. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick <lb/>
as the cost of putting us in a
complete <lb/>
state to defend ourselves
against the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States, and it only met with
deserved <lb/>
ridicule. Then there was our revenue <lb/>
another milllion, and that makes
$4,000,<lb break="no"/>000, without providing for their
extended <lb/>
works, canals, &amp;c., which
were as much <lb/>
a part of the Scheme as anything else.<lb/>
And yet in view of all this we had gentle<lb break="no"/>men who came before the public and sta<lb break="no"/>ted that our expenditure was to bo redu<lb break="no"/>ced. The taxation was to be lowered <lb/>
from $3 to $2
75 ; I am happy to say that <lb/>
our people refused to be
humbugged by <lb/>
such a statement. This was one
of the <lb/>
misrepresentations. Mr. Galt took the <lb/>
same ground, and it was doubtless pre<lb break="no"/>pared by him. He told the Canadians <lb/>
that the Canadian tariff would be enough
<lb/>
to meet all the expenses, that we should <lb/>
have to bear 2? per cent more, and Nova <lb/>
Scotia 7? per cent more. There the <lb/>
Canadian tariff was to be lowered to 17?
<lb/>
per cent, and thus all was to be assimula<lb break="no"/>ted. The hon. ex-Surveyor General did <lb/>
not take into consideration what the effect <lb/>
of the increase of our tariff would be. <lb/>
Why it would give us an increase of duty <lb/>
on tea, excise duties, and the stamp
act. <lb/>
Applying the tariff of Canada to ours we
<lb/>
should have to pay $250,000. The hon. <lb/>
Mr. Tilley tried to controvert
my state<lb break="no"/>ment when I made it, and he stated that <lb/>
it was only $211,000. With a tariff of<lb/>
twenty per cent in Canada they pay less <lb/>
per head than we do. We went into
an <lb/>
account of the dutiable articles, and it was <lb/>
said that we use more than they do. It
<lb/>
was said, why look here, the
people of Can<lb break="no"/>ada useless
sugar than.we do ; but if they <lb/>
had gone a
little
further they
would
have <lb/>
      
            <cb/>      
     
seen that in molasses we use nine gallons<lb/>
to their one. This was the style of the<lb/>
misrepresentations. Since 1863 the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians have had to impose a much higher<lb/>
tariff, and yet in spite of all, their deficit<lb/>
is larger than ever before. This was the<lb/>
people we were asked to unite with to be<lb break="no"/>come prosperous. The hon. member says<lb/>
that they were to assume the interest of<lb/>
our debt, but then they were also to take<lb/>
all our revenues except our Crown Lands.<lb/>
They too were to take the liability of all<lb/>
our Railway works under the Facility<lb/>
Bill, and well they might, for they never<lb/>
imagined it would amount to anything.<lb/>
and knew that nothing would ever have<lb/>
been paid. With regard to the eighty<lb/>
cents a head, it is well known that in<lb break="no"/>crease as we may, we could never get any<lb/>
more. The hon. gentleman argues that<lb/>
we can't have the Railway without Con<lb break="no"/>federation, when I have shown that we<lb/>
should have had about $80,000 more for<lb/>
public works without it than we could get<lb/>
in it. </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. McMILLAN</persName>.—Did
not Mr.
Tilley<lb/>
show that the difference in duty
on spirits,<lb/>
and the duty on ship's
materials, would<lb/>
equal
the amount he named ?  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon.
Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.—He did try to cut<lb/>
it down in his own peculiar way. He <lb/>
tried to show that we would gain
some <lb/>
tried to show that we would gain some<lb/>
$100,000 by assimilating our tariff to the<lb/>
Canadian free list. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>.—Taking
the importa<lb break="no"/>tion of 1863 in each Province, the
average<lb/>
in Canada is 11 per cent., and here it is
a<lb/>
little over 10 per cent. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName> —But the right
way <lb/>
is to take up the separate articles,
and<lb/>
show that even $1,000 will be saved. much.<lb/>
The hon. member, in speaking of the<lb/>
Post Office savings, said nothing about<lb/>
the tax on papers and stamps on news<lb break="no"/>papers. The statement that we should<lb/>
not have the Canadian tariff is
perfectly<lb/>
absurd, and I could show it in half an <lb/>
hour if it were necessary. We were told <lb/>
that we were to be relieved from a num<lb break="no"/>ber of things, as if we were some pauper
<lb/>
on bended knee
supplicating the assist<lb break="no"/>ance of some
wealthy neighbor. But first<lb/>
they were to relieve us of our revenue, <lb/>
and then to pay these various sums, while  <lb/>
they made a nice little commission out of
<lb/>
the operation. Then one of the prettiest <lb/>
little dodges of the Scheme was, that<lb/>
Canada would very obligingly and kindly<lb/>
give on $63,000 for ten years. PRO-VID-ED<lb/>
that we spent a certain sum on
Western . <lb/>
Extension, which the very sagely and <lb/>
wisely believed would never be paid. <lb/>
Even in
their own statements the $63,000<lb/>
soon faded out, and was not put forward<lb/>
again. The Upper Canadians have
strong<lb/>
proclivities towards annexation, because<lb/>
they do their business with the
United<lb/>
States, and would rather send
their pro<lb break="no"/>duce to their markets than to England.<lb/>
Politically, we should have to start
in this<lb/>
Scheme with fifteen members in a House <lb/>
of 194. Our increase is somewhat great<lb break="no"/>er than in Lower Canada, but so little<lb/>
that many years must elapse before we<lb/>
should get any increase of
members. <lb/>
Nova Scotia does
not increase quite as <lb/>
fast as Lower Canada, and so she would<lb/>
gradually lose, while Prince
Edward<lb/>
Island would soon dwindle down to
one ;<lb/>
while Canada West
would increase so <lb/>
rapidly that in twenty-five years the num<lb break="no"/>ber would be equal, it not
superior, to all<lb/>
the rest. The interest
of what is now <lb/>
called Central Canada—and which it. is<lb/>
probable will become a province of itself<lb/>
—is
identical with that of Canada
West, <lb/>
and would go with them in any matter <lb/>
affecting them. Montreal
is the natural

            <cb/>
         
centre of trade, and that is in direct com<lb break="no"/>munication with Portland. Then, con<lb break="no"/>flicting with that port on the one hand<lb/>
and with Halifax on the other, what a<lb/>
contemptible position we should be in.<lb/>
Talk about our fifteen members being<lb/>
able to do anything ; they could do just<lb/>
nothing at all. See how it is in Cana<lb break="no"/>da now. The difficulties existing there<lb/>
were no doubt the bottom of the whole<lb/>
Scheme, they hoping that these difficulties<lb/>
would be forgot in a larger Union ; and<lb/>
when Mr. Brown crossed the floors of the<lb/>
House and joined with Mr. Cartier, he<lb/>
did it to bring about a great political<lb/>
change, and that was to crush out the<lb/>
spirit of Lower Canada. This much for<lb/>
the financial and political points ; now<lb/>
for the commercial aspect. I know that<lb/>
one of the greatest difficulties we had to<lb/>
combat in St. John was the argument<lb/>
that the markets of all Canada would be<lb/>
open to our manufacturers. The parties<lb/>
who were manipulating this affair got up<lb/>
a manifesto of the manufacturers, which<lb/>
was not prepared by a manufacturer, and<lb/>
by dint of getting it sent round by some<lb/>
dry goods clerks in the rain, they man<lb break="no"/>aged to get ninety-one names to it. Of<lb/>
those on the list some were bakers, who<lb/>
it was presumed, would be able to get<lb/>
their wheat down from Canada, manufac<lb break="no"/>ture into hot rolls, and send them back to<lb/>
Canada for sale.—tombstone makers. (a<lb/>
rather equivocal interest,)—house carpen<lb break="no"/>ters, one was a lumber dealer, who sur<lb break="no"/>veys and looks after logs on the river St.<lb/>
John ; one was a mason, and one whose<lb/>
name was down twice, in all ninety-one<lb/>
men. So this argument did not avail<lb/>
much. Mr. Lawrence delivered one of<lb/>
the most able lectures on the subject, and<lb/>
quite clearly showed the absurdity of<lb/>
people imagining that the Canadiens were<lb/>
such fools and dolts that they could neither<lb/>
make anything, nor imitate anything. I<lb/>
think many of the people have seen their<lb/>
delusion, and I am not willing to admit<lb/>
with my hon friend that Confederation is<lb/>
gaining ground. Why, I am told that<lb/>
Canadian iron and other wares sell at<lb/>
Little Falls at lower prices than they can<lb/>
be go from St. John. My colleague (Mr.<lb/>
Cudlip) has handed me a comparative list<lb/>
of manufactures in Canada in the years<lb/>
1863 and 1864 :—</p>

<fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> <fw type="num">115</fw>
         
   <p> Thus in
manufactures we shall have <lb/>
little chance with them. But this is but <lb/>
one phase of the commercial
view. I <lb/>
have heard lectures on this subject, and <lb/>
as I have heard them talk about
free <lb/>
trade with Canada, I have asked
myself <lb/>
are these people such fools as
not to <lb/>
know that if Canada wants to get
coal <lb/>
from Pictou they are free to do it as <lb/>
they can possibly be. People forget<lb/>
that there is perfect free trade between<lb/>
us and Canada. This cry about free<lb/>
trade is not the reason why Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is wanted, but an hon.
member of  <lb/>
the Canadian Legislature has
explained<lb/>
the whole matter, when he alleged as <lb/>
one of the advantages of Union
to Cana<lb break="no"/>da, that they would be able to say to the <lb/>
States, we will not only close
the St. <lb/>
Lawrence against you, but
prevent you <lb/>
from sending down your flour and beef <lb/>
and pork to St. John, and the other <lb/>
ports of the Lower Provinces, unless
<lb/>
you come to our terms. Are we thus <lb/>
to be made the cats-paw for Canada? <lb/>
are we to be mere make-weights
be<lb break="no"/>tween Canada and the United States? <lb/>
Are we to have all these articles shut
<lb/>
out from us just that Canada may make <lb/>
us consume her corn and pork at
im<lb break="no"/>mensely higher prices? Great
Britain <lb/>
makes treaties with the United States, <lb/>
but she always asks our opinion
about <lb/>
them, and whether they will affect us. <lb/>
When the Reciprocity Treaty was sign<lb break="no"/>ed. Parliament was called
together to <lb/>
deliberate on it, but here we are to have
 <lb/>
no voice all. Just think of our 15 <lb/>
men standing up among the 194 ; sup<lb break="no"/>pose they all stand together for their <lb/>
rights, and against a great wrong, I<lb/>
think I hear the Canadians saying, <lb/>
" you came into this great union
of your <lb/>
own free will, you have reaped the
ad- <lb break="yes"/>
advantages of the alliance, and
now when <lb/>
difficulties come you must bear
them or <lb/>
do the best you can." It is said that <lb/>
union is strength, and we had it illus<lb break="no"/>trated in different ways down in St. John <lb/>
at the last elections, but I think we al<lb break="no"/>ready have a union that is strong enough
; <lb/>
we are united to Great Britain, and I do <lb/>
not think they desire to sever the
band <lb/>
that unites us. Look at the map
and <lb/>
see how New Brunswick and Canada <lb/>
run up round the State of Maine
like an <lb/>
ox bow ; for some distance the strip of <lb/>
land is not more than twenty miles
wide, <lb/>
and is the bond that binds us to Canada, <lb/>
a link that an American troop of
dra<lb break="no"/>goons could snap in a day ; and to de<lb break="no"/>fend that place or any other there would <lb/>
be no more difficulty in turning
out an <lb/>
available force at the request
of Great <lb/>
Britain, than by a command from Otta<lb break="no"/>wa. One remark about the delegation
<lb/>
to England ; all delegations in the past <lb/>
have been subject to ridicule, and I sup<lb break="no"/>pose that others
will be, but my hon. <lb/>
friend is the first of his party who I have <lb/>
heard admit, for one moment, that the <lb/>
country has decided on the question
of <lb/>
Confederation finally and conclusively.
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>.—I
said the resolution <lb/>
say the country has
decided on it.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName> —Do
you deny that <lb/>
the question is decided on conclusively?
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>.—I simply said that<lb/>
the resolution states that the
country has<lb/>
decided on it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.—Well,
if there is <lb/>
to be quibbling let it pass. The
Times, <lb/>
a paper not easy to control, states that <lb/>
in this Province there was only a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 455 against Confederation. <lb/>
We, Mr. Chairman, could not get such <lb/>
a statement inserted, and much
less <lb/>
could we get it made the basis of a
lead<lb break="no"/><cb/>ing article, yet influences are at work <lb/>
to bring this about, and the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Saturday <lb/>
Review</hi> reiterates the same falsehood and <lb/>
calumny ; when in the County of York <lb/>
alone there are over 900 majority
against <lb/>
it. Does this mean nothing? Is it not<lb/>
done for some sinister purpose? When <lb/>
I see Mr. Cartier stating at Fishmonger's <lb/>
Hall that they had come to induce the <lb/>
people of England to carry out that<lb/>
scheme, I think it is time we did some<lb break="no"/>thing to counteract such scheming and<lb/>
falsehood. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> says again,
that <lb/>
these gentlemen from Canada went <lb/>
down to Halifax and were received by <lb/>
every demonstration of respect,
and <lb/>
that several influential
gentlemen from <lb/>
New Brunswick were also there to re<lb break="no"/>ceive them. I say that is false. When <lb/>
I see Mr. Cartier, after interview
with <lb/>
Lord Palmerston, stating that
all is go<lb break="no"/>ing on well, think it is time we
were <lb/>
heard in Downing Street too. I do not <lb/>
wish to say that the feeling or desire to <lb/>
coerce us into this scheme is felt by any <lb/>
in this House, but when I hear
an hon<lb break="no"/>orable member say that Confederation <lb/>
is gaining ground, and that it may be <lb/>
carried in six months ; and when
I hear <lb/>
another gentleman in the other
branch <lb/>
say that the reason why Confederation
<lb/>
failed was on account of the sins
of the <lb/>
late Government, and was never pro<lb break="no"/>perly tested ; I say, when hear this, I<lb/>
warn these hon. gentlemen that
they are <lb/>
playing into the hands of the greatest
<lb/>
conspirators against the prosperity and <lb/>
happiness of this Province.<lb/>

<!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

<!--<p>THURSDAY, June 1.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. COSTIGAN.—It
has been stated by <lb/>
the hon. member from Restigouche
(Mr.<lb/>
McMillan ) that the more the people be<lb break="no"/>came acquainted with this Confederation
<lb/>
Scheme the better
they would like it. <lb/>
Now, if the Government really thought it<lb/>
was a good
Scheme they should not have <lb/>
been afraid of having it discussed. What<lb break="no"/>ever the intention of the Government may <lb/>
have been, the facts show they
did not <lb/>
want the people to become acquainted<lb/>
with the Scheme. If that had not
been <lb/>
the case they could have brought it up <lb/>
before the House, and then referred it to <lb/>
the country at the general election : peo<lb break="no"/>ple then could have all the information
to<lb/>
be derived from the
correspondence with<lb/>
the additional information which they<lb/>
would have gained by the question being<lb/>
debated on the floors of the House. This<lb/>
would have put the matter in a fair light ;<lb/>
but I believe the Government did not<lb/>
have confidence enough in it themselves<lb/>
to bring it before the House, for they did<lb/>
not think they could carry it through. If<lb/>
the Government had been really strong,<lb/>
they would have been more cautious, but<lb/>
they were growing weaker every day, and<lb/>
unless something was done they would go<lb/>
over board. They thought this was a<lb/>
chance to keep them in a position they<lb/>
were anxious to retain. If they allowed<lb/>
the House of Assembly to meet again,<lb/>
they did not see how they could fight<lb/>
their way through the Session. In order<lb/>
to retain their power they took up this<lb/>
Scheme, and they thought it might place<lb/>
them in a higher position than before.<lb/>
There was always a bait held out to every<lb/>
man of influence, to induce him to sup<lb break="no"/>port the Scheme. A great deal has been<lb/>
said about the position we would occupy<lb/>
in the general Government. I have al<lb break="no"/>ways contended that it would be dange<lb break="no"/>rous to place ourselves in the hands<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>of the Confederacy. Some will say this<lb/>
is a narrow minded view, and we ought<lb/>
not to be afraid, for we would
have even<lb break="no"/>handed justice. I read in a Canadian <lb/>
newspaper the opinion of a leading
man <lb/>
in that country on a Union of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces before this Scheme was<lb/>
brought up. He said in case a
Union of <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces took place, Nova <lb/>
Scotia would absord the influence of New <lb/>
Brunswick. If that would be the case in
<lb/>
this smaller union, how much
more would <lb/>
this influence be absorbed in this greater<lb/>
majority of this grand Union ? Is it re-<lb break="maybe"/>
sonable to suppose that a better feeling <lb/>
will
exist between New Brunswick and <lb/>
Canada than among the people of New <lb/>
Brunswick themselves ? I
remember <lb/>
when a Bill was brought in
to increase <lb/>
the representation of certain Counties, <lb/>
there was a strong feeling in
the House <lb/>
to support it, because it had especial re<lb break="no"/>ference to the County of Carleton, as it<lb/>
was thought it ought to be entitled to one
<lb/>
additional representative. When
the vote <lb/>
was taken on that question, the
principle <lb/>
part of the members of the North were <lb/>
against it. That feeling of antagonism <lb/>
has always existed between the
two sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the Province, and they
are afraid <lb/>
to extend the power on either side. In <lb/>
view of this, are we prepared to give an <lb/>
overwhelming majority to Upper
Canada <lb/>
and trust to their liberality in
dealing <lb/>
with us ? In regard to trade,
when we are <lb/>
able to stock our own market, it will be <lb/>
time enough to look forward to
increase <lb/>
the market. That time has hardly arriv<lb break="no"/>ed. In reading a statement
made in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the result of the election, and <lb/>
the votes for and against the
Scheme, I <lb/>
have to state that statement does
not <lb/>
show the whole of the anti-Confederate <lb/>
vote in the Province. I think it it
due to <lb/>
myself, as well as to the
constituency of <lb/>
the County of Victoria to state that there <lb/>
was not one vote polled for
Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in that County. <lb/>
            </p>




            <p> Hon. Mr. HATHEWAY.—I
will be very <lb/>
brief, inasmuch as I am almost
afraid to <lb/>
speak upon any subject, because every <lb/>
advantage is taken of any remarks
which <lb/>I make. I can state my reasons
for <lb/>
opposing Confederation without casting<lb/>
any more reflection on any gentlemen <lb/>
who may differ from me in
opinion <lb/>
than is absolutely necessary in my own <lb/>
defence. At the last Session of the <lb/>
Legislature resolutions were brought in<lb/>
by the Provincial Secretary seeking for<lb/>
a Union of the Maritime Provinces. It <lb/>
was distinctly stated here that the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary asked for no further <lb/>
authority than to go to Prince Edward <lb/>
Island and meet the
delegates from Nova<lb/>
Scotia and they had no authority to enter<lb/>
into any negotiations,
for the matter was <lb/>
to be submitted to the House. I little <lb/>
expected when we consented to the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of that delegation that a mi<lb break="no"/>nority of the Executive Council would<lb/>
have gone to Canada and agreed to a<lb/>
proposition to unite these Colonies. I<lb/>
take the broad ground and put it forth<lb/>
without fear of contradiction, that when<lb/>
that Conference met at Quebec, there<lb/>
could be no doubt, from the language<lb/>
used by the delegates, that it was to be<lb/>
adjudicated upon by the late Legislature.<lb/>
If the Government of which I was a mem<lb break="no"/>ber, had been sufficiently strong to have<lb/>
carried that measure through the House<lb/>
they would have done so. It has been <lb/>
said that I had foresight enough to see<lb/>
what. would be the result of the election,
<lb/>
but I assert and can prove that six hours <lb/>
after I saw the resolutions of
the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, I took a strong objection
to them. <lb/>
