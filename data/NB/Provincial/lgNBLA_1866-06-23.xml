            </p>
   
            <p>
     HON. MR. WILMOT would ask the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Charlotte, who had read<lb/>
     the petition (Mr. Chandler), if Mr. Cud- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     lip was in Fredericton, that he so soon 
     <lb/>
     knew of the appointment which had been 
     <lb/>
     made. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOHN1">MR. JOHNSON</persName> replied that he was 
     <lb/>
     not, but was represented by his attorney, 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Fraser. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">HON. MR. FISHER</persName> said although he 
     <lb/>was opposed to receiving any petition,<lb/>yet this was informal, inasmuch as it<lb/>was addressed not to the House of<lb/>Assembly, against whose action the pro<lb break="no"/>test was entered, but to His Excellency<lb/>the Lieutenant Governor and the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. He did not see how, under these<lb/>circumstances, the House could take cog<lb break="no"/>nizance of the matter.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:STEV1">MR. STEVENS</persName> explained that the peti<lb break="no"/>tion was not against the return of Mr. Gray<lb/>as a member of the House, but against his<lb/>appointment as Speaker, a matter with<lb/>which the petitioner had nothing to do,<lb/>and for which there is not law at all appli<lb break="no"/>cable.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:JOHN1">MR. JOHNSON</persName> said if the petition 
     <lb/>
     was refused it would not appear on the 
     <lb/>
     journals, and its folly might not be known, 
     <lb/>
     whilst the reference to it which must ne<lb break="no"/>cessarily be made might lead some to im<lb break="no"/>agine that there was something in it the 
     <lb/>
     member of the House did not wish to 
     <lb/>
     come to light. Having laid it on the ta<lb break="no"/>ble, they could let it lay there, or throw 
     <lb/>
     it under, as they saw proper, but the 
     <lb/>
     right of petition was sacred and should 
     <lb/>
     not be refused. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The petition was then received and 
     <lb/>
     laid on the table. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion of MR. KERR it was re<lb break="no"/>solved to go into consideration of the 
     <lb/>
     Address in Reply to the Speech on Sat<lb break="no"/>urday morning, immediately after the 
     <lb/>
     reading of the Journals. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion of MR. KERR it was or<lb break="no"/>dered that 200 copies each of the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress and Reply be printed for the use of 
     <lb/>
     the House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. MR. TILLEY informed the House 
     <lb/>
     that as there was no Committee to report 
     <lb/>
     on the Debates, he was prepared to state 
     <lb/>
     that Messrs. John March and T. P. Dix<lb break="no"/>on were present, and prepared to report 
     <lb/>the proceedings of the House for the<lb/>sum of $150 each for a session of 20<lb/>
    days, and pro rata afterwards ; and that 
     <lb/>Mr. G. W. Day was also prepared to print 
     <lb/>the Debates on the same terms as last Ses<lb break="no"/>sion, and he would therefore move that 
     <lb/>these tenders be accepted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The Resolution was adopted. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion it was ordered that 7000 
     <lb/>
      copies of the debates be printed for gene<lb break="no"/>ral distribution. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     On motion it was ordered that 2000 co<lb break="no"/>pies of the Journels be printed for gene<lb break="no"/>ral circulation.

     The House then adjourned till Satur<lb break="no"/>day evening at 10 o'clock.

     After the Journals were read the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the House who were absent on

     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> moved the following reso<lb break="no"/>lution:â€”" That all local bills which by 
     <lb/>
     the Journals of last Session appear to have 
     <lb/>
     been introduced into this House be al<lb break="no"/>lowed to be received this Session without 
     <lb/>
     requiring that such bills should be pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the local papers or read before 
     <lb/>the Grand Jury." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:JOHN1">MR. JOHNSON</persName> said this appeared to 
     <lb/>
     be a general invitaiion for local bills to 
     <lb/>
     be presented. It would be the best way 
     <lb/>
     to suspend the rule in each individual 
     <lb/>
     case ; for there should be no local legisla<lb break="no"/>tion at all this Session except in extreme 
     <lb/>
     cases.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> said that there were seve<lb break="no"/>ral important local bills to come before 
     <lb/>
     the House, particularly from St. John, 
     <lb/>
     and to let them stand over until next year 
     <lb/>
     would cause great inconvenience. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAN1">MR. CHANDLER</persName> thought they should 
     <lb/>
     postpone all the business they could until 
     <lb/>
     a future session, and only legislate upon 
     <lb/>
     such bills as were urgently required. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">MR. CAIE</persName> remarked that he had 
     <lb/>
    brought in a bill during the last session of 
     <lb/>the Legislature praying for the division of 
     <lb/>a Parish in the County of Kent. This 
     <lb/>bill had been advertised for four weeks, 
     <lb/>but had not been presented. He wished 
     <lb/>to know whether it would have to be 
     <lb/>again advertised. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     His Honor <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">the SPEAKER</persName> said the 
     <lb/>
     rule did not specify that a bill should be 
     <lb/>
     advertised during the four weeks imme<lb break="no"/>diately preceding the meeting of the 
     <lb/>
     House. It would be for the House to 
     <lb/>
     say whether the rule had been complied 
     <lb/>
     with or not.

            </p>

     <persName ref="pers:RYAN1">MR. RYAN</persName> movedâ€”"That for the 
     <lb/>
     purpose of giving information of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of the House the number of 
     <lb/>copies of the Debates ordered to be pub<lb break="no"/>lished be increased from 7,000 to 10,000." 
     <lb/>He believed this was the most important 
     <lb/>Session ever held in New Brunswick, as 
     <lb/>measures were to come before them in<lb break="no"/>volving a change in their Constitution. 
     <lb/>The question upon which they were to 
     <lb/>legislate was one in which the people take 
     <lb/>a great interest, and which had moved 
     <lb/>the whole country from its centre to its<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

circumference. As the expense of the<lb/>increased number of debates was so small,<lb/>being only $4.50 per thousand, and the<lb/>importance of the measures to be intro<lb break="no"/>duced was so great it was desirable to<lb/>have this increased number.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The question was then taken, and the

     <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">MR. BOTSFORD</persName> said he did not op<lb break="no"/>pose going on with the order of the day, 
     <lb/>
     but he thought it a matter of courtesy 
     <lb/>
     due to the leader of the late Government, 
     <lb/>
     who was unavoidably absent, that the 
     <lb/>
     consideration of the answer to His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's Speech should be postponed until 
     <lb/>
     Monday, He (Mr. Smith) would be here 
     <lb/>
     to-night. Questions may arise during 
     <lb/>
     the discussion which it would be neces<lb break="no"/>sary for him to answer, therefore, they 
     <lb/>
     should as a matter of courtesy adjourn the 
     <lb/>
     debate until Monday, particularly as it 
     <lb/>
     has been the usual course to take up this 
     <lb/>
     subject on that day. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Hon. MR. FISHER</persName> said he did not 
     <lb/>
     want to take advantage of any one, he did 
     <lb/>
     not see that any discussion would arise 
     <lb/>
     which would affect the leeder of the late 
     <lb/>
     Government. They should press the 
     <lb/>
     business forward as fast as possible. 
     <lb/>
     This was the third day of the Session, 
     <lb/>
     and in short sessions, the address was 
     <lb/>
     generally taken up on the second or third 
     <lb/>
     day. He wished to give notice of a reso<lb break="no"/>lution on the subject of Union, and 
     <lb/>
     also to give notice (in the absence of the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Secretary) of supply. The 
     <lb/>
     public business of the country requires 
     <lb/>
     His Excellency to go up the River on 
     <lb/>
     military matters next week ; they there<lb break="no"/>fore could not delay the consideration of 
     <lb/>
    this address. He would put it to the 
     <lb/>House, whether the Government would be 
     <lb/>justified in doing so. He could not con<lb break="no"/>sent to this delay, and he hoped they 
     <lb/>would not be considered uncourteous in 
     <lb/>pressing on the business of the country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> said that he observed in 
     <lb/>
     the journals of 1857 that the House met 
     <lb/>
     on Wednesday the 24th of June, attended 
     <lb/>
     to the routine of business, elected a 
     <lb/>
     Speaker, and on the 25th of June at 2 
     <lb/>
     o'clock they presented the address in 
     <lb/>
     answer to the Speech. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The motion was then carried, after 
     <lb/>
     which His Honor <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">the SPEAKER</persName> read 
     <lb/>
     part of the proposed address, whenâ€”

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">MR. BOTSFORD</persName> remarked that there 
     <lb/>
     had been a slight alteration in the phrase<lb break="no"/>ology. He did not know by what parlia<lb break="no"/>mentary rule an address was altered after 
     <lb/>
     it had been published and laid upon the

     table. If any alterations were necessary,

     been apprised of it, and they should have 
     <lb/>
     been made with the Speaker in the chair.

            </p>

            <p>
     His Honor <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">the SPEAKER</persName> said the 
     <lb/>
     time to make those observations would be 
     <lb/>
     when the address was read by paragraph. 
     <lb/>
     When this was done he hoped his honor<lb break="no"/>able friend would be able to state the 
     <lb/>character of the alterations that had been 
     <lb/>made. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The address was then read, after which 
     <lb/>
     upon motion of <persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. Kerr</persName> it was read by 
     <lb/>
     paragraph. The first paragraph passed 
     <lb/>
     unanimously. Upon the reading of the 
     <lb/>
     second paragraphâ€”

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">MR. BOTSFORD</persName> said he did not rise

     These two paragraphs refer principal<lb break="no"/>ly to the Address of the Legislative 
     <lb/>
     Council and its reception by Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty the Queen, and to the inconvenient 
     <lb/>
     season of the year at which the House 
     <lb/>had been called together. After viewing<lb/>
    what took place during the last sitting 
     <lb/>of the Legislature which was familiar 
     <lb/>to most of them ; he could not say he 
     <lb/>was pleased that the Address of the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council had been transmitted 
     <lb/>to Her Majesty the Queen. Although he 
     <lb/>did not deny the right of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council to express an opinion in re<lb break="no"/>ference to the Quebec Scheme, or to 
     <lb/>any kind of Union, if they thought pro<lb break="no"/>per ; yet he believed they transcended 
     <lb/>their powers when they prayed Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty to pass an Imperial Act on this 
     <lb/>question without any reference to the 
     <lb/>action of the Lower House. These 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
           

     were the views which he expressed to his 
     <lb/>
     constituents, and he was bound to ex<lb break="no"/>press them here. The third paragraph 
     <lb/>
     goes on to say that the proceedings 
     <lb/>
     which took place led to a dissolution of 
     <lb/>
     the House. It was admitted by His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency that his late advisers were not 
     <lb/>
     consulted ; as an excuse for this, he says 
     <lb/>
     it was a matter of accident. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Botsford) held that His Excellency's 
     <lb/>
     not consulting with his advisers was 
     <lb/>
     subversive of their Provincial Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion. His not having done so, caused 
     <lb/>
     the resignation of his advisers. Ano<lb break="no"/>ther part in that paragraph he could 
     <lb/>
     not assent to was: "We believe the 
     <lb/>
     constituencies of the Province have jus<lb break="no"/>tified the course adopted by Your Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency." That is not correct. It does 
     <lb/>
     not state a majority of the constituen<lb break="no"/>cies, but includes the whole ; therefore 
     <lb/>
     it states what cannot be substantiated, 
     <lb/>
     for the Counties of Westmorland, Glou<lb break="no"/>cester and Kent have not justified the 
     <lb/>
     course pursued by His Excellency.

     Take that answer without any refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the Speech, and it would not

     be so very objectionable ; but when they 
     <lb/>
     compared it with the paragraph in the

     Speech, it was not consistent, and he 
     <lb/>

     The answer, taken in connection with 
     <lb/>
     that paragraph, not only binds us to con<lb break="no"/>cur in the mode by which that resolu<lb break="no"/>tion in favor of Union was accomplished 
     <lb/>
     in Nova Scotia ; but it goes further, and 
     <lb/>
     binds us to assent to any measure which 
     <lb/>
     may be proposed to secure that object. 
     <lb/>
     He was not prepared to assent to that 
     <lb/>
     doctrine. The mode by which it was ac<lb break="no"/>complished in Nova Scotia was not con<lb break="no"/>stitutional. It may be urged on the 
     <lb/>
     other side that the people are represent<lb break="no"/>ed by the House of Assembly. This, as 
     <lb/>
     a general principle, may be correct, but 
     <lb/>
     when you find that the constitution of a 
     <lb/>
     country is to be altered, and those mem<lb break="no"/>

bers who have passed upon it were elect<lb break="no"/>ed by the constituencies of Nova Scotia

     before it was even thought of, you must 
     <lb/>
     say that it is not a correct principle to 
     <lb/>
     act upon in that case. When they pre<lb break="no"/>sume to alter the constitution without 
     <lb/>
    giving the people a voice in it, we are 
     <lb/>going beyond our duty and powers to 
     <lb/>confirm it. He could not see upon what 
     <lb/>ground they were asked to strengthen 
     <lb/>the position of a party in a sister colony. 
     <lb/>These were the reasons why he opposed 
     <lb/>the passage of those three paragraphs,

     <persName ref="pers:JOHN1">MR. JOHNSON</persName> said he was astonish<lb break="no"/>ed that a professional man with the stand<lb break="no"/>ing of his learned friend from Westmor<lb break="no"/>land would talk of the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil exceeding their constitutional rights 
     <lb/>
     when they addressed the Crown, and 
     <lb/>
     asked for Imperial legislation upon this 
     <lb/>
     question. Does he mean to say that 
     <lb/>
     they have not the right to ask for Impe<lb break="no"/>rial legislation ? Does he mean to say 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Legislature would take ac<lb break="no"/>tion on the subject without our concur<lb break="no"/>rence ? They ask for this legislation, 
     <lb/>
     presuming that the people would also 
     <lb/>
     ask. My hon. friend says they transcen<lb break="no"/>ded their duty. What rights have this 
     <lb/>
     House more than the Upper House, ex<lb break="no"/>cept the initiation of money grants ? Let 
     <lb/>
     us trace the origin of the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons. It was first originated in 1269, 
     <lb/>
     and in 1295 the Lords and Commons sat 
     <lb/>
     in the same room and voted together, 
     <lb/>
    and it took majority of both Houses to<lb break="no"/>gether to carry a measure. They were  
     <lb/>not seperate branches at all. If we deny 
     <lb/>the rights of the Upper House, we might  
     <lb/>as well abolish it altogether. The 
     <lb/>House of Lords has been a protection to 
     <lb/>the country, and their rights are the same 
     <lb/>se the rights of the Lower House, except 
     <lb/>the initiation of money grants. When 
     <lb/>the tariff increased with the increase of 
     <lb/>trade and commerce, the interests of the 
     <lb/>people became a source of revenue, and 
     <lb/>the House of Commons claimed this right 
     <lb/>and it was assented to. For many years 
     <lb/>previously the Lords and the Commons 
     <lb/>each granted their subsidies upon the 
     <lb/>property over which they had control. 
     <lb/>For a long time after this right was given 
     <lb/>up, the House of Lords maintained their 
     <lb/>right to alter and amend bills of that 
     <lb/>kind, but finally this right was also given 
     <lb/>up. The House of Lords has now no 
     <lb/>right to alter or amend those bills, but 
     <lb/>simply to accept or reject them. He 
     <lb/>called npon his hon. friend, as a lawyer  
     <lb/>and a statesman, to point out in the his<lb break="no"/>tory of their country any rights possessed 
     <lb/>by the House of Commons, further than 
     <lb/>has been stated, that were different from 
     <lb/>those possessed by the House of Lords. 
     <lb/>They each have the right to originate 
     <lb/>bills. A bill was originated in our Upper

     House to alter the representation of our 
     <lb/>
     country. This was a bill which they had 
     <lb/>
     no interest in. They sent it down here, 
     <lb/>
     and there was no objection raised To its 
     <lb/>
     reception. This House received that 
     <lb/>
     bill, and it was read a first and second 
     <lb/>
     time. No member asked to have it laid 
     <lb/>
     before the Committee on Privileges. The 
     <lb/>
     reason the question was not taken upon 
     <lb/>
     t was because it came in so late in the 
     <lb/>
     Session that there was no time to take it 
     <lb/>
     up. If they had rejected or amended 
     <lb/>
     the bill, it would not have been because 
     <lb/>
     the Legislative Council had no right to 
     <lb/>
     bring it in, for having received it, they 
     <lb/>
     had admitted this right. The House of 
     <lb/>
     Lords has introduced some of the most 
     <lb/>
    important measures in Britain, and this 
     <lb/>is done in the face of the House of 
     <lb/>Commons, and contrary to their opinions 
     <lb/>and the opinions of the Ministry of the 
     <lb/>day. He would mention a case. During 
     <lb/> the revolutionary war the Ministry came 
     <lb/>down with their Speech, and declared they 
     <lb/>would carry out that war vigorously to 
     <lb/>the end, and the House of Commons ex<lb break="no"/>pressed their opinion that the war should 
     <lb/>be carried on. The Earl of Chatham 
     <lb/>moved, right in the face of the Ministry 
     <lb/>and the House of Commons. to disconti<lb break="no"/>nue the war. We find the rights of the 
     <lb/>Lords and Commons are co-equal. Why, 
     <lb/>then does my hon. friend say they have 
     <lb/>not the same rights which we have ? Do 
     <lb/>not the same rules govern us that govern 
     <lb/>the Imperial Parliament ? In all the 
     <lb/>other Provinces of the proposed Union 
     <lb/>their Legislative Councils have been the 
     <lb/>first to act upon it, long before the House 
     <lb/>of Assemblies of the various Colonies 
     <lb/>took it up at all. If his hon. friend de<lb break="no"/>nied this right to exist, he would ask 
     <lb/>him at what particular year or century 
     <lb/>this change was made. If he cannot 
     <lb/>answer this, he must admit that the 
     <lb/>right still exists. He objects to this

     address. He (Mr. Botsford) says he 
     <lb/>
     cannot agree to adopt the third para<lb break="no"/>graph in the address, because it includes 
     <lb/>
     the manner of His Excellency's consult<lb break="no"/>ing with his advisers. This is an im<lb break="no"/>portant matter, for there are many in<lb break="no"/>stances of the Lieutenant Governor's 
     <lb/>
     consulting with the leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment instead of all the members of 
     <lb/>
     the Council. He says His Excellency's 
     <lb/>
     not consulting with his advisers was 
     <lb/>
     unconstitutional. We know that the 
     <lb/>
  

            <cb/>
         

     House as returned was directly opposed 
     <lb/>
     to Union in every respect. Suppose 
     <lb/>
     the people had changed and His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's advisers had not ; was it not 
     <lb/>
     right that he should take new advisers, 
     <lb/>
     who would adopt his views and take the 
     <lb/>
     responsibility ? He did so, and his ad<lb break="no"/>visers took the responsibility of dissolv<lb break="no"/>ing the House, and the verdict of the 
     <lb/>
     people was an approval of their course. 
     <lb/>
     My hon. friend says the constituencies of 
     <lb/>
     the Province did not justify the course 
     <lb/>
     adopted by His Excellency, but only a 
     <lb/>
     majority of them, and therefore the pa<lb break="no"/>ragraph states what cannot be substan<lb break="no"/>tiated. When we pass a resolution in 
     <lb/>
     this House by a majority of the mem<lb break="no"/>bers, it is a resolution of the House and 
     <lb/>
     not a resolution of a majority of the 
     <lb/>
     House, and the same parallel holds good 
     <lb/>
     in regard to the constituencies of the 
     <lb/>
     Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This course adopted by His Excellency 
     <lb/>
     led to events which rendered it expe<lb break="no"/>dient to dissolve the House. Was it ex<lb break="no"/>pedient that the eleven constituencies 
     <lb/>
     that were in favor of Union should re<lb break="no"/>main governed by the voice of the three 
     <lb/>
     that were opposed to this measure? If 
     <lb/>
     the House of Assembly had not been dis<lb break="no"/>solved the majority of the people would 
     <lb/>
     have been misrepresented by a majority 
     <lb/>
     of the members of the House, who did 
     <lb/>
     not express their views on this question. 
     <lb/>
     Will he (Mr. Botsford) contend that the 
     <lb/>
     rights of the people were endangered by 
     <lb/>
     this dissolution? It was the duty of His 
     <lb/>
     Excellency's advisers to see that the 
     <lb/>
     majority of the people were properly 
     <lb/>
     represented, and to do that they must 
     <lb/>
     dissolve the House. The people had 
     <lb/>
     been hastily called upon to express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion upon a great question, and they 
     <lb/>
     did so ; but they had since changed their 
     <lb/>
     views, and an opportunity was given 
     <lb/>
     them to send men here to represent their 
     <lb/>
     changed views. This was not endanger<lb break="no"/>ing the rights of the people. Could any 
     <lb/>
     Government be justified in saying, we 
     <lb/>
     will keep you here for three years longer, 
     <lb/>
     for if we dissolve the House we are tak<lb break="no"/>ing away your rights.

            <p>
     In regard to the fourth paragraph he 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. Botsford) says we are called upon 
     <lb/>
     here to express an opinion of approval 
     <lb/>
     or disapproval of the manner in which 
     <lb/>
     the resolution in favor of Union was car<lb break="no"/>ried in Nova Scotia. We are not called 
     <lb/>
     upon to do anything of the kind ; we are 
     <lb/>
     not called upon to decide whether they 
     <lb/>
     took the proper course in deciding upon 
     <lb/>
     this measure without submitting it to 
     <lb/>
     the people. If he (Mr. Johnson) was 
     <lb/>
     asked to say whether it was a constitu<lb break="no"/>tional course or not, he should say it 
     <lb/>
     was. The representatives of the people 
     <lb/>
     are sent here to exercise their judgment 
     <lb/>
     and think for the people, without going 
     <lb/>
     back to the people upon every matter 
     <lb/>
     which comes before them. In the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament all those important 
     <lb/>
     measures, like the repeal of the Corn 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
       

     Laws, have been decided without any 
     <lb/>
     reference to the people. In the same 
     <lb/>
     manner alterations have been made in 
     <lb/>
     the Constitution of Great Britain. This 
     <lb/>
     Constitution is not the same as it was in 
     <lb/>
     the time of William III. There was no 
     <lb/>
     such thing as responsible Government 
     <lb/>
     in that day. It has been again and again 
     <lb/>
     altered and improved. It has been suffi<lb break="no"/>ciently yielding to admit of those im<lb break="no"/>provements, which have been rendered 
     <lb/>
     necessary by the increase of commerce, 
     <lb/>
     and sufficiently strong to prevent its 
     <lb/>
     bursting up as other countries have 
     <lb/>
     done. The representatives of the people 
     <lb/>
    in Nova Scotia have a constitutional 
     <lb/>right to act as they have done. and we 
     <lb/>are not asked to say whether they have 
     <lb/>done or right or wrong, for it is a matter 
     <lb/>which they must settle among them<lb break="no"/>selves. We are simply asked to say : do  
     <lb/>we approve of what they have done? 
     <lb/>and we are not asked to say whether we 
     <lb/>approve of how they did it. If they have 
     <lb/>done what we conceive to be right, we 
     <lb/>can well say that we approve of the sub<lb break="no"/>stance of the resolutions, without ex<lb break="no"/>pressing an opinion as to the manner or 
     <lb/>mode in which those resolutions were 
     <lb/>carried ; therefore my hon. friend (Mr. 
     <lb/>Botsford) is not called upon to commit 
     <lb/>himself in that matter at all. There are  
     <lb/>a few words in the third paragraph he 
     <lb/>(Mr. Johnson) thought it would be as 
     <lb/>well to strike out. The section which 
     <lb/>says: " Your Excellency may rely with 
     <lb/>confidence on our cordial co-operation 
     <lb/>in any measure which may be proposed 
     <lb/>to accomplish that object." He (Mr. 
     <lb/>Johnson) thought that was asking too 
     <lb/>much from the House. It would pre<lb break="no"/>clude them from asking for any altera<lb break="no"/>tions in any measure proposed. He 
     <lb/>would suggest that they leave out the 
     <lb/>words, " in any measure which may be 
     <lb/>proposed." The section would then read, 
     <lb/>" Your Excellency may rely with con<lb break="no"/>fidence on our cordial cooperation to 
     <lb/>accomplish that object."

     <persName ref="pers:YOUN1">MR. YOUNG</persName> said he still believed, as 
     <lb/>
     he did at the close of the last session, 
     <lb/>
     that the course pursued by the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, in passing a resolution 
     <lb/>
     for a Union based upon the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme, thereby endeavoring to force 
     <lb/>
     upon the people a measure the people 
     <lb/>
     had rejected twelve months before, was 
     <lb/>
     wrong. He should, therefore, vote 
     <lb/>
     against the second and third paragraphs, 
     <lb/>
     but if the fourth paragraph was amended 
     <lb/>
     as proposed, he might vote for it. He 
     <lb/>
     had been sustained by a large majority 
     <lb/>
     of his constituents in the position he took 
     <lb/>
     in reference to the conduct of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and in reference to the Upper 
     <lb/>
     Branch of the Legislature. He was 
     <lb/>
     satisfied the address would pass without 
     <lb/>
     any amendment, by at least four-fifths 
     <lb/>
     of the members of the House, therefore 
     <lb/>
     he would say nothing further on the 
     <lb/>
     subject, but would content himself with 
     <lb/>
    voting against those paragraphs in the 
     <lb/>address.

     place it would be useless to do so. In

     much time at this season ot the year,

     when time is so valuable. In the third

     arguments which he might use to con<lb break="no"/>vince the minds of the members on the

            <p><persName ref="pers:STEV1">MR. STEVENS</persName> said he was glad 
     <lb/>to embrace the opportunity of rais<lb break="no"/>ing his voice against the assertion 
     <lb/>made against the Legislative Council, 
     <lb/>that they represented nobody but them<lb break="no"/>selves. The Constitution of Great 
     <lb/>Britain has received the plaudits of all 
     <lb/>writers of history. The reason of this 
     <lb/>is, because of the admirable checks 
     <lb/>which one branch has upon another. 
     <lb/>We should, therefore, endeavor to pre<lb break="no"/>vent the usefulness of the Upper Branch 
     <lb/>being done away with by any remarks 
     <lb/>calculated to bring them, as an indepen<lb break="no"/>dent Branch, into contempt. It has 
     <lb/>been urged by one hon. gentleman, that 
     <lb/>the Legislative Council was endeavoring 
     <lb/>to force upon the people a scheme which 
     <lb/>they had previously rejected, and be<lb break="no"/>cause the scheme had been once rejected 
     <lb/>the people never ought to have another 
     <lb/>opportunity of expressing an opinion 
     <lb/>upon it. They were prepared to meet 
     <lb/>this constitutional question in all its 
     <lb/>bearings. The action of the Lieutenant 
     <lb/>Governor was strictly constitutional in 
     <lb/>all its details. There was no endeavor 
     <lb/>to subvert the constitution or to force 
     <lb/>upon the people a scheme that they did 
     <lb/>not wish. The Legislative Council can<lb break="no"/>not carry anything into effect without 
     <lb/>the concurrence of the other branches. 
     <lb/>They did as they were asked to do by the 
     <lb/>Imperial Government, and in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of doing that they brought mat<lb break="no"/>ters to an issue, which caused the re<lb break="no"/>signation of a Government that had been 
     <lb/>in power long enough, and this was 
     <lb/>proved by the result of the elections. 
     <lb/>The country knew when His Excellency 
     <lb/> returned from England that there was 
     <lb/>something to be done to bring the sub<lb break="no"/>ject of Union prominently before the 
     <lb/>people. We now find that the subject of 
     <lb/>Union was to have been brought before 
     <lb/>the people by the despatches which were 
     <lb/>to be laid before the House. If we look 
     <lb/>at the correspondence which took place 
     <lb/>

            <cb/>
         

     upon the resignation of the Government, 
     <lb/>
     we will find that His Excellency was 
     <lb/>
     willing to bring this about through the 
     <lb/>
     agency of the Government, so that it 
     <lb/>
     could be carried out without a party 
     <lb/>
     triumph. This showed great delicacy 
     <lb/>
     on the part of His Excellency. This 
     <lb/>
     subject of Union was mentioned in the 
     <lb/>
     speech from the throne, and the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council presented an address in an<lb break="no"/>swer to the speech, the reply to which 
     <lb/>
     was endorsed by the Government and 
     <lb/>couched in the same language in which<lb/>
    afterwards His Excellency replied to 
     <lb/>their address on the subject of Union. 
     <lb/>The found fault because that reply was<lb/>not communicated to the Government as 
     <lb/>a body, and in consequence of this they 
     <lb/>said it was not a constitutional act of the 
     <lb/>Governor. Why, he would ask, was it 
     <lb/>necessary for the Governor to do that 
     <lb/>when it was but a second copy of what 
     <lb/>they had already endorsed and approved 
     <lb/>of ? Where was the unconstitutionality 
     <lb/>of this act of His Excellency ? It was a 
     <lb/>mere matter of form, and they could not 
     <lb/>go to the country and ask them to decide 
     <lb/>on a mere matter of form.  
     <lb/>

     the Government had taken upon them<lb break="no"/>selves to dismiss a coachman, and if they 
     <lb/>
     have taken the dismissal they have taken

     the appointment. He would ask if any

     coaches had been dismissed by the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. The coaches which were ap<lb break="no"/>pointed last Session continued in their

     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Hon. MR. FISHER</persName> said his hon. friend

     had better not speak of Government ap<lb break="no"/>pointments. The door-keeper was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed through the Sergeant-at-Arms by 
     <lb/>
     the late Government. Mr. Atherton's 
     <lb/>
     coach had been employed by the House, 
     <lb/>
     but last year it was dismissed and an<lb break="no"/>other coach employed in its place.

     <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">MR. BOTSFORD</persName>â€”The door-keeper

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Hon. MR. FISHER</persName> said it was no dif<lb break="no"/>ference to him whether they employed 
     <lb/>
     one coach or two, they had always em<lb break="no"/>ployed two, and two would still continue 
     <lb/>
     in attendance. He did not wish to see 
     <lb/>
     the main question blinked, which was, 
     <lb/>
     whether Mr. Atherton or Mr. Peters 
     <lb/>
     should have one of these coaches. Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Atherton was appointed in 1857, and fur<lb break="no"/>nished good coaches and accomodated 
     <lb/>
     the members. He held this appointment 
     <lb/>
     until the general election preceding this. 
     <lb/>
     He took ground against the then Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and the House turned him out and 
     <lb/>
     appointed Mr. Peters. When our friends 
     <lb/>
     have been removed from office for the 
     <lb/>
     course which they have taken during the 
     <lb/>
     election, it is but common justice that we 
     <lb/>
     should restore them. Mr. Atherton was 
     <lb/>
     removed for simply voting for us at the 
     <lb/>
     election, and it was now their duty to re<lb break="no"/>store him to his situation. These were 
     <lb/>
     his reasons for the appointment of Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Artherton, but neither the resolution and 
     <lb/>
     amendment made provision for it. He 
     <lb/>
     did not wish the coaches for himself for 
     <lb/>
     he had a carriage of his own. The man 
     <lb/>
     who was appointed now would retain the 
     <lb/>
     situation during the next four years, and 
     <lb/>
     during the winter season they had a great 
     <lb/>
     deal of stormy weather. The salary was 
     <lb/>
     a small matter, the members made more 
     <lb/>
     excitement about it then the people did 
     <lb/>
     themselves. The people are willing that 
     <lb/>
     every convenience should be provided for 
     <lb/>
     their representatives, and all they require 
     <lb/>
     of them in return is that they shall dis<lb break="no"/>charge their duty to the best of their 
     <lb/>
     ability.Â

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAN1">Mr. CHANDLER</persName> said the simple 
     <lb/>
     question was did they require two coaches 
     <lb/>
     or not. If two coaches were necessary 
     <lb/>
        

   <cb/>
          

     they should have them. Mr. Atherton 
     <lb/>
     was appointed in 1857 and had performed 
     <lb/>
    his duties with kindness and attention. 
     <lb/>lf he has been removed by the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment for any well-founded charge they 
     <lb/>should not employ him, but if he has been 
     <lb/>removed on political grounds he should 
     <lb/>be reinstated. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">MR. BOTSFORD</persName> said the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment did not displace or reinstate 
     <lb/>
     either Mr. Atherton or Mr. Peters. It 
     <lb/>
     was the House that did it. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment have no power to displace 
     <lb/>
     them, and he supposed that was the 
     <lb/>
     reason that Mr. Peters was not dis<lb break="no"/>placed. He (Mr. Peters) was employed 
     <lb/>
     by the House, but he did not know whe<lb break="no"/>ther it was from political motives or not.

            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCAD1">MR. McADAM</persName> would vote against the 
     <lb/>
     resolution, if adopting it would prevent 
     <lb/>
     them from re-instating Mr. Atherton, 
     <lb/>
     who had been displaced for political rea<lb break="no"/>sons. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WILL1">HON. MR. WILLISTON</persName> thought the 
     <lb/>
     hon. members did not understand the 
     <lb/>
     matter before the House. In 1865 the 
     <lb/>
     question was brought before the House 
     <lb/>
     whether the Speaker should employ the 
     <lb/>
     coaches. The Speaker declined, and a 
     <lb/>
     resolution was submitted to the House to 
     <lb/>
     authorize the Contingent Committee to 
     <lb/>
     employ them. Mr. Peters had been 
     <lb/>
     coachman for the Executive Council and 
     <lb/>
     Mr. Atherton for the House of Assembly. 
     <lb/>
     They tried to do justice to all parties. 
     <lb/>
     They recommended that Mr. Peters 
     <lb/>
     should be employed as coachman to the 
     <lb/>
     House, as he had formerly served in that 
     <lb/>
     capacity, and they thought they were do<lb break="no"/>ing no injustice to Mr. Atherton, for he<lb/>had large contracts under the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They also employed Mr. Turner,<lb/>and these two coachmen did the duty. He<lb/>could bear testimony to the efficiency of<lb/>Mr. Atherton, but he thought the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should not have this patronage.<lb/>He had a strong feeling in reference to<lb/>the displacement of officers. He hoped<lb/>that the day had gone by when the officers<lb/>could be removed except on good substan<lb break="no"/>tial grounds. So long as a man is doing<lb/>his duty to his country, so long should<lb/>he continue in office. If, on the other<lb/>hand, a man holding an office under the<lb/>Government becomes a partizan, he<lb/>should be removed. The question of<lb/>whether Mr. Peters or Mr. Atherton<lb/>be employed had better be referred to the<lb/>Contingent Committee, and let them in<lb break="no"/>vestigate it fairly and fully.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOHN1">MR. JOHNSON</persName> said they should not<lb/>place the patronage of the House in the<lb/>hands of the Contingent Committee. They<lb/>might just as well delegate it to the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee on Privileges. If the House<lb/>would place it in the hands of His Honor<lb/>the Speaker, he would agree to it, but<lb/>not to placing it in the hands of a Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of that kind. According to the<lb/>
            

            <cb/>
         

     amendment, the coaches would not be 
     <lb/>
     confined to members going to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment House, but the Contingent Com<lb break="no"/>mittee, or any other Committee of the 
     <lb/>
     House would have the right to use them, 
     <lb/>
     while His Honor the Speaker would not. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:STEV1">MR. STEVENS</persName> said the question was 
     <lb/>
    whether they should have two coaches or 
     <lb/>one. The amendment says we shall only 
     <lb/>have one. This will not be sufficient to 
     <lb/>accommodate all the members who re<lb break="no"/>quire coaches. He would vote for two 
     <lb/>coaches, which was the number they usu<lb break="no"/>ally employed. The time spent in discuss<lb break="no"/>ing this subject costs more than the em<lb break="no"/>ployment of the coaches.

            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BECK1">MR. BECKWITH</persName> moved, as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, " that George Atherton and John 
     <lb/>Turner be coachmen to this House." 
     <lb/>

            <p>This amendment was then adoptedâ€”

     The Committee appointed to wait upon

     <persName ref="pers:JOHN1">MR. JOHNSON</persName> said the question 
     <lb/>
    now was whether they should suspend 
     <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, or pass a Bill
