<!-- GL, 2018-04-24, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
<!--</p>
            <p>
     noon. The hon. member has only been 
     <lb/>a day or two in the House since it<lb/>
     
    opened ; he has only now just returned 
     <lb/>after an absence of a week and from 
     <lb/>the anxiety he displays in getting up 
     <lb/>discussions, and the style in which he 
     <lb/>conducts them, I think the country 
     <lb/>would not have suffered if he had not 
     <lb/>come here at all. We were getting 
     <lb/>along with the business very well with<lb break="no"/>out him. Hon. members have express<lb break="no"/>ed their desire to get through as fast as 
     <lb/>possible, but the hon. member appears 
     <lb/>to be desirous to delay the business by 
     <lb/>making unprovoked and uncalled for 
     <lb/>attacks upon me. He has travelled out 
     <lb/>of the record, and now l again say that 
     <lb/>although there is no written rule, yet 
     <lb/>the practice has been, and it is endorsed 
     <lb/>by the Clerk, that whenever a Petition 
     <lb/>is not properly endorsed with the resi<lb break="no"/>dence of the petitioners, the attention 
     <lb/>of hon, members is called to the fact by 
     <lb/>the Speaker. The Petitions referred to 
     <lb/>by the Surveyor General are excep<lb break="no"/>tions, which it appears not only passed 
     <lb/>the notice of hon. members but also of 
     <lb/>the Speaker.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>—It is just as I ex<lb break="no"/>pected. My hon. friend has again 
     <lb/>
     attacked me, because he says, although I 
     <lb/>
     repudiated the idea, that I attacked him. 
     <lb/>
     He has referred to this morning's discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and although I do not wish to take 
     <lb/>
     up the time unnecessarily, yet it seems 
     <lb/>
     important I should defend myself in my 
     <lb/>
     humble way. The ideas held by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend and the remarks he makes shows 
     <lb/>him to be a bundle of inconsistencies. 
     <lb/>This morning he said the Secretary 
     <lb/>should not take the praise of the increase 
     <lb/>in the revenues ; I then asked him to 
     <lb/>whom the increase was due, and who we 
     <lb/>should thank for it ? That he said was 
     <lb/> making a vile attack upon him. He then 
     <lb/>proceeded to charge me with inconsis<lb break="no"/>tency and sudden conversion ; but that 
     <lb/>in his opinion, was not an attack upon 
     <lb/>me. Now he says I am a sarcastic man, 
     <lb/>which certainly is neither a very nice nor 
     <lb/>agreeable name to be called ; but then 
     <lb/>he does not regard that as an attack. I 
     <lb/>said this morning that the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, though pledged against Union, put 
     <lb/>it in their speech, and so I was forced to 
     <lb/>oppose them ; but that he looked upon 
     <lb/>as an outrageous attack upon him. You 
     <lb/>see that whatever he says must not be 
     <lb/>considered as assailling any one, no mat<lb break="no"/>ter how personal his remarks may be ; but 
     <lb/>if I attempt to speak, then what I say is 
     <lb/>regarded as a torrent of abuse upon my 
     <lb/>hon. friend. Now that's just how he looks 
     <lb/>at the matter. He says we occupied two 
     <lb/>or three hours in discussion this morning, 
     <lb/>but as it was after 12 o'clock when we 
     <lb/>went into Committee and we separated at 
     <lb/>l o'clock, that statement appears to be a 
     <lb/>little exaggeration. The time that was 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     occupied arose entirely from his refusal
<lb/>to answer my question as to who should
<lb/>be thanked, and I think I stated, and if I<lb/>did not I will now state that I do not<lb/>think we have to thank the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for anything but for getting the
<lb/>country into a state of turmoil and con<lb break="no"/>fusion, My hon. friend has said that I<lb/>wanted to be Attorney General. Well,
<lb/>suppose I did ; is that anything to bring
<lb/>against me ? I think that my hon. friend
<lb/>who says that he is so regardless of office<lb/>wanted and got that office more than
<lb/>once. If I remember rightly, when the
<lb/>present Attorney General was (to use an<lb/>expression which has been used before)
<lb/>bowled out of the Govsrnment, my hon.
<lb/>friend jumped into his shoes before they
<lb/>were scarcely cool ; and when the present
<lb/>Judge Allen was appointed to the Bench,<lb/>although my hon. friend had publicly
<lb/>stated that he would not accept office,<lb/>unless a special emergency arose and the
<lb/>interests of the country demanded it, yet
<lb/>he jumped right into it. Now I never
<lb/>said I wouldn't accept an office, for I tell
<lb/>him that if I got the offer I should accept
<lb/>it, and consider myself just as competent<lb/>to fill it as my hon. friend.<lb/>

     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I shall shall not take up 
     <lb/>the time of the country any longer in<lb/>such a useless discussion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SUTTON then withdrew his ob<lb break="no"/>jection, stating that as a fight would<lb/>probably arise on the Bill, it was useless<lb/>to carry it any further now.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. RYAN presented a Petition from <lb/>Thomas Davis and 28 others, inhabitants<lb/>of King's County, praying that a Bill may<lb/>pass to incorporate the Grand Orange<lb/>Lodge of New Brunswick and subordi<lb break="no"/>nate Lodges in connexion therewith.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Petition was received and laid on
<lb/>the table.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. CONNELL presented a Pe<lb break="no"/>tition from Rev. J. C. Bleakney and
<lb/>65 others, inhabitants of Carleton Coun<lb break="no"/>ty, with a like prayer.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>The Petition was received and laid on 
<lb/>the table.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
      Hon. Mr. McADAM read a Petition 
     <lb/>from James Dunn and 50 others, inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants of Charlotte County, praying for<lb/>assistance in erecting certain landings at<lb/>Oak Bay ; but as it asked for a grant of<lb/>money it was not received.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">Hon. Mr. FISHER</persName> moved for leave to<lb/>bring in a Bill to establish County Courts<lb/>in this Province.<lb/>
            </p>

<lb/>first time. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of Hon. Mr. FISHER this<lb/>Bill was read a second time and ordered<lb/>that 200 copies be printed for the use of<lb/>the Legislature.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. McINERNEY moved the House<lb/>into Committee on a Bill to establish an<lb/>additional Polling Place in the Parish of<lb/>Carleton, in the County of Kent.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. DOW in the Chair.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BABB1">Mr. BABBIT</persName> took exception to the 
     <lb/>
     Bill on the ground that it did not specify 
     <lb/>
     where the dividing line of the Parish ran. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName> also said the Bill was in<lb break="no"/>sufficient in this respect. and further the 
     <lb/>
     other member for the County (Mr. Caie) 
     <lb/>
     was not in his seat.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Further progress was therefore report<lb break="no"/>ed, with leave to sit again.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. YOUNG moved that the House 
     <lb/>
     do on Wednesday next, the 29th instant,
