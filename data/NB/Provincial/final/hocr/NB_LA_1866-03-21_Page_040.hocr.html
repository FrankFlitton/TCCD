<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> if he did not vote with the Government<br />
A cry is now raised, that is they vote<br />
against the Government the House will<br />
be dissolved. I never was into a Govern-<br />
ment, and do not care about going in,<br />
neither do I care much about having a<br />
seat in the Legislature. When I was <br />
first requested to offer, some person said<br />
I would not get three hundred votes, but<br />
the event proved he was wrong, and if<br />
the House was dissolved to-morrow, I am <br />
ready to run again, so they need not <br />
think dissolving the House will have <br />
much effect with me. There is another<br />
thing ought not to have been done—that<br />
is, speculating in land. I consider that <br />
the greatest sin the Government have<br />
been guilty of. I believe no greater evil<br />
can be inflicted upon a community than<br />
allowing one man to monopolize that lands<br />
of the country. I will quote a report of<br />
the Earl of Durham, who was at that<br />
time Governor General of British North<br />
America. At the 159h page of his<br />
report he says :—</p>











<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"In Upper Canada, a very small pro-<br />
portion—perhaps less than a tenth—of<br />
the land thus granted has been even occu-<br />
pied by settlers, much less reclaimed and<br />
cultivated. In Lower Canada, with the <br />
exception of a few townships bordering<br />
on the American frontier, which have <br />
been comparatively well settled, in despite<br />
of the proprietors by American squatters<br />
it may be said that nineteen-twentieths of
<br />
these grants are still unsettled, and in a
<br />
perfectly wild state."</p>

















<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"No other result could have been ex-<br />
pected in the case of those classes of<br />
grantees whose station would preclude <br />
them from settling on the wilderness, and <br />
whose means would enable them to avoid<br />
exertion for giving immediate value to<br />
their grants ; and, unfortunately, the <br />
land which was intended for persons of<br />
a poorer order, who might be expected to<br />
improve it by their labor, has, for the <br />
most part, fallen into the hands of land<br />
jobbers of the class just mentioned, who<br />
have never thought of settling in person,<br />
and who retain the land in its present<br />
wild state, speculating upon its acquiring<br />
value at some distant day when the de-<br />
mand for land shall have increased<br />
through the increase of population."</p>
<br />



























<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">This coincides with my own views in<br />
this matter. I am opposed to any Govern-<br />
ment who will allow men to purchase<br />
large blocks of land, which the poor man<br />
has to go through and make roads, as<br />
this interferes with the prosperity of the
<br />
country. Why should a poor man be<br />
compelled to make roads through another<br />
man's property ; that land having been<br />
obtained for two shilings, and kept<br />
until it is worth four dollars an acre,<br />
in consequence of the settlements around<br />
it. It had been said here that when they<br />
received from timber licences. I contend<br />
the country would be a gainer if no man<br />
got land without the principle of actual<br />
settlement being attached to it, for it has<br />
been calculated that every settler is worth<br />
three dollars a year to the revenues of<br />
the country. This and the late Govern-<br />
ment blame each other in regard to this,<br />
but I do not care who is in the Govern-<br />
ment, I should blame them for this,<br />
(Hon. Mr. Smith.—Which Government<br />
was most to blame) All the late Gov-<br />
ernment did was to order the survey.<br />
(Mr. Wetmore.—Was the money paid.)<br />
The ex-Surveyor General said it was not<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> said. Why did the Government come to<br />
the conclusion that the Intercolonial<br />
Railroad was given up, when the survey<br />
was made only ten months ago? If there<br />
was any reason why the public lands<br />
should be sold to others than actual<br />
settlers, notice should have been given to<br />
the Deputies. I know that men made<br />
application for land in my County, and <br />
could not get it. I believe in equal<br />
rights for all. It was not right that a few<br />
men should have been informed of what<br />
was going on, and the rest kept in ig-<br />
norance. There was five thousand acres<br />
purchased in fictitious names, and then<br />
the resolution was rescinded, and he got<br />
ten thousand more ; previous to this he<br />
got a three year license to cut the lum-<br />
ber on it, and if any one else had bought<br />
it he could cut all the lumber off of it.<br />
Then again they said, by doing away<br />
with the political character of the Post-<br />
master General, they would make a great<br />
saving. If the political head of the de-<br />
partment was abolished, would not the <br />
chief business be done in St. John? It<br />
was said Mr. Howe would be the Gen-<br />
eral, but it was hinted outside that a<br />
gentleman in St. John had the promise<br />
of an office to be called Post Office In-<br />
spector. He would have the salary and <br />
pickings, without the privilege of having<br />
"General" attached to his name. This<br />
was the saving that was to ve effected by <br />
doing away with the political head of the<br />
department, and to carry their measure,<br />
they got up their rallying cry of Confede-<br />
ration. I was almost discouraged, but I <br />
believed that "he is thrice armed who <br />
has his quarrel just." I am glad there <br />
are some hon. gentlement now who will<br />
look after the interests of the coutnry and<br />
not be drummed up with the cry of Conf-<br />
ederation anfd anti-Confederation.</p>








































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">In regard to the appoinment og Judges,<br />
my hon. friend referred to what Judge<br />
Wilmot had said and done, and how he<br />
had voted, thus admitting the truth of<br />
the charge brought against them that they<br />
had made politics their rule for their ap-<br />
pointments on the Bench. I do not be-<br />
lieve in Judges interfering in the
political<br />
questions which are before the country.<br />
They should arise far above that ; but this<br />
was a question whether we were going to<br />
maintain out connection with the mother<br />
country or not. Confederation in a ques-<br />
tion that has occupied the minds of men<br />
for sixty-five years. Judge Wilmot held <br />
those views when on the floors of this <br />
House, and he is a credit to the country<br />
which gave him birth, and I contend it<br />
was unfair to pass over him and appoint<br />
a junior Judge to the office. I do not<br />
know much about the gentleman who has<br />
been said that they might have found a per-<br />
son qualified without going to Insurance<br />
Offices. He was appointed on political<br />
grounds, which is a principle they have <br />
carried down to the offcials on the rail-<br />
way, and I don't know how much further<br />
they would have carried it, if His Excel-<br />
lency had not interfered. It had been<br />
said that they are going to change their <br />
base, and take another course on Confed-<br />
eration. If that is the case, it is not
right<br />
for me to say anything, for they may come<br />
round al right. I think by what is fore-<br />
shadowed in the Speech, that they are go-<br />
ing to get up another delegation and have<br />
another pleasure excursion, for the Attor-<br />
ney General says he is willing to go for<br />
some Scheme. He said when we advoca-<br />
ted a Scheme of Union, that we were<br />
"political schemers" and "conspirators."<br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_3" title="bbox 94 67 130 94">



<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Now they are going to get up a poli-<br />
tical scheme, but I do not know whether<br />
they are going to "conspirit" or not. They
<br />
c<span class="unclear" title="illegible lettering.">?</span> a man that was going to carry out<br />
the wishes of his Sovereign a "conspira-<br />
tor." I heard it stated on good authority,<br />
and I need not go off the floors of this<br />
Legislature to prove it, that the Chief<br />
Commissioner, on being asked whe-<br />
ther he had read the Minate of Council,<br />
said he was sorry it did not go further,<br />
that they had not made use of stronger<br />
language, using an expression I am a-<br />
shamed to repeat. These are the loyal<br />
men, and we are the conspirators.<br />
My hon. friend (Mr. Wilmot) said in<br />
Canada, that he was not opposed to a<br />
union, but he was not satisfied with the<br />
Quebec Scheme. Mr. George Brown<br />
said there were some things in the scheme<br />
they did not like either, they would <br />
meet him half way in considering a <br />
union, for they did not wish to take <br />
any unfair advantages of their fellow-<br />
colonists. I am in favor of a union and<br />
I do not see how any British subject<br />
can be opposed to it, but to agree upon a<br />
scheme of union, we must all make some <br />
concessions or we will never agree to any<br />
terms. My hon. friend (Co'. Boyd) made a <br />
speech in Canada in favor of union. (Col. <br />
Boyd, not in favor of the Quebec Scheme.)<br />
I did not say it was, but I heard him speak<br />
strongly in favor of a union ; but he is one<br />
of those men who believe nothing good<br />
can come out of Nazareth, and that a man<br />
must belong to certian families of he will<br />
not be fit for office. I believe in freedom<br />
and equal rights for all. There are a great<br />
many things in the scheme which are com-<br />
plained of in Canada and it is doubtful, if<br />
we get a new scheme, whether we would <br />
come off as well as we did before. They<br />
complain that New Brunswick is to get <br />
$63,000 a year for ten years. (Mr. Need-<br />
ham,—That is contingent, that unless we<br />
run into debt to the extent of $7,000,000<br />
we were not to get it.) If we built our <br />
railroads under the Subsidy Act, our debt<br />
would soon reach that amount, and Cana-<br />
da does not come in with a debt equal to <br />
ours, if we take the population of Canada<br />
into consideration. We would have more<br />
money for local purpose than we have<br />
now, and have the Inter-Colonial Railway<br />
and Western Extension built besides. In <br />
a time of war we could come to the as-<br />
sistance of each other and would not<br />
require half the number of troops that we<br />
do now in our isolated position.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">DR. THOMPSON said he had taken <br />
no notes, and would, therefore, make but<br />
a short speech. At the last election two-<br />
thirds of the poeple in this Province de-<br />
clared they were opposed to Confedera-<br />
tion. It has been said that, by signing<br />
this Minute of Council, the Government <br />
have insulted Her Majesty's Ministers.<br />
He did not believe that, and he had<br />
as great a respect for the United <br />
Kingdom as any other man in the Prov-<br />
ince. At the same time, he did not like<br />
to bow in slavish obedience to what-<br />
ever set of men was put in as rulers<br />
of that country, and if he has his say, the<br />
present rulers would not be sustained in<br />
their position very long. Since the great<br />
man (Lord Palmerston), who was at the<br />
head of the Government, is gone, they<br />
have scarcely a man fit to retain office.<br />
In regard to Confederation, it is not go-<br />
ing to benefit us, for we would have to<br />
be at the espence of keeping up two Le-<br />
gislatures, besdies this great Parliament.<br />
If they must unite together, they had <br />
better unite under one Legislature, which<br />
