               I said that the Fenians sympathised<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with the Antis, and not that the Antis<br />
sympathised with the Fenians. The At-<br />
torney General then jumped up in a great<br />
rage and said, "I see the hon. gentleman<br />
is opposed to the Government." I made<br />
those remarks not with an reference to<br />
anything brought before the House. He<br />
said I was not worthy of a place in the <br />
Legislature. I thought it would be very<br />
convenient for the hon. member to keep<br />
me out until this question was disposed <br />
of. Something was said about our being<br />
in the mud. It reminds me of the allu-<br />
sion made last year, comparing the Go-<br />
vernment to Nebuchadezzar's image, <br />
which was made of iron, clay, brass,<br />
gold and silber. If reports are true, <br />
the silver is gone and the gold with it.<br />
Some say the clay is gone too. I should<br />
think it was, as I see here a large quan-<br />
tity of brass, or perhaps it was meant that</span><br />
the clay and brass had been mixed to-<br />
gether and converted into mud. I do<br />
not know what to call my hon. friend, <br />
whether to call him President of the <br />
Council, or Attorney General, or Leader<br />
of the Government, or Plenipotentiary<br />
extraordinary. I do not know who<br />
is the Leader of the Government<br />
It was said that the hon. member<br />
for St. John, (Mr. Wilmot) in con-<br />
nection with the Hon Mr. Smith, <br />
were appointed to form a Government.<br />
The hon. Chief Commissioner said his<br />
Excellency called upon him. I do not<br />
know whether he is the leader, or<br />
whether he brings up the rear. He<br />
quoted from the Litany. My mind<br />
would lead me to quote from the gener-<br />
al confession. "They have done the<br />
things they ought not to have done, and<br />
left undone the things they ought to have<br />
done," <span style="font-style: italic;">and we have no confidence in them</span><br />
I have heard it intimated outside that<br />
they have one office promised to two or<br />
three members, and they have some of-<br />
fices up stairs which they keep as bait<br />
for their supporters. Then again, they<br />
intimidate some by saying, if they vote<br />
against the Government there will be a <br />
dissolution and they will have to go<br />
back to their constituents. In any thing<br />
that concerns the interests of the Pro-<br />
vince, or the rights of the people, I should<br />
have no hesitation in going back to my<br />
constituents. I will now call attention<br />
to things that ought not to have been <br />
done. He has allowed His Excellency<br />
to draw the same amount of slary that<br />
his predecessors did, and for which he<br />
condemned them. He says that is paid<br />
back ; that is not the question. The <br />
question is, has he a right to draw it?<br />
If he had a right to draw it, had has a <br />
right to keep it. My hon friend agrees<br />
with me on that, we voted on the same <br />
side on the resolution which was carried<br />
in 1864. I will read the resolution :</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Resolved, As the opinion of this<br />
Committee that the amount the Lieuten<br />
and Governor is entitled to receive, as <br />
salary, is £3461 10s. 8d per annun,<br />
and the Solicitor General and Provinvial<br />
Secretary £230 15s. 4d each," and fur-<br />
ther</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Resolved, That the amount paid be-<br />
yond these sums were improperly paid, <br />
and without sufficient authority."</p>

               He has thus allowed His Excellency<br />
to do what he thought was wrong in<br />
his predecessor's office. Another thing<br />
he ought not to have done was, with-<br />
holding the despatches sent out here for<br />
the information of the Legislature. Mr. <br />
Lindsay then read a despatch dated the<br />
12th of April, which he said should have<br />
been received here the 26th of April, <br />
and which contained information of im-<br />
portance respecting military defence<br />
and Confederation, that should have<br />
been laid before the Legislature at that<br />
time assembled, but which was not laid<br />
before them at all. The next thing they<br />
ought not to have done was, they should<br />
not have written that despatch, dated<br />
July 12th, which was insulting to Her<br />
Majesty's Government, and which was<br />
signed by the immortal seven and as<br />
the President of the Council has en-<br />
dorsed it, he, with the late Attorney<br />
General, will make the immortal nine.<br />
The President of the Council said the<br />
despatch justified them in using such<br />
language as they did. He then read<br />
the despatch dated June 24th, 1865, to <br />
which the other was an answer, and said<br />
he could see nothing in it to justify them<br />
in returning such an answer, and con-<br />
tinued : the President of the Council<br />
said, he only knew of two persons, out<br />
side of Parliament, who knew any thing<br />
about the scheme. I cannot suppose<br />
that when the British Parliament, con-<br />
sisting of six hunfred and fifty-six mem-<br />
bers, were acquainted with this scheme,<br />
no one outside would know anything<br />
about it. It was said, if we went into <br />
Confederation we would have to pro-<br />
vide a navy. An Act passed this Legis-<br />
lature a few days ago to provide one or<br />
two vesseles for defence. Here is a navy <br />
which we have to provide alone. If we<br />
went into Confederation we would only<br />
have one-thirteenth part to pay, and but<br />
few vessels would be wanted. We have<br />
been taken care of for seventy-five years,<br />
and we should begin to try to do some-<br />
thing for ourselves, and it should not be<br />
thought an insult for Her Majesty's<br />
Ministers to refer to it. and I do not<br />
think the people of the country consider<br />
it so. It has been said that union is not<br />
strength. Who can beieve that uniting<br />
these Colonies would weaken them. <br />
The only thing I know of that will be<br />
weakened by uniting is rum and water.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> says, that by refusing to <br />
unite together we showa want of loyal-<br />
ty, and this Government says in the Min-<br />
ute of Council : "When a wish is ex-<br />
pressed by Her Majesty's Government,<br />
it will be received with that federence<br />
which is due to suggestions emanating<br />
from so high a source, and will be con-<br />
sidered with an anzious desire to meet <br />
the views of Her Majesty's advisers ;<br />
but if such views should unfortunately<br />
not coincide with the views of those on <br />
whom alone the responsibility of action<br />
in the Province fallsm the Committee<br />
feel assured that Her Majesty's Govern-<br />
ment will expect and desire that the Go<br />
vernment of this Province should act<br />
according to their own convictions of<br />
right." They will act according to their<br />
own convictions ; but when a foe in-<br />
vades the country they will send a des-<br />
patch as quick as possible to England, <br />
and ask them to send soldiers and ships<br />
to protect men who claim the right to<br />
do as they like, when Her Majesty sug-<br />
gests that we should unite under one<br />
Government. The Government tell us<br />
how loyal they are. Loyalty does not<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">consists in lip service, but in obedience.<br />
A refractory man is not a good subject<br />
to an country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Lindsay then read the reply of the<br />
Colonial Secretary to those immortal<br />
nine, and continued. This reply was<br />
just as much as to say : I cannot be-<br />
lieve the loyal men of New Brunswick<br />
endorse the views expressed by those<br />
immortal nine. These are things they <br />
ought not to have done. I will now<br />
speak of things they ought to have left<br />
undone&nbsp; I believe when a man is paid<br />
$2400 a year to fill an office, he should<br />
attend to his duties and not have to<br />
make excuses for sins of omission. It <br />
is the old story—Adam left the blame<br />
on his wife and his wife left it on the<br />
devil. (Laughter.) The President of<br />
the Council says the late Attorney Gen-<br />
eral ought to have known the Export<br />
Duty law was to expire. Another says<br />
the Provincial Secretary ought to have <br />
known it. Another, that Fisher found<br />
it out and should have told them, and<br />
another that the late Provincial Secre-<br />
tary ought to have told his predecessor<br />
of it. They thus acknowledge that they <br />
are not fit to attend to the business, for<br />
they tried till they got a man out of of-<br />
fice, and then found fault because he<br />
did not do the work for them. The peo-<br />
ple complain they cannot find a member<br />
of the Government at Fredericton, there<br />
were so many pleasure excursions. Two<br />
of them off to England to tell Her Ma-<br />
jesty's Government what they knew be-<br />
fore ; but, in order to say they had done<br />
something for the £800 they received,<br />
they made an arrangement for the Rail-<br />
way in Westmorland&nbsp; The Attorney<br />
General made it under a Bill which he<br />
had done all he could to defeat when it<br />
was before the House. The Commis-<br />
sioner of the Board of Works, and my<br />
hon. friend from St. John (Mr. Anglin)<br />
went to Canada. I do not know whether<br />
they went voluntarily or whether they <br />
were paid for it. (Mr. Anglin—I paid<br />
my own expenses as I always do.) That<br />
is all very well. Suppose I went to<br />
your House and said I believe you are a<br />
humbug, and a bankrupt, and I don't <br />
want to have any thing to do with you ;<br />
we would have a social time would we<br />
not? It was in this spirit they went to<br />
Canada ; they said we did not want a <br />
closer union with you, for we believe<br />
you are bankrupt, and are trying to take<br />
advantage of us. What a fraternal<br />
meeting that must have been. Then<br />
they had another pleasure excursion to<br />
the United States. My hon. friend (Mr. <br />
Wilmot) was one of the immortal nine.<br />
It is said, "evil communications corrupt<br />
good manners" He was led to do<br />
something he ought not to have done,<br />
but, I believe, if my friend repents he<br />
has a right to expect mercy, and if som-<br />
other of my hon. friends would come<br />
round in the same way we would have<br />
mercy for them. The hon Attorney<br />
General stated here last Session that he<br />
was sorry that his hon. friend (Mr. <br />
Fisher) who was one of the delegates<br />
who went to Quebec, was not on the<br />
floors of the House, so that he could con-<br />
front him ; but not he has his wish,<br />
he is not satisfied. He says that when a <br />
division was taken upon the question<br />
abolishing the office of Postmaster Gen-<br />
eral, there were thirty for it and nine <br />
against it. That was because, when a<br />
question came up, they got up the rallying<br />
cry, that every man who was elected a<br />
Confederate was violating his principle<br />
