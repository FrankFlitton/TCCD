<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">enter into some details. After the late<br />
election, when the late Government was<br />
thrown out, he was called upon in con-<br />
junction with the Attorney General (hon. <br />
A. J. Smith) to form an Administration.<br />
He thought they were then in a position<br />
to form a strong and stable Government.<br />
When he met the Attorney General, he<br />
(Attorney General) proposed that he<br />
(Mr. W.) should be Provincial Secretary.<br />
He had been Provincial Secretary before,<br />
and he said that if they could not get a <br />
better man, he was willing to take the<br />
office. He asked if he could not have<br />
had the office of he had chose? Differ-<br />
ences of opinion arose betwixt them as to<br />
the gentlemen who should hold the De-<br />
partmental Offices. He thought that the <br />
Government should have a Solicitor Ge-<br />
neral, that there should be a responsible<br />
law officer to whom questions of impor-<br />
tance should be referred ; but the Attor-<br />
ney General opposed any apointment. <br />
(Attorney General here objected to Mr. <br />
Wilmot entering into these detail.) He<br />
was charged with falsehood, and further<br />
charged with being bought in Canada<br />
and he was bound to defend his own char-<br />
acter. (Mr. Wilmot then quoted from<br />
his tender of resignation, Jan. 4, in<br />
which he expressed an opinion in favor<br />
of the principle of Union, and the Govern-<br />
ment's reply thereto) When those gen-<br />
tlemen that signed that memorandum<br />
stated, "that they were not aware that he<br />
was in favour of Union up to the time of<br />
his mission to Canada," they stated what <br />
was untrue. They knew the Government<br />
referred to his opinion in Council when<br />
they went on to state, "what induced a<br />
change of his mind while there, the Coun-<br />
cil have no means of knowning." What <br />
induced him? It was not office that in-<br />
duced him ; he could have taken the Sec-<br />
retaryship if he had chose. That was<br />
one of the best offices in the country.<br />
The leader of the Government said, he<br />
(Mr. W.) had no right to expose matters<br />
in Council, but hoped, when he was<br />
charged with falsehood and with being<br />
bought, he had a right.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL though that<br />
he (Mr. W.) had a right to explain all<br />
matters that touched on his resignation ; <br />
but what took place in Council was as<br />
binding upon him as himself (Att'y Gen.)<br />
They were both called upon to form the<br />
Government. They had worked together<br />
for months, and he was now as much<br />
bound to preserve silence as to what took<br />
place in the Government as any member <br />
of it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER—If his conduct was im-<br />
pugned, had he not a right to explain?<br />
Most certainly he had.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT proceeded to quote<br />
from his letter of resignation, February<br />
21st, concerning the differences between<br />
himself and the leader of the Govern-<br />
ment as to the composition of the COuncil<br />
at its formation. He could have taken<br />
the Provincial Secretaryship if he had <br />
chosen. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE.—Why did he not <br />
take it?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT.—Because he was not<br />
disposed to be a more jack in the box, to<br />
move as the strings were pulled. When<br />
he saw the course the leader was pursu-<br />
ing, he came to the conclusion that the<br />
Government would not last long, and he<br />
would tell him (Att'y Gen.) to-day, if he<br />
could not carry his man. Such was the<br />
difference of opinion on the first forma-<br />
tion, that he came to the conclusion not to<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go into
the Government at all, and return-<br />
ed home, when a messenger came to<br />
him in his house at Belmont, sum-<br />
moning him to Saint John. It was<br />
then that he should return at the close of the <br />
session, and take the Audit Office. After<br />
having been so long in different Govern<br />
ments as Provincial Secretary and Sur-<br />
veyor General, he thought, if a death<br />
vacancy occurred in the Audit Office, he<br />
had as much right to it as any other man.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">After it was agreed that he should have<br />
the Audit Office, a resolution was moved<br />
in the House last Session to reduce the <br />
salary, and it was agreed that the matter<br />
should be referred to the Executive Coun-<br />
cil to deal with. After that, Mr. McClel-<br />
an, a member of the Opposition, moved<br />
that the salary should be reduced from<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£500 to</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£100, and then the leader of the <br />
Government got up and said the House<br />
had a right to fix the salary. When he<br />
saw the leader of the Government take<br />
that course, and vote for the reduction of<br />
the salary after the question had, by pre-<br />
vious resolution, been referred to the Ex-<br />
ecutive Council, he was very much aston-<br />
shed.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTORNEY
GENERAL.</span>—Did he<br />
not, in conversation with him (Mr. W.)<br />
about the Audit Office, say that he<br />
thought the salary of £300 was too high,<br />
and the £400 was sufficient, that it was<br />
competent for the House to fix the<br />
amount.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT had no doubt about the<br />
right of the House to fix the salary, but<br />
what he objected to as that the leader<br />
of the Government should, after the re-<br />
solution was passed referring the matter<br />
to the Executive Council, have taken the <br />
course he did. If the leader of the Gov-<br />
ernment chose to arrogate to himself the<br />
whole Government, he was not disposed<br />
to submit.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. He had<br />
put a plain question to him (Mr. W.)—<br />
did he not tell him that the salary was too <br />
much.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT. The question ought<br />
to have been referred to the Executive<br />
Council. That was not the only cause of<br />
his dissatisfaction with the leader of the <br />
Government. What had caused his friend<br />
Mr. Anglin to resign but the fact that<br />
the Attorney General took upon himself<br />
the authority of the whole Govern-<br />
ment and the Lieutenant Governor when <br />
he signed the agreement about Western<br />
Extension. He (Mr. W.) did not, under<br />
the circumstances, care to take office, as he<br />
was no prepared to live under a despo-<br />
tism, and he certainly thought that an act<br />
of despotism.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. He thought<br />
the Government would see the unfairness<br />
of the course the hon. member was tak-<br />
ing. He (Mr. W.) was as much respon-<br />
sible for the acts that took place in Coun-<br />
cil as he (Attorney General) was. He<br />
would ask did Mr. Wilmot ever complain<br />
in Council that he had noted despotically <br />
in this matter.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT. When the action that<br />
led to the resignantion of Mr. Anglin took<br />
place he was in Canada, but he reserved <br />
his right to protest.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. Did he<br />
(Mr. W.) protest when he explained the<br />
transaction. Did he not approve of the <br />
course he (Attorney General) had taken.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT. He did not approve.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL explained<br />
that he had written the paper of agree-<br />
ment regarding Western Extension,<br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">knowing
the minds of all his colleagues,<br />
and it was necessary to do it imme-<br />
diately, as Mr. Parks and Mr. Skinner<br />
were obliged to go to Boston.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. WILMOT.
He was in Canada<br />
at the time. When he returned and<br />
heard of the transaction, he expressed<br />
his opinion to Mr. Anglin, and he then<br />
reserved his right to protest against the<br />
whole affair.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTORNEY
GENERAL. Answer</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this
question. Did he (Mr. W.) express</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to him
(Attorney General) when they</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">met, any
dissatisfaction?</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. WILMOT.
He expressed his opin-<br />
ion of the matter in Mr. Troop's office, and<br />
he certainly did not approve of the ac-<br />
tion of the leader of the Government.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ATTORNEY
GENERAL. Did he<br />
(Mr. W.) disapprove of it to him.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. WILMOT.
He most unques-<br />
tionably did not approve.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR.
WETMORE. He recollected,<br />
when the outrage committed by the At-<br />
torney General occurred,</span> meeting Mr. <br />
Wilmot, when he spoke in terms of en-<br />
tire disapprobation of the conduct of<br />
the Attorney General in taking charge<br />
of the country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. He wanted <br />
to know when he told Mr. Wilmot the cir-<br />
cumstances under which he gave the<br />
paper to Mr. Skinner if he did not ap-<br />
prove of it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT. Certainly not.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL. Did he<br />
disapprove of it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT was certainly not in the <br />
habit of approving of what he did not<br />
know. The leader of the Government<br />
and himself, in fact, never could agree.<br />
He never could even get a local matter<br />
passed through Council without a fight,<br />
and he now felt perfectly satisfied to be<br />
out of the Government. Mr. Wilmot<br />
proceeded to speak of the Union of the <br />
Colonies. In Canada he had expressed<br />
his opinion that some Union must take<br />
place. He saw many reasons that made<br />
him come to that conclusion. He saw<br />
the United States were determined to<br />
abolish the Reciprocity Treaty and that<br />
there would be an opportunity of opening<br />
up a large trade between the Provinces.<br />
He also saw that in consequence of the<br />
unsettled condition of the United States,<br />
and the high taxation there, the Maritime<br />
Provinces would be a better field for e i-<br />
gation, and they would have the advan-<br />
tage in the shipping trade. His view at <br />
first was that the Lower Provinces had<br />
nothing to send to Canada ; but now,<br />
that they had a right to make treaties<br />
with other British Colonies and with for-<br />
eign nations, a large and profitable trade<br />
would spring up.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Wilmot proceeded to say that the<br />
Government were now a Confederation<br />
Government. Their conversation had been<br />
very sudden. It had taken place between<br />
the 19th of February, when his resigna-<br />
tion was accepted, and the 8th of March,<br />
when the House opened. In his last con-<br />
versation with the leader of the Govern-<br />
ment, that gentleman said ; rather than<br />
consent to the Quebec Scheme, he was<br />
determined to go down with the ship. He<br />
could not understand what influences had<br />
been at work to bring about so sudden a<br />
change of opinion.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. McMILLAN.—What ship did he<br />
mean?  The Anti ship?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT.—Yes. He would <span class="unclear" title="“unreadable">?</span><br />
