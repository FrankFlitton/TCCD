<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> in England, so that we have not a sin- <br />
gle member in the Government at pre-<br />
sent. (Mr. Smith —No injustice will <br />
be done to the North.) I am glad to <br />
hear it, but I am very sceptical about it. <br />
I have been for many years in opposi- <br />
tion to the Government, but I have al- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ways</span> been ready to give them a <br />
hearty support in any measure which<br />
I believed to be right They have not<br />
done right in leaving the important<br />
office of Auditor General unfilled. The<br />
accounts may have been well audited,<br />
the gentleman who occupies the office<br />
may have discharged his duty faithfully,<br />
but I do not think, as the matter stands,<br />
he can make such a report of the ac-<br />
counts as ought to have the entire con-<br />
fidence of the country. He is not fur-<br />
nished with the materials to examine the<br />
accounts in such a way as ought to be<br />
done. Then again, we have reason to<br />
find fault with the Government for in-<br />
curring the heavy expense of delega-<br />
tion to England on a useless mission.<br />
A despatch was written the 12th of<br />
April last, to be laid before this House.<br />
That despatch must have been received<br />
at the opening of the Legislature, and<br />
any person looking at it would say,<br />
that anything we could do by delegation<br />
could be effected by a despatch of the<br />
Government. They certainly have not<br />
done anything to change the views of<br />
the Bristish Government on confedera-<br />
tion. In order to carry out that dele-<br />
gation, the country had to give up the<br />
services of the Attorney General for<br />
three months, and incur an expense of<br />
£700, which is a large sum of money to<br />
throw away without receiving an equiv-<br />
alent. I spoke and voted against that<br />
delegation, and I disapprove of it yet<br />
There is a matter connected with out<br />
debentures, coupons, and other matters<br />
lying in various hands. He might have<br />
made some arrangements about having<br />
them taken up and destroyed, but I fear<br />
it was not done. There are £17,000 of<br />
our debentures which fall due the 1st<br />
April, and we have debentures lying in<br />
St. John which are not accessible to the<br />
public. A large amount of money will<br />
be required which will have to be paid<br />
in new debentures, and those new de-<br />
bentures should be sold in this country<br />
so as to save so much interest to the<br />
country.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—Is my hon. friend<br />
not aware that there are £16,000 in de-<br />
bentures in the treasury at St. John<br />
which have been there four weeks.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. KERR.—I am aware of that<br />
fact. I took down money to purchase<br />
some of those debentures, and was told<br />
no person was authorized to sell them.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR.—Those debentures are<br />
kept in the treasury for the purpose of<br />
exchanging them for those that fall due<br />
in May. We had no occasion to raise<br />
money upon them. If our debentures<br />
were absorbed in New Brunswick we<br />
would not have to draw £5,000 sterling<br />
<span class="unclear">?</span> the
interest on our rail-<br />
road <span class="unclear">?</span> along
Canada being in-<br />
debt, are we not £6,000,000 in debt, and<br />
only <span class="unclear">?</span> piece
of railroad to show<br />
for it. (Mr. Needham—who built it?)<br />
A larger amount of money was ex-<br />
pended in building it than it was worth<br />
and it <span class="unclear">?</span>
upon the Province<br />
for <span class="unclear">?</span> debt
of £70,000 currency<br />
annually, which was what we owe<br />
besides, gives us a debt for which we<br />
have to pay £88,000 per annum. This<br />
is a heavy charge for the few public<br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_8" title="bbox 708 225 1275 554">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> works we have. We are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">owing</span> that <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> money, and when that money is falling <br />
due we should look ahead and see where <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the means</span> are to come from to pay
it.
<br />
There should be no default in paying the <br />
interest in England, for if they lose con- <br />
fidence in us, our debentures will <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span>
<br />
down in the British market. I desire <br />
to see these debentures placed where <br />
the people can get them, if that can be<br />
done without any risk of the public<br />
funds of the country. We hear a great<br />
deal said about the theory of union. I<br />
do not know what this theory is. There<br />
was a delegation appointed last session<br />
to effect a union of the Maritime Pro-<br />
vinces. I do not know whether it was<br />
done to keep up some sort of appear-<br />
ance, or whether there was any inten-<br />
tion to effect such a nation. I have never<br />
heard of anything being done.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SMITH—It was distinctly<br />
understood that we were requested to do<br />
it by Nova Scotia.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. KERR—That may be the case,<br />
but it stands recorded upon the Journals<br />
of our House. We have no assurance<br />
that they intend to bring down any scheme<br />
of union, and as I believe Confederation<br />
must ultimately be carried, I intend to<br />
give my assistance to any improvement<br />
upon the Quebec Scheme; but at the<br />
same time I believe the Quebec Scheme<br />
as it is, is better for us than to be alone.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. CORAM—I am here to-day an<br />
independent representative of the City and<br />
County of St. John. I have no other ob-<br />
jects in supporting any Government than<br />
the best interests of my country. What<br />
is the indictment brought against this<br />
Government? A great many arguments<br />
have been brought forward by members<br />
on both sides, and a great many charges<br />
made in a rambling way, without proving<br />
one single point. I cannot see why the<br />
present Government cannot carry on the<br />
business of the country as well as a new<br />
Government could. If I have not been<br />
misinformed, the mover of the Amend-<br />
ment has always been finding fault and<br />
bringing a vote of want of confidence<br />
against every Government of which he is<br />
not a member himself. This being the<br />
leader that some other gentlemen have.<br />
I was elected to oppose the Quebec<br />
Scheme, and I am in the confidence of<br />
those who sent me here. If I change my<br />
views, it is my duty to tender my resig-<br />
nation; until I do that, I will carry out<br />
the views of those who sent me here by<br />
supporting the present Government.<br />
When we look at the indictment and lift<br />
the veil, we see nothing but Confederation<br />
under it, and the object is to carry out<br />
the Quebec Scheme as it was, is, and<br />
shall be. We should not go into Confed-<br />
eration until the route of the Intercolo-<br />
nial Railroad is settled and put under<br />
seal, so that it cannot be altered. A<br />
reason given why we should go into Con-<br />
federation is that we would be better pro-<br />
tected; we would have soldiers sent down<br />
to guard us by night against Fenians.<br />
I do not believe there would be one<br />
<span class="unclear">?</span> down from
Canada to defend.<br />
<span class="unclear">?</span> New
Brunswick. Will going<br />
into Confederation make us more loyal?<br />
No, I am just as loyal as ever <span class="unclear">?</span><br />
for I am prepared to <span class="unclear">?</span><br />
defend the <span class="unclear">?</span><br />
and the liberty <span class="unclear">?</span><br />
this <span class="unclear">?</span><br />
results will allow <span class="unclear">?</span><br />
all men to live in friendship and move, in-<br />
stead of hatred and strife. It is our duty<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> protect all men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when we</span> can, whether <br />
they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Protestants</span> or
Catholics, but if <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> come <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> the laws of my coun- <br />
try, I will put them down. A <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">charge</span>
<br />
brought against the Government is the <br />
great expense of the delegation going to <br />
England. At the last sitting of the Le- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gislature </span>a majority of the
House decid-<br />
ed to send a delegation to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span>
and <br />
they went according to the wishes of the <br />
House and the people. Why should we <br />
condemn the Government, before the <br />
correspondence between the Government <br />
and the Mother Country is laid before the<br />
House? They have not brought any ev- <br />
idence to prove they have done wrong in <br />
this particular. When the documents <br />
are produced, if they have not done ac- <br />
cording to the wishes of the people, I <br />
will vote <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span> them. I will
try them <br />
before condemning them. I like to see fair <br />
play and justice dealt out to
every man. <br />
With regards to railroads, that is a ques-<br />
<br />
tion with which I will deal when it comes <br />
before the House in proper shape. When<br />
they are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called</span> upon for the
agreement in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to Western Extension, then
I
will <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do</span> my best to sustain them or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> against <br />
theme as I think proper. Another com- <br />
plaint was, why was not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
House called <br />
together sooner? Where is the damage <br />
done? We know the Attorney General <br />
was at Washington negotiating regarding <br />
the Reciprocity Treaty, and we should <br />
not condemn him betore he brings his do- <br />
cuments before the Home so that we <br />
can see whether he has carricd out the <br />
trust reposed in him. On these <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grounds</span><br />
I think the indictments are wrong, there- <br />
fore I cannot condemn the
Government <br />
without a fair trial.<br />

<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slow</span>
in this debate, I will occupy but <br />
little time. I am not in the habitat of ma- <br />
king long speeches to place myself be-<br />
fore my constituents. When <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span>
House <br />
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst formed, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> people were called <br />
upon to decide one of the greatest ques-

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ferent</span> Provinces, and laid before

When the House was dissolved, I was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">determined</span> not to offer as a

that occasion, but from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pressure</span>
of <br />
circumstances, I came to the conclusion <br />
that, as this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> was
agitating the <br />
minds of the people, and they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having</span>
<br />
elected me three times before, I would<br />
come forward and advocate my princi-<br />

friend (Mr. Kerr) says if this Government<br />
was turned out, the prospects of Confed- <br />
eration would be almost certain. He has <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">good</span> reason for saying so, and I
look <br />
upon him with honor, as carrying out the<br />
principles advocated by him on the hust-<br />
ings. When I came forward to advocate <br />
my principles, I declared myself an anti- Confederate, and my reason for going<br />
against this amendment is to maintain<br />
