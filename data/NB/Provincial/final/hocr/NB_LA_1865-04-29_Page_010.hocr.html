done by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Government. Our
staple ex- <br />
ports <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ships</span> and deals are depressed and<br />
likely to continue so. I am informed that <br />
there are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ship</span> building
companies formed <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> Scotland and the
Isle of <br />
Man, that will supply the whole world. In <br />
the North of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Europe</span> they only
have one- <br />
third of the distance to carry their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lum-</span>
<br />
ber, and they can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">afford</span> to
undersell <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us in the British market. I believe <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> must he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done, and</span> I believe that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> is, connection with the
United <br />
States. If I differ from men more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ad-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vanced</span> in years, and with more
experi- <br />
ence I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> help <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> I believe that if <br />
there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> any section going to be
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">beneﬁt-</span> <br />
ed by this railroad, it is the North Shore. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I recollect</span> moving a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution</span> in 1858 <br />
finding fault <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with the Government for
not <br />
answering a communication from Nova <br />
Scotia <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">respecting </span>the extension
of their <br />
lines to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meet</span> ours, they having
to build <br />
65 miles and we 62. I was then in favor <br />
of continuing our Railroad from Hali- <br />
fax to St. John ; but now I think this <br />
country is altered in circumstances. I<br />
now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">think</span> it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> to extend the line to <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United States</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">All</span>
our exports, with <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exception of ship</span> building
and the <br />
deal <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">trade,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lies with </span>the United States. <br />
And it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> the enterprise of
Americans that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">develope</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> resources of the country. If <br />
this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">road</span> is built there will be
a large <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount</span> of trade between the two
coun- <br />
tries. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Suppose</span> there is a
steamer running <br />
every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">other day from Restigouche to
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway</span> ex<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tending</span> to the United States. <br />
Every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">salmon</span> o poor man catches
there <br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span> worth $2. We have got
to turn <br />
our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attention</span> to something else
besides <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">building</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ships</span> and manufacturing deals. <br />
I think we could have connection with <br />
the United States by paying very little <br />
more intere<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">st</span> than we now pay ;
we are <br />
now <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paying</span> 6 per cent, when we
should <br />
get it for three or four per <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cent.</span>
Even if <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we have</span> to pay six per cent, I
believe in <br />
four or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">five</span> years it would be a
paying <br />
property. There is a great deal of talk <br />
about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation.</span> It is said
we must <br />
go into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">confederation.</span> or
annexation. It <br />
is a cowardly proposition to put forward <br />
against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> who are opposed to
the <br />
Scheme. I am not afraid of annexation <br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">United</span> States ; not that
I think this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> able to cope with the United <br />
States <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in</span> warfare ; but I can
say we are <br />
able, very materially, to assist Great Bri- <br />
tain. If we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> be at war, it
will be <br />
Great Britain's quarrel and not ours, and <br />
it will be time enough for us to meet it <br />
then.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> sible. In 1853 arrangements were made<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with
Peto, Betts, Brassy &amp; Co., for the<br />
construction of the European and North<br />
American Railway, for which they were<br />
to receive the sum of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£6,500</span> a
mile ; <br />
part to be paid by the bonds of this coun- <br />
try, and part by public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">lands</span>
along the <br />
line. This <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span> was
entered into <br />
in good faith with a responsible company, <br />
who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> built a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">large</span> amount of rail- <br />
ways in Europe and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on this</span>
continent. <br />
They came and performed a certain <br />
amount of work on that railway. The <br />
Government in 1856 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e</span>ntered into
an ar- <br />
rangement to purchase the work plant<br />
and every thing connected with it, for <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£90,000. </span>They also passed
certain laws <br />
for the construction of railroads from the <br />
State <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> Maine to Shediac, from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thence</span> to <br />
Miramichi, and from thence to Wood- <br />
stock. According to that law it the main <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">line</span> was completed there was a
certain <br />
sum to be expended upon those two bran- <br />
ches. This was all done in good faith, <br />
and the people of the North supported the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition, for</span> the arrangement
was bene- <br />
cial for them, and beneﬁcial to the in- <br />
terests of the whole Province. Subse- <br />
quently the House passed a resolution <br />
to strike off those two branches, thereby <br />
the law to affect only the main line from <br />
Shediac to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">State</span> of Maine.
By that <br />
law the Government had power to build <br />
the road as a Government work, and by <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so</span> doing it has cost the Province
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /></span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£</span></span></span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">11,000</span> <br />
per mile, instead of £6,500 sterling, only <br />
a portion of which was to have come out <br />
of the revenue of the country. This should <br />
open our eyes in regard to the con- <br />
struction of railways by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government.</span>
By <br />
the Speech the Government say <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
<br />
would undertake the work if the exist- <br />
ing laws presented no obstacle, and the <br />
state of the ﬁnances permitted ; and  I <br />
have no doubt but what they would com- <br />
mence the work and carry it on, without <br />
squandering the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money</span>
unnecessarily, for <br />
I have great conﬁdence in the Govern- <br />
ment. Although I was elected to support </span><br />
Confederation,</span>
yet I have announced my<br />
principles as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Conservative,</span>
and I am <br />
prepared to support the present Govern- <br />
ment, for I believe they are principally all <br />
conservatives (cries of O, no, and laugh- <br />
ter.) Two years ago we entered into an <br />
arrangement with Canada and Nova <br />
Scotia for the construction of the Inter- <br />
coionial Railway. Nova Scotia and New <br />
Brunswick passed the Bill for that pur- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pose, but</span> Canada rejected it.
Last
winter <br />
a pressure was brought against the Gov- <br />
ernment to induce them to repeal that <br />
act, so that a measure could be brought <br />
forward for the purpose of carrying on <br />
the line to the United States ; ﬁnally a <br />
n Bill was brought in, which was termed <br />
by Mr. Gilbert the Lobster <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Bill,</span>
which <br />
provided for railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">extension</span>
all
over the <br />
Province. That Bill is now the law of <br />
the land ; that Bill gives a facility of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$10,-</span>
<br />
000 a mile to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">any</span> company that
would <br />
construct those roads. Subsequently to <br />
that Mr. Reynolds applied for an Act of <br />
Incorporation to extend the line from St. <br />
John <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">westward ; that</span> act is now
inopera- <br />
tive. So that if Mr. Parks should relin- <br />
quish his claim, there would be nothing <br />
to prevent the Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
carry- <br />
ing on the work of Western Extension. <br />
Now I am not prepared to give them that <br />
power. It would be a curse to the coun- <br />
try to have it built as a government mea-
<br />
sure. I would give companies every faci- <br />
lity, and grant them any amount of money ? <br />
the ﬁnances of the country would warrant <br />
me in giving, but I shall withhold my <br />
consent from placing the whole construc- <br />
tion of the railway in the hands of the <br />

of that in the European and North Ameri- <br />

submitting the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. Mr. HUTCHISON.—I came from</span><br />

<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question,</span> or if so it will be
only a dis- <br />agreement <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />in words, and not
in substance. <br />
I think the amendment and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paragraph</span>
are <br />
pretty much alike. I did not suppose there <br />
would be such a cavil about words. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Look</span>
<br />
at that paragraph ; is there any thing in it <br />
of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> any hon. member can be
afraid. <br />
I am as much against the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
constructing <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pub</span>lic works as
any man in <br />
the House. Our ﬁnances are not in a <br />
condition to go on with these works, even <br />
if there were no companies in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existence.</span>
<br />
How can we give facilities when we have <br />
no money. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CORAM.—I</span>
was much surprised to <br />
see that amendment moved. There is no <br />
danger of the people of this country being <br />
driven out of the Province if the resolu- <br />
tion was carried. They should have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">brought</span> in a resolution to go on
with the <br />
work immediately. They say there are <br />
laws in existence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which prevent</span>
them. If <br />
the company formed to build Western <br />
Extension had twelve months allowed <br />
them to get subscribers to take up stock,<br />
the Government did right to mention it <br />
in the speech. The twelve months now <br />
are almost up, and there are no signs of a <br />
Railroad being constructed between St. <br />
John and the United States. It is stated <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> there is no money paid into
the <br />
revenue from the Railroad ; that there <br />
has been an extravagant expenditure on <br />
the ﬁrst line established in the Province. <br />
It need not be so now ; we have the bene-<br />
fit of past experience, and know where <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">improvements</span> can be made. If a
man <br />
enters a branch of business and loses his <br />
capital, it will caution him to be more on <br />
his guard. It is so with the expenditure <br />
on Railroads. When this line is built we <br />
will have the beneﬁt of the past experi- <br />
ence of the Engineers who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">worked</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on the</span> previous road. If the road
from <br />
St. John cost <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$40,000</span> a mile, it
is no rea- <br />
son why the branch running <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
the United <br />
States should cost as much, or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
branch <br />
running to Nova Scotia. If the company <br />
having a reasonable time allowed them, <br />
and the President of the company says, <br />
we are not prepared to carry out the ar- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rangements,</span> why should not the
Govern- <br />
ment take up the work and go on with <br />
it ? The time has come now to go ahead <br />
and not be pulling <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">back.</span> If the
