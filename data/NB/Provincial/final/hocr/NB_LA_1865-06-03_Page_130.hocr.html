do not believe that we are in danger of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">being </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">attached</span> by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> United States. <br />
Every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expression</span> of sentiment by
the <br />
leaders of public opinion in that country <br />
is opposed to such a course. We heard <br />
Henry Ward Beecher, on the ﬁrst day <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span>
<br />
the present year, saying to his congrega- <br />
tion : " I am not for war with any nation, <br />
and that man is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">my friend</span>
who de- <br />
clares war against the people of our <br />
Fatherland. All that is dearest to us, of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what we brought</span> hither, we
brought from <br />
thence, Laws and Institutions, and Chris- <br />
tian civilization, and woe be to the day <br />
that begets estrangement between the <br />
Christians of England and the Christians <br />
of America !" We hear Secretary Seward, <br />
when addressing the crowd who were <br />
congratulating him on the surrender of <br />
General Lee, saying that as long as Cana- <br />
da preferred remaining under the rule of <br />
her noble Que<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">en,</span> to voluntary
incorpora- <br />
tion in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> United States, she
was safe <br />
from attack from them. But in case of <br />
invasion, how shall we be secured in Con- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">federation.</span> It is proposed to
expend a <br />
million dollars for defence. Why that is <br />
just about six hours of the expenditure by <br />
the American Government during the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">last</span>
<br />
two <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years—they</span> have averaged
over two <br />
millions per day; during the last week the <br />
tramps of two hundred thousand men <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
<br />
resounded thro' the streets of Washington, <br />
besides the tens of thousands of soldiers <br />
scattered from Maine to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Rio Grande.</span>
<br />
We should have two thousand miles of <br />
sea coast, and three thousand miles of <br />
land and lake frontier. Can Canada send <br />
us assistance <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">when</span> she has two
and a half <br />
millions of people, and the very States <br />
touching her frontier contain twelve mil- <br />
lions ? Can we in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span>
with <br />
three millions of people defend ourselves <br />
against thirty millions, who have, by so <br />
many railroads and other means of com- <br />
munication such power of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">concentrating</span>
<br />
their forces on our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">borders ?</span> If
they have <br />
ten times our population have they not <br />
far more than ten times our power in all <br />
other resources of war, wealth and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">supplies,</span> and all the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vast</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">implements</span>
<br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">machinery</span> for warfare. But
shall <br />
we fall back on the old exploded false- <br />
hood, that the Yankees will not ﬁght ? <br />
that one Englishman or Provincial would <br />
be equal to three. Has history taught us <br />
nothing ? Are we not descended from <br />
the one race ? A branch of that great Ar- <br />
gan race, who from its earliest traditions in <br />
remote antiquity were a ﬁghting people. <br />
Starting from the remote regions of Cen- <br />
tral Asia, whither in their migrations they <br />
overran the plains of Hindostan, or the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forests</span> of Germany, wherever they
laid <br />
their hands upon a people, it was the <br />
hand of a conqueror. And is not the <br />
Anglo Saxon the noblest branch from that <br />
race, either in the arts of war or of peace. <br />
I could never see why the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Englishman,</span>
<br />
the Irishman, the German, would not, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> the same discipline fight as
well upon<br />
the western shore of the Atlantic, as upon <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the Eastern ;</span> and I could never
see why <br />
an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imaginary</span> line of frontier
should make <br />
the Provincials so much better men than <br />
their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> neighbors. But
because <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> such heavy odds against us,
I do not <br />
think that we should be able to repel an <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">invasion from the Uni</span>ted States.
I do <br />
not wish the gentlemen upon the opposite<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">side </span>of this question to think <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the</span> <br />
wish is father to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the thought. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that it were otherwise, more than any-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing earthly. I could desire that my</span><br />
own Province and country was strong<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
enough to defy attack from any quarter.<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would

WETMORE.—I do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wish</span> to be <br />
understood as stating my own merits, but <br />
having been returned by the grand empo- <br />
rium of this Province, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> feel I
would but <br />
ill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">discharge</span> my duty, being
placed to the <br />
high position which I occupy, did I not <br />
express my views on this great scheme of <br />
Confederation. It is true the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">matter</span>
has <br />
been handled politically, commercially, <br />
and ﬁnancially, very ably by the hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentlemen</span> who have spoken on the
ques- <br />
tion. I will not take up the time by go- <br />
ing into minute details, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but</span>
shall express <br />
my views brieﬂy and generally against the <br />
Scheme. In the first place it is said that <br />
there is no need of a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation,</span>
because <br />
the people of England are aware that the <br />
grand scheme of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation has</span>
been <br />
defeated. It might be sufficient that the <br />
British Government in the exercise of <br />
their powers will have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span>
for <br />
the constitutional rights which we have. <br />
But this is a matter on which discretion <br />
is to be exercised. It is said the appoint- <br />
ment of this delegation is a concession to <br />
Confederation ; in like manner the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">build-</span>
<br />
ing of Penitentiaries is a concession to <br />
criminals. We have a law in this land to <br />
prevent the commission of crime ; but <br />
would a man, if he thought his house <br />
was going to be destroyed, if he did not <br />
take a reasonable means of defence, lie <br />
down on his bed satisfied as if the law was <br />
going to protect him ? I feel that where <br />
the constituency of this country has been <br />
maligned every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">effort</span> should be
made to <br />
protect our rights and our homes in the <br />
land in which we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">live.</span> It has
been
said <br />
by several hon. gentlemen that those who <br />
have been returned on the Anti-Confeder- <br />
ate ticket have been returned by the rab- <br />
ble. Several times this basest of slanders <br />
has been uttered. I have been returned <br />
as one of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">representatives</span> of
St. John, <br />
and I can say I have not been returned <br />
by a rabble. I represent more intelligence, <br />
wealth and independence than the Con- <br />
federation party can begin to boast of. It <br />
is a base, malignant slander, got up for <br />
the basest of purposes. I possess little <br />
influence in St. John, and was opposed to<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men who held high positions, men of po-<br />
litical standing who brought political and<br />
monetary influence to bear, and who had<br />
experience in elections for a number of<br />
years ; therefore it required a large amount<br />
of intelligence to return me to this posi-<br />
tion which I have the honor to hold. The<br />
election was not held upon any backsliding<br />
of the former Government ; it was con-<br />
ducted upon the question of Confedera-<br />
tion, or no Confederation. The Govern-<br />
ment had some slight amount of backslid-<br />
ings, but they sunk into insignificance and<br />
were never spoken of during the election ;<br />
our thoughts then were to protect our<br />
homes where we lived, for we felt they<br />
were about to be sacrificed. It may have<br />
been that the Government thought this<br />
Scheme was absolutely necessary for the<br />
interests of the people, or it may have<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">been that
designing men were seeking to<br />
aggrandize themselves at the expense of<br />
the dearest rights of the people ; that was<br />
the question, and it was the all-absorbing<br />
question, and fair, reasonable, and proper<br />
men were taken to explain to the people<br />
the nature of this Confederation, and the<br />
effect it would have upon the community.<br />
It was said that the Hon. President of the<br />
Council went about the country promis-<br />
ing offices to people to support his<br />
party, but wherever that gentleman's<br />
voice was heard, there was a declaration<br />
made in the papers that all he said</span><br />
amounted to nothing, and the people <br />
that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">advocated</span> that scheme were
the <br />
people that must be returned to repre- <br />
sent the interests of this Province. If <br />
that was the case, is it a reasonable pro- <br />
position to suppose that any individual<br />
could hold out inducements to persons <br />
to join the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposition.</span> There
was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a fair</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">canvass.</span> I had something to do
with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
the election in St. John, and I never <br />
knew a fairer canvass conducted in my <br />
life. Public Meeetings were held by <br />
each party. While I say there was no <br />
influence on the part of the opposition, <br />
I may say all the Government influe<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nce</span>
<br />
was used ; every thing was done that <br />
could be done to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">retain</span> the
offices which <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">held.</span> Was not this
celebrated <br />
“Cole's Island“ operationa Government <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">inﬂuence.</span> Were these men aware
that<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
the voice of the people should be the<br />
voice of the Government? Where the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> had expressly declared
that no<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> <br />
such undertaking would be conducive <br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> of the people. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">I</span> cannot <br />
conceive how men, elected under the <br />
principles of responsible Government, <br />
can prostrate that influence, and use the <br />
people‘s money for electioneering pur- <br />
poses. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> is said that the views
of the <br />
people of this Province have entirely <br />
changed on this question ; it is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well</span>
<br />
to put forth this assertion, but we have <br />
to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">exercise</span> our own judgement
whether <br />
to believe it or not. The late Solicitor <br />
General, in the City in which he lives, <br />
was proverbial for his popularity, and <br />
the greatest amount of sympathy was<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />
<br />
felt for him when he lost his election <br />
and had to give up his office ; since then <br />
he was a candidate for the office of May- <br />
or in St. John ; his talents, integrity, and </span><br />
</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the length of time he had liv</span>ed there <br />
gave him great influence, every effort <br />
was made to secure his election ; at the <br />
election of representatives he received <br />
1400 votes in the City of St. John, but <br />
now after this<span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /> Confederation
scheme <br />
has been defeated, and the influence of <br />
the Government withdrawn, he received <br />
but 300 <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vot</span>es. Does this show
that those <br />
who were Confederates have altered <br />
their opinions and are now against the  <br />
scheme? It has been said by my hon.  <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">friend from the County of Albert that<br />
the election was a matter of accident.<br />
I think it was so. I believe it was the<br />
intention of the leader of the Government<br />
not to submit this to the consideration of<br />
the people at all. It has been said that<br />
when these delegates returned from Can-<br />
ada they anticipated that there was a ma-<br />
jority in the House of Assembly who<br />
would carry this measure through. If it<br />
was the intention to submit it to the peo-<br />
ple, why was this election held over in the</span><br />
County of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Northumberland ?</span> It is said
<br />
that this delegation is not required ; that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Home Government</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">know</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that the</span>
peo- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ple of this Province have pronounce</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against the Scheme.</span> It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">might as well </span>be <br />said, what is the use of the Canadians <br />
sending home a delegation ? The&nbsp; Home <br />
Government know that the Canadians have <br />
