<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed
resolutions concerning a Federal<br />
Union, and they can be signed and for-<br />
warded to them. When the Canadian<br />
delegates met at Halifax there was a torch<br />
light procession took place ; what had they<br />
done for Nova Scotia that they should be<br />
accorded this honor ? Was it not done<br />
to influence the public in England, and<br />
lead them to believe that a reaction had<br />
taken place ? Why did not the Govern-<br />
ment of Nova Scotia bring in the ques-<br />
tion, and propound it as a Government<br />
measure? or if they were not satisfied<br />
without submitting it to the people, why<br />
did not they dissolve the House, and get<br />
an expression of opinion from the people ?<br />
It was because they knew beyond the<br />
shadow of a doubt, that it must be de-<br />
feated. Then in regard to the Intercolo-<br />
nial Railway ; a fair and equitable arrange-<br />
ment as could be made between man and<br />
man was made between the Provinces for<br />
the construction of that road. This road<br />
would have been of great advantage to<br />
the people of Nova Scotia, though I doubt<br />
whether it would help us much ; yet that<br />
agreement having been made, it was bind-<br />
ing upon all parties, but Canada violated<br />
her trust, and her honor politically had<br />
been scattered to the winds. Then what<br />
had these Canadian delegates done for<br />
Nova Scotia, that they should be honored<br />
with a torch-light procession ? One of<br />
our distinguished men was among that<br />
party, and he was honored in the same<br />
way. What had he done for Nova Scotia ?<br />
What was his position then? Defeated<br />
in his election ; the people had spoken in<br />
a voice of thunder, and said they had no<br />
confidence in his party. Why then this<br />
" torch-light procession?" It was done<br />
that a great outcry might be raised on<br />
the other side of the water ; that the op-<br />
position go their election by accident ;<br />
that the voice of the people was against<br />
them ; that if the question of Confedera-<br />
tion was again submitted to the people<br />
their position would be reversed. This<br />
being the case, is it a proper course to be<br />
silent, because we have expressed our<br />
opinion, and allow those men to make mis-<br />
representations concerning the state of<br />
feeling in this country on that question,<br />
with nobody to counteract their influence;<br />
we must not trust to existing right alone,<br />
but we must take all reasonable precau-<br />
tion. What is the use of troops if people<br />
are to depend upon mere existing right,<br />
without taking means to enforce that right?<br />
Therefore, to send a delegation is a mat-<br />
ter of the greatest importance. I only re-<br />
gret that this delegation had not been sent<br />
a little earlier. With reference to the re-<br />
solutions which authorized those gentle-<br />
men to go to Prince Edward Island to<br />
meet other delegates to discuss a Union<br />
of the Maritime Provinces, I would say<br />
that when I find men disposed to violate<br />
one right, I would be loth to put trust in<br />
them again. We find these men who<br />
were elected on the principles of Respon-<br />
sible Government, and who boasted that<br />
they entertained the confidence of the<br />
people, go forth with the resolutions of<br />
the House of Assembly, and, through<br />
Canadian influence, treat those resolutions<br />
with the most consummate contempt. These<br />
delegates then proceeded to Quebec,<br />
where a meeting took place, not autho-<br />
rized by the people of the Province or by<br />
the British Government, as the Hon. ex-<br />
Surveyor says, for they had left for Que-<br />
bec before the dispatch came out.</span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN.—The Lieutenant<br />
Governor of Nova Scotia when appealed<br />
to by the Governor General, at first re-<br />
fused to send delegates until he could get<br />
authority from Mr. Cardwell. Afterwards<br />
he wrote <span class="unclear" title="smudged, can't see the word">?</span>
the Colonial Secretary, stating<br />
that he was satisfied that the Governor<br />
General was acting with the knowledge<br />
and sanction of the Imperial Government ;<br />
therefore, he had complied with his invita-<br />
tion, and sent delegates to the Conference.<br />
because if he had withheld his consent,<br />
Nova Scotia could not have been repre-<br />
sented. </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCMILLAN.—Was he not aware of<br />
the fact that he was acting under the dis-<br />
patch of 1862?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN.—Although the Lieu-<br />
tenant Governor of Nova Scotia knew<br />
that despatch was in existence, still he<br />
did not feel authorized to send them.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. WETMORE.—The action of those de-<br />
legates was a direct violation of the princi-<br />
ples of Responsible Government, for it<br />
was their business and duty to attend to<br />
what the people sent them to look after,<br />
and that consideration was not given that<br />
should have been given to the voice of the<br />
people of this Province. They treated<br />
those resolutions with the greatest con-<br />
tempt, and in direct violation of them they<br />
go to Canada at great expense to the peo-<br />
ple of this Province, and there mature a<br />
scheme to destroy and sacrifice the coun-<br />
try in which they live. I believe it was<br />
those delegates' intention to cram the<br />
scheme down the throats of the people of<br />
this Province ; therefore, there was an<br />
unpardonable violation of our rights, and<br />
the people did well to express their opin-<br />
ion at the polls. It is said the Govern-<br />
ment of the present day is a matter of<br />
accident ; but I consider it a most fortu-<br />
nate circumstance, for it saved the coun-<br />
try. In reference to this Intercolonial<br />
Railway going to be of so much advantage<br />
to us, I have listened with great attention<br />
to the arguments of many public men ex-<br />
pressed at public meetings at St. John,<br />
and I have endeavored to bring the best<br />
judgment I could to bear upon the sub-<br />
ject, but I failed to discover that we would<br />
commercially derive any benefit from it.<br />
It is said that there is a large amount of<br />
money to be expended upon this road if<br />
we go into Confederation, and it will cost<br />
us a very small amount indeed, but what<br />
is the difference who pays the cost, as they<br />
are going to take our money from us.<br />
Suppose they do expend a large sum of<br />
money in the country, it will be spent<br />
among the railway navvies and contrac-<br />
tors, creating extravagant habits and<br />
causing drinking shops to be set up, thus<br />
doing a wrong and an injury to the<br />
country. What are we going to carry<br />
upon that Railway ? I have listened with<br />
patience, but have listened in vain, to hear<br />
any arguments to prove that we will de-<br />
rive any commercial benefit from it. My<br />
impression is, that it will go by the North<br />
Shore route ; my hon. friend from St.<br />
John thinks it will go by the middle<br />
route. If the Government did not know<br />
by which route it was going, was it fair<br />
between man and man to state to the peo-<br />
ple of the North Shore that it was going<br />
by that route? If it was true, I do not<br />
blame them for getting the benefit of it;<br />
but if it was false, and there was no rea-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">sonable ground for the statement, was it a<br />
fair canvass to make the statement when<br />
they knew it to be false ? Then, again :<br />
was there any thing to justify the asser-<br />
tion that it was going by the Sussex route?<br />
This question of the railway route was a<br />
political fiddle with three strings: there<br />
was the North Shore string, the Central<br />
string, and the Southern string; put that<br />
and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Coles'</span>
Island <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">operation</span> together, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and I say </span>it was not a fair
canvass, for the <br />
question was not treated on the broad <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">p</span>rinciples of
Confederation alone. Then <br />
in reference to the trade on the Interco-<br />
lonial Railway, we have nothing to send<br />
to Canada that they do not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have.</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">It</span> has<br />
been said that our shipping interest will <br />
be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">increased..</span> Who ever <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">heard</span> of a Ca- <br />
nadian buying <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a New</span> Brunswick
ship, or <br />
a New Brunswicker buying a Canadian <br />
ship? We cannot compete with Cana-<br />
dian manufactures, for ours are in an in- <br />
fant state ; this opinion was expressed in <br />
1862 by some of the most prominent ad- <br />
vocates of the present scheme. Suppose <br />
I have a mill on one side of the Resti- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gouche River, and have to pay a heavy <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debt,
and my hon. friend from that county <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span> a mill on the other, free
from debt, <br />
can I compete with him under those cir- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cumstances, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> sell my lumber as cheap <br />
as he can ? If we employ the same num- <br />
ber of hands and the same amount of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">capital, and he gets his logs near his
mill <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and I have to bring mine
from a distance, <br />
I cannot begin to compete
with him. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">S</span>uppose we have
manufacturers in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,
with the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span> facilities and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">same</span><br />
number of hands employed as the Cana- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dians, we cannot sell as cheap as they do, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fact that</span> the
market is in Canada <br />
and we have to pay the cost of
transport. <br />
We have to get our flour from Canada, <br />
and have to pay so much money for it ; <br />
that is the same as if we had to pay so <br />
much debt. But in Canada they produce <br />
their own ﬂour ; therefore, we cannot feed <br />
our operatives as cheaply as they can in <br />
Canada, where they have their flour and <br />
market at their own door. Therefore, we <br />
can send nothing to Canada on this In- <br />
tercolonial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway—neither</span>
will the Ca- <br />
na<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dians</span> send their flour by
that route, be- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cause they can send it much cheaper by <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way
of Portland. Then we are told
that, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in a military point of view, it is im- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">portant
that this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">road</span> should be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constructed, because
the Yankees are <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to gobble us up. It
was anticipated <br />
that the revolution in America was draw- <br />
ing to a close ; and, while they had this <br />
large army unemployed, they would make <br />
an onslaught on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span>
Provinces. I do <br />
not believe for one moment that that great <br />
nation, because
they had the power, would <br />
make power right, and attempt to invade <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">us. What object would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> be
to that <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">mighty</span>
nation to invade these insignificant <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces ; we were told that the
Ameri- <br />
cans were to be upon us immediately, and <br />
we wanted this railway for military pur- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">poses.</span> How long would it take to
con- <br />
struct that railway ? It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span>
not, and <br />
would not be done in ten years ; and it is <br />
not to be supposed that the Americans, if <br />
were rapacious <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">enough</span> to invade
us, <br />
would put their soldiers in camp and feed <br />
them for ten years in order that we could <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">get</span> our railway built, so that we
could <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">send</span> <br />
our soldiers up to Canada to have a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁg</span>ht.
<br />
We are told that “ Union is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength</span>
;"<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doubt</span> some kinds of union are
strength. <br />
I will call the attention of the hon. Pre- <br />
sident of the Council to that fact ; but <br />
there is a union that is not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strength. I</span>
<br />
believe a Commercial Union between<br />
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia would<br />
strength us, as we have been in the  ha- <br />
