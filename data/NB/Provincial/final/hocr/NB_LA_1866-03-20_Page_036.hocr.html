               ATTORNEY GENERAL—He would<br />
never consent to representation by popu-<br />
lation under the Quebec scheme.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT.—Canada would never<br />
consent to forego that principle. Then<br />
he understood the leader of the Govern-<br />
ment to say that he would never go for<br />
any scheme with representation by popu-<br />
lation?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER thought the House ought<br />
to know how the Government stood with<br />
regard to the two principles—Federal<br />
Union and Representation by Population.<br />
The hon. member of St. John (Mr. Wil-<br />
mot,) in arguing on the position of the <br />
Government on the question of union, had<br />
said that in any scheme that was submit-<br />
ted, these two principles must be includ-<br />
ed. It was as well for the House to <br />
understand where they were.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL.—What he<br />
had said was, he would never consent to<br />
representation by population under the <br />
Quebec Scheme. He would go down with<br />
the ship before he would do so. In any <br />
scheme he would support, there must be <br />
something to neutralize the effect of that <br />
principle.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WIMOT.—These two principles<br />
must be included in whatever scheme<br />
was submitted. When he was in Canada <br />
he was told that the Canadian Govern-<br />
ment were prepared to meet that Govern-<br />
ment of New Brunswick on those two<br />
points. He was informed by Mr. George<br />
Brown that he was willing to do so. <br />
When he returned to New Brunswick, he <br />
told his late colleagues of the willingness<br />
of the Canadian Government to confer<br />
with them. He did not do it by writing,<br />
but he did so in conversation.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ATTORNEY GENERAL.—The Gov-<br />
ernment were willing to meet Mr. Brown<br />
at any conference.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT.—He understood the<br />
Government had come to a very different<br />
conclusion. He would now wish to read<br />
the sixth and seventh resolutions passed<br />
by the Confederate Council of Trade, held<br />
in Quebec:—</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">6th. "That in the event of negotiations<br />
for a new Treaty of Reciprocity with the<br />
United States Government, but not con-<br />
cluded before the 17th March next, appli<br />
cation be made to Her Majesty's Govern-<br />
ment, suggesting that an arrangement<br />
be entered into with the United States<br />
Government for such a continuance of<br />
the existing Treaty as may afford time for<br />
concluding the pending negotiations."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">7th. "That Her Majesty's Government<br />
be requested to authorise the members of<br />
this Council or a Committee to be appoint-<br />
ed from amongst them to proceed to<br />
Washington in the event of negotiations<br />
being opened for the renewal of the Reci-<br />
procity Treaty, in order to confer with<br />
the British Minister there, and afford him<br />
information with respect to the interests <br />
of the British North American Pro-<br />
vinces."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">These resolutions were passed at the<br />
Confederate Council, sent off to Her Ma-<br />
jesty's Government, sent back to the<br />
Government in New Brunswick ; and his<br />
report was read in Council, approved of <br />
and adopted. What was done there was<br />
approved here.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Wilmot proceeded to say that he<br />
was in Frederiction, where he met the<br />
Government after they received a telegram<br />
from Sir N. Belleau, communicating the <br />
fact that the Government of Canada pro-<br />
posed sending delegates to Washington,<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">but he was not told of the fact. he<br />
would have been quite willing to forego<br />
his right to proceed as a delegate to<br />
Washington, but he was not willing to<br />
be superceded without even bring referred<br />
to. (Here followed some conversation<br />
between Mr. Wilmot and the Attorney<br />
General, Provincial Secretary, and Hon.<br />
Mr. Hatheway, on the subject of the<br />
meeting of Council in Saint John, at<br />
which the Attorney General was appoint-<br />
ed delegate to Washington.) Mr. Wil-<br />
mot then concluded by saying that he had<br />
now explained the position in which he<br />
stood with regard to the Government.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. HATHEWAY said he would<br />
in all probability address the House long-<br />
er on the present occasion than he had<br />
been in the habit of doing, and he would<br />
ask the indulgence of the hon. members<br />
for the remarks he would make. It might<br />
be that his hon. friend, Mr. Wilmot, in<br />
going out of the Government had taken a <br />
leaf out of his (Mr. H.'s) book. It might<br />
be that his hon. friend saw the clouds<br />
gathering, and a storm coming, and made<br />
haste to escape. It was said that he (Mr. <br />
H.) saw last year which way the tide of<br />
popular opinion was running, and that he<br />
saw a crash was coming, and that he left<br />
the Government just in time to save him-<br />
self. It might be that his hon. friend saw<br />
further into futurity than his late col-<br />
leagues, and had resigned because he<br />
thought another change in the variable<br />
tide of popular opinion would turn the<br />
Government out. His hon. friend said<br />
he had not been anxious to get into the <br />
Government, but he (Mr. H.) thought<br />
that he (Mr. W.) had been dissatisfied to<br />
remain in the Government because he<br />
could not get his own way ; and he be-<br />
lieved that it would have been much bet-<br />
ter for his late colleagues if that hon<br />
member had never entered it, if the Gov-<br />
ernment had had him in the Opposition<br />
from the very commencement. No mem-<br />
ber of the Executive Council could carry<br />
every measure he desired. Difficulties<br />
arose at the first formation of the Gov-<br />
ernment, and he knew well that he and<br />
the present Judge Allen differed in opi-<br />
nion upon a certain question. But were<br />
the whole Council bound to take his<br />
hon. friend's opinion. He had (Mr. H.)<br />
permission, he would like very much to <br />
tell the House the reason his hon. friend<br />
would not take the office of Provincial<br />
Secretary, but he could not, and he would<br />
tell him (Mr. W.) that having from the <br />
first formation worked with his late col-<br />
leagues of the Government, their acts<br />
were his, and the oath of secrecy was as<br />
obligatory on him ; he was as much bound<br />
to preserve silence as to what had tran-<br />
spired in Council as himself or any other<br />
member of it. But what were his col-<br />
league's real reason for resigning? Be-<br />
cause he had been refused the trip to<br />
Washington! Perhaps if he (Mr. W.)<br />
had been present at the Council he would<br />
have urged the appointment. If he had<br />
been sent to Washington he was satisfied<br />
they never would have heard of this ques-<br />
tion of his resignation&nbsp; Mr. H. proceed-<br />
ed to say, that he had a great mind to<br />
tell the House what had taken place in<br />
Council when the Hon. George Brown<br />
was present when the question of Con-<br />
federation was discussed. His hon. friend<br />
Mr. W. had said, that Mr. Brown, when<br />
he saw him in Canada, expressed his<br />
opinion that the Government of Canada<br />
were prepared to meet the Government<br />
of New Brunswick on the details of the <br />
Scheme. But he (Mr. H.) would say<br />
</p>
</div>
         
         
         <div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_4" title="bbox 131 80 749 1724">
            
            
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
               that Mr. Browe in Canada and Mr. Brown<br />
in New Brunswick, were two very differ-<br />
ent men. He (Mr. H.) had seen Mr.<br />
Brown in Canada. He was then quite<br />
willing and prepared to open up the ques-<br />
tion ; but how did the Government find<br />
Mr. Brown in New Brunswick after he<br />
had been subjected to two days influences<br />
from certain quarters, and had been cram-<br />
med with stories of the change of opinion<br />
upon the Quebec Scheme—the country<br />
then being excited about the York elec-<br />
tion—they found him holding off an<br />
saying the Canadian Government cannot<br />
consent to any change, "you must take<br />
it as it is." His hon. friend said the<br />
Governement agreed to give him the office<br />
of Auditor General. No one disputed<br />
his right to go into the office. But he was<br />
offended because the salary had been re-<br />
duced. It was considered that 
               £500 was <br />
too high a salary for the Auditor General<br />
—and he thought
               £400 a year in that <br />
office was a far better salary than £600<br />
a year in any of the Government Depart-<br />
ments. [Mr. Wilmot—had he refused<br />
£400?] It was perfectly well known<br />
that, if the hon. gentleman had chosen to<br />
accept the office, the Government were<br />
prepared to give it to him at the time.<br />
He (Mr. Wilmot) had accused the Attor-<br />
ney General of assuming the whole Gov-<br />
ernment upon his shoulders, and said he<br />
was not prepared to live under a despot-<br />
ism. [Here Mr. H. enetered into some<br />
detail concerning the franchise of the <br />
Government.] But it was entirely out<br />
of his mouth to accuse the Leader of the <br />
Government of having acted despotically.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Government, he proceeded to say, <br />
had been arraigned on four charged.<br />
To one of the counts in the indictment<br />
they had plead guilty. In trying them on<br />
the other three the Government would<br />
throw themselves on the justice of the<br />
House. Thought the Government had array-<br />
ed against them a grwat deal of talent, and<br />
though a great deal of recrimination had<br />
taken a place he trusted that calm judg-<br />
ment would prevail, and he had no doubt<br />
that the Government would satisfactorily<br />
show that they were guiltless of the<br />
charges preferred against them, and that<br />
at the end of their trial they would come<br />
off conquerors and more than conquerors.<br />
The mover of the amendment (Mr. F.)<br />
spoke of the wheels of popular opinion ; <br />
that they were rumbling and rolling<br />
through the country against the Govern-<br />
ment. Public opinion, they all knew,<br />
was liable to very sudden changes, as no<br />
one should know better than that hon.<br />
member himself. He (Mr. H) could remem-<br />
ber well when the wheels of public opinion<br />
rolled him (Mr. F.) in 1851 out. He<br />
could remember when they rolled him out<br />
again in 1854. Mr. Fisher said that po-<br />
poular opinion had changed in the Pro-<br />
vince with regard to the Quebec Scheme.<br />
What was all this clamor raised about<br />
this change of opinion. Was it not<br />
raised and kept up by a few restless and<br />
unscrupulous politicians, who made the<br />
Quebec Scheme subserve their own ends<br />
of personal aggrandizement? Rumblings<br />
of popular opinion ! How were the wheels<br />
that produced the rumblings set in mo-<br />
tion at the time of the York election. He<br />
challenged his colleague (Mr. F.) to show<br />
one requisition from the electors of the <br />
County that had not emanted from the <br />
office of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Colonial Farmer</span>, of the of-<br />
fice of the Fredericton <span style="font-style: italic;">Reporter</span>. How<br />
was popular opinion influenced against<br />
the Government. Bills an placards were<br />
printed and thrown broad cast over the<br />
