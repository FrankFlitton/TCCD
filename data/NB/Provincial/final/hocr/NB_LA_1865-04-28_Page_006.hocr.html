<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> country, therefore, we must conclude this<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
in their complete policy. Although the<br />
present administration has only lately<br />
come into power, yet when I consider the<br />
ability of the hon. gentlemen who compose<br />
that Government ; when I reflect upon the<br />
prominent position which some of them<br />
have occupied in the Legislature for a<br />
number of years, and the long experience<br />
they have had in the Government of the<br />
country, I must suppose that they have<br />
had a sufficient time to have matured the<br />
full and entire nature of their policy.<br />
This Speech does not mention the great<br />
wants and requirements of the country. I<br />
see nothing in it foreshadowing their poli-<br />
cy in regard to colonization. It is coloni-<br />
zation that has made the United States<br />
what it is. Take from them their system<br />
of colonization and emigration, and let<br />
them depend upon their own resources,<br />
and instead of having a population of 30<br />
million, they would only have about seven<br />
or eight million. i consider that a pro-<br />
per system of colonization so as to secure<br />
an increased population, is the most im-<br />
</span>portant subject that can occupy the atten-<br />
tion of any Government. Without an in-<br />
crease of population, we cannot have an<br />
increase of labour, or an increase of<br />
wealth, for its is labor which makes wealth.<br />
There are no inducements presented to<br />
induce emigrants to come to this Pro-<br />
vince and settle. The Crown Lands are,<br />
as it were, blocked up ; the small capital<br />
which the poor man has, is wrung from<br />
him in the purchase of lands on which no<br />
roads are made. The late Government<br />
made no attempts to improve the settle-<br />
ment of the country, but I did hope the<br />
present Government would have made it<br />
one of the principle features of their ad-<br />
ministration. This is no sudden idea of<br />
mine, for I have announced it to the peo-<br />
ple of Westmorland, and it has met their<br />
approbation. Then there is a total ab-<br />
sence of a spirit of economy ; true, there<br />
is the suggestion to dispense with the Post<br />
Office Department, but I do not consider<br />
that by so doing we put a knife to that<br />
establishment. Why sustain the institu-<br />
tion ? There is now about <span class="unclear" title="Not sure how to create the symbol for British pounds">?</span>6000
defi-<br />
ciency in that Department, and there ap-<br />
pears no intention on the part of the Gov-<br />
ernment to abolish it, but merely that they<br />
would not require the Postmaster General<br />
to be an officer of the Crown. That is<br />
very well so far as it goes, and I think it<br />
meets with the approbation of the people<br />
of Westmorland, but why not abolish the<br />
office altogether ? Mr. Howe could do<br />
the duties of the office at his present sal-<br />
ary. If the Government intend to abolish<br />
the office, why keep nine members in the<br />
Executive ? Why not lessen the numeri-<br />
cal strength of the Government? I think<br />
it would be advisable and prudent to do<br />
so. The second paragraph of the Speech<br />
will, no doubt, meet with the approbation<br />
of the House, and be responded to through-<br />
out the country. In the third paragraph<br />
it is mentioned that a diabolical murder<br />
has been committed, and which we all<br />
look upon with feelings of disapprobation.<br />
The late President of the United States<br />
was not only an honest man, but a wise<br />
one, and I think his death will be deplor-<br />
ed throughout the civilized world ; so far<br />
the Government has expressed the honest<br />
feelings of the country. In the United<br />
States they were about coming to the con-<br />
clusion of a war, and it illustrated a pro-<br />
blem, which is, that a war can be sustain-<br />
ed and carried out, on a gigantic scale,<br />
without a previous standing army. I<br />
think the great powers of Europe will<br />
profit by their example, and learn that it<br />
is not necessary in times of peace to keep<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">a great standing army for the purpose of<br />
carrying on war on a large scale. It has<br />
also been proved that war can be carried<br />
on without making a levy upon private in-<br />
dividuals, without ransacking and rob-<br />
bing churches, as was done in old times<br />
in Europe. It is carried on by the pro-<br />
mises of the nation ; this lesson should be<br />
valuable to other powers throughout the<br />
world. This Province requires that its<br />
resources should be developed by public<br />
works. This Province is interested in the<br />
welfare of St. John, it being its chief com-<br />
mercial emporium. When the trade of<br />
St. John is either prosperous or depressed,<br />
there is a corresponding degree of pros-<br />
perity of depression felt throughout the<br />
whole Province. We find a railroad from<br />
St. Andrews tapping the upper waters of<br />
the St. John, and gradually taking away<br />
the trade of that country from St. John,<br />
and carrying it into the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States.—</span>
<br />
Nova Scotia also having a road <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span>
Hali- <br />
fax to Pictou, the trade of that part of <br />
Nova Scotia and the Bay of Fundy is ta- <br />
ken to Halifax. Thus the trade of St. <br />
John must become <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">depressed,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unless</span> we <br />
do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">connect</span> it with Nova <br />
Scotia und the United States. I cannot <br />
see why <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Government cannot
take <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">im-</span> <br />
mediate action in regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
connection <br />
with the United <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">States</span> and Nova
Scotia. <br />
I expected this connection <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
between <br />
Moncton and the Nova Scotia line would <br />
be prosecuted <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immediately,</span> and
also im- <br />
mediate steps taken to connect St. John <br />
with the West. I want, and hope to re- <br />
ceive information from the hon. mover of <br />
this Address, what law there is to prevent <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">immediate</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undertaking</span> of this work. <br />
There was an Act passed by the late Gov- <br />
ernment, the fourth section of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which is
the</span>
<br />
only section I can find in which the Gov-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ernment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> pledged in any form.
lt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">says:</span> <br />
“ lf any company or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">body</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corporate,</span> now <br />
possessing sufficient capital, shall offer to <br />
construct the ﬁrst mentioned line of rail- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">way,</span> and shall give such
assurance
of <br />
their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ability, &amp;c."</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Now, I</span> want to know <br />if any company having sufficient capital,<br />
have offered to construct Western Exten-<br />
sion ? I know of no such offer, and I<br />
know of no company that have offered to<br />
construct the line between Moncton and<br />
the Nova Scotia line. There is no reason<br />
why that gap in the line should not be<br />
filled up, as Nova Scotia intends to<br />
drive on towards the boundary line.<br />
I rue there may be companies formed in<br />
St. John ; it may be that they have raised<br />
sufficient capital to construct the road<br />
under this act ; then it might be desirable<br />
to wait until we see what they do, but if<br />
not, are the people of this Province to wait<br />
five years ? It is important that this time<br />
should not be thrown away ; we have lost<br />
time enough running after delegations<br />
which were not practicable, something in<br />
the distance, some great scheme that was<br />
to be developed in the future. In a young<br />
country like this, it is very important that<br />
we should not wait five years before we<br />
build Western Extension, and fill up the<br />
gap to the Nova Scotia boundary. Rail-<br />
ways, Telegraphs, and Steamboats, are <br />

the Government men who will go earnest-<br />
ly to work, with the sound of the hammer<br />
and pick. We want the labour of the<br />
country employed and something to re-<br />
present it. If the country should use its<br />
resources in this way, and have something<br />
they could show for it, it would not be<br />
indebtedness. We should adopt a sys-<br />
tem of strict economy, commencing with<br />
