Fraser then went on to show that the <br />
crown <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">law</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expenses</span> under the late Gov- <br />
ernment were not confined to the salaries<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of its officers; he took up the public
ac-</span><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">counts of 1862 and proved that the late

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">iness</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>quoting a case where Mr. Charles<br />
Fisher <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span> been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">paid</span> $187 for attending <br />
to the criminal business in Carleton.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. Fraser then referred at length to <br />
the course Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fisher</span> had taken
during <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">election</span> of York, and
denounced his at- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tack</span> on Mr. Hatheway as cruel and
unkind. <br />
Mr. Fuller had attacked every one of the <br />
three gentlemen who represented York, <br />
and who had been returned by large ma- <br />
jorities over himself, and all, he believed.<br />
for the express purpose of raising himself <br />
at their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expense.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">.</span>
Fraser then proceeded to say the <br />
mover of the amendment, Mr. Fisher, had <br />
made a grave charge a against the Govern - <br />
ment in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reference</span> to Minute of
Council. <br />
He had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">called</span> it an insulting
document,<br />
and said that any one who would answer <br />
a courteous letter in the spirit of that pa- <br />
per, he would call a low fellow. He <br />
could not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">agree</span> with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fisher,</span>
he <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">said,</span> and he did not fear boldly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to express</span> <br />
his opinion. There was no insult to that <br />
dispatch to Her Majesty's Secretary of <br />
State. He thought that the gentlemen <br />
who signed that Minute had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">taken</span>
a bold <br />
and independent stand. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">C</span>ould Mr <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Fish-</span> <br />
er say that they had no right to differ <br />
with Mr. Cardwell on a matter of policy <br />
so nearly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">affecting</span> their
interests ?<br />
Would he say that Her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Majesty’s</span>
Minis-<br />
ters <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> be approached with remon- <br />
strance ? that they were never censured <br />
for their policy in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Imperial</span>
Parlia- <br />
ment? What, he would like to know,<br />
did <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Earl</span> Derby state, the other
day, in <br />
reference to Mr. Cardwell <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span>
his Colo- <br />
nial policy? Mr. Cardwell was, like any <br />
other man, liable to error and mistakes of <br />
judgment, and open to censure. While <br />
he had the highest respect for the Queen's <br />
Secretary of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">State,</span> he thought,
on the <br />
question of Confederation, he had a right <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> his opinion, and that he had
the better <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">judgment</span> of what would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best</span> for the <br />
country. Mr. Fisher had displayed a <br />
new-born <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reverence</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dispatches,</span> but <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> did he say in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1854?</span> Why, that the <br />
Government should not he governed by <br />
dispatches from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Downing</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Street,</span> but <br />
Mr. Fisher only cared for dispatches <br />
when it suited him. The <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>
<br />
had been charged with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">neglecting</span>
the de- <br />
fence of the country. He had no hesita- <br />
tion in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">saying</span> that it had been
the hon. <br />
member of Carleton (Mr. Connell) who <br />
had raised the alarm about <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
unpro- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">te</span>cted state of the frontier. He
did not <br />
wonder at the alarm in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Carleton, and
that</span> <br />
weak <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">women</span> and children should
be <br />
frightened; but he believed it was got <br />
up <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that </span>some political purpose
might be<br />
served. He had not the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">slightest</span>
doubt <br />
that the Government would look <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">after</span>
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defences</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span> if for no other <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reason</span> than that their own lives
and pro- <br />
perties were at stake. Mr. Fisher had <br />
referred to the coat of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span>
to <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> and said that the money
had <br />
been absolutely wasted. But be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thought</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done</span> good. By it <br />
Mr. Cardwell<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">got</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">some</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">feeling</span>
in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard-</span> <br />
ing the Quebec Scheme, that might be <br />
useful ro him. With regard to the ques- <br />
tion of Confederation, he was not, he <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.
Fraser quoted from the Canadian</span><br />
News, to the effect that it was said the<br />
British Government were going to ap- <br />
point Hon. Mr. Tiller Governor of British <br />
Columbia and Vancouver's Island<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—a re-</span><br />
port that the News hoped <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> not
true, <br />
for Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Tilley</span> had yet good work
to do, <br />
and in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">doing</span> it he would serve
the Brit- <br />
ish Government and the Colonies. What <br />
was that good work, he would like to ask? <br />
Was it not to work up the scheme and <br />
have it forced upon the Province? Mr. <br />
Tilley, in doing this, might be serving<br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> of the Imperial
Government,<br />
but was he serving the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interests</span> of the <br />
Province? He believed the British Gov- <br />
ernment were deceived as to the unanimi- <br />
ty of feeling in favor of the scheme. They <br />
were told that men of all political parties<br />
wished to carry it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">out.</span> But, he
would<br />
ask, who represented the Opposition of <br />
this Province at the Quebec Conference? <br />
The Hon. J. H Gray. Did he represent <br />
the Opposition? No. Did Hon. E. B. <br />
Chandler, one of the greatest <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">politicians</span>
<br />
this country had produced—did he repre- <br />
sent the Opposition? No. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Somehow</span>
<br />
he was generally found supporting the <br />
Government of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> day. Did his
hon. <br />
colleague Mr. Fisher represent the Op- <br />
position? No. He would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tell</span> his
col- <br />
league, when the Tilley <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>
<br />
turned him, they turned him out. But <br />
it was no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less</span> true that, after
he was <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">turned</span> out, he invariably <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gave</span> that Gov- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ernme</span>nt his support. When the
British <br />
Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">were </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">told</span> that men of all <br />
parties supported the scheme, he main- <br />
tained they were told <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">what</span> was
not true. <br />
He would refer to another <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation.</span>
<br />
the delegation to Washington with refer- <br />
ence to the Reciprocity Treaty. (Here <br />
Mr. Fraser quoting<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> from an American <br />
paper, referred to a debate that had taken <br />
place at some <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">meeting</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Washington,</span> at <br />
which Mr. Merrill &amp; Co. on the-American <br />
side and the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Hon. Messrs. Galt,</span>
A.J Smith <br />
and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Henry,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces,</span> <br />
were present, and showed that the Hon. <br />
A. J. Smith was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">reported</span> as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguing</span> <br />
strongly in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">maintenance</span> of the
right of <br />
lumbermen to raft their lumber down the<br />
head waters of the St. John.) Should <br />
they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say,</span> after this, that the
Hon. A. J. <br />
Smith, who, it had been said, was hostile <br />
to this section of the country, was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
man who was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sacrifice</span> inter- <br />
ests of the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">on</span> the St. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">John</span> River? <br />
Or would it be said that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span>
<br />
to Washington was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">useless</span> when, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">though</span> <br />
the treaty was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">abrogated,</span> that
right was <br />
not lost? A great deal had been said <br />
about the cost of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegations.</span>
How <br />
much<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> he would like to know, did the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> of Mr. Fisher and the
Hon. J.<br />
Robertson cast the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span> ? <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">£350,000.</span><br />
because the country lost that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sum</span>
when <br />
they bought out Jackson &amp; Co. He heard<br />
that his hon. colleague kept back the<br />
contract, and it was a singular thing that <br />
memorandum attached to it, in which<br />
Jackson &amp; Co. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">professed</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">willingness</span> to <br />
build the Railway upon concession of<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">time,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">could</span> not be found. (Mr. Fisher<br />
derided this.) The contract was kept<br />
back. He would refer to his hon. friend<br />
Mr. Kerr, if that was not the fact,<br />

desk in the Provincial Secretary's of-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—It was a singular thing</span><br />
that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">original</span> contr<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">act</span> was never<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">produced</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">during</span> the debate. But there<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> a duplicate of it. It was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> a sin-
<br />
gular thing that.,after the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">debate,</span>
the <br />
original contract should have turned up <br />
in the Secretary’s ofﬁce. He would ra- <br />
ther be called a liar to his face than to <br />
have these insinuations thrown out. His <br />
colleague (Hr. Fraser) would find the <br />
whole words of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">original</span>
contract in <br />
the Journals of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1856,</span> page 52,
with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the,</span> <br />
memorandum.<br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
MR. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">FRASER—If</span> his hon. colleague
<br />
would show, he would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">withdraw</span>
his as- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sertion.</span> (Here Mr. Fisher
produced the <br />
Journals, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">showed the</span> copy of the con-<br />
tract, and pointed out that the memoran-<br />
dum for extension of time was in the body <br />
of the agreement.) Mr. Fraser,—But it <br />
was a distinct memorandum. He had <br />
heard the present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Judge</span> Allen
make the <br />
statement on the hustings. With refer- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ence</span> to the cost of the
delegation of Hon. <br />
A.J. Smith and J. Allen. it had been <br />
said that it cost £800. Then, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">he</span>
said, the <br />
delegation of his hon. colleague <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span>
<br />
Fisher) cost £350,000; for who could <br />
say, if they had not been <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bought</span>
out, if <br />
they had got an extension, that
Jackson <br />
&amp; Co., the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wealthiest</span>
railway <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contractors</span> <br />
in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">England,</span> who had built a
railway in <br />
the Crimea and made a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">present</span> of
it to <br />
the British Government, were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">men</span>
not <br />
able to build the Railway? But, apart<br />
from this view <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of the case</span>, it
was <br />
said that the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> of
Fisher and <br />
Robertson cost £900. One thing
more <br />
he would touch upon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">An</span>
observation of <br />
the hon. member (Mr. Fisher) had fallen <br />
on his ears and given him a great sur- <br />
rise, when he said that the troops of <br />Her <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Majesty</span> would not be sent to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
borders of the Province because <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
<br />
would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desert.</span> Were they not sent
two <br />
or three years <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ago?</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">And</span> when th e dis- <br />
turbance on the Railway took place, sent <br />
to the border, and had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span>
heard of one <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">desertion?</span> lt came with a very
bad grace <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> him (Mr. Fisher) to cast
this slur <br />
upon <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Her</span> Majesty's <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">groups.</span> (Mr. Fisher <br />
denied that what he had said could bear <br />
the interpretation Mr. Fraser had put upon
<br />
it.) That slur that had been thrown up- <br />
on Her Majesty‘s troops he would throw <br />
back as a slur upon the hon. member. <br /></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
MR MCCLEAN referred to his
<br />
friendly relations with the members of <br />
the present Government, had a high re-<br />gard for each separately, but they had<br />
lost their individuality, and as a politi-<br />cal combination he (Mr. McC.) hoped <br />their policies would be confounded, and<br />their fantastic and knavish tricks frus-<br />
