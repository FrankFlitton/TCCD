; but</span> very few, who <br />
have any anticipation of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">getting</span>
an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office,</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will go</span> for reducing the
salaries. In re- <br />
gard to Railways, I think that if the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fa-</span>
<br />
cility bill will not induce capitalists to <br />
embark in their construction, we should <br />
increase the facility and give an addition- <br />
al amount of money <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> that
purpose. <br />
The Government <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> tell you
that there <br />
is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> which stands in the
way ; but <br />
I do not think they have taken the trouble <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> enquire whether these
companies <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in-</span> <br />
tend to proceed with the work, or give up <br />
their rights. Their <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object</span>
appears to be <br />
not to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">anything.</span> It is the
only true <br />
principle to help those who try to help <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves.</span> I have heard it
stated that <br />
the Legislature was called for the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">purpose</span>
<br />
of doing only such business as must be <br />
done, and the rest was to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postponed</span>
<br />
until next winter. I say it to best to do <br />
the business now, for the country requires <br />
it. It is no saving to the country to <br />
postpone the business until <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">next</span>
winter, <br />
for then we would have to stay twice as <br />
long. If we could only stop the salaries <br />
of those who have got into fat offices un- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">til</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span> meets, i would have no ob- <br />
jection to it. I was elected to support <br />
Confederation, but that scheme is not <br />
likely to be adopted. Then they say <br />
nothing about retrenchment. Are hon. <br />
members to shut their months, or cry <br />
yea, yea, and be sent home to do the <br />
balance of the work next winter ? I would <br />
vote to do away with the ofﬁce of Com- <br />
missioner of Railways. I intend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
vote <br />
against everything which I believe to be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong.</span> Although the present Chief
Com- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">missioner</span> of the Board of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Works</span> is as <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">efficient</span> an officer as <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span> can get, yet his <br />
office and the office of Solicitor General <br />
should he abolished and a reduction made <br />
in the salary of the Attorney General. <br />
Mr. Fisher was the only Attorney Gen- <br />
eral that ever visited our section of the <br />
country. Then there it the paragraph <br />
about loyalty. I hope the hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">gentle-</span>
<br />
men will satisfy the Home Government <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">about their loyalty.</span> I hope we
will never <br />
see the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">day</span> when we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">will</span> be part and <br />
parcel of the United States, for I do not <br />
admire their Government. But I am con- <br />
ﬁdent we will be part of that country, <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">unless</span> the British North American
Colo- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nies </span>are united. I have no
objection to <br />
the hon. member for Westmorland being <br />
in the Government, although he may not <br />
be altogether consistent in the Railway <br />
delegation ; he left the Government be- <br />
cause they agreed to give a certain amount <br />
to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Intercolonial</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railway,</span> and he is <br />
now committed to a worse scheme, for<br />
which double the amount of money will<br />
be required. Perhaps he has thought<br />
better of it, and has changed his mind.<br />
He is economical, and agrees with me in <br />
many things ; but as he has got a Rail- <br />
road in his section of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country,</span>
he <br />
should endeavor to open up other parts of <br />
the Province. All our young men are <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">leaving the</span> country for want of
employ- <br />
ment. The day will come when we will <br />
repent of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">having rejected</span> the
Confedera- <br />
tion scheme, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wherein</span> we could
have had <br />
the Intercolonial Railway by paying about <br />
one-thirteenth of its cost. I am not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ashamed</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">acknowledge</span> that I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am</span> in <br />
fa<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vor</span> of Confederation, and I
have seen <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nothing</span> to change my views on the
ques- <br />
tion. <br />

we</span> used to sell our deben- <br />
tures at 7 or8 per cent above par. Now<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">
<br />
they are down to 90 or 92, and it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span>
<br />
the utmost difficulty that we can sustain <br />
the public <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">institutions</span> of the
country, and <br />
we have no <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">strong reason</span> to look
forward <br />
to an increased sale of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">our</span>
staple article <br />
of ships. For the last two or three years <br />
our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">staple</span> exports <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> not afforded a <br />
reasonable <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">remuneration.</span> We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span> all <br />
admit <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> Railroads are a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great</span> advan- <br />
tage, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">where they can he undertaken
and <br />
carried out within the means of the coun- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">try ;</span> and we must <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> admit that our <br />
expenditure upon Railroads so far, has <br />
not caused a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">corresponding</span>
benefit. It <br />
was stated that our lands <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">along</span>
the line </span></span><br />
would be enhanced in value to a great <br />
extent ; even towns were laid out and pur-
<br />
chases of land made, with the idea that it <br />
would be largely increased in value; but <br />
it has all turned out adversely to what <br />
we anticipated, and the lands along the <br />
line are not worth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">more</span> than
ordinary <br />
lands that are away from the reach of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Railways.</span> Several years ago we
entered <br />
into an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arrangement</span> with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canada</span> and <br />
Nova Scotia to build the Intercolonial <br />
Railroad. We passed a law <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pledging</span>
our <br />
credit for that work. That law has just <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expired.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">An atte</span>mpt was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">made last</span> year <br />
to repeal it. I<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> resisted</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it ;</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because</span>
we <br />
had pledged ourselves to Canada, and it <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span> be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong</span> to do so. Last Session <br />
a Bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> passed to give a
bonus of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$10,000</span> a mile to a number of
branch- <br />
es. Since then companies have been <br />
formed to build some of those branches, <br />
and I see no necessity for the Govern- <br />
ment to interfere and undertake the <br />
work. I believe that if our present Rail- <br />
road had been left to the original con- <br />
tractors, it would not have entailed one- <br />
third of the expense upon us that it has <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">done.</span> I believe that the line
between <br />
Moncton and Nova Scotia, is the only <br />
line that will pay the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">interest</span>
on the <br />
money invested, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and if</span> any
company will <br />
undertake to build that line by receiving <br />
a bonus of one-fourth of its cost, they <br />
should have every facility to do so. I <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> agree to have the
Governments <br />
build our Railroads, and I therefore move <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">following</span> amendment to
the ﬁfth <br />
paragraph. Strike out after the first sen- <br />
tence the fourth paragraph, and insert <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">following:</span> <br />

endeavour to avoid, as far as possible.  I <br />
came here with the full intention of vot- <br />
ing with the Government. In the Govern- <br />

have received many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">marks</span> of
friendship ; <br />
gentlemen of great ability in whom I have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">great confidence,</span> and it is

<br />
other roads have prior claims. It will be <br />

<br />ed providing for a road <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">from</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Monc-</span> <br />
ton to St John a bill <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">also</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">000 for opening</span> a road <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">along</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
North <br />
Shore. It was found that the state of the <br />
finances would not permit any further <br />
expenditures, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sum</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of money</span>
being <br />
insufficient,. this road had to be aban- <br />

<br />
It will be urged by the friends of West<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ern</span>

<br />
road, whereas the other will not. I would <br />
say to those gentlemen, if they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">imagine</span>
<br />
such to be the case, they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better</span>

be doing a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">grievous</span> injury to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">those</span> that <br />

de- <br />
pressed more and more, if we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">build</span> rail- <br />

United Kingdom of Great Britain. It is <br />a better confederation than <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> at <br />

in this amendment <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whether</span> <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">hands</span>

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">railroads</span> built <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without</span> the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span><br />
