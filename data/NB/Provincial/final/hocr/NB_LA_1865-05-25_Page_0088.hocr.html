I am glad to see a movement taking place <br />
in this direction, but I think there need <br />
not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be much</span> expense attending <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this dele-</span> <br />
gation, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for the</span> distance being

Nova Scotia delegation may come over to <br />
St. John. The members of the House <br />
can vote for this resolution without being <br />
obliged <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to vote</span> for any union
the delega- <br />
tion might propose. Some gentlemen say <br />
if they cannot have a large union they <br />
do not want a small <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">one ;</span> but I
think this<br />
small union may be a beneﬁt, while it <br />
might not be desirable to have a union of <br />
all the British possessions in the world. <br />
The appointment of this delegation may <br />
be the means of bringing about a com- <br />
mercial union, which would be a beneﬁt <br />
to these Maritime <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Col. BOYD —It is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> desirable to have <br />
a union of these Maritime Provinces, <br />
either commercial or Legislative. I would <br />
rather see a Legislative Union, because <br />
one Legislature would answer in place of <br />
three. If <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> gentlemen who were
ap- <br />
pointed last year to confer on this subject <br />
had done their duty, we might have been <br />
united now. It is very desirable that we <br />
should have one <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff,</span> one
currency, and <br />
the same postal arrangements in the three <br />
Provinces. After we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> this
union, and <br />
it is found <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> work well, we
might have <br />
Confederation with Canada, if the Cana-<br />
dians would make reasonable propositions ; <br />

to Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia, we</span> should not

any beneﬁts arising from this small union, <br />
which would not have been much greater <br />

was abandoned last year, but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do not</span>

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">GILBERT.—The</span>
interests of these <br />
Lower <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces</span> are <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">identiﬁed</span> in every <br />
possible way, and this delegation may <br />
lead to some beneﬁcial results. I cannot <br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">clear</span> of co-operating with <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> Scotia in <br />
discussing this matter. I shall support <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">resolution.</span> <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. HILL—It is said this resolution is <br />
a mere matter of courtesy to Nova Scotia. <br />
I do not see that it is any more so than a <br />
similar resolution which we passed last <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">year,</span> the result of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which certainly went <br />
beyond what we intended when we passed <br />
that resolution. It would be premature <br />
to take sides on this question now, inas- <br />
much as our minds would be liable to<br />
change when we receive further informa- <br />
tion on the subject. Although I am <br />
somewhat in favor of this resolution, think- <br />
ing this union will come to pass in a few <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">years,</span> yet I should like to hear
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">argu-</span> <br />
ments for and against <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it,</span> in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">order to</span> ac- <br />
quire further <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">information</span>. When
the <br />
Canadian union was <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁrst</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">moved, I was</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rather</span> in favor of it ; but the
more<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> I <br />
looked into it the more I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opposed</span>
it. <br />
'There is no subject which can come be- <br />
fore the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislature</span> this
Session that I <br />
would more gladly <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">listen to</span> than
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> union <br />
of these Lower Colonies. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Some</span>
such <br />
preliminary discussion should take place, <br />
in order that we may be fully prepared <br />
to discuss the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">question</span> when it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">comes</span> up. <br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr.KERR.—I am in favor of this reso- <br />

<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 680 172 1277 1548">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> benefitted to a considerable extent. I <br />
recollect the time when there was a duty <br />
of two pounds on every horse that was <br />
imported from Prince Edward <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Island;</span>
but <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> an arrangement entered into
the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Governments of the respective
Provinces, <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">productions</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">different</span> Colonies <br />
are entered at a uniform rate. I imported <br />
a carriage from the United States and paid <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">17<span class="unclear" title="unsure of the number">?</span> </span>per cent. duty in this <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province.</span> If I<br />
had taken it to Nova Scotia I would have <br />
had to have paid but 6 per cent., and<br />
could have brought it home from there <br />
just as easily, and thereby escaped the <br />
extra duty. Merchants like to get their <br />
goods into the country at the lowest pos- <br />
sible rate, and it is very desirable that <br />
such an arrangement may be made as will <br />
remove all the restrictions upon our trade, <br />
so that the importations into the various <br />
Colonies may be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admitted at</span> the
same <br />
rate of duty. The heads of departments <br />
should meet and discuss this matter of a <br />
Legislative or Commercial Union, and the <br />
resolution which they adopt can be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">fully</span>
<br />
discussed in the House next winter. <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">CONNELL</span>
moved that this resolu- <br />
tion be postponed for three months, and <br />
said :—If this resolution is a mere matter <br />
of courtesy, and no result to be arrived <br />
at, what is the use of appointing a delega- <br />
tion ? It is a matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> can
be very <br />
well <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">undertaken</span> by the
Government, and <br />
it is very <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> for them to do <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">so,</span> laying <br />
such information as they receive before <br />
the Legislature next winter. It has been <br />
said that we would have been swamped <br />
in uniting with Canada ; but the same <br />
argument will apply to a union of these <br />
Lower Colonies. I should like to have <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">seen</span> the President of the Council
go into <br />
an elaborate discussion of this matter, as <br />
they have done in Nova <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Scotia,</span>
not only <br />
in reference to a union of the Lower Colo- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nies,</span>
but also the larger union with Cana- <br />
da. I should like the opinion of the <br />
country to be expressed on this question, <br />
as it might have an inﬂuence upon this <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation.</span> If there is no
movement <br />
made to discuss this question, how is the <br />
country to get information ? No action <br />
should be taken until the country has had <br />
an opportunity to express an opinion upon <br />
the subject. In reference to Confedera- <br />
tion,I always expressed my opinion in <br />
the strongest terms, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> the
measure <br />
should never be submitted to the House <br />
for its ﬁnal passage without being ﬁrst <br />
left to the peop<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">le.</span> <br />
