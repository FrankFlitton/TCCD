 description, Her Majesty's Government<lb/>
 agreed to ask Parliament for a guarantee<lb/>
 of Three Millions Sterling, to build the<lb/>
 Inter-Colonial Railway.  
</p>
    <p>
     Considerable difficulty arose with re-<lb/>
     gard to the investment of the Sinking<lb/>
     Fund, and the legislation required by<lb/>
     Canada previous to the attaching of the<lb/>
     guarantee. The Treasury Department<lb/>
     required that Canada should provide by<lb/>
     special law for raising the necessary<lb/>
     Revenue to defray the Interest on the<lb/>
     Loan before any guarantee should be<lb/>
     made, and that the Sinking Fund should<lb/>
     be invested in British funds. After a<lb/>
     series of interviews they were induced<lb/>
     to abandon their first condition as to<lb/>
     proof of the Revenue required to meet<lb/>
     the Loan, and also to agree to the pro-<lb/>
     posal of the Delegates, that the Sinking<lb/>
     </p>
   <cb/>
    <p>
     Fund should be invested in Colonial or<lb/>
     other Securities at the option of Canada.<lb/>
     </p>
    <p>
     We cannot close this Report without<lb/>
     expressing our obligations to the Right<lb/>
     Honorable the Earl of Carnarvon for the<lb/>
     interest he evinced on our behalf, and for<lb/>
     the patient manner in which he discus-<lb/>
     sed the different questions that were<lb/>
     raised during the progress of our deliber-<lb/>
     ations, and for his energy and persever-<lb/>
     ance in carrying the Act of Union through<lb/>
     the House of Lords, and to the Duke of<lb/>
     Buckingham and Chandos for the hearty<lb/>
     manner in which he entered into the<lb/>
     question of guarantee, and for his strenu-<lb/>
     ous exertions to induce the Treasury<lb/>
     Department to accede to the proposition<lb/>
     we made for securing the money, and<lb/>
     for successfully carrying the Bill for the<lb/>
     guarantee through the House of Lords;<lb/>
    </p>     
    <cb/>
    <p>
     and to the Right Honorable Mr. Adderley<lb/>
     for the ability he displayed in carrying<lb/>
     the Act of Union and the guarantee<lb/>
     through the House of Commons.<lb/>
    </p>
     <p>
      We also desire to express our great<lb/>
      obligations to the Right Honorable Ed-<lb/>
      ward Cardwell, and to the Right Honor-<lb/>
      able Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Watkins, and<lb/>
      other Members of the opposition, for the<lb/>
      cheerful and efficient aid they rendered<lb/>
      in carrying the measure.<lb/>
