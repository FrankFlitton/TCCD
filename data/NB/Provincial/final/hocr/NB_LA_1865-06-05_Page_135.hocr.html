<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> this Scheme was got up for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the purpose of</span>s <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making</span> some of our great
gentlemen Gov-<br />
ernors of these<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provinces.</span> Well I think <br />
that a praiseworthy <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">object.</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Laughter.)</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
The Hon. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">President</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Council may</span><br />
laugh, but I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">believe</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> he would do <br />
honor to such a position. We should not <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be any the less loyal, because we had a<br />
</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">few
of our leading me in such offices,<br />
and the Governor General would still be<br />
the tie binding us to the mother country.<br />
With regard to the elections in Albert, I<br />
may <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say that</span> the question turned
exclu- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sively</span> on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation. There were</span> <br />
some discontented spirits who came <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">among us to stir up strife</span>, but
they did<br />
not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">much</span>. There wero seven candi- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dates </span>in the ﬁeld, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> five of them were <br />
Confederates, and out of the 1,350 votes,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
about 600 were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cast</span> for
Confederation.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
But that question <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> dead the
present,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
and I now come here to do my duty as a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
representative of the country,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> and if
this<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
Government introduce measures<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> that</span> I<br />
conceive to be beneficial, I shall support<br />
them. With regard to the Resolutions<br />
now before us, I believe that it is known<br />
in England just as well as it is here, that<br />
Confederation is gone, and they also know<br />
that we are, and always have been, a<br />
loyal people, and there is therefore no ne-<br />
cessity to send Home hon. gentlemen just<br />
to flourish round through England, and<br />
over the continent for no real good. I<br />
think it would be much better to take the<br />
money that will be thus expended, and put<br />
it on the bye-roads of the Province. I<br />
am opposed to the Resolutions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. McMILLAN—Before the debate<br />
closes I wish to offer a few remarks in ad-<br />
dition to what I have already said : In<br />
the County of Restigouche notwithstand-<br />
ing that Confederation was gone, and the<br />
leading members of the Government were<br />
overthrown before the election came off,<br />
yet the people cast their votes in favor<br />
of that Scheme. No Anti-Candidate need<br />
offer for that County. I may say that I<br />
feel under some difficulties in addressing<br />
the House again on this subject ; it is<br />
well-known that I have occupied more time<br />
this Session than ever I did before, and I<br />
have been forced to it by the fact that the<br />
hon. member for Sunbury and myself, are<br />
the only members of the late Government<br />
now left on the floors of this House. I<br />
shall, however, glance at the arguments<br />
which have been brought by those oppo-<br />
sed to this Scheme. And first in reply to<br />
the hon. member for the County of Saint<br />
John (Mr. Anglin). He has made use of<br />
strong language in reference to the Cham-<br />
ber of Commerce ; has said they were<br />
moved by some " hidden hand," and that<br />
falsehood and misrepresentation has been<br />
the order of the day. This " hidden hand"<br />
has come to be a familiar term, yet it<br />
seems to be a ghost to the present Govern-<br />
ment, that frightens and terrifies them,<br />
and if they could by any possibility lay it<br />
as low, and bury it as deep as the hon<br />
member for Charlotte would have Con-<br />
federation buried, yet it would rise to ap-<br />
pal them. But I am happy to state that<br />
that hand is still under the control of a mind,<br />
and a grasp of intellect that has a power<br />
to make his opponents afraid and tremble.<br />
The dissolution of the House has been<br />
characterized as cruelty and oppression ;<br />
it might, certainly, appear like tyranny<br />
to those who did not wish to appeal to the<br />
people, but not to the people themselves.<br />
True, the season of the year was inclem-<br />
ent, but then it took none of the people<br />
from their duties ; and that it was not felt<br />
to be oppressive is clear from the fact that<br />
a larger vote was polled than ever before.<br />
Next is the Canadian tariff as compared<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> with ours ; there it is 20 per cent,
whilst<br />
here it is only 15, and it is argued that<br />
we should have to come up to them. We<br />
admit 32 articles free of duty, and Canada<br />
44, and this, it is affirmed, would lower<br />
our revenue. But the way to arrive at a<br />
just conclusion on this point is to take<br />
the imports of the two countries and<br />
compare them, and we shall then find that<br />
whereas in Canada in 1863 it was 11 per<br />
cent., in New Brunswick it was 10 1.8 per<br />
cent. ; why then frighten the people with<br />
the cry of the tremendous difference in the<br />
tariff. Another point : it was said that<br />
the difference in 1863, if we had been in<br />
Confederation, would have been $250,000,<br />
and he said Mr. Tilley had made it<br />
$211,000.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN.—Mr. Tilley said we<br />
could abandon our use of brandy and<br />
spirits and save the duty on these ; we<br />
could save 10 cents a pound on tobacco<br />
by manufacturing it here, and in this way<br />
he tried to make up the amount ; but I<br />
challenge the hon. ex-Surveyor General<br />
to take the free list of Canada and make<br />
up anything like an amount equal to the<br />
$250,000.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. MCMILLAN.—I do not think that<br />
is the right way to take it. I think the<br />
proper plan is to average the imports of<br />
the two Provinces. Canada has so far<br />
advanced that she can support her local<br />
manufactures and save importation to a<br />
large extent, and this is an argument in<br />
favor of Union, as we should go on with<br />
her and be able to support our manufac-<br />
tories, and get an increase of customers.<br />
While I am not prepared to say that our<br />
local expenditure would not be increased,<br />
I do not believe they would increase to<br />
to the extent that has been said. The<br />
general government would have to deal<br />
with general and large matters, and the<br />
time occupied in their discussion would<br />
be shorter than now, and the same in the<br />
local legislatures, where they would only<br />
discuss local matters ; and, while the ex-<br />
pense would be, perhaps, somewhat in-<br />
creased, a great saving would be made in<br />
the time occupied in Session. It has been<br />
said that under Confederation we should<br />
dwindle down to a mere municipality, yet<br />
this Session only two measures have come<br />
before us—the Treasury Note Bill and the<br />
Post Office Bill—that would not be dis-<br />
cussed in the local legislature. But,<br />
it is asked, who would come here<br />
as a representation under Confed-<br />
eration? I reply that our young men<br />
of intellect and power would come here<br />
to obtain a political education, to fit<br />
them for positions in the General Govern-<br />
ment, and for a Governorship of the<br />
Colonies. It is a high and a grand prin-<br />
ciple of ambition implanted in the hu-<br />
man heart and soul that would animate<br />
our young men to raise themselves to<br />
positions of rank and power. The hon.<br />
member for St. John further said that<br />
the 80 cents a head was a high sum for<br />
Canada to receive, but small for New<br />
Brunswick. I do not understand how<br />
this can be. I ask if ten years ago we<br />
did not get more for local purposes than<br />
we do now? Yes, and why? Be-<br />
cause we have paid out large sums for<br />
our great public works, and therefore<br />
have not the money for local purposes.<br />
But under Confederation we should re-<br />
ceive 80 cents a head for all time to come<br />
to add to our revenue for these works.<br />
And then there is the question of taxa-<br />
tion. Out of Confederation what are<br />
we to do ? In a few days we are to have<br />
up the resolutions relative to the West-<br />
ern Extension, and for that purpose shall<br />
be called on to vote $260,000 or $270,-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 000 to commence the work, and if this<br />
be done how are the appropriations for<br />
schools, roads, bridges, to be upheld but<br />
by direct taxation. There will be no 80<br />
cents a head to fall back upon. It is as<br />
clear as noonday that if we are to have<br />
direct taxation it would be farther off,<br />
at least in union, than out of it. Then<br />
for militia purposes we should have<br />
$1,000,000, and it is said that this is<br />
nothing at all. Then, I would ask,<br />
what is the $30,000 we granted the other<br />
day, for us separated, and a frag-<br />
ment as now ; but united under one<br />
power, one interest, animated by one<br />
common feeling I believe that $1,000,-<br />
000 would be something. Our propor-<br />
tion of that sum would be $70,000, more<br />
than double what we now give. How<br />
then can it be said that $1,000,000 is so<br />
small? It is not expected by the British<br />
Government that we are to do all to-<br />
ward our own defence. They do not<br />
look for it, and it is but right and manly<br />
and independent that we should contri-<br />
bute something. What does the Col-<br />
onial Secretary say in his despatches :<br />
he hopes that operations can be carried<br />
on without imposing a tax upon the peo-<br />
ple ; shewing that the British Govern-<br />
ment do not wish to saddle the country<br />
with more than we are able to bear.<br />
The hon. President of the Council has<br />
referred to the difference in race and<br />
creed in the people of Canada. I will<br />
quote on this subject an extract from one<br />
of the most eloquent men on this contin-<br />
ent, Mr. D'A. McGee :<br />
</p>

</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_9" title="bbox 953 2270 1839 2495">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> " I venture, in the first place, to ob-<br />
serve that there seems to be a good deal<br />
of exaggeration on the subject of race,<br />
occasionally introduced both on the one<br />
side and the other in this section of our<br />
country. This theory of race is some-<br />
times carried to an anti-christian and<br />
unphilosophical excess. Whose words<br />
are those—" God hath made of one<br />
blood all the nations that dwell on the<br />
face of the earth."<br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr" /><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />This is the right view to take of this<br />
question. Look at the position of affairs<br />
in the Mother Country ; there they are<br />
composed of all peoples, and yet they go<br />
on quietly and harmoniously. Then an-<br />
other point taken up is our trifling trade<br />
with Canada. Why, the same cry was<br />
raised in Canada ; there it was said that<br />
the Lower Provinces were so poor that<br />
they were not worth the expense that<br />
would be incurred by Canada. The<br />
Hon. Mr. Brown says:</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">" I hold in my hand a return of arti-<br />
cles purchased by the Maritime Pro-<br />
vinces from the United States in 1863,<br />
which Canada could have supplied. I<br />
will not detain the House by reading it,<br />
but any member who desires can have<br />
it for examination. The total value of<br />
products which the Lower Provinces<br />
might have bought more advantageous-<br />
ly from us, summer up to over seven<br />
millions of dollars."<br />

</div>
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_11" title="bbox 1359 2801 1839 2896">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It is the want of direct trade that makes<br />
the hard feelings, and if these were<br />
broken down we should be much better<br />
off. Then the Hon. Mr. Ferrier shows<br />
what the Inter-colonial railroad would<br />
do that a trade in produce would spring<br />
up, and a large traffic would pass over<br />
it every day in the year. He shows that<br />
we import from the United States $2,000,-<br />
000 worth more produce than we export<br />
there. If we had this road we should<br />
bring direct from Canada, whereas now<br />
