<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> get one by degrees. The member of<br />
York had highly enlogised the United<br />
States, and had quoted from a New York<br />
paper to the effect that Government would<br />
protect the Colonies from invasion. He<br />
had also flung back the charge that the<br />
Antis were disloyal. Now he questioned<br />
the obeience of that child that would<br />
not obey its parent—loyalty was of the<br />
heart and not of the pocket, and no men<br />
could be loyal unless they obeyed the Go-<br />
vernment. He would quote also from a<br />
New York paper. (The hon. member<br />
read extract.) Here we found that they<br />
were opposed in the United States to the<br />
Union of the Colonies and the Intercolo-<br />
nial Railway, and the Antis were opposed<br />
to them also. He thought that there was<br />
some connection between disloyalty and<br />
anti-Confederation. Mr. Lindsay went<br />
on to quote from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Freeman</span>,
and extract<br />
from a letter signed A I, and commented<br />
upon it, denying that he was there charged,<br />
had ever said that the Fenians belonged<br />
to one denomination. He had never tried<br />
to set denomination against denomination,<br />
or class against class ; be believed every<br />
man was entitled to equal privileges and<br />
freedom. He then went on to deny the<br />
truth of the statement made to the hon.<br />
member of York (Mr. Needham) that<br />
there were six or seven comapnies in<br />
Woodstock well armed and equipped ; <br />
there was only one company. He thought<br />
something should be done for the defence<br />
of Carleton and the frontier. If the ob-<br />
ject of the raiders was plunder, they were<br />
more likely to attack small towns and vi-<br />
lages than cities. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT asked, was the country<br />
prepared to go into an army and navy,<br />
and support them out of the ordinary re-<br />
venue P He thought the Government<br />
ought to tell the House what steps they<br />
were prepared to take to raise the ways<br />
and means. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER supposed the object of <br />
the Bill was to meet the present emer-<br />
gency. As the House had already given<br />
the Government all power necessary to<br />
meet it, he could not see how they could<br />
refuse to pass the Bill. He was not dis-<br />
posed to let his hon. colleague (Mr. N.)<br />
laugh this matter off. He believed that<br />
there was ground for serious danger. The<br />
time had arrived that had been looked<br />
forward to with apprehension for years.<br />
When the war of the Union over, the dif-<br />
ficulty would arise when a lawless mo , ac-<br />
customed to the use of arms, and indis-<br />
posed to industry, would be thrown out<br />
upon the country, ready to engage in any<br />
raid or desperate undertaking, and enlist<br />
in any cause so that they could indulge<br />
their taste for rapine and plunder. This<br />
Bill did not refer at all to the Fisheries<br />
We had, for that protection, flung over<br />
us the powerful arm of the British Em-<br />
pire—an Empire, before whose power the<br />
grandeur of Rome in its palmiest days<br />
paled. Mr. Fisher then quoted from the<br />
Memorandum from His Excellency re-<br />
garding the defence of the Province, to<br />
prove that this alarm in te country was<br />
not a mere matter of moonshine. It lay<br />
not in the mouth of any man to laugh this <br />
thing away.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE said he had looked<br />
over the Bill, and he had found in it a <br />
great number of blanks. It was evident <br />
the Government were determined that<br />
the House should get no information on<br />
this or any other subject. He thought it<br />
was his right that he should get the infor-<br />
mation he wanted. It was extraordinary<br />
that the Attorney General was not found<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in his
place now. </span>All the available re-<br />
sources of the Province had gone for mil-<br />
itary purposes, and now the country wait-<br />
ed the mercy of the Government. If the<br />
Government expected to retain the confi-<br />
dence of the country, they must in their<br />
turn, be more confiding. Mr. Wetmore<br />
then read the Bill, and commented upon<br />
it, and said he found it a prefect blank. <br />
He did not intend to oppose the Bill, but<br />
called upon the Provincial Secretary to <br />
give some information respecting it.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">PROVINCIAL SECRETARY. The<br />
hon. member did not intend to oppose<br />
the Bill, but he caught at every opportu-<br />
nity to say something derogatory of the<br />
Government. He had told them he asked <br />
the House to pass the Bill, that the Go-<br />
vernment might have full authority to<br />
take the necessary steps for the defence<br />
of the country. He had told them that<br />
there was reaseon to fear that some danger<br />
would approach the Province by the sea<br />
The Bill explained itself and it did ask<br />
for more money than had already been<br />
granted. The hon. member of St. JOhn<br />
(Mr. Wetmore) had made allusions to <br />
the Attorney General being away. It<br />
was no proof of talent to say these saucy<br />
things. He could say them if he liked, <br />
but he was better bred. If the hon. mem-<br />
ber intended to pursue the course he had<br />
taken it would be necessary to meet him<br />
in his own manner. He would assure<br />
him (Mr. W.) that the country saw through<br />
the low, mean insinuations he was conti-<br />
nually making against the Government.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT. Where are the ways<br />
and means to come from? That was a <br />
political quesion at any rate.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE. One would think<br />
from the ferocious manner in which<br />
the Provincial Secretary attacked him<br />
(Mr. W.) that he was sufficient<br />
in himself to drive out all the ma-<br />
rauders that would ever attempt to<br />
come into the Province. He could<br />
thoroughly understand why the Provincial<br />
Secretary was so sensitive about any re-<br />
flection upon the Government. With<br />
regard to the Government, the existing<br />
opinion in the country was, that they had<br />
no mind of their own. They had not<br />
even power to appoint to office and, it<br />
was said, that the chief head was not a <br />
member of the Council at all. He would<br />
like to get the information he asked for,<br />
if the Provincial Secretary was permitted<br />
to give it. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Bill was then passed.</p>

                AFTERNOON.<br />
ADJOURNED DEBATE ON THE AMENDMENT<br />
            TO THE ADDRESS.<br />
<br />
<p>
MR. WILMOT said, he was now called <br />
</p>
<p>upon to explain the position in which he<br />
stood with regard to the present. He had<br />
received permission from His Excellency to<br />
use anything where his colleagues and<br />
himself had been in conflict. It appeared<br />
that he had been charged as being en-<br />
tirely in error, when he had said he was<br />
in favour of the abstract principle of union.<br />
There was a distinct difference of opinion<br />
between them with regard to the Minute<br />
of Council ; and, when the gentlemen<br />
who signed that memorandum, said, that<br />
he never expressed an opinion in favor of<br />
union, he had the authority of Judge<br />
Allen to say, that he repeatedly heard<br />
him state an opinion in favor of union ; <br />
and he was allowed by His Excellency to<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say, when
that cel-brated Minute was<br />
before the
Council, that His Excellency<br />
referred to
him (Mr. W.) as not opposed<br />
to the
abstract principle. When those<br />
gentlemen
who signed the Minute said,<br />
that he
expressed no such opinion, he<br />
said, it
was not the fact. He saw Mr.<br />
Fraser in
his place. He happened to be<br />
in his (Mr.
W.'s) house when the ques-<br />
tion was
talked of, and he (Mr. R.) knew<br />
whether he
was in favor of the abstract<br />
principle
or not. (Mr. Fraser. There<br />
was not the
slightest doubt about it.)<br />
He had
expressed the same opinion to<br />
hundreds of
persons. He had the satis-<br />
faction of
knowing that when he was<br />
called a
traitor to the cause of anti-Con-<br />
federation,
that the Governor had en-<br />
dorsed his
opinion. He would ask the<br />
Government
if they were opposed to<br />
union?
What did the paragraph in the</span><br />
Speech mean? [The hon. member here<br />
quoted from the Speech] If these gen-<br />
tlemen were still disposed to union, he<br />
would ask again, how was it they agreed<br />
to put that paragraph in His Excellency's<br />
Speech? [The hon. member quoted the<br />
paragraph relating to union in the Reply<br />
to the Address.] He would like to know<br />
if he was entirely wrong—if the Govern-<br />
ment were entirely right? When he<br />
stated his opinion in Toronto, it was in<br />
reply to a speech made by Mr. McDou-<br />
gall, who said, that not only the people of<br />
Canada, but the people of the Lower <br />
Provinces, were in favor of the Quebec<br />
Scheme. In reply, he (Mr. W.) stated,<br />
that, certainly, the Quebec Scheme had<br />
been put before the people at the polls<br />
and they had condemned it. But though<br />
they had condemned that scheme, there<br />
was a vast number in favor of the abstract<br />
principle of union, and that it was only a<br />
question of time when a union would be<br />
carried—why, it was carried now. He<br />
had, he supposed, had more foresight<br />
than his former colleagues in this ques-<br />
tion.</p>

































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. Wilmot then went on to say, that<br />
the paragraph in the Speech certain y<br />
foreshadowed some Scheme of Union,<br />
and he thought the Government ought to<br />
come down with it. But he would tell<br />
them that any Scheme of Confederation<br />
they might submit must involve those<br />
two principles :—one, the Federal princi-<br />
ple, the other, Representation by Popu-<br />
lation. Lower Canada would insist upon<br />
the first, in order to protect her rights,
and<br />
Upper Canada must have Represenation <br />
by Population. [Attorney General. That<br />
was unfair.] Fair, or unfair, no Scheme<br />
could be carried that did not involve those<br />
two abstract principles. He had strong<br />
feelings against these two principles be-<br />
fore he went to Canada. But when he<br />
attended the Convention there, and heard<br />
the whole question of trade opened up<br />
and discussed, he came to the conclusion<br />
that Union must take place. He foresaw<br />
also, that the Reciprocity Treaty would<br />
be repealed. There was one subject<br />
brought forward at that Convention that<br />
impressed his mind with the necessity of<br />
Union—the Mother Country was prepared<br />
to give those Colonies the right to make<br />
Commercial Treaties. When he consi-<br />
dered that there were six different Go-<br />
vernments, and six different tariffs, and<br />
all the difficulties in the way, he con-<br />
cluded there must be one General Govern-<br />
ment to carry them out.</p>



<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">It was stated in the papers, that it was<br />
because he could not get the Audi or<br />
Generalship, or some office, that he left<br />
the Government. He would require to<br />
