<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Let them consider how dangerous it<br />
was to give up power without knowing<br />
fully what was the necessity of granting<br />
it, and for what purpose it would be<br />
used! The House had a right to infor-<br />
mation, and, as a matter of common<br />
decency, the Government ought to<br />
give it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The PROVINCIAL SECRETARY.<br />
The Government were not disposed to<br />
withhold information. He had stated<br />
that the Bill only carried out the reso-<br />
lution passed by the House. It gave<br />
the Governor and Council authority to<br />
make use of every means to defend the<br />
Province by employing armed vessels.<br />
If any attack was made, it would likely<br />
be by sea. In Nova Scotia, it had been<br />
though necessary to pass a similar Bill.<br />
It might not be necessary to use the <br />
power granted in the Bill, but it was<br />
necessary to give the power. The time<br />
was unprecedented in the Province, and<br />
they must take every precautionary<br />
measure to meet any danger. If any<br />
expense for naval defence was called<br />
for, he was disposed to be as prudent<br />
as possible in expenditure from the <br />
general revenue, and to use all proper, <br />
economy. He assured the hon. mem-<br />
ber for St. John (Mr. Wetmore) that <br />
the Government did not refuse and were<br />
always willing to give the most ample <br />
information.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. McCLELAN quite agreed with <br />
the remarks of the Provincial Secretary ;<br />
the House had already given the Go-<br />
vernment full authority to take every<br />
precautionary measure for the defence<br />
of the Province, but he hoped, that in<br />
the execution of their trust, they would<br />
exercise the most rigid economy. There<br />
was a danger, at this time, that the re-<br />
sources of the Province would be drawn<br />
upon too largely.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. CONNELL said he was going to <br />
vote for every Bill regarding the army<br />
and navy. It was time to give the Go-<br />
vernment all the authority and all the <br />
means they required, and to show that<br />
they were determined to defend their <br />
homes and firesides. But when he said<br />
that the Government should have the <br />
fullest authority, he wished to be under-<br />
stood they must exercise proper eco-<br />
nomy, for they would be held strictly<br />
responsible for the expenditure of every<br />
dollar. If there was great alarm in the <br />
country, he though that it had been <br />
created, in a great measure, by the Go-<br />
vernment. It was reported that the <br />
Government were taking active mea-<br />
sures for the protection of St. John, that<br />
the militia were called out there. That <br />
was right; but why all these prepara-<br />
tions at St. John, when the country of <br />
the Upper River was most exposed to<br />
danger? As he had said before he did <br />
not fear an invasion from a large force, <br />
but from incursions from call bands<br />
of marauders upon the border ; and the <br />
Government had fallen very far short of <br />
their duty when they neglected to pro-<br />
tect the frontier.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LEWIS said, that the Bill ought <br />
to be passed unanimously. He felt that <br />
the country was in great alarm about<br />
the Fenian movement. He hoped the<br />
Government would take every precau-<br />
tionary measure for its defence, and<br />
that the country would sustain them.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. BOYD said, that this was the first <br />
time when such a Bill had been intro-<br />
duced in the House. He did not fear<br />
that the Government would expend a <br />
great deal of money for naval defence,<br />
</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">and he had every confidence in them. <br />
The Bill was necessary, if for no other<br />
purpose than the protection of the<br />
Fisheries. He did not doubt that the<br />
Imperial Government would order here<br />
armed vessels to protect the Fisheries,<br />
but the country ought to show that it<br />
was willing to do something.</p>






<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. McMILLAN, quoting the first<br />
section of the Bill, wished to have infor-<br />
mation how the Government were going<br />
to make use of the power when they got<br />
hold of it. Did they intend to purchase<br />
or build gun vessels for the defence of<br />
the country and the Fisheries?</p>






<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">PROVINCIAL SECRETARY.â€”The<br />
member of Re tigouche knew that it <br />
could not be the intention of the Govern-<br />
men to purchase or build armed vessels<br />
of war. It was not the object to employ<br />
the vessels in the protection of the Fish-<br />
eries.</p>































































<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. NEEDHAM spoke of the cause<br />
that had produced all the alarm and ex-<br />
citement. As regarded the alarm, he<br />
confessed it had made no impression upon<br />
him. It appeared to him mere nonsense;<br />
and he would prophesy that at the end of <br />
this time next year, it would be found<br />
that there had been a great deal more<br />
smoke than fire about the Fenian alarm. <br />
The House had already given the Govern-<br />
ment all the resources the Province, and<br />
authority to take every measure for its <br />
defence. Then whay was the use of ask-<br />
ing them to explain a part? The mem-<br />
ber of Carleton (Mr. Connell) said that<br />
the Government has credited the alarm ; <br />
but if he could believe his ears, that hon.<br />
member had done more to create alarm<br />
than any one else, and had been himself<br />
most frightened of any, Mr. Connell said<br />
that Woodstock was absolutely undefend-<br />
ed ; but he (Mr. N.) (here the hon mem-<br />
ber gave the details of the information he<br />
had received from an individual from that <br />
part of the country,) knew that in Wood-<br />
stock, Florenceville, Hardscrabble,
&amp;c.,<br />
there were seven or eight companies, <br />
and a home guard fully armed and equip-<br />
ned. As to the Bill, it was all nonsence<br />
to suppose that the Government were<br />
going to build or purchase war vessels.<br />
All they asked power to do was to hire<br />
them if necessary. The Bill gave the<br />
Government no more authority than the<br />
Imperial Act. If the Government thought<br />
is absolutely necessary to have a portion<br />
of a navy, they ought to have the power.<br />
The moment the Bill was passed the<br />
Government must go to work and show<br />
that they were determined to do some-<br />
thing. With regard to economy, that<br />
was all very fine ; but were he in a Gov-<br />
ernment, he would do what was right,<br />
irrespective of what might be said, no<br />
matter whether he might be kicked out<br />
or kicked in. He was perfectly willing<br />
to vote, for the Bill, and had every faith
<br />
that the Government would exercise <br />
economy. He had great faith in the <br />
Government. Let the hon. members take<br />
up the public accounts now published,<br />
and examine for themselves, and see if<br />
from first to last the most rigid economy<br />
had not been exercised. Never, until<br />
this year, had the public accounts been <br />
put forth in such a simple manner of Dr.<br />
and Cr., showing what was received, ex-<br />
pended, and what was owed, so that every<br />
man, of whatever capacity, in the country<br />
could understand them. Very different<br />
from the old hugger-mugger system, that<br />
only made multiplication more mystified.<br />
Economy, he went on to say, was all very<br />
well ; but he did not like cheese-paring.<br />
</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="ocr_carea" id="block_1_6" title="bbox 37 1889 658 1925">
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">He would not support a paltry, cheese-<br />
paring Government. When he supported<br />
a Government, he must be sure when they<br />
were born somebody must have died.<br />
With regard to the BIll, if there was an<br />
expectation of serious trouble, he was<br />
prepared to give the Government all the<br />
power that was necessary, and would put<br />
the country in a proper state of defence.<br />
If Carleton and Woodstock, were unpro-<br />
tected, he would protect them ; and if St.<br />
Stephen and St. Andrews were unpro-<br />
tected, he would also protect them. If<br />
they were not now protected, they ought<br />
to be. Mr. Needham then proceeded to <br />
to read an extract concerning Fenianism<br />
and the comtempt in which it was held in<br />
the States, from the New York <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>, <br />
copied into the <span style="font-style: italic;">Globe</span>.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY.â€”The <span style="font-style: italic;">Globe</span> is no<br />
authority.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. NEEDHAM.â€”The <span style="font-style: italic;">Globe</span> was<br />
good authority. It had never been bought<br />
and sold. He read the whole of the ex-<br />
tract from it, and commented upon it.<br />
He quoted with particular emphasis the<br />
following passage:</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"But shou'd the necessity arise for the<br />
United States Government to assery the<br />
supremacy of the municipal law of the <br />
country, that duty will be loyally perform-<br />
ed, even if our lately neutral friends are <br />
the first to profit thereby."</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">He said he had read that sentiment<br />
with an immence amount of pleasure.<br />
Those words ought to be engraven in<br />
gold, and hung up in the most conspicu-<br />
ous places in the halls of every Provin-<br />
cial Legislature, and in the House of <br />
Commons in England ; and they ought<br />
to be engraven in the heart of every true<br />
man. Here was a great nation that had<br />
been deluged in blood, and been over-<br />
whlemed with taxation, and all this to<br />
work out and prove to the world that<br />
glorious principle of self-government ; <br />
and in that mighty struggle to stay re-<br />
bellion, he must say that they received<br />
anything by sympathy from these Colo-<br />
nies. Here was that great nation pro-<br />
claiming that, though its "neutral<br />
friends" would be the first to share the<br />
benefit, it was determined to addert the<br />
supremacy of its municipal law, and pro-<br />
tect these Colonies from any raid from<br />
American territory. He rejoiced that he<br />
was here to pay to the men of that great<br />
nation a just tribute to their noblemess. <br />
This great Northern American Continent<br />
had the salvation of many a crown head <br />
in Europe. Many of them would have been<br />
tottered to the centre long before this, <br />
had not this great Continent received<br />
their disaffected subjects as free men,<br />
who otherwise would, by rebellion, have<br />
obtained the glorious privilege of freedom.<br />
These men looked across the broad At-<br />
lantic to this great, glorious and free<br />
land, and when they landed on North<br />
American soil they breathed the air of <br />
pure and unalloyed freedom. It had been<br />
said that the Antis were disloyal, but he<br />
flung back the charge with contempt. <br />
He was loyal to his Queen ; he was loyal <br />
to his country ; he loved the British law<br />
and he loved the British Constitution.<br />
These were the honest sentiments of his <br />
heart.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY said that this Bill was<br />
working out one thing. One of the great-<br />
est bugbears held up by the Antis was if<br />
the Province went into Confederation we<br />
would have to support a navy. It ap-<br />
peared by the Bill that we were going to<br />
