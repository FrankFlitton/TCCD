          <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">… Mr. LINDSAY. The country re-<br /> 
            quired information upon this subject.<br /> 
            The people were crying out what was<br /> 
            being done for the defence of whe coun-<br />
            try ? and yet when a question was put<br />
            to the leader of the Government as to<br />
            what was doing, honorable members<br />
            could get no information. If the coun-<br />
            try could not get information it<br />
            wanted the members had better go home<br />
            at once. They had heard a great deal<br />
            about the Fenians—he had read it in the<br />
            papers that these Fenians claimed affi-<br />
            nity with the Anti-Confederates was<br />
            the country to be kept in a state of alarm<br />
            and suspense and unprepared to meet<br />
            any invasion because it was cursed<br />
            with an Anti-Confederate Government?<br />
            Away with such an idea! Some men<br />
            might pooh, pooh, and laugh at the<br />
            threats of these Fenians, but it was dif-<br />
            ferent in the country—different with<br />
            the people, with families living on the<br />
            frontier—where they were open to the<br />
            attacks of cut-throat raiders and assas-<br />
            sins. Members ask what proceedings<br />
            had been taken to repel invasion and<br />
            they were told they could not get infor-<br />
            mation! He thought the country had<br />
            arrived at a crisis when the people<br />
            would be required  to show on what side<br />
            they were, and to rally for the defence<br />
            of their country, for the preservation of<br />
            British Institutions, for the protection<br />
            of these British colonies. As for him-<br />
            self he was willing, when the time<br />
            arrived, to give his money, and his<br />
            means and himself if it wsa necessary.<br />

   ATTORNEY GENERAL did not see<br />
   what occasion there was for the hon.<br />
   member of Carleton to work himself<br />
   into such a fury. What did he want?<br />
   Did he wish to get information of what<br />
   the Government were doing—which<br />
   would be copied into all the papers—<br />
   and be the means of directing attention<br />
   to what it was necessary to keep secret?<br />
   He would tell the hon. member that the<br />
   Government were taking proper pre-<br />
   cautionary measures to meet any danger<br />
   that might be threatened. The insinua-<br />
   tion that he (Mr. Lindsay) had made,<br />
   that there was a connection between<br />
   the Fenians and the Anti-Confederates<br />
   in this Province, was false and calum-<br />
   nious. It was unworthy his palce as a<br />
   member of that House; it ws unwor-<br />
   thy himself as a mean thus to traduce the<br />
   chracter of the Anti-Confederate party<br />
   by insinuating that they had a sympathy<br />
   with the designs of a band of marauders.<br />
   As for himself he had as much stake in<br />
   the country, as much pride in British<br />
   connection, as much desire to maintain<br />
   it, and he would sacrifice as much to<br />
   preserve it as the member of Carleton<br />
   himself. He would ask the House, he<br />
   would ask the country, if it ws not<br />
   entirely unworthy of his (Mr. L.'s)<br />
   place to make such an insinuation?<br />
   What object had he in making such an<br />
   attack upon the Government if it was<br />
   not for some party purpose in order to<br />
   damage them in the eyes of the coun-<br />
   try? The hon. member of St. John<br />
   (Mr. Wilmot) had asked what was cer-<br />
   tainly a proper question; but he ap-<br />
   pealed to the hon. member of Carleton<br />
   himself, he appealed to the House, he<br />
   appealed to the country, if the Fenians<br />
   were preparing to make a raid upon our<br />
   borders, would it be prudent to direct<br />
   the attention to what we were doing—<br />
   would it be right to point to the very<br />
   spot where the Government were send-<br />
   ing men? Did not he (Mr. L.) believe<br />
   when he (Attorney General) stated that<br />
   the Government were taking every pro-<br />
   per step to repel invasion? He could<br />
   assure him, and he could assure the<br />
   country that energetic measures, and as<br />
   effective as the resources of the Province<br />
   would justify, were being taken by the<br />
   Government at this present time. 
 </p>
  <p>
    Mr. CONNELL thought that the lan-<br />
    guage of the Attorney General was quite<br />
    as emphatic as that of his colleague (Mr.<br />
    Lindsay). He (Mr. C) was not at all sa-<br />
    tisfied with what the Attorney General<br />
    had said. The country demanded to<br />
    know what danger was threatening the<br />
    Province, and what preparation the Gov-<br />
    nment was making to meet it. It was<br />
    but right that he (Mr. C.) should be fur-<br />
    nished with information to send to the<br />
    people of the country—those who lived<br />
    alnog the upper St. John river. He be-<br />
    lieved the time had come when the re-<br />
    sources of the country should be placed<br />
    in the hands of an Administration in<br />
    whom the people had confidence. He<br />
    would put all the resources of the coun-<br />
    try at their disposal, because he felt<br />
    that the danger was imminent. He<br />
    thought the Government had fallen very<br />
    far short of their duty in this matter.<br />
    Why had not preparations been made<br />
    months ago. Those who lived in the<br />
    city and town knew little chil-<br />
    dren had come to him crying, and saying<br />
    "something should be done to protect<br />
    us." The Attorney General might laugh,<br />
