Mr. Hatheway proceeded to make<br />
some further personal remarks, and then <br />
spoke against the Quebec Scheme, and<br />
said that but for the influences brought to <br />
bear upon the Hon. Mr. George Brown,<br />
they would have had much better terms<br />
of union offered them than those propos-<br />
ed by that scheme, and he did not think<br />
the country was yet prepared to adopt it.<br />
He then concluded by saying he had en-<br />
deavored to justicy the course he had<br />
taken.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. MCCLELAN.—There was one<br />
count, the hon. member said, the Govern-<br />
ment plead guilty to. What was that?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. HATHEWAY.—The Ex-<br />
port Duty Law.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. MCMILLAN.—Should the Gov-<br />
ernment agree to a scheme of union,<br />
would they require the route of the Inter-<br />
Colonial Railway to be defined?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. HATHEWAY.—As a mem-<br />
ber of the Government, he would give him<br />
the necessary information that day <br />
week.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Debate was then adjourned over<br />
until to-morrow at eleven.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The motion being put the House was <br />
then adjourned over until to-morrow at<br />
ten o'clock.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER said he had only dis-<br />
covered yesterday, that the practice in<br />
this House had been not to send Bills<br />
to the Legislative Council until after<br />
the Address had passed. He could see<br />
no reason why they should not go to<br />
get on with the business, so that there <br />
should not be a rush of business at the <br />
close of the Session. He would, there-<br />
fore, move that the Bill to incorporate <br />
the Fredericton Railway Company be<br />
read a third time, in order that it could<br />
be sent to the Council.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Several other hon. members expressed<br />
themselves in favor of the motion, <br />
which was carried.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The House then went into Committee<br />
on a Bill to facilitate the construction of<br />
a Railway to Fredericton, which was<br />
agreed to. </p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The time for taking up the order of<br />
the day having arrived, it was proposed<br />
to adjourn the debate until two o'clock,<br />
as Mr. McClellan—who, it was under-<br />
stood, was to be the next speaker upon<br />
the question—was not prepared to speak<br />
in consequence of being unwell.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The HON. MR. SMITH and others<br />
urged, because the members of the<br />
House would not give the other business<br />
proper attention while a question of so<br />
much importance to the coutnry was<br />
not decided. Some of the members of <br />
the Opposition ought to be prepared to <br />
go on with the debate, or have the vote<br />
taken. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY expressed his willing-<br />
ness to make a few remarks in the after-<br />
noon, but was not prepares at present.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE thought the same<br />
courtesy should be extended to the hon. <br />
Surveyor General—the debate having<br />
been adjourned on Saturday in conse-<br />
quence of his being unwell.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. CUDLIP though, if they <br />
had less speaking, the country would<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> be better off. He had always made up<br />
his mind on the great questions of the <br />
day before he came to the House. They<br />
had better have the division, so they<br />
could attend to the business of the <br />
country.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">A BILL RELATING TO THE SETTLEMENT<br />
AND SUPPORT OF THE POOR IN THIS <br />
PROVINCE.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY moved the House<br />
into Committee on the above Bill, and<br />
said, that it was a copy of a Bill intro-<br />
duced by his hon. friend from Northum-<br />
berland, some years ago, which had <br />
passed through the House, but had<br />
been rejected in the Upper House. Its<br />
object was to define where the poor<br />
legally belonged.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">COL. BOYD was in favour of the Bill,<br />
for such a law was very much needed.<br />
In St. Andrews, and on the borders,<br />
numbers of poor persons come from<br />
the United States and get relief from<br />
the Parish. This Bill provides that a<br />
person shall be a resident of the Parish<br />
for twelve months before he can claim<br />
relief. He thought one Parish should<br />
not support the poor of the neighboring<br />
Parishes.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. ANGLIN was inclined to support<br />
the Bill. He believed that, although<br />
the City members supported it, several<br />
members of the country districts opposed<br />
it ; and though it was not right to pro-<br />
tract matters, yet the Bill should not be<br />
pressed on when so many members<br />
were absent, for he would like to give<br />
any member who opposed it a fair<br />
chance.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. YOUNG though it was an im-<br />
portant Bill, and advised the mover to<br />
report progress on the Bill, for he would<br />
like to know more about it before he<br />
agreed to it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY said, the Bill was <br />
well known to the members of the <br />
House—it having passed the House<br />
nce or twice, and the Legislative<br />
Council had it published in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Royal<br />
Gazette</span>. If a pauper came from one <br />
Parish into another, there would be no<br />
injustice in sending him to the Parish<br />
from which he came.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. HILL had no objection to that<br />
section of the Bill, but he had great ob-<br />
jection to the manner in which the Bill<br />
was passing through this House. With<br />
one or two exceptions, there was not a<br />
member who had heard it read, and not<br />
half a dozen members knew the provi-<br />
sions of the Bill. If this was their sys-<br />
tem of passing Bills, any Bill could be<br />
got through the House. It was an un-<br />
safe method of legislating, although the<br />
Bill may be all right.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. KERR said this Bill was a copy of <br />
a Bill which he had taken a considerable<br />
amount of the pains to frame, and which had<br />
passed the House unanimously. The<br />
Council thought it a Bill of importantce,<br />
and published it in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Royal Gazette</span>.
It<br />
comprehends the principles of the State <br />
of Maine and the State of New York<br />
poor laws. He was glad to see it dis<br />
cussed, and thought it would be a great<br />
imporvement upon the existing state of<br />
things, for they now had no law for the re-<br />
moval of the poor to their own parish.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. SMITH said there was no <br />
law for the poor at all at present. A gen-<br />
tleman in Prince Edward Island had<br />
written to him for a copy of this Bill,<br />
which he supposed was the law. He had<br />
written back that we had no law : we on-</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ly had some custom which had been taken<br />
from an English law. They should un-<br />
derstand what the law was relating to <br />
this subject. He thought that Bill was<br />
well adapted to this country, therefore<br />
he should support it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Progress was then reported. <br />

</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">AFTERNOON SESSION.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S<br />
AMENDMENT.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. LINDSAY. As the hon. member<br />
from the County of Albert (Mr. McCle<br />
lan) is not in his place, I will make a few<br />
remarks, but I will not occupy much <br />
time. The people take a great interest in <br />
this question, for they attend here anxious<br />
to know what is going on. I am pleased<br />
to see them, for I think it is the duty of<br />
the constituency to keep their eye on the<br />
Government, and to see that the men who<br />
come here to represent them do not mis-<br />
represent them. I think that public men<br />
are public property, and we have a right<br />
to refer to their public acts as long as we<br />
do not misrepresent them. When a ques-<br />
tion was asked a few days ago about the<br />
defence of the Province, I stated there <br />
was something in common between Antis<br />
and Fenians. The Attorney General<br />
thought I insinuated that the Anti-<br />
Confederate member of the Legislature<br />
sympathized with the Fenians. I did not <br />
mean any such thing. I will call atten-<br />
tion to why I consider Antic and Fenains<br />
agree. I will read an extract from the<br />
New York <span style="font-style: italic;">Irish People</span>, a
Fenian organ,<br />
dated Feb. 17, which refers to the Reci-<br />
porcity Treaty, and gives a reason why<br />
the American Government should not ne-<br />
gotiate a treaty :</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Another reason which should have its<br />
weight with every well-wisher of Ameri-<br />
ca is this? <span style="font-style: italic;">Why should be negotiate
a trea-<br />
ty with the very men who are to-day con-<br />
cocting the plan of a Confederation of the <br />
British Colonies</span>, in order to erect a bar-<br />
ier against the expansion of the Ameri-<br />
can nation, to transplant a viceeregal<br />
court nroth of us, where the admirers<br />
and the flatterers of the aristocratic re-<br />
gime may go and parage their pretentious<br />
individuality? No, let there be no trea-<br />
ty whatever!"</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">That was to prevent the Confederate<br />
Union that would raise a barrier to the<br />
further extension of the American Gov-<br />
ernment. Another paper takes the same<br />
view of it :</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"<span style="font-style: italic;">It will
be dangerous to given encourage-<br />
ment,</span> even temporarilty,<span style="font-style: italic;"> to
the inter-Colo-<br />
nial feeling which certain influential men,</span><br />
both in Britain and in Canada, <span style="font-style: italic;">are
doing<br />
all in their power to cultivate</span>. The sus-<br />
pension of reciprocal trade will be a co-<br />
gent argument with the Canadians in <br />
favor of the building of the inter Colonial<br />
Railway, WHICH EVERY INHABITANT OF<br />
NEW ENGLAND SHOULD SEEK TO PREVENT<br />
BY ALL PROPER MEANS, and which, with<br />
the continuance of reciprocity, and the<br />
prosecution of the international line,<br />
will, in our opinion, never be built.<br />
Closely allied to his is the political Con-<br />
federation of the Provinces, which can<br />
never be brought to pass unless an un-<br />
friendly policy on the part of the United <br />
States <span style="font-style: italic;">shall force them, for their
mutual<br />
protection and prosperity, into a closer<br />
compact and alliance than now exists.</span>"<br />
