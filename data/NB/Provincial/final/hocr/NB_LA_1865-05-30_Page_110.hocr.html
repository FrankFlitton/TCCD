<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">COSTIGAN.—I</span>
have heard, and the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">people</span> of this Province believe, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that influ-</span><br />
ences are at work to endeavour to force<br />
this Union upon us; that representations <br />
are made in England that we are a people <br />
disloyal, and do not wish to do our share <br />
of whatever is necessary to maintain the <br />
connection between them and the British <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>. It is our duty to
protect <br />
that character of loyalty by sending a <br />
delegation to correct those false represen- <br />
tations. The ex-Surveyor General has <br />
stated that the first part of the resolution <br />
is not correct, in stating that this Union <br />
would be injurious to the people of this<br />
Province. There are many hon. gentlemen<br />
in this House better qualified to show<br />
wherein that Union would have been in-<br />
jurious, and the necessity for this resolu-<br />
tion; but I wish to say a few words in<br />
order to show the disadvantages and ruin<br />
it would bring upon this Province. It<br />
does not require a masterly mind to see it.<br />
It has been said that Union is strength,<br />
but it would not be so in this case. The<br />
more the people became acquainted with<br />
the Scheme, the more they opposed it<br />
The opponents of the Scheme had to con-<br />
tend with many disadvantages. I con-<br />
tend that when the people defeat a Scheme<br />
proposed by the Government in power, it<br />
is a sure sign that they have a two-third<br />
majority of the people of the country, be-<br />
cause the Government by their position<br />
have an influence upon the country, and<br />
there is not a locality but what feels this<br />
influence, because there is a sympathy ex-<br />
isting between the Government and the<br />
office holders in the country which leads<br />
them to adopt their measures when they<br />
otherwise would not ; many of those who<br />
advocated the Scheme of Confederation<br />
did not know what the conditions of the<br />

ment proposed it they were bound to<br />
carry it out. I know this to be a fact,<br />
that many who took an active part against<br />
Confederation could not explain how it<br />
was to be carried out. We were three<br />
distinct people, but were to be governed<br />
by one general Government, and that was<br />
to be carried on by a majority vote; that<br />
majority was to rule the country and tax<br />
the people as they saw fit. According to<br />
the construction of Government we would<br />
be represented by fifteen representatives,<br />
and these would have to fight against 145. <br />
Although I might have much respect for<br />
the ability of our representatives, yet I<br />
would not have much reason to expect<br />
that they would have much success in<br />
anything they undertook for the benefit of<br />
the Province. Then the question of the<br />
Intercolonial Railway was brought up,<br />
and it was said under Confederation we<br />
could have the Railway wherever we<br />
wished it ; but my opinion is, that if the<br />
people of Canada really desire the rail-<br />
way, the same facilities for building the<br />
road exist without Confederation as with<br />
it. There was no guarantee that we would<br />
have this railroad under Confederation; it<br />
might grow out of the Scheme, and it<br />
might not. I was said that the general<br />
revenues could not expended in the<br />
construction of the Canal system, as that<br />
was guarded against by a resolution of<br />
the Conference, which said that this work<br />
should be prosecuted so soon as the finan-<br />
ces of the country permitted. Who was<br />
to decide when the state of the finances<br />
would permit it to be built? The general<br />
Government of Canada ; and they would<br />
not object to have the work go on imme-<br />
diately if they had Confederation, because<br />
they would have an additional inducement<br />
to extend them when they drag in those<br />
three Lower Provinces to bear their pro-<br />
portion of this great work. This was one<br />
of the grand reasons which induced the<br />
Canadians to advocate Confederation.<br />
They were involved in difficulties in re-<br />
gard to the Union with Lower Canada and<br />
in regard to their finances, and they real-<br />
ly required an additional field<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—not for<br />
public expenditure in improvements</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—but<br />
an additional field for taxation and reve-<br />
nue ; that was the reason why they were<br />
so anxious to secure the Union of these<br />
Colonies. The Canadians would have no<br />
reason to complain if they were taxed,<br />
because it would be expended and circu-<br />
lated among themselves, and would bear<br />
upon the people of this country, because<br />
they would have to pay this money which<br />
would never be returned again. It was<br />
said that the Government to each Pro-<br />
vince should have a certain sum to ex-<br />
pend for local purposes ; this was true<br />
enough, we had to provide for our own<br />
local expenditure, and so had the other<br />
Provinces except Canada, who had the<br />
additional advantage of having the general<br />
revenue expended on her public works,<br />
and it, therefore, became local expendi-<br />
ture, and we would have to pay for that<br />
from which we would derive no benefit.<br />
Now, in regard to representation by<br />
population. There is one Section of the<br />
Scheme which provides for the readjust-<br />
ment of the representation by population<br />
every ten years. In such readjustment<br />
Lower Canada is always to be assigned<br />
sixty-five members, and each of the other<br />
Provinces shall have the same number of<br />
members to which it will be entitled on<br />
the same ratio of representation as Lower<br />
Canada will then have. According to<br />
that in a few years, taking the increase of<br />
population according to the past as the</span></p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> nearest criterion to judge by, the repre-
<br />
sentatives of Upper Canada in seventeen <br />
years would out-vote the whole of the <br />
other Provinces. It has been argued that <br />
if we had Confederation it would make a <br />
great change, and we would become a <br />
great country for capitalists, and emi- <br />
grants would be induced to come here. <br />
Would it change the course of our rivers <br />
and give more facilities to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">manufacturers
?<br />
The only change it would make would be</span><br />
to place at the disposal of the General <br />
Government in Canada the whole resour- <br />
ces of the Colonies, and emigration would <br />
tend to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> part of the
Confederation, for <br />
we would be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">removed</span> from any
benefit <br />
arising from the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction</span> of
public <br />
works. I believe that there is reason for <br />
making the assertion that inﬂuences are <br />
brought to bear abroad to place the peo- <br />
ple of this Province and the Government <br />
of the day in a wrong position. It is as- <br />
serted by those who are very anxious <br />
about the Confederation scheme, that the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> of the day is merely
called <br />
into its present position by accident. I <br />
contend that if those who are favourable <br />
to Confederation wish to see the present <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span>
retire from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">their</span> present <br />
position, they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">better</span> say
nothing <br />
about Confederation, for so long as the <br />
people of the country are reminded of the <br />
Scheme, just so long will they rally round <br />
those who <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">defeated</span> it. <br />
