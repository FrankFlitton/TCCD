of this question from a wrong stand-point.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
The Government had a strong influence<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">in support of Confederation, even when<br />
not directly exercised, because men who <br />
did not understand the question would sup-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
port the measure as they considered that<br />
it must be a good Scheme, for the members<br />
of the Government who had given the<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
subject every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">consideration</span> had
supported<br />
it. The hon. member has also said that<br />
the inﬂuence of the President of the <br />
Council was as great in regard to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pro-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">musing</span> offices as the late
Government. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
There was no inﬂuence in this respect,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
for it was prophesied from the beginning <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of the election campaign that Confedera-<br />
tion would be carried ; the newspapers<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
said that there would be twenty-six return-<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
ed in favor of it at the very least, and even<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
those opposed to the Scheme feared it<br />
would be carried. The Reverend Editor<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
of a paper <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">told</span> us that a
majority would<br />
be returned in favor of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation,</span><br />
whether Charlotte elected men in support <br />
of it or not, and others said that if <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">we</span>
<br />
wished any favors from the Government, <br />
we must return men who would support<br />
them, as they were sure to be elected and<br />
have a majority in the House. This had<br />
a great effect in influencing the votes of<br />
the people in favor of the Scheme. Again, <br />
reference has been made to eclesiastical<br />
influence. In our County I am not aware <br />
of any clergyman taking any part in the<br />
elections ; but in the City of St. John, the<br />
organs of religious denominations were in<br />
favor of Confederation. They raised an<br />
issue that it was a question in which reli-<br />
gion was largely involved, and they had<br />
an influence among the people throughout<br />
the country. The hon. gentleman from<br />
Albert says why should we send this de-<br />
legation home, as Confederation is dead.<br />
I say we want to bury it and carry it face<br />
downwards, so deep that ti can never be<br />
resuscitated. I do not think it right that<br />
we should burden ourselves with debt,<br />
and deprive ourselves with all power to<br />
regulate our own affairs for the sake of<br />
giving twenty-five men a larger field in<br />
which to exhibit themselves. The more<br />
this Scheme is discussed the less favor it<br />
will find. The Government chose their<br />
own time ; they made their statements to<br />
the public first, they had the press in their<br />
favor, and they used every opportunity to<br />
bring their views before the country.<br />
The election took place in winter when<br />
the lumbermen were absent, and those <br />
who got to the polls had little <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">informa-</span><br />
tion on this subject, therefore they had<br />
every advantage which their influence and <br />
position could give them. The proper <br />
method would have been to have submit- <br />
ted the question to a direct vote of the <br />
people, apart from all <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span>
considera- <br />
tions,or the popularity of this or that <br />
candidate. My hon. friend said the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-</span>
<br />
tension of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canals</span> in Canada
might <br />
be as popular in New Brunswick as in<br />
Canada. He has given us credit for a<br />
great deal of disinterestedness in stating<br />
that we would be willing to help build<br />
those Canals, which will have the effect of<br />
carrying the trade away from us. We are<br />
not generally so disinterested; the people<br />
of the North are not willing to be taxed<br />
to build Western Extension, unless it is<br />
to get something in return. The hon.<br />
gentleman says we should rise above the<br />
position of politicians into the position of<br />
statesmen ; he would have us rise above<br />
all considerations of the interests of our<br />
own Province. I say it is the duty of the<br />
statesmen of New Brunswick to look af-<br />
ter the welfare of their own Province.<br />
So far as business is concerned, Canada is<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> a foreign country to us. He says that<br />
we stand in the same position to Canada<br />
that the seaboard in the United States<br />
does to the great West. He must give<br />
us credit for a great deal of geographical<br />
ignorance in regard to the United States<br />
and Canada Railways. It is only 469<br />
miles from the City of Toronto to New<br />
York ; but it is by the Intercolonial Rail-<br />
way 1,100 miles to St. John, and goods<br />
will be sent to the nearest outlet. We are<br />
told this Intercolonial Railway is to cost<br />
us nothing, and it will develop our mines<br />
and minerals of Albert and Carleton<br />
Counties. I would ask what route it will<br />
take ? I have understood that it will take<br />
the central route, then it will pass through<br />
neither of these Counties. It has been<br />
said by a Canadian statesman that after<br />
the Intercolonial Railway was built, he<br />
would not undertake to run it, for the<br />
whole revenue of one of the Lower Pro-<br />
vinces. My hon. friend dwelt upon the<br />
great advantage that would accrue to the<br />
people of this Province from the increas-<br />
ed market which we would have for man-<br />
ufactured articles ; but the fact is, that<br />
the manufactured articles of Canada sell<br />
on the upper St. John now at cheaper<br />
rates than those of home manufacture,<br />
notwithstanding the cost of transport and<br />
duty upon them. They can manufacture<br />
cheaper than we can, because labor and<br />
food are cheaper ; in addition to that they<br />
can get their raw material, iron and coal<br />
cheaper than we can ; inasmuch as many<br />
vessels leaving ports in England to go to<br />
Quebec, for the purpose of getting a cargo<br />
of timber, take out coal and iron at low<br />
freight as ballast ; therefore we find they<br />
are quoted cheaper there than in St. John,<br />
besides that they have the market and<br />
the consumers at their own door. I do<br />
not believe the manufacturers who signed<br />
that circular in St. John, had any idea of<br />
sending their goods to Canada, but they<br />
may have thought of sending them to<br />
Nova Scotia. All the advantages that<br />
would be gained by this Union, would be<br />
gained by free trade among the Lower<br />
Provinces, or a maritime Union. Great<br />
stress is laid upon the fact, that we obtain<br />
our flour from Canada. It was said by<br />
the hon. member from the County of Al-<br />
bert, that we would buy in the cheapest<br />
market and sell in the dearest. Quebec<br />
never will be the cheapest market for us<br />
to buy in, taking into consideration the<br />
cost of transport, and the fact that Lower<br />
Canada is not a grain producing country.<br />
If we wish to obtain it from Montreal we<br />
have to transport it a distance of 550<br />
miles, if we bring it by the Intercolonial<br />
Railway ; but it can be brought much<br />
cheaper to Portland, as the distance by<br />
the Grand Trunk Railway is but 290 miles<br />
and from there to St. John it can be<br />
brought at an additional cost of twen-<br />
ty-five cents per barrel. It is said they<br />
may put on certain restrictions that will<br />
prevant Canadian goods from finding an<br />
outlet. It is not to be supposed that the<br />
people of the United States will be so<br />
blind to their interests as to prevent the<br />
expenditure of millions of money in the<br />
transport of Canadian goods. It has been<br />
stated that this Scheme was rejected on<br />
account of the unpopularity of the late<br />
Government, this is not the case in our sec-<br />
tion of the country, for the Liberal party<br />
are there very popular ; but when this<br />
Scheme came up, our people said they<br />
would sacrifice the Liberal party for the<br />
sake of opposing Confederation. I am<br />
desirous of seeing this delegation because<br />
it is necessary to make use of some such<br />
means to correct the misrepresentations<br />
that have been made there by the Cana-<br />

which I can agree with my hon. friend<br />
from the County of Albert, that is, in his<br />
choice of delegates ; he thinks the hon.<br />
Mr. Smith and the hon. Mr. Anglin<br />
are the proper persons to go on this dele-<br />
gation. There are no two men who so<br />
well represent the sentiments of the peo-<br />
ple of New Brunswick on this question,<br />
and there are no two men who have done<br />
so much to oppose this Scheme, which<br />
would have brought so much evil upon<br />
the people of this Province. It has been<br />
said that the hon. President of the Coun-<br />
cil might have allowed a desire for posi-<br />
tion to influence his course. It is well<br />
known that this is not the case. He has<br />
made a sacrifice of his time and money<br />
for the good of the country ; he has de-<br />
voted his time and his ability to enlighten<br />
the people. If it is ambition, to have la-<br />
bor, care and anxiety for the benefit of the<br />
public without any remuneration, it is of<br />
an unblamable kind, and I wish we had<br />
more of it.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. HILL.—They tell us that anti-Confe-<br />
deration had but four or six hundred<br />
majority, and that is reported and<br />
reiterated and adopted as being the<br />
true state of things. It appears that<br />
the mantle of prophesy has fallen<br />
upon these gentlemen ; they tell us now<br />
as they they told us before the election<br />
that Confederation is sure to be carried.<br />
They are like Miller prophesying the de-<br />
struction of the world ; when the time<br />
comes for the prophesy to be fulfilled they<br />
prophesy anew. These gentlemen imi-<br />
tate the rallying cry of Mahomet, " Great<br />
is Allah and Mahomet is his Prophet,"<br />
and substitute " Great is Confederation<br />
and many are its profits." But the profits<br />
would be to Canada and the expense to New<br />
Brunswick and the other Maratime Pro-<br />
vinces. Much stress has been laid by the ad-<br />
vocates of Confederation upon the military<br />
and defence portion of the question. We<br />
have been told that we were in danger of<br />
being swallowed up by the United States,<br />
and that we must unite with Canada in<br />
order to place ourselves in a position to<br />
repel any attack from that quarter. The<br />
Monroe doctrine, in all its terrors, has<br />
been harped upon. Do these gentlemen<br />
know what the doctrine is, and where it<br />
originated ? Do they know that it emu-<br />
lated from the British Government, and<br />
that its promulgation was urged by that<br />
Government through its Minister at Wash-<br />
ington upon the Cabinet of President<br />
Munroe. France had formed an alliance<br />
with Spain, and one of the objects of that<br />
alliance was the reconquest of the Spanish<br />
American Colonies, for the purpose of<br />
again bringing them under the domina-<br />
tion of the Latin races. The British<br />
Ministry, anxious to prevent the success<br />
of this Scheme, strongly pressed upon the<br />
American Government the adoption of<br />
that policy, which was almost immediate-<br />
ly accepted by President Monroe, and em-<br />
bodied in his famous message to Con-<br />
gress. This policy, then first declared, was<br />
that the United States would not consent<br />
to the establishment of any Foreign<br />
Power upon American soil, and that they<br />
would not, without resistance, allow any<br />
European nation to obtain further foothold<br />
in America beyond that already existing.<br />
And now, while the establishment of<br />
Maximilian by French aid in Mexico is<br />
an infringement of policy so laid down,<br />
the British North American Provinces do<br />
not come within its restriction and it was</p>
