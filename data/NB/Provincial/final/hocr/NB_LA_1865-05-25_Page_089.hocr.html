</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">NEEDHAM.—I
certainly</span>
think that <br />
when that resolution came up members <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessarily</span> absent on business in
the <br />
Committee <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Room should have been call-
<br />
ed, for it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a subject</span> of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">greatest im</span>- <br />
portance, and more particularly affects <br />
the County of York than any other Coun- <br />
ty in the Province. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">d</span>ecidedly
op- <br />
posed to it, for I do not think any such<br />
union can be effected that will be a bene- <br />
fit to New Brunswick ; on the contrary <br />
it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">materially</span> injure the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province.</span> <br />
With regard to a commercial union or <br />
the adoption of a uniform tariff, and <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">postal</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">rates,</span> I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have no</span> objection ; if we <br />
can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">assimilate</span> our <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tariff, postal</span> arrange- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ments</span> and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">currency,</span> it will, no doubt <br />
be a benefit to the colonies, but I nev- <br />
er will consent to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">legislative</span>
union, <br />
which is part and parcel of this resolu- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tion,</span> which certainly commits the
mem- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bers</span> of this House ; for if this
delegation <br />
agrees to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> Legisla<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">tive</span> union, how can <br />
any member get up and opp<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ose</span> it
after <br />
having voted for this resolution. Now, <br />
as a matter of courtesy, when a proposi- <br />
tion is made by one Province to another, <br />
I am willing to extend all the courtesy <br />
I can, consistent with my duty, but I am <br />
not willing to have a delegation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go
there</span>
<br />
and determine whether we shall have a <br />
legislative or commercial union, for <br />
those who vote for it will be bound by <br />
it. I believe that a legislative union <br />
would be more destructive to this Pro- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">vince</span> than that grand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> <br />
scheme, and if we must choose between <br />
two evils we had better choose the least. <br />
If I had to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">choose</span> between a
Legislative <br />
Union of the Lower Colonies, or this <br />
grand <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> scheme which
I do <br />
not believe in, I would say, give me the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">scheme</span> ten to one. This <br />
Union of the Lower Colonies would <br />
dwindle us down into absolute <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">insigni-</span>
<br />
ficance;  it would deprive us of our seat <br />
of Government, and render the whole<br />
Province <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">less</span> than a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">municipality.</span> I <br />
confess I feel strongly on this subject, <br />
and do not wish to be misunderstood. <br />
I want to record my vote against it, but <br />
I do not want to record a silent vote. <br />
We do not know what this delegation<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
may do, when they get there, but I do<br />
not feel disposed <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to give</span> them
the power <br />
to legislate for a Legislative Union. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Some persons</span> might <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">say</span> because I was <br />
away from my seat that I shirked <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<br />
question. Perhaps I may be rather too <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">bold,</span> but I never shirk. I am <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepared</span> <br />
to speak, vote and act as I think, <br />
whether it is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">right</span> or wrong,
and then I <br />
am responsible for what I do. If the <br />
word <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Legislative</span> Union had not
been <br />
there I would have voted for the resolu- <br />
tion, for we ought to have a delegation<br />
to consider a Commercial Union ; but I<br />
