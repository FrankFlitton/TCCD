<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> did I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span>
think so I am sure I would not<br />
so speak.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">There are other hon. members who<br />
get credit for knowing a great deal about<br />
finance, and without wishing to depre-<br />
ciate them, or recommend myself, I feel<br />
quite satisfied there is not one among<br />
them who can discharge the duties bet-<br />
ter than I can.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">As I made allusion, yesterday, to the<br />
Inter-colonial Railway, and it has been<br />
talked about considerably during this<br />
debate, and has been held out as a great<br />
inducement for us to go into Confedera-<br />
tion, I will venture, although a little<br />
out of connexion, to read an extract<br />
from the Toronto Globe, which speaks<br />
Mr. George Brown's sentiments on that<br />
questions:—</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"Upper Canadians have not suffered<br />
enough, it appears, in the estimation of<br />
Upper Canadian members of the Cab-<br />
inet, from being tied to one poor East-<br />
ern Province, it must have three more<br />
added to its already heavy burdens.<br />
One Legislature is not a sufficiently<br />
cumbrous, unwieldy and expensive<br />
body, buyt must add to it the represen-<br />
tatives of three other communities, each<br />
section with varying local interests,<br />
and all pulling at the same purse. And<br />
to show what we may look for in the<br />
future, we are to pay four-twelfths of<br />
the cost of a Railway to unite us to these<br />
new allies, and to keep the road running<br />
besides. Truly a charming scheme to<br />
be proposed by a retrenchment Govern-<br />
ment, whose sole aim was to be the re-<br />
duction of expenditure, and the correc-<br />
tion of abuses in administration. New<br />
burdens of an enormous amount are to<br />
be imposed upon the people of Upper<br />
Canada, a Railway job to be undertaken,<br />
likely to be as disastrous and disgrace-<br />
ful as the Grand Trunk, and an already<br />
unwieldy political system to be encum-<br />
bered three fold; all that Messrs. Sicote<br />
and Sandfield McDonald may get rid of<br />
the difficulties with which their Govern-<br />
ment is surrounded."</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">SECOND EXTRACT.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"There is a refreshing coolness in the<br />
demand that Canada shall pay for the<br />
construction of a road, which is pro-<br />
fessedly designed to draw away trade<br />
from its great estuary. We have been<br />
building up the St. Lawrence at im-<br />
mense expense, and have had very hard<br />
work to compete with the Hudson and<br />
Erie Canals. According to the views<br />
of the late Hon. Mr. Merritt, steamship<br />
lines were alone needed to secure the<br />
object we desire. The ministry pur-<br />
pose, however, to withdraw the steam-<br />
ships from the St. Lawrence. If this<br />
could be done it would be an act of sui-<br />
cide in Canada to take part in the<br />
scheme. As it cannot be done it is sim-<br />
ply an absurdity. It may be difficult to<br />
escape from pledges given to the repre-<br />
sentatives of the Lower Provinces, but<br />
the members of the Cabinet may rely<br />
upon it, that they will have their reward<br />
for the abandonment or postponement<br />
of the measure in the approbation of<br />
their constituents and the Province at<br />
large."</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">the Colonial Minister."</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER—When was that writ-<br />
ten?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—In 1862.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER—Mr. Brown has chang-<br />
ed his mind since that time.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—Those men broke<br />
faith once in reference to the Inter-<br />
colonial Railroad, and could do it again.<br />
Mr. Brown changed his views on this<br />
question because he wanted to get re-<br />
presentation by population, and when<br />
in Confederation, the Inter-colonial Rail-<br />
road depends upon a majority of the<br />
Federal Parliament. It is not a part of<br />
the Constitution of the Confederated Pro-<br />
vinces.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER—It would be perfectly<br />
constitutional if we make that in the<br />
agreement.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT—The British Govern-<br />
ment agree to guarantee the amount<br />
necessary to build the Road.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. NEEDHAM—They guaranteed<br />
that before, but I promise you they will<br />
not send the money until they get<br />
security.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR GILLMOR—I will now<br />
read an extract from a speech made in<br />
Canada, to show why Mr. Brown was wil-<br />
ling to go to such an expenditure for a<br />
non-paying railroad. It was in order to<br />
get representation by population:</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">"After many years of political strife<br />
between the two Canadas, the principle of<br />
representation equal for each of the Cana-<br />
das was fully established. The Hon.<br />
Mr. Brown has been for a long time try-<br />
ing to effect a change in that part of the<br />
Constitution of the Canadas. Every<br />
effort having failed to effect that, he, as a<br />
last resort, adopted Confederation as the<br />
only means of effecting his darling ob-<br />
ject. Had he been able to bring that<br />
about without asking the aid of the Mari-<br />
time Provinces, we should never have<br />
heard anything of Confederation. Is it<br />
wise for the Lower Provinces to go in and<br />
help Mr. Brown and his followers break<br />
up an arrangement solemnly entered into<br />
between the two Canadas? Will it not<br />
be the means of forcing a million of<br />
Lower Canadians into an arrangement<br />
contrary to their wishes, and consequent-<br />
ly they will not work harmoniously in<br />
the new order of things, and the num-<br />
ber can make some trouble.</p>
<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER—What authority is<br />
that?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. NEEDHAM—I will endorse it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—My hon. friend, Mr.<br />
Wilmot, occupies a singular position ; he<br />
has heard the charges brought against the<br />
Government, and all the charges which<br />
have been made were for acts done or<br />
omitted while Mr. Wilmot was in the Go-<br />
vernment; and yet in his speech he ne-<br />
ver alluded to one of them. I was sur-<br />
prised, for he was equally with myself<br />
and my colleagues responsible for all that<br />
had been done up to the date of<br />
his resignation, and he was even<br />
more responsible, being an old po-<br />
litician and one of the gentlemen call-<br />
ed upon by His Excellency to form a<br />
Government. He said he was offered<br />
the office which I hold. I was anxious<br />
he should have taken it, and it was on-<br />
ly at the last moment that I accepted<br />
it. My friend said that he soon discover-<br />
ed how things were going on, and he was<br />
not going to take the office, and act "Jack<br />
in the Box." He has no right to charge<br />
me with being the mere instrument of<br />
any man or body of men. He knows<br />
me too well to imagine any such thing,<br />
and if he wishes to convey any such<br />
impression, he does me great injustice.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT—I did not charge you<br />
with any improper conduct. I differed<br />
with the leader of the Government, and<br />
my hon. friend agreed with him.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—I have differed from<br />
the Attorney General, and I have agreed<br />
with him as matters appeared to my<br />
mind, but are we to come before the<br />
country, having been sworn to secresy,<br />
and state what we have differed upon.<br />
When I went into the Government, al-<br />
though I knew little about the duties of<br />
an Executive Councillor, yet I knew that<br />
as long as I remained there I was respon-<br />
sible for every act, whether I agreed<br />
personally to it or not, and I am bound to<br />
come before the House and the country<br />
and sustain my colleagues and the Gov-<br />
ernment on all their acts. I think the<br />
impression has gone abroad in the coun-<br />
try that we have had a great deal of<br />
discord; such is not correct. There has<br />
been, I think, a great deal of harmony—<br />
more than I anticipated on entering the<br />
Government. It is only reasonable to<br />
conclude that nine men will on many<br />
matters entertain different opinions.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">My hon. friend says he had written out<br />
his resignation at the close of the Ses-<br />
sion. I never saw it. I think he did go<br />
out of the Council Chamber once, in a<br />
pet, and wrote out what he called his<br />
resignation, but I was told he tore it up,<br />
and was back again in fifteen minutes as<br />
pleasant as ever.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT—Did you know<br />
I made an arrangement to leave the<br />
Government at the close of the Session?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—Why do you ask me<br />
about an arrangement made before I came<br />
in? If I had the making of an arrange-<br />
ment, I would not buy any man to come<br />
into the Government by the promise of<br />
an office.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WILMOT—Do you charge me<br />
with being bought?</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. GILLMOR—You say you would<br />
not go into the Government and take<br />
the office of Provincial Secretary, but<br />
you did go into the Government on a<br />
promise that you was to get the office<br />
of Auditor General. No man should<br />
stipulate for any reward of that kind on<br />
going into a Government. I did not do<br />
so. I thought, under the circumstances,<br />
it was my duty to help all I could, and<br />
do the best I could, to help along the<br />
Government of the country.<br />
