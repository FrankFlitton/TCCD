my nature<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
to be cautious, and I think the same rules<br />
which we apply to our private affairs will<br />
apply as well to Government transactions.<br />
I have been fearful of rushing headlong<br />
in debt. The interest of every debt con-<br />
tracted in this country must be met by<br />
the people. I believe the people think<br />
Western Extension and the connection<br />
with Nova Scotia to be necessary ; there-<br />

proceed with those lines as soon as pos-<br />

will agree with me, that existing laws<br />
preclude immediate action for the accom-<br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">SMITH.—If the</span> Council Board <br />
afﬁrmed the proposition, and appointed a <br />
committee to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepare</span> a Bill, it
is not ma- <br />
terial whether the Bill is under consider- <br />
ation, or has actually passed. We would <br />
prefer that companies should build our <br />
roads, and if they go on, the Government <br />
is disposed to give them every <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">facility.</span>
<br />
With <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">regard</span> to Schools, I agree
with my <br />
hon. colleague, in thinking <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
the pre- <br />
sents system of inspection of Schools is <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">entire</span>ly useless, giving a great
amount of <br />
dissatisfaction <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span>out the
country ; <br />
but we feel we have no time to bring be- <br />
fore the House this Session, one of the<br />
most difficult subjects with which any<br />
Government has to do. My hon. colleague<br />
says he does not like the paragraph rela- <br />
ting to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Militia.</span> On this
subject, we <br />
have agreed heretofore. I have not alto- <br />
gether made up my mind upon that ques- <br />
tion, but I think from the views which I <br />
have expressed before the country, that <br />
my constituents will be satisfied that no <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> amount will be given for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> pur- <br />
pose than will be necessary under <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">all</span>
the <br />
circumstances. In <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Nova</span> Scotia
they have <br />
given <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$8l,000.</span> It is expected <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span> the <br />
British Government that we <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">do</span> <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">something</span> for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Militia</span> defence. If a few <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thousand</span> pounds will satisfy the
British <br />
Government that we feel our responsibili- <br />
ty and try to do what we can to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">prepa</span>re
<br />
our country to defend the honor of the <br />
Empire, we should cheerfully give it. But <br />
I, as a member of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government,</span>
will <br />
not give my sanction to devote a larger <br />
sum of money for that purpose than is<br />
absolutely required. I fee satisfied, that<br />
when the correspondence with the Impe-<br />
rial Government upon this question is laid<br />
before you, the amount we may recom-<br />
mend will give satisfaction to the House,<br />
as I am confident it will throughout the<br />
country.<br />

then stated distinctly what my views<br />

the principles which I have laid down to-<br />

Westmorland, in his hearing, what were<br />
my views.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> If, as appears from the

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">best

Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCMILLAN</span> stated that
according <br />
to the way he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understood</span> the
ﬁfth <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">section</span> <br />
of the Address, the only <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difﬁculty</span>
in the <br />
way for the immediate construction of the <br />
work, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for the</span> completion of the
European <br />
and North <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">American</span> Railway, was
the ex- <br />
isting laws ; he denied that there was any <br />
such laws in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">existence ;</span> he
stated
that Mr. <br />
Livesey had not fulfilled the requirements <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of that act, consequently was not </span>entitled
<br />
to its privileges ; therefore, the Govern- <br />
ment were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">free</span> to build that
portion of <br />
the work, and had pledged themselves to <br />
do so immediately, but he believed that <br />
the finances of the country did not justify <br />
them in giving such a pledge ; he would <br />
declare his opposition to the completion <br />
of this railroad as a Government work. <br />
His hon. friend, Mr. Smith, had opposed<br />
the Government because they pledged the<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province</span>
for £20,000 I year, to construct <br />
the Intercolonial railroad, and now he, as <br />
a leader of the Government, according to <br />
his own announcement, would pledge the <br />
Province to the extent of £97,000 annu- <br />
ally, on the lines of road authorised to be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constructed</span> by the legislation of
last year. <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">HATHEWAY.—The</span>
position <br />
which I occupy towards my hon friend <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
<br />
different from what it was in the late <br />
House. We <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have been</span> returned,
opposed <br />
to each other, on this great <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Confederation</span>
<br />
Scheme. If he had been a colleague of <br />
mine, and the constituents of my County <br />
had approved of the course which he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had</span>
<br />
taken, my seat would have been vacated <br />
in twenty-four hours. He states that <br />
there is no law in existence <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to prevent</span>
us <br />
from <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">going</span>
on and connecting Moncton <br />
with the Nova Scotia boundary. Why, <br />
Mr. Livesey is even now in Halifax en- <br />
tering into <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">engagements</span> for the
building <br />
of this road, upon the faith of the Gov- <br />
ernment of New Brunswick. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">would</span>
<br />
like my hon. friend, to read the speech of <br />
the late Provincial Secretary, as reported <br />
and delivered in Carleton. wherein he is <br />
reported to have said: " That he was <br />
willing to guarantee the interest upon the <br />
whole money required in the construction <br />
of the work." That is, he was prepared <br />
to make <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Western Extension a </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> <br />
work, besides giving the £20,000 subsidy<br />
for <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span>
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">construction</span> of the Intercolonial<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
railway. If my hon. friend, the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ex-Sur-</span>
<br />
veyor General, is opposed to Western <br />
Extension, why did he not tender his re- <br />
signation when a Bill for that purpose was <br />
brought in from St. John, and a pressure <br />
was brought to bear against the Govern- <br />
ment to compel  them to adopt it. I would<br />
like to call his attention to the course<br />
pursued by the late Government, in refer- <br />
ence to the route
of the Intercolonial rail- <br />
road. One day they would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be</span>
telling the <br />
people of the North Shore the road would <br />
go by that route, and the next they would <br />
be telling the people of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Sussex</span>
by
the <br />
centre route, and again telling the people<br />
along the river St. John, that the road<br />
would come by this route, and this very<br />
city would blossom as the rose from the<br />
benefits accruing from this railroad. My<br />
hon. friend, Mr. Gilbert, would connect<br />

had adopted the same independent course <br />as he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">had,</span> they might have been
in the <br />same proud position. Now, I differed<br />
from them on one point, and one only, <br />
that is, representation <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">by</span>
population, but <br />I considered the matter <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">well,</span> and believing <br />
that other interests would be understood , <br />
and to depart from that basis the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulty</span><br />
was where to stop, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">outside</span> of that, my <br />
