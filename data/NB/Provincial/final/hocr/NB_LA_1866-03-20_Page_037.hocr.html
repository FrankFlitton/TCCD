<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province, throwing out poisonous insinua-</span></span><br />
tions against the Government. It was<br />
proclaimed all over the country that the<br />
Government was under Roman Catholic<br />
influencedthat Anglin, the traitor, was<br />
its dictator. It was said that if the elec-<br />
tors would save the country, and tear the<br />
reins of power out of the hands of dis-<br />
loyal men, they must vote for Fisher, the<br />
staunch loyalists, the old boy—vote for<br />
Fisher and save the country—vote for<br />
Fisher and the British Constitution, Brit-<br />
ish Law, British Nationality, and British<br />
Christianity! He would not tell how<br />
many men during the excitement of the<br />
election were fed in the back settlements,<br />
or what other influences were brought to<br />
bear. Every effort was made to preju-<br />
dice him (Mr. H.) in the mind of the<br />
country. . It was said that Smith ruled the<br />
Government, and the Smith was hostile<br />
to York, and Hatheway was powerless—<br />
the interests of the Country was suffering<br />
in his hands. He had not the ability el<br />
his hon. and learned friend (Attorney <br />
General), but he was quite able to face<br />
him whenever the interests of his Country<br />
were concerned. One of the canvasses<br />
during the election was that the Govern-<br />
ment intended to remove the Post Office<br />
Department from Fredericton, and that<br />
was the first step towards the removal of<br />
the seat of Government ; and the cry
was<br />
raised, if the Country was to be saved,
and <br />
the Seat of Government secured, they <br />
must elect Fisher, for he was the only<br />
man that could face Smith on the floors<br />
of the House. He thought the hon.<br />
member for Restigouche had handled the <br />
sale of the Gibson lands very cautiously ;
<br />
he did not wonder that his colleague (Mr.<br />
F.) had done so. But they did not dare<br />
to condemn the Government for that<br />
transaction : they knew the Government<br />
were only carrying out the acts of their<br />
predecessers. The member of Resti-<br />
gouche knew that, had the late Govern-<br />
ment remained in power, they would have<br />
rescinded the regulation. He thought<br />
that was what the hon. member said.<br />
(Mr. McMillan.—He said, if there was no<br />
prospect of the Inter-Colonial Railway,<br />
there would be no need of the regula-<br />
tion) Just so. Mr. Hatheway then<br />
proceeded to speak of the influences that<br />
had been brought to hear during the first<br />
election in York? What were the argu-<br />
ments that his colleague, (Mr. F.) when<br />
he went lecturing through the back settle-<br />
ments had put forth in his canvas?<br />
First, if York would secure the seat of<br />
Government, it must go for Confederation ;
<br />
and secondly, if York wanted to set the<br />
Inter-Colonial Railway by the Valley of<br />
the Keswick, it must go for the Quebec<br />
Scheme At one of these meetings he<br />
had met his hon. colleqgue, (Mr. F.) and<br />
put to him the question, would he go for<br />
Confederation if the Railway went<br />
by the North Shore. well, he said he<br />
would not. He (Mr. F) told the peo-<br />
ple that the Railway would go by the<br />
Keswick Valley, and Mr. Fleming, the<br />
Canadian Surveyor's Report would<br />
soon be out, confirming his statement. <br />
Let them refer to the law and the testi-<br />
mony, let them refer to Fleming's re-<br />
port [here the hon. member referred at<br />
great length to Fleming's report, read-<br />
ing several extracts concerning the va-<br />
rious routes to show that the Central<br />
line fixed upon by the members of York<br />
(Mr. F.) was the longest and would be<br />
the most expensive in construction, and<br />
would cost £600,000 more than other <br />
routes.] would the hon. member after<br />

Fleming said about the Cen-</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
tral line succeed in gulling the people<br />
as he had done, that the Railway would<br />
go by it. The hon. member (Mr. Fish-<br />
er) had during the time of the election<br />
the line absolutely staked out, and he<br />
told the electors that he had induced<br />
the Canadian Government to order that <br />
the survey to be made along the Kes-<br />
wick Valley. </span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FISHER said he had written to<br />
the Canadian Government asking them<br />
to order a survey of the Central route,<br />
and he had no doubt that it was through<br />
his urgent endeavours that the survey<br />
came to be made.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. HATHEWAY proceeded<br />
to say that it was astonishing that with<br />
all his knowledge, all his reputation as<br />
a constitutional lawyer that the name<br />
of Fisher was never mentioned in Cana-<br />
da, while the names of Smith, and Til-<br />
ley and Gray were familiar was never <br />
heard. He was astonished when he<br />
looked over the map accompanying<br />
Fleming's report to find that whilst there<br />
was a line laid down that was deno-<br />
minated the Mitchell line, it show-<br />
ed no Fisher line. The inter-colonial<br />
railway had always been held forth as<br />
the great boon New Brunswick would<br />
get by Confederation, but he doubted if <br />
it was looked upon with much favor in<br />
Canada. Would any one tell him that<br />
Galt the great finance minister of Cana-<br />
da who possessed immense property in<br />
the City of Portland, and had held a<br />
large amount of stock in the Railway,<br />
was in favor of a Railway through New<br />
Brunswick ! They might try to delude<br />
the people that he was in favor of it,<br />
but that would not go down with him.<br />
In fact that there was little feeling in<br />
Canada in favor of the Intercolonial,<br />
and he was opinion that the feeling<br />
on the whole was decidedly against it.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. Mr. Hatheway proceeded to <br />
speak to another charge against the Gov-<br />
ernment with reference to the appoint-<br />
ment of Judge Ritchie over Judge Wil-<br />
mot. He would say very little about it. <br />
But he well remembered at the opening<br />
of the Court in Fredericton, seeing<br />
Judge Wilmot occupying the seat of his<br />
honor his speaker. Never in his life had<br />
ho seen the hall where the hon. mem-<br />
bers were now assembled so crowded<br />
as on that occasion, for it was well<br />
known in Fredericton, that the Judge<br />
would deliver a harangue. He doubted <br />
much the right of a Judge to deliver<br />
from the bench at a time when polittcal<br />
feeling was rising high, such an address<br />
as Judge Wilmot did. It might be said<br />
by some that he (Judge W.) had a right<br />
to speak on a subject that was agitating<br />
the minds of the people ; but when the<br />
words caught his ears that if it was ne-<br />
cessary to carry the scheme, he would<br />
come down from the bench, he thought<br />
that statement Judge Wilmot had no<br />
right to make, and he justified the ap-<br />
pointment of Judge Ritchie on the <br />
ground of the same harangue. When<br />
they heard the opinion of Chief Justice<br />
Robert Parker, and knew that he advis-<br />
ed the Government to appoint Judge<br />
Ritchie, the mouths of those who had <br />
murmured because they thought Judge<br />
Wilmot had been superseded ought to be<br />
closed.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. CONNELL he would like to hear <br />
the letter of Chief Justice Parker read.</p>

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MR. WETMORE</span>—What
did his hon.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. FRASER—He said he gave the <br />

that Judge Robery Parker would not<br />

if he had not known Judge Ritchie<br />
would succeed him.</p>



<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE—What could his<br />
hon. friend (Mr. F) mean? He most<br />
positively and distinctly denied that he<br />
ever made such statement.</p>


<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. MR. HATHEWAY proceeded to<br />
speak of the course his colleague, Mr.
Fisher,<br />
had pursued against him during the elec-<br />
tion of York. He called to his recollec-<br />
tion the many occasions he had befriended<br />
him in his political trouble ; he had always<br />
been his friend ; he well knew his friend=<br />
ship for him ; he knew the position he<br />
(Mr. Hatheway) was placed in about the <br />
time of the election—lying sick in bed at-<br />
tended to by two medical men, and he knew<br />
that $300 were offered to one of these<br />
medical men to keep him lying on the <br />
broad of his back. (Mr. Fisher.—He <br />
knew nothing of the kind.) One would<br />
think he (Mr. Fisher) did know ; when he<br />
was lying in this condition, he made a<br />
public speech in the Temperance Hall, in<br />
Frederiction, that was calculated to harrow<br />
up the innermost feelings of those most <br />
nearly related to him, and it was a <br />
most remarkable fact that two copies of<br />
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Reporter</span>, containing the report of the<br />
speech, were directed to his wife. He<br />
charged it home to him that he knew<br />
that ; hon. members knew that Mr. Fisher<br />
was in the habit of saying that after poli-<br />
tical discussion he went home to his fami-<br />
ly, and forgot all the angry feelings that<br />
had been engendered, and he prayed upon<br />
his knees for forgeiveness to his enemies.<br />
But when he though of that, the words<br />
of his supplication ought to have been<br />
in the words of the fine prayer in the<br />
Litany : "From all blindness of heart, <br />
from pride, vain glory and hypocrisy, from<br />
envy, hatred, and malice, and all unchari-<br />
tableness, deliver me." (Mr. Fisher.—<br />
He denied that he knew the papers to <br />
have been sent and said that the lan-<br />
guage he had used in his speech was<br />
justified by the strong language uttered<br />
by Mr. Hatheway against himself.)<br />
The least Mr. Fisher ought to have<br />
done was, after the excitement of the oc-<br />
casion, to have gone to the office of the<br />
paper, and asked the editor not to put in<br />
the report of the speech of the offensive<br />
statements. To send the paper with that<br />
speech into private family, was a low, <br />
mean, cowardly act, unworthy of the cha-<br />
racter of a man. Every influence had <br />
been brought to bear against him ; heed-<br />
less expression in casual conversation<br />
had been caught up and turned against<br />
him. When in St. John he met that in-<br />
flated little animal, Johnny Boyd, (he <br />
knew he was not here to defend himself)<br />
Boyd said to him, "You cannot resist <br />
the British Government ; they will oblige<br />
you to take the Quebec Scheme," (or<br />
words to that effect) and he answered<br />
hastily, "The British Government may<br />
go to the devil, or some hotter place,"<br />
and on the strength of that heedless ex-<br />
pression, he had been accused of diloy-<br />
alty. He respected the British Govern-<br />
ment, but he though that on a question<br />
that so nearly affected their own interests,<br />
the people of the Provinces were the best<br />
judges. <br />
