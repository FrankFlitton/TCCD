<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The
Government to blame on the<br />
Governor's salary question. The Pri-<br />

so strongly condemned by the Freeman,<br />
still continues.</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">The delay
in calling the House, un-<br />
wise, especially this year, when impor-<br />
tant laws had expired. Tilley and <br />
Fisher should not be blamed for not<br />
coming earlier to their rescue. Such<br />
an act of kindness could scarcely be ex-<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Gibson's land ought not to have been<br />
brought to sale till a formal notice of<br />
rescinding the former order had been<br />
published. The Surveyor General, last<br />
Session, stated that the Government<br />
had not then concluded as to this mat-<br />
ter. Now they say, the order lapsed<br />
when the Inter-colonial Railroad Act<br />
expired. Five thousand acres of the <br />
land surveyed for Gibson advertised in <br />
name of other parties. The public de-<br />
ceived. Twenty-seven acres granted<br />
at the head of Nashwaak River, which<br />
commands the business of St. Mary's <br />
Lake, which was not offered at public<br />
sale at all, said to have been given to<br />
make up for some deficiency.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Attorney General cannot blame<br />
the Opposition Press for furnishing time-<br />
ly information of the Fenian conspiracy ;<br />
he is not the greatest alarmist himself<br />
on this subject. We are not asked for<br />
concord and harmony in view of this<br />
emergency. The Attorney General<br />
finds "emergencies" sufficient to enable<br />
him to get the loaves and fishes; but <br />
such appeals are too transparent.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The famous Minute of Council, un-<br />
dignified, untruthful and insulting.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">The Judges appointments condemned.<br />
The claims of Wilmot unjustifiably over-<br />
looked. The despotic conduct of these<br />
men in the exercise of "a little brief<br />
authority" cannot be sustained by the<br />
people.</p>

captain and more reliable men.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">[Mr. McClelan addressed the House<br />
for about three hours; but owing to our<br />
unfortunate misunderstanding about<br />
reporting, we are unable to furnish more<br />
of this speech than some of the leading<br />
points.]</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Hon. MR. GILMOUR said he was<br />
pleased to hear his hon. friend, Mr.<br />
McClelan say that if the Government<br />
were all right on the question of Confe-<br />
deration, he would not feel bound to<br />
vote against them on any of the minor<br />
charges which had been preferred at<br />
this time. He thanked his hon. friend<br />
for the complimentary allusion which<br />
had been made to him; personally they<br />
had been on the most intimate terms for<br />
ten years, and had, until the last elec-<br />
tion, acted together in politics, and if<br />
there was any circumstances which he<br />
regretted, it was that his hon. friend<br />
and himself differed in reference to Con-<br />
federation. There was no member with<br />
whom he should be more pleased to be<br />
associated than with him. He should<br />
not trespass long upon the time of the<br />
House, for he was quite sure that he<br />
could not make a speech which could<br />
for any length of time be interesting.<br />
The Government, of which he was a<br />
member, were not upon their trial. He<br />
had listened to the charges and denuncia-<br />
tions which had been made without any<br />
feelings of alarm or fear: first, because he<br />
knew that he had endeavored to do his<br />
duty, and that it had been done in such<br />
a manner that the public interest had<br />
been carefully guarded, and whatever<br />
the result of the vote might be, it could<br />
make little difference to him personally,<br />
for he valued the honorable position<br />
which he held only because it was an<br />
evidence of the confidence of the peo-<br />
ple ; he was not in need of its emolu-<br />
ments, he was not a all in love with its re-<br />
sponsibilities. One would suppose that <br />
some of the Opposition in the House,<br />
and many more out of it, imagined that<br />
the Government had done some great<br />
injustice to the late Government ; such<br />
was not the case ; in the words of the<br />
famous Memorandum of Council, the<br />
late Government were parties to the<br />
Quebec Scheme ; they submitted it to<br />
the people in their own way and at their<br />
own time, and it was rejected, and in<br />
rejecting it they rejected its advocates.<br />
The present Government had no con-<br />
certed action during the elections; each<br />
discussed the question in its own way,<br />
and he should trust fairly and honora-<br />
bly; and no matter how highly the ser-<br />
vices of the late Government had been<br />
valued, the most of them had been de-<br />
feated, and their services had been dis-<br />
pensed with. If any injustices had been <br />
done to them, they had to blame their own constituencies and not this
Gov-<br />
ernment. He had no apology to make<br />
to the late Government or any member<br />
of it; he never wronged them either<br />
individually or collectively, and neither<br />
was he under any obligation to them ;<br />
he thought if the accounts were balan-<br />
ced, they would be largely indebted to<br />
him, so far as political favors were con-<br />
cerned. It was true, as the Attorney<br />
General had stated, that most of the<br />
members of the present Government<br />

were called hastily and unexpectedly<br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">to seat in the Executive Council,<br />
and a generous public would not ex-<br />
pect new men to be just so ready in<br />
all duties of an Executive as men<br />
who had been for years directing the<br />
affairs of the Province; but while they<br />
had not their experience, neither had<br />
they learned the art of mystifying and humbugging the people.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Without any wish to operate upon<br />
the sympathies of hon. members or the<br />
people generally, he would refer for a<br />
few minutes to some of the influences<br />
which had been used against the Go-<br />
vernment. First, he alluded to the<br />
press, the most of which had been not<br />
only in favor of Confederation, but in<br />
direct opposition to the Government.<br />
He was aware that some portion of the<br />
religious press had been devoted to ad-<br />
vocating Confederation, but other por-<br />
tions of it had exerted all their in-<br />
fluence against the Government, and <br />
had not hesitated to scatter through<br />
society "firebrands, arrows and death."<br />
He was not one of those who<br />
would, if he could exclude the discus-<br />
sion of important political questions<br />
from religious journals, but they should<br />
be expected, from their high and holy<br />
calling, to urge a calm and dispassion-<br />
ate consideration of any important mat-<br />
ter, and to endeavor to operate upon<br />
men's reason and judgment, and upon<br />
the better part of human nature, but<br />
some of them, he regretted to say, had<br />
pursued an entirely different course.<br />
He had no disposition to say anything<br />
disrespectful, and should leave them to<br />
their own reflections, which he was sure,<br />
in their calm moments, must punish<br />
them more than anything which could<br />
be said of them; but there were some<br />
honorable exceptions. The secular<br />
Press had pursued a course of opposi-<br />
tion unprecedented in the history of this<br />
or any other Province, and if the "liars<br />
have their place," he pitied the men who<br />
had prompted and published such base<br />
and calumnious falsehoods. They had<br />
learned the art of lying and misrepre-<br />
sentation to perfection, and would be<br />
entitled to a first class certificate for<br />
those qualifications. They had acted<br />
upon the principle of throwing dirt in<br />
hopes that some might stick; they had<br />
endeavored to give a false coloring to<br />
the most plausible acts of the Government<br />
and the papers had teemed with one<br />
continued strain of personal abuse,<br />
slander and misrepresentation, and<br />
when such characters call a man a fool<br />
the public are to understand him to be<br />
an honest man, and one who will en-<br />
deavor to do his duty. Their humor<br />
means scandal and falsehood. Patriot--<br />
one who wants to humbug the people<br />
and get into office. Promises-mean<br />
nothing. Rogue and rascal-means a<br />
man of a different political party from<br />
themselves ; in fact, the public should un-<br />
derstand them, to get at the truth, to<br />
say. Such papers had been spread,<br />
broad-cast over the land, at whose ex-<br />
pense he was not prepared to say, but<br />
he could say, that none of the public<br />
money had been used since the present<br />
Government came into power, to sub-<br />
sidize the Press. In connection with a<br />
portion of the Press there had been em-<br />
ployed an organized band of sneaks,<br />
who had no taste for anything that was<br />
decent or good, who would see nothing<br />
to please in the most lovely landscape.<br />
