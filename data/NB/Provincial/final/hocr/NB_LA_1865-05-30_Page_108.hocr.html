in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">1858,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">and</span> my mind is still <br />
unchanged. I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">am thoroughly</span> in
favor of<br />
responsible <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Government</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">as</span> any man in <br />
this country, and it is the ruling principle <br />
in my mind ; but I do not see that it at all <br />
bears on the placing the members of de- <br />
partments out of the House. It is more<br />
dangerous to the liberties of the people to<br />
have those salaried officers in the House,<br />
because when a man gets one of those<br />
offices he will struggle for life and death<br />
to hold it ; he will go round soliciting<br />
votes here and there, and resort to many<br />
things he otherwise would not, in order<br />
that he may not lose his salary. When<br />
we have three paid members of the Gov-<br />
ernment on the floors of the House, we<br />
have as many as we should have. The<br />
Attorney General, I think, is the best paid<br />
man in the country, as in addition to his<br />
salary, his office gives him a status in<br />
the profession, while it does not interfere <br />
with it, as it does not take the whole of his <br />
time ; but it is necessary for his salary to <br />
be high to secure the most talented man <br />
to fill the ofﬁce. In regard to the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span>
<br />
of Post Master General, I am prepared to <br />
vote for removal of the office, even if there<br />
is no saving to be effected by it, for the<br />
office is merely local in its character, and<br />
is not one of much importance, as is the<br />
case in England, where they keep a cor-<br />
respondence with all parts of the world.<br />
I do not think it is necessary to have an<br />
inspector appointed, for clerks can often<br />
be sent out of the office to inspect the<br />
different Post Offices without interfering<br />
with the duties of the department. There<br />
has been a cry raised that this was pre-<br />
paratory to a removal of the seat of Gov-<br />
ernment to St. John. I do not think re-<br />
moving a couple of clerks to St. John will<br />
have any influence in moving the seat of<br />
Government. If the question of removing<br />
it to St. John came up, and I voted against<br />
it, I do not think there would be five of<br />
my constituents would find fault with me.<br />
The resolutions which I have placed be-<br />
fore the House, will be the means of<br />
perpetuating the seat of Government here,<br />
because the difficulties in getting to<br />
Fredericton will not be so great as they<br />
have been. This system of railways will<br />
prevent the necessity or desirability of<br />
removing the seat of Government. If a<br />
city is in a position to go vigorously into<br />
manufacturing and trading operations, the<br />
accumulation of public offices and idlers<br />
will weaken and destroy the business<br />
habits of young men, and they will not<br />
acquire the habit of application necessary<br />
to put them forward in the world.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Mr.
WILLISTON.—It is unnecessary for<br />
me at this stage of the proceeding to say<br />
much on this subject ; but I feel bound<br />
by the position I have taken in reference<br />
to this subject, to say a few words before<br />
the vote is taken. You must remember<br />
in 1858, after the office of Post Master<br />
General became political, I felt bound to<br />
bring in a Bill to repeal that Act. I have<br />
been Post Master for some years past,<br />
and am pretty well acquainted with the<br />
routine of duties which he has to perform.<br />
I felt satisfied that eight or nine heads of<br />
departments in a House of forty-one mem-<br />
bers were more than was required, and I<br />
felt it my duty to do all in my power to<br />
bring about some reform. Mr. Howe, hav-<br />
ing been educated at his father's office,<br />
who was a Post Master at Halifax, has a<br />
through acquaintance with the duties of<br />
the office, and could perform them much<br />
more satisfactorily than a person who knows<br />
nothing of the duties, but is appointed<br />
because his party has come into power.<br />
I have been here for seven years fighting<br />
against political influence. I thought<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">that the Government had too many politi-<br />
cal heads on the floors of the House, and<br />
I for one was determined that I would do<br />
all in my power to lessen the number of<br />
them. In 1859, I brought in a Bill to<br />
repeal the Act making this office a politi-<br />
cal one. I found my hon. friend from St.<br />
John, (Mr. Cudlip) who was a prominent<br />
member of the House, voting with me,<br />
although we numbered but ten. It is<br />
gratifying to me now to find members who<br />
opposed me on that occasion, when en-<br />
deavouring to effect that wholesome re-<br />
form, have changed their minds, and are<br />
now introducing this as a Government<br />
measure. It is a proud satisfaction to all<br />
of us who voted on that occasion. to find<br />
public opinion so changed that the Gov-<br />
ernment now comes forward to effect that<br />
change which the exigencies of the case<br />
require. I was sorry to hear my hon.<br />
friend from Carleton (Mr. Connell) deny<br />
a case where he ignored the decision of<br />
the Council. The case was the loss of a<br />
money letter sent by "Elijah Clark," and<br />
the Postmaster General himself, without<br />
the advice of his Council, paid that claim.<br />
(Mr. Connell.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—" I deny the accusation.")<br />
He did that without the advice of his<br />
Council, and against the advice of his pre-<br />
decessors. (Mr. Connell </span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—" Bring
for-<br />
ward your proofs.") I can bring forward<br />
the proofs. It has been said that if we<br />
abolish the office of Postmaster General,<br />
we should have to appoint a Post Office<br />
Surveyor to inspect the Post Offices.<br />
This is unnecessary, as the work could be<br />
done by the head Clerks in the St. John<br />
office. The Postmaster General receives</span><br />
£600 a year. besides his travelling expen-<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ses, which amounted last year to $548 ;<br />
the public has to pay those travelling ex-<br />
penses, even when incurred on an elec-<br />
tioneering tour. I am happy to see the<br />
day when the President of the Council,<br />
after seeing the necessity of the case, has<br />
the correctness to come forward and pro-<br />
pound a measure of this kind, which I, an<br />
humble number of this House, advocated<br />
some years ago.</span><br />

confess my mind is<br />
not made up on the same grounds as the<br />
hon. member who last addressed you. I <br />
do not think became he entertained an <br />
opinion that was wrong, and the Presi- <br />
dent <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of</span> the Council now
entertains an <br />
opinion that was wrong, that he should keep <br />
that opinion. If the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">arguments,</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">which</span> <br />
appear to have borne very heavily upon <br />
the mind of the hon. member who last ad- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dressed</span> you, are sound, then no

has <br />

here to support that Government, or a<br />
Governement formed on Anti-Confederate<br />
principles. Unfortunately for me. I took<br />
a different view from the Government in<br />
reference to this question. I was here in<br />
1854, when a resolution was introduced<br />
by some hon. member of the House, in<br />
order to make the Surveyor General's<br />
office and the Postmaster General's office<br />

<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">because I believed that the head of that<br />
office ought to be a Surveyor himself, and<br />
understand his business, so as to know<br />
when his subordinates did right or wrong.<br />
</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Unless we got a political man
on the <br />
floors of the House who understood all <br />
the operations that belonged to an <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span>
<br />
of that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">kind.</span> I did not think
it right to <br />
make it a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> office. I
opposed it <br />
then, and if there was a question of that <br />
kind <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">before</span> the House now, I
would still <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oppose it</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">;</span> for I believe the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">office</span> of poli-<br />
tical <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Surveyor</span> General to be
useless. <br />
With regard to the Post Master General's <br />
office, I say this : If the Government can <br />
show that by making the office non-poli- <br />
tical the country is going to save a great <br />
deal of money, that they can <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">save</span>
twelve <br />
or <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁfteen thousand</span> dollars, I am
prepared <br />
to go for it, however inimical it may
be <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span>
the interests of my <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">constituents ;</span>
but <br />
they have not done it. and cannot do it. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Hon.</span> Mr. Smith. We will save <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$3.000.)</span> <br />
Have they shown it? They have not, <br />
a<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nd</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">cannot</span> show it. They cannot get <br />
along <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">without</span> more clerks, and
they will <br />
have to increase the salaries of the offi- <br />
cers they now have on account of the in- <br />
creased labour and increased responsibi- <br />
lity. With regard to my own private <br />
views about all these officers being on the <br />
floors of the House, I think in a House of <br />
only forty-one members, the fewer <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political</span> officers on the ﬂoors
of
the <br />
House the better for the country ; but that <br />
is not the reason why I oppose the Bill. <br />
I oppose it because the Government do <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">not</span> show that it is going to
beneﬁt the <br />
country by saving any money. Another <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ground</span> is, because by late
arrangements <br />
the Post Office Department <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has</span>
almost <br />
become a banking institution. I saw an <br />
account that an increase of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">$24,605</span>
in <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">money</span> orders over six
corresponding <br />
months of last year, had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">passed</span>
through <br />
the Post Office since the money order <br />
system had been introduced by the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">late</span>
<br />
Government. Now I ask <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> House <br />
prepared to put this into the hands of <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">irrespons</span>ible men ? If the
Government <br />
appoint a man to a situation, and <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span>
<br />
man does wrong, I hold them responsible <br />
for his acts. If they choose to make an <br />
office non-political that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">political,</span> and <br />
put a man in that ofﬁce, I hold that, ac- <br />
cording to true, sound political principles, <br />
the Government is answerable for the <br />
acts of that man if he has done <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">wrong ;</span>
<br />
otherwise, let that man be a political <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officer,</span> and alone be responsible
for his <br />
own acts when on the ﬂoors of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House.</span>
<br />
It is perfectly absurd to talk about Re- <br />
sponsible Government, if we say the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Gov-</span>
<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ernment</span> can appoint a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man</span> to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">an</span>
office <br />
where such a large amount of money is <br />
at stak<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">e,</span> and that man becomes
a default- <br />
er, that the Government is not
responsible. <br />
There is no necessity for abolishing this <br />
ofﬁce, for the Government cannot show <br />
that there will be any saving in money to <br />
this Province to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">justify</span> them in
throwing <br />
to the winds an office that is so much <br />
needed at present, when there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span>
such an <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">amount of</span> money passing through <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> <br />
Province. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">You</span> allow every man in

right now you will abolish your money<br />
