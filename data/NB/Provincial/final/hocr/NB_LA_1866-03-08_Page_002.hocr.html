<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Your</span> Excellency for the Speech

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> 3. We thank Your Excellency for re-<br />
sponding to the invitation of the Govern- <br />
ment of Canada in sending a Delegate to <br />
Washington for the purpose of endeavor- <br />
ing, in concert with Delegates from the <br />
Sister Provinces, and Her Majesty's Min-<br />
ister at Washington, to procure a tem- <br />
porary extension of the Reciprocity <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Treaty,</span> with a view to afford
time for full <br />
negociations, having for their object the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">establishment</span> of a permanent
commercial <br />
arrangement with the United States upon <br />
a basic mutually beneficial ; and we unite <br />
with Your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency</span> in the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">expression</span> <br />
of regret, that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the efforts</span> of
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Delegates</span> <br />
were not successful, and we trust that dis- <br />
cussion on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this subject,</span> if
revived, may <br />
lead to a <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">satisfactory</span> issue. We
are <br />
pleased to learn that Your <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Excellency</span>
<br />
has, in concert with the Governors of the <br />
other <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span> North American
Provinces, <br />
despatched a Delegate to the West Indies <br />
and certain States of South <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">America,
with</span> <br />
a view of opening up new channels to our <br />
Commerce. We will carefully consider <br />
any measure having for its object any re- <br />
vision of the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Revenue</span> Laws
rendered <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">necessary</span> by the abrogation of
the Treaty. <br />

We learn with feelings of deep in- <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">dignation</span> the existence of a
conspiracy, <br />
having for its avowed object the dismem- <br />
berment of the British Empire. We <br />
would hope that no attack will be made <br />
on any portion of Her Majesty's <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span>
<br />
American Dominions ; but in that event, <br />
we rejoice in being able to assure Your <br />
Excellency that but one sentiment of loy- <br />
alty animates the whole people of this <br />
Province ; and its inhabitants, of every <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">race, creed</span><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">, and station, are alike ready to</span> <br />
repel lawless aggression and to punish un-<br />
provoked hostility ; and Your Excellency<br />
can confidently rely upon our cordial co- <br />
operation and support in the adoption of<br />
any measures of a precautionary charac-<br />
ter, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">that</span> may be necessary to
avert a <br />
calamity so serious as that of the occur- <br />
rence of an armed conflict within our <br />
borders. <br />

the opinion expressed by Her Majesty's <br />

any scheme for a Union of the British <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> His Honor the Speaker if any appoint-<br />
ment of Door Keeper to the House had<br />
been made on the death of Mr. George<br />
Anderson.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">SPEAKER.—He could not say, as he<br />
had not been informed.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. W. J. GILBERT suggested that<br />
some member of the Government inform<br />
the House.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL.—The<br />
Government had appointed Mr. Benja-<br />
min Wheeler.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE contended the Gov-<br />
ernment had no right to make the ap-<br />
pointment without the authority of the<br />
House ; and he did not see any reason<br />
why the House should submit to it. He<br />
held that if the House wished and re-<br />
quired any person for door-keeper, it ne-<br />
cessarily had the right of making the ap-<br />
pointment. The Government had no<br />
right to interfere with their privileges.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> HON. ATTORNEY <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">GENERAL</span> said<br />
it was necessary to have a person at the<br />
opening of the Legislature to act as door<br />
keeper, and so the appointment was made.<br />
But if the House thought it had the right<br />
of appointment, the Government in that<br />
case had none. He did not wish to inter-<br />
fere with any of the privileges of the<br />
House.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. WETMORE said he should, in or-<br />
der to test the question of right, move<br />
that the House do proceed to the appoint-<br />
ment of a door-keeper, in the room of<br />
George Anderson, deceased.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">MR. W. J. GILBERT argued that the<br />
direct right of appointment lay in the<br />
hands of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and the<br />
House had supervision over the exercise<br />
of that right. The right of appointment<br />
of door-keeper might be a small affair,<br />
but if the House gave way, because it was<br />
small, their rights, by allowing such a<br />
precedent, might be invaded in matters<br />
of larger concern.<br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL said :<br />
That his present <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">opinion</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">was</span> that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">offices</span> <br />
connected with the House should he ap- <br />
pointed by the House, and he would sug-<br />
gest that the matter be referred to the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Committee</span> of Privileges. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. FISHER had no objection to let <br />
the matter go to the Committee.<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> <br />
</span></p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. WETMORE said—in making the <br />
motion—he did it not with a wish to re- <br />
move the present door keeper, but <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">merely</span>
<br />
to ascertain and protect the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">privileges</span>
of <br />
the House. <br />
</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"> MR. KERR was of opinion that the <br />
House should retain the power of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ap-</span>
<br />
pointing all its <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">officials.</span> They
appointed <br />
their Speaker, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">they</span> appointed
their Chap- <br />
lain : why should they not appoint their <br />
Door Keeper? If a person received an <br />
appointment in the House, the House<br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">should</span> have the power of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">making</span> it.  It <br />
was the way in Nova Scotia, and, he <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">be-</span>
<br />
lieved, all the other Provinces, that all <br />
ofﬁcials were appointed by a direct vote<br />
of the House. He then referred to the <br />
Journals, and the appointment of the se- <br />
cond Clerk of the House by the first<br />
Clerk : and argued that a regular system <br />
should be adopted, and finally moved— <br />
