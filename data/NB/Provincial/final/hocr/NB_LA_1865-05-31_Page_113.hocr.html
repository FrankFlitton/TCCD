removed, that we should be enabled to <br />
extend our trade, and enlarge our enter- <br />
prise? If we have manufactures in the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">country is</span> it not for our beneﬁt
that they <br />
should be extended? Will it hurt us to <br />
have plenty of customers ? We have <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">man-</span>
<br />
ufactures in this country, and all we need <br />
is that we should have a large market and <br />
more <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ﬁeld for</span> our enterprise.
Why did <br />
we agree to the Reciprocity Treaty with <br />
the United States? Was it not to get a <br />
wider ﬁeld of operations ? And if we, <br />
with a population of 250,000, can sustain <br />
manufactories, could we not do it much <br />
better if we were 4,000,000 ? How then <br />
can it be that we should be ruined com- <br />
mercially, by this Union ? And now for <br />
the resolutions <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">themselves.</span> The
third <br />
clause of the preamble says " Whereas, <br />
the loyalty and attachment of the people <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of this</span> Province to the Throne
and Go- <br />
verment of Great Britain cannot justly be <br />
impunged,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> &amp;c."</span> Now this is a
most ex<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">-</span> <br />
traordinary <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proposition</span> and one
that I <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">can-</span> <br />
not <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">understand.</span> It reminds me of
a say- <br />
ing of the hon. President of the Council, <br />
that for a man to be always speaking of <br />
his honesty looks as though there was <br />
some cause to doubt <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">it.</span> This
very talk <br />
about our loyalty tends to cast a doubt on <br />
it. Satisfy the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">British</span>
Government ! <br />
Conciliate the British Government! What <br />
for ? Because we are Antis? Is this <br />
why we grant a sum of $30,000 for our<br />
militia, and again are called on to pay for <br />
delegates to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">go</span> home <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">to</span> tell the people of <br />
Engla<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">nd</span> what they know as well as
we <br />
do ? But I will go on “ And <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">whereas,</span>
in the <br />
exercise of the right of internal self-go- <br />
vernment enjoyed by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Province,</span> its <br />
people are entitled to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">deliberate</span>

their <br />
own <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">local</span> interests in such
manner as to <br />
them may seem best calculated to pro- <br />
mote their prosperity and welfare, &amp;c." <br />
What evidence in there before the House <br />
that the British Government intend to de- <br />
prive us of Responsible Government, or <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">self-government ?</span> for this is <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the only</span> in- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Mr. CUDLIP,<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">—</span>I
will just explain. It <br />
was contemplated to carry out the Union <br />
of the Colonies by <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">chicanery</span>, by
o joling. <br />
by deception, and by briber<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">y</span> in
high <br />
places, the same as it was in Ireland when <br />
she was united to England. But the peo- <br />
ple of this Province were too wide awake <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for</span> them, and decided against
their plot-<br />
ings.<br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr">M</span>r. <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">MCMILLAN.—The</span> hon. member <br />
says the country has decided <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">against</span>
Con- <br />
federation, and now I ask him to justify <br />
the grounds on which he asks the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">House</span>
<br />
to send delegates home. If any <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span>
<br />
more is necessary why not shew by an <br />
Address to Her Majesty, or by sending <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">home</span> a copy of the public
Journals what <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">has been the result,. After <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">admitting</span> that <br />
the vote of this House will be, to ask for<br />
delegates to he appointed, appears to me <br />
to be <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">a</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">very</span> childish <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">thing</span>. The hon. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">member for</span> Charlotte <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">(Mr.</span> B<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">oyd)
says</span> he <br />
is in favour <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">of a Union of </span> the

vantages will this give us that the large<br />
one would not confer?<br />

other Colonies, when it is well known <br />
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">
that by a despatch from the Imperial <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Go-</span>
<br />
vernment to the Governor of Nova Sco- <br />
tia on <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">this</span> question, power was
given <br />
to the Governor General to call <br />
them <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">together</span> for this very
purpose.<br />
Mr. Cardwell also says in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">his</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">despatch</span> <br />
to the Lieut. Governor, " with the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">sanction</span> of the Crown. &amp;c.,
they as - <br />
sembled." But apart from all this I dis- <br />
sent from this objection on general prin- <br />
ciples. I believe<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"> that</span> men should
meet <br />
together to confer upon subjects <br />
pertaining to the welfare of the <br />
whole of the Provinces. A great deal <br />
has been said about the manner in which <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegation</span> was carried on ;
it is said <br />
they had <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">champagne,</span> and a jolly
time of <br />
it, and yet those who condemned the meet- <br />
ing of <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">these</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates,</span> want now to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">send</span> <br />
other delegates <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">home</span> to go
through the <br />
same. But Mr. Cardwell's eulogy on the <br />
men who composed that delegation, and <br />
the manner in which they carried on their <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">proceedings</span> is quite sufficient
justification <br />
of the course pursued. What does <br />
he say ? " Animated by the warmest sen- <br />
timents of loyalty and devotion to their <br />
Sovereign, earnestly desirous to secure <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">for their</span> posterity throughout
all future <br />
time, the advantages which they enjoy as <br />
subjects of the British Crown ; steadfast- <br />
ly attached to the institutions under which <br />
they live, they <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">have</span> conducted
their deli- <br />
berations with patient sagacity, and have <br />
arrived at unanimous conclusions on ques- <br />
tions involving many <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">difficulties,</span>
and cal- <br />
culated under less favorable auspices to <br />
have given rise to many differences of <br />
opinion." Such an event is in the highest <br />
degree honorable to those who have taken <br />
part in these deliberations. It <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">must</span>
in- <br />
spire <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">conﬁdence</span> in the men by
whose <br />
judgment and temper this result has been <br />
attained. Another ground taken by my <br />
hon. friend from Charlotte (Mr. Boyd.) <br />
was that our own men should not be ap- <br />
pointed to the Governor's chair. What! I <br />
would ask, is not the hon. President of the <br />
Council able to fill that position ? I say <br />
that we have men who are able not only <br />
to ﬁll the office, but who are able to teach <br />
the Governors who are sent out to us, so <br />
that they go home better and wiser men <br />
than when they came out. But apart <br />
from this there are objects that should <br />
animate us with a spirit of progress. <br />
What is the cry of England? “ Free trade, <br />
free trade with the world," and this should<br />
be our motto, not as I said the other day,<br />
to build a china wall around us and crop us<br />
up in our little egg shell, and call all outside<br />
of us barbarians. This is not the principle<br />
of the day ; this should not be our policy,<br />
but to enter into an alliance that will en-<br />
able us to have free trade with our neigh-<br />
bours ; and this Union of the Provinces,<br />
I maintain, would be commercially the<br />
best step we could take. I have already<br />
gone into the figures and shown that<br />
financially we should have been much bet-<br />
ter off, and I shall not now take up any<br />
more of the time of the House, but hold<br />
myself ready to answer any thing that<br />
may be brought up as the debate pro-<br />
ceeds.</p>
<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr"><span class="lowConfidenceOcr" />Hon.

and coldness on this question.,for so much <br />
has been said and heard upon it that all<span class="lowConfidenceOcr"><br />
must be tired of it. The hon. member in <br />
all his long speech has brought out no- <br />
thing new—nothing but what has been re- <br />

<p class="ocr_par" dir="ltr">Lower Provinces. They met at Charlotte-<br />
town, and although ostensibly deliberating<br />
a few days they did nothing but wait for<br />
the Canadian delegates to propose ano-<br />
ther Union. It is evident from the whole<br />
proceedings that they all went there pre-<br />
pared to go into the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">larger</span> Scheme. The <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Canadians</span> came down in a steamer, and <br />
then commenced a round of festivities <br />
which ended by giving to us a Scheme by <br />
which our rights and revenues were to be <br />
bartered away for ever. In the mean- <br />
time we ﬁnd a most insignificant body in<br />
St. John—the Chamber of Commerce— <br />
insignificant in <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">numbers</span> and
inﬂuence— <br />
we ﬁnd them set to work by some secret <br />
inﬂuence, inviting not any Commercial <br />
body like themselves, but the whole of <br />
the Legislature of Canada, on their own <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">responsibility,</span> to pay us a visit. We
<br />
know that when the invitation reached <br />
Canada the Legislature was in the last <br />
throes of dissolution. After awhile the <br />
matter was renewed, and some of the <br />
members of the new House came down. <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">They</span> were <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">received</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">with</span> that hospitality <br />
and kindly treatment which strangers al- <br />
ways <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">receive</span> in St. John, and at
a dinner <br />
given in their honor at Stubbs' Hotel, <br />
although I did not wish to <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">speak,</span> I was <br />
called on, and in a most guarded manner <br />
told them that they need not imagine <br />
from the demonstrations of the people,<br />
that they were all in favor of a Union <br />
with Canada. The delegates, if such they <br />
may be called, for they only claim to <br />
have acted on a despatch which had been <br />
received from the Imperial Government <br />
some years before, when they returned <br />
from Canada soon let us know that <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">false-</span>
<br />
hood and misrepresentation were the en- <br />
gines to be used in this country to for- <br />
ward the Scheme. We were at first told <br />
that the people were not to he informed <br />as to what had been done, till the Scheme <br />
had been sent to England, and come out<br />
again ; it would have been a breach of <br />
etiquette to let the people, who were most <br />
interested, know anything about it till it <br />
had been laid before <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">the</span> Imperial Cabi- <br />
net ; and there <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is no doubt</span> at
all but that <br />
it was intended to withhold all particulars <br />
till the House met, and then to force it  <br />
through before time could be given for <br />
the people or their representatives to <br />
think on the matter. A gentleman who <br />
has done much for Confederation asked <br />
the <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Provincial</span> Secretary whether
they <br />
intended to submit it to the people, or to <br />
push it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">through</span>
the House, and he replied <br />
that it had not yet been decided. Ru- <br />
mour said that the question did come up <br />in the Council, and that Mr. McMillan <br />the then hon. Surveyor General was the <br />
only one who said it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">ought</span> to be submit- <br />
ted. They then determined at once to <br />
dissolve the House. and have a new elec- <br />
tion. I think it <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">is</span> hardly fair
for those <br />
who then forced an election on the coun- <br />
try, and made the people <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">travel</span>
for miles <br />
through snow and mud to hear them ex- <br />
pound their pet Scheme, to charge their <br />
failure on the ignorance of the people, es- <br />pecially as they did all they could to en- <br />
lighten them. Then the statements that <br />
were put <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">forth</span> by the different <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">delegates</span> <br />
were most <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">contradictory.</span> One of
them in <br />
Carleton County told the people that the <br />
Intercolonial Railroad was to come down <br />
past Woodstock, and another over at the <br />
<span class="lowConfidenceOcr">North</span> <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">Shore</span> made a very different state- <br />
ment, <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">intimating</span> it would come
by their <br />
doors. One said it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">pass</span> down the <br />
West Side of the River St. John, and <br />
another that it would <span class="lowConfidenceOcr">take the Central</span> <br />
route for the especial benefit King's.<br />
And even in St. John the two delegates <br />
on the same platform could not agree in <br />
