<fw type="num">42</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> 

<!-- GL, 2016-11-18, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            <!--<p> Brunswick were the best judges of whe<lb break="no"/>ther Confederation was for their interest<lb/>
or not. It was not for the people of Ca<lb break="no"/>nada or the people of England, to tell<lb/>
them what was for their interest, but<lb/>
they would give due consideration to<lb/>
anything emanating from the Colonial<lb/>
Office. We are told that "union is<lb/>
strength." No one desies that ; but a<lb/>
union, to be strong, must have no discord<lb break="no"/>ant elements. In the abstract, he was in<lb/>
favor of union ; but if he disapproved of<lb/>
the grounds they went on, he would fight<lb/>
against it through thick and thin. He had<lb/>
heard them talk about loyalty. He could<lb/>
say that some of his ancestors had shed<lb/>
their blood under General Wolfe, at the<lb/>
taking of Quebec ; and if the time now<lb/>
came for a fight, and they got him in a<lb/>
corner, he would be found giving a kick<lb/>
for a kick, and a blow for a blow. The<lb/>
next charge brought against them was<lb/>
the President of the Council wished to <lb/>
remove the seat of Government. He <lb/>
then referred to the Journals of 1858 to<lb/>
show who voted for the removal of the<lb/>
seat of Government at the time.</p>
            <p>MR. MCMILLAN said he had never,<lb/>
here or elsewhere, given as a reason for<lb/>
a vote of want of confidence, that they<lb/>
wished to remove the seat of Government.<lb/>
A charge was made against the mover of<lb/>
the amendment, that he had charged the<lb/>
President of the Council who doing away<lb/>
with the Post Office Department, was a<lb/>
first step towards the removal of the seat<lb/>
of Government. I said I stated last year<lb/>
in my place, when the subject was under<lb/>
consideration, that it was a first step to<lb break="no"/>wards doing away with Departmental and<lb/>
Responsible Government. I did not give<lb/>
a reason that I would go against the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment because I opposed them upon<lb/>
that last year.</p>
            <p>MR. FRASER said it was put forward<lb/>
in the County of York as a canvass<lb/>
against Mr. Pickard, that he was a sup<lb break="no"/>porter of Mr. Smith, who was going to<lb/>
remove the seat of Government. The<lb/>
hon. mover of the amendment had stated<lb/>
that he never stirred from his office, but<lb/>
he had canvassers who went through the<lb/>
country.</p>
            <p>MR. FISHER.—There never was a<lb/>
man went through the country by my <lb/>
directions.</p>
            <p>MR. FRASER then slated that in one<lb/>
of the settlements of the County a gen<lb break="no"/>tleman, who was an ex-member of great<lb/>
ability and ingenuity, told the inhabitants<lb/>
in language that conveyed to their minds<lb/>
the impression that Mr. Smith intended to<lb/>
remove the Seat of Government. Ano<lb break="no"/>ther chrage is that they failed to discover<lb/>
that the Export Duty Law had expired ;<lb/>
all he would say in regard to this was,<lb/>
that it was the duty of the out-going Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment to communicate to an in-coming<lb/>
one every thing that concerns the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the people or the business of the <lb/>
country. This was done in England. If<lb/>
the out-going Government knew of it,<lb/>
they should have told it, and if<lb/>
they did not know it, they were<unclear n="">
                  <lb/>
?</unclear> in the duty. Shortly af-<lb break="maybe"/>
               <unclear n="">? </unclear>here last
session, he had<lb/>
               <unclear n="">? </unclear>a rumour
outside that the revenue<lb/>
               <unclear n="">?<lb/>
?<lb/>
?<lb/>
?<lb/>
?<lb/>
?<lb/>
? They should not condemn the Go</unclear>
               <lb break="no"/>vernment for that, for the money was all<lb/>
in the Treasury now. They must consi-</p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>


















            <p>der the peculiar situation of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. They were running all those elec<lb break="no"/>tions in the month of March, and had<lb/>
many difficulties to contend with. Ano<lb break="no"/>ther ground of complaint is : they have<lb/>
been guilty of land jabbing. He thought<lb/>
if they had twenty such land jabbers as<lb/>
Mr. Gibson, the people of York would<lb/>
not complain, and he did not think the<lb/>
people fo the Spruce County of Resti-<lb break="maybe"/>
gouche would complain either. The late<lb/>
Government undertook to seel Mr. Gob-<lb break="yes"/>
son 15,000 acres of land without condi<lb break="no"/>tions of actual settlement attached. Five<lb/>
thousand acres of this, Mr. Lindsay says,<lb/>
was applied for under ficticious names.<lb/>
He (Mr. Fraser) said they were all bona<lb/>
fide
names<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. LINDSAY—If application is made</p>
            <p>for land in one man's name, and another<lb/>
man gets the land, is it not using ficti<lb break="no"/>tious names?</p>
            <p>MR. FRASER—The whole lumbering<lb/>
business is done in that way. If the hon. <lb/>
member for Kent was to go to St. John<lb/>
to purchase molasses, and went to his<lb/>
friends and said, if I go and buy it, the<lb/>
dealer will take advantage of me, but if<lb/>
you go, he will not know who is buying<lb/>
it. They say the late Government did<lb/>
not undertake to sell the land. They or<lb break="no"/>dered a survery, and when a man gets an<lb/>
order to survey, he believes the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment is going to bring that land to sale.</p>
            <p>The debate was then adjourned until<lb/>
to-morrow at 11 o'clock.</p>
















            <p>MR. NEEDHAM called the attention<lb/>
of the House to a report in the Morning<lb/>
Telegraph
of a speech made by him, in<lb/>
which this passage appears : "He states<lb/>
he was not surprised at the view taken<lb/>
by that 'great big toady.' Dr. Thompson,<lb/>
but it was no use for him 'or any other<lb/>
man' to try to stop the progress of every<lb/>
great political principle." He did not<lb/>
want to be misrepresented, for he did not<lb/>
make use of the words "great big toa<lb break="no"/>dy," nor the words that follow either. He<lb/>
believed it was not a misprint, but a mis<lb break="no"/>representation. He spoke this in the <lb/>
hearing of their paid reporter, in order<lb/>
that he should notice that he gave this a<lb/>
flat contradiction.</p>

            <p>House adjourned until 10 A. M. to-mor-<lb break="maybe"/>
row.</p>
            <p>

            <p>THURSDAY, MARCH 22.</p>


            <p>The House, moved by <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. Anglin</persName>, went<lb/>
into Committee of the Whole ( <persName ref="pers:SCOV1">Mr. Scovil</persName> <lb/>
in the Chair) on a Bill for the purpose of<lb/>
winding up the affaird of the Caledonia<lb/>
Mining and Manufacturing Company.<lb/>
Bill passed without discussion or amend<lb break="no"/>ment.</p>
            <p>At eleven the adjourned debate on the<lb/>
amendment to the 4th paragraph in the<lb/>
address, was taken up.</p>




            <p> <persName ref="pers:FRAS1">MR. FRASER</persName> resumed his speech<lb/>
from yesterday afternoon. He said that <lb/>
there was the charged of which the House<lb/>
was <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> Government<lb/>
and it was a very delicate subject <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
<unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
Province, to, torch <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
Judicial <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
afraid <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
would give his opinion plainly and he<lb/>
felt bound to say that the Government<lb/>
could not have appointed Judge Wilmot<lb/>
<cb/>
           
to the position of Chief Justice and done<lb/>
justice to themselves. The hon. member<lb/>
of York (Mr. Fisher) said that there was<lb/>
no great political excitement at the time<lb/>
Judge Wilmot addressed the Grand Jury<lb/>
in Fredericton on the subject of Confede<lb break="no"/>ration. He wished to show that the poli<lb break="no"/>cal excitement was running very high at<lb/>
the time. The coutnry was agitated on<lb/>
the question of the Quebec Scheme. Mr.<lb/>
Fisher himself, who was the first who be<lb break="no"/>gan the discussion, he spoken in Carle<lb break="no"/>ton ; he was followed by his friend Mr. <lb/>
Needham. Mr. Tilley and Mr. Gray<lb/>
not long afterwards repeatedly addressed<lb/>
crowded audiences in the Mechanics In<lb break="no"/>stitute, St. John, and in Carleton. The<lb/>
excitement throughout the country was,<lb/>
there could be no doubt, running high. A<lb/>
keen political contest was looked forward<lb/>
to, for it was pretty well understood that<lb/>
the Governor was going to dissolve the<lb/>
House. It was amidst all this excite<lb break="no"/>ment that Judge Wilmot addressed the<lb/>
Grand Jury in Fredericton. His hon.<lb/>
colleague (Mr. Fisher) said that it was a<lb/>
common practice for Judges in their ad<lb break="no"/>dresses to speak on the topice of the day,<lb/>
and he had pointed to a precedent in the <lb/>
case of the late Chief Justice Parker.<lb/>
But there was a great difference between<lb/>
Judge Parker addressing a Jury on a<lb/>
School Law, and that of Judge Wilmot<lb/>
speaking with all the judicial authority of<lb/>
the Bench on a question affecting the very<lb/>
constitution of the coutnry. He denied<lb/>
his right to throw himself into the politi<lb break="no"/>cal excitement of the time, and his say<lb break="no"/>ing that he would, in case it was neces<lb break="no"/>sary to carry the Scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, resign his seat up on the Bench and<lb/>
contest the County of York, was sufficient<lb/>
to condemn him in his mind. Further<lb/>
than that, Judge Wilmot voted against<lb/>
the Government of the day. If he (Judge<lb/>
W. chose to mix himself up with the po<lb break="no"/>litics of the day, he must as men i nthe
hum<lb break="no"/>bler situations of public trust, take the<lb/>
consequences : considering his position, <lb/>
he was bound to preserve a dignified<lb/>
silence.</p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:FRAS1">Mr. Fraser</persName> then proceeded to speak on<lb/>
the charge against the Government for<lb/>
not fillinf up the office of Auditor Gene<lb break="no"/>ral, and referred to the late Auditor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, a gentleman who was well known to<lb/>
be a great financier, but equally well<lb/>
known for several years before his death<lb/>
to be incapable to discharge the duties of<lb/>
his offie. He was not pleased, he con<lb break="no"/>fessed, that the Government had filled up<lb/>
that office before this time, but was he to<lb/>
turn round, because they had not done so,<lb/>
and oppose them, and help probably to<lb/>
being in a Government that would inflict<lb/>
the Quebec Scheme upon the country. But<lb/>
he would say that as far as the business<lb/>
of the Audit Office was concerned, he had<lb/>
no fault to find with the Government. He<lb/>
never knew the public accounts to be pre<lb break="no"/>sented in such a clear, plain, mercantile<lb/>
manner as they had been this year. With<lb/>
regard to the Solicitor Generalship. As<lb/>
far as he himself was consulted in the<lb/>
Crown business, he had given good ad<lb break="no"/>vice, that is, in Crown judgment, <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>
               <lb/>
               <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
<unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>
               <lb/>

               <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>
<unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>
               <lb/>
              <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>
               <lb/>
              <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> the Government had not made the
               <lb/>
appointment, particularly if the pay of<lb/>
the gentlemen employed did not exceed<lb/>

          the salary of the Solicitor General. Mr. <lb/>
Fraser then went on to show that the <lb/>
crown law expenses under the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were not confined to the salaries<lb/>
of its officers; he took up the public
ac<lb break="no"/>counts of 1862 and proved that the late
Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, when they had a Solicitor
Gener<lb break="no"/>al employed gentlemen to conduct the bus<lb break="no"/>iness—quoting a case where Mr. Charles<lb/>
Fisher had been paid $187 for attending <lb/>
to the criminal business in Carleton.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FRAS1">Mr. Fraser</persName> then referred at length to <lb/>
the course Mr. Fisher had taken
during <lb/>
the election of York, and
denounced his at<lb break="no"/>tack on Mr. Hatheway as cruel and
unkind. <lb/>
Mr. Fuller had attacked every one of the <lb/>
three gentlemen who represented York, <lb/>
and who had been returned by large ma<lb break="no"/>jorities over himself, and all, he believed.<lb/>
for the express purpose of raising himself <lb/>
at their expense.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FRAS1">Mr.
Fraser</persName> then proceeded to say the <lb/>
mover of the amendment, Mr. Fisher, had <lb/>
made a grave charge a against the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in reference to Minute of
Council. <lb/>
He had called it an insulting
document,<lb/>
and said that any one who would answer <lb/>
a courteous letter in the spirit of that pa<lb break="no"/>per, he would call a low fellow. He <lb/>
could not agree with Mr. Fisher,
he <lb/>
said, and he did not fear boldly to express <lb/>
his opinion. There was no insult to that <lb/>
dispatch to Her Majesty's Secretary of <lb/>
State. He thought that the gentlemen <lb/>
who signed that Minute had taken
a bold <lb/>
and independent stand. Could Mr Fish<lb break="no"/>er say that they had no right to differ <lb/>
with Mr. Cardwell on a matter of policy <lb/>
so nearly affecting their
interests ?<lb/>
Would he say that Her Majesty’s
Minis<lb break="no"/>ters could not be approached with remon<lb break="no"/>strance ? that they were never censured <lb/>
for their policy in the Imperial
Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment? What, he would like to know,<lb/>
did Earl Derby state, the other
day, in <lb/>
reference to Mr. Cardwell and
his Colo<lb break="no"/>nial policy? Mr. Cardwell was, like any <lb/>
other man, liable to error and mistakes of <lb/>
judgment, and open to censure. While <lb/>
he had the highest respect for the Queen's <lb/>
Secretary of State, he thought,
on the <lb/>
question of Confederation, he had a right <lb/>
to his opinion, and that he had
the better <lb/>
judgment of what would be best for the <lb/>
country. Mr. Fisher had displayed a <lb/>
new-born reverence for dispatches, but <lb/>
what did he say in 1854? Why, that the <lb/>
Government should not he governed by <lb/>
dispatches from Downing Street, but <lb/>
Mr. Fisher only cared for dispatches <lb/>
when it suited him. The Government
<lb/>
had been charged with neglecting
the de<lb break="no"/>fence of the country. He had no hesita<lb break="no"/>tion in saying that it had been
the hon. <lb/>
member of Carleton (Mr. Connell) who <lb/>
had raised the alarm about the
unpro<lb break="no"/>tected state of the frontier. He
did not <lb/>
wonder at the alarm in Carleton, and
that <lb/>
weak women and children should
be <lb/>
frightened; but he believed it was got <lb/>
up that some political purpose
might be<lb/>
served. He had not the slightest
doubt <lb/>
that the Government would look after
the <lb/>
defences of the country, if for no other <lb/>
reason than that their own lives
and pro<lb break="no"/>perties were at stake. Mr. Fisher had <lb/>
referred to the coat of the delegation
to <lb/>
England, and said that the money
had <lb/>
been absolutely wasted. But be thought
<lb/>
that delegation had done good. By it <lb/>
Mr. Cardwell got some
information <lb/>
as to the feeling
in this Province regard<lb break="no"/>ing the Quebec Scheme, that might be <lb/>
useful ro him. With regard to the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation, he was not, he <lb/>
would say, opposed to the
abstract prin<lb break="no"/><cb/>ciple of union, but he would never
consent <lb/>
that the Quebec Scheme should be
inﬂict<lb break="no"/>ed upon the country. He would go
down <lb/>
with the ship first, and he would never<lb/>
consent to any scheme unless it was first<lb/>
submitted to the people.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FRAS1">Mr.
Fraser</persName> quoted from the Canadian<lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">News</hi>, to the effect that it was said the<lb/>
British Government were going to ap<lb break="no"/>point Hon. Mr. Tiller Governor of British <lb/>
Columbia and Vancouver's Island—a re<lb break="no"/>port that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">News</hi> hoped was not
true, <lb/>
for Mr. Tilley had yet good work
to do, <lb/>
and in doing it he would serve
the Brit<lb break="no"/>ish Government and the Colonies. What <lb/>
was that good work, he would like to ask? <lb/>
Was it not to work up the scheme and <lb/>
have it forced upon the Province? Mr. <lb/>
Tilley, in doing this, might be serving<lb/>
the interests of the Imperial
Government,<lb/>
but was he serving the interests of the <lb/>
Province? He believed the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment were deceived as to the unanimi<lb break="no"/>ty of feeling in favor of the scheme. They <lb/>
were told that men of all political parties<lb/>
wished to carry it out. But, he
would<lb/>
ask, who represented the Opposition of <lb/>
this Province at the Quebec Conference? <lb/>
The Hon. J. H Gray. Did he represent <lb/>
the Opposition? No. Did Hon. E. B. <lb/>
Chandler, one of the greatest politicians
<lb/>
this country had produced—did he repre<lb break="no"/>sent the Opposition? No. Somehow
<lb/>
he was generally found supporting the <lb/>
Government of the day. Did his
hon. <lb/>
colleague Mr. Fisher represent the Op<lb break="no"/>position? No. He would tell his
col<lb break="no"/>league, when the Tilley Government
<lb/>
turned him, they turned him out. But <lb/>
it was no less true that, after
he was <lb/>
turned out, he invariably gave that Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment his support. When the
British <lb/>
Government were told that men of all <lb/>
parties supported the scheme, he main<lb break="no"/>tained they were told what was
not true. <lb/>
He would refer to another delegation.
<lb/>
the delegation to Washington with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the Reciprocity Treaty. (Here <lb/>
Mr. Fraser quoting from an American <lb/>
paper, referred to a debate that had taken <lb/>
place at some meeting in Washington, at <lb/>
which Mr. Merrill &amp; Co. on the-American <lb/>
side and the Hon. Messrs. Galt,
A.J Smith <lb/>
and Henry, delegates of the Provinces, <lb/>
were present, and showed that the Hon. <lb/>
A. J. Smith was reported as arguing <lb/>
strongly in maintenance of the
right of <lb/>
lumbermen to raft their lumber down the<lb/>
head waters of the St. John.) Should <lb/>
they say, after this, that the
Hon. A. J. <lb/>
Smith, who, it had been said, was hostile <lb/>
to this section of the country, was the
<lb/>
man who was going to sacrifice inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the people on the St. John River? <lb/>
Or would it be said that the delegation
<lb/>
to Washington was useless when, though <lb/>
the treaty was abrogated, that
right was <lb/>
not lost? A great deal had been said <lb/>
about the cost of delegations.
How <lb/>
much he would like to know, did the<lb/>
delegation of Mr. Fisher and the
Hon. J.<lb/>
Robertson cast the Province ? £350,000.<lb/>
because the country lost that sum
when <lb/>
they bought out Jackson &amp; Co. He heard<lb/>
that his hon. colleague kept back the<lb/>
contract, and it was a singular thing that <lb/>
memorandum attached to it, in which<lb/>
Jackson &amp; Co. professed willingness to <lb/>
build the Railway upon concession of<lb/>
time, could not be found. ( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> <lb/>
derided this.) The contract was kept<lb/>
back. He would refer to his hon. friend<lb/>
Mr. Kerr, if that was not the fact.<lb/>
            </p>
<p> <persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName> did remember that the<lb/>
contract was missing at the time, and that<lb/>
it was never seen till after the debate on<lb/>

            <cb/>

          the question was closed. The Attorney <lb/>
General (Mr. Fisher) said that it had <lb/>
been mislaid in a pigeon-hole of some <lb/>
desk in the Provincial Secretary's of<lb break="no"/>fice.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName> —It was a singular thing<lb/>
that the original contract was never<lb/>
produced during the debate. But there<lb/>
was a duplicate of it. It was also a sin<lb break="no"/>gular thing that.,after the debate,
the <lb/>
original contract should have turned up <lb/>
in the Secretary’s ofﬁce. He would ra<lb break="no"/>ther be called a liar to his face than to <lb/>
have these insinuations thrown out. His <lb/>
colleague (Hr. Fraser) would find the <lb/>
whole words of the original
contract in <lb/>
the Journals of 1856, page 52,
with the, <lb/>
memorandum.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
<persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FRASER</persName> —If his hon. colleague
<lb/>
would show, he would withdraw
his as<lb break="no"/>sertion. (Here <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>
produced the <lb/>
Journals, and showed the copy of the con<lb break="no"/>tract, and pointed out that the memoran<lb break="no"/>dum for extension of time was in the body <lb/>
of the agreement.) Mr. Fraser,—But it <lb/>
was a distinct memorandum. He had <lb/>
heard the present Judge Allen
make the <lb/>
statement on the hustings. With refer<lb break="no"/>ence to the cost of the
delegation of Hon. <lb/>
A.J. Smith and J. Allen. it had been <lb/>
said that it cost £800. Then, he
said, the <lb/>
delegation of his hon. colleague (Mr.
<lb/>
Fisher) cost £350,000; for who could <lb/>
say, if they had not been bought
out, if <lb/>
they had got an extension, that
Jackson <lb/>
&amp; Co., the wealthiest
railway contractors <lb/>
in England, who had built a
railway in <lb/>
the Crimea and made a present of
it to <lb/>
the British Government, were men
not <lb/>
able to build the Railway? But, apart<lb/>
from this view of the case, it
was <lb/>
said that the delegation of
Fisher and <lb/>
Robertson cost £900. One thing
more <lb/>
he would touch upon. An
observation of <lb/>
the hon. member (Mr. Fisher) had fallen <lb/>
on his ears and given him a great sur<lb break="no"/>rise, when he said that the troops of <lb/>Her Majesty would not be sent to the <lb/>
borders of the Province because they
<lb/>
would desert. Were they not sent
two <lb/>
or three years ago? And when th e dis<lb break="no"/>turbance on the Railway took place, sent <lb/>
to the border, and had they
heard of one <lb/>
desertion? lt came with a very
bad grace <lb/>
from him (Mr. Fisher) to cast
this slur <lb/>
upon Her Majesty's groups. ( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> <lb/>
denied that what he had said could bear <lb/>
the interpretation Mr. Fraser had put upon
<lb/>
it.) That slur that had been thrown up<lb break="no"/>on Her Majesty‘s troops he would throw <lb/>
back as a slur upon the hon. member. <lb/>

still continues.</p>
            <p>The delay
in calling the House, un<lb break="no"/>wise, especially this year, when impor<lb break="no"/>tant laws had expired. Tilley and <lb/>
Fisher should not be blamed for not<lb/>
coming earlier to their rescue. Such<lb/>
an act of kindness could scarcely be ex<lb break="no"/>pected.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Gibson's land ought not to have been<lb/>
brought to sale till a formal notice of<lb/>
rescinding the former order had been<lb/>
published. The Surveyor General, last<lb/>
Session, stated that the Government<lb/>
had not then concluded as to this mat<lb break="no"/>ter. Now they say, the order lapsed<lb/>
when the Inter-colonial Railroad Act<lb/>
expired. Five thousand acres of the <lb/>
land surveyed for Gibson advertised in <lb/>
name of other parties. The public de<lb break="no"/>ceived. Twenty-seven acres granted<lb/>
at the head of Nashwaak River, which<lb/>
commands the business of St. Mary's <lb/>
Lake, which was not offered at public<lb/>
sale at all, said to have been given to<lb/>
make up for some deficiency.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General cannot blame<lb/>
the Opposition Press for furnishing time<lb break="no"/>ly information of the Fenian conspiracy ;<lb/>
he is not the greatest alarmist himself<lb/>
on this subject. We are not asked for<lb/>
concord and harmony in view of this<lb/>
emergency. The Attorney General<lb/>
finds "emergencies" sufficient to enable<lb/>
him to get the loaves and fishes; but <lb/>
such appeals are too transparent.</p>

            <p>[ <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. McClelan</persName> addressed the House<lb/>
for about three hours; but owing to our<lb/>
unfortunate misunderstanding about<lb/>
reporting, we are unable to furnish more<lb/>
of this speech than some of the leading<lb/>
points.]</p>
            <p> <persName ref="UNSPECIFIED">Hon. MR. GILMOUR</persName> said he was<lb/>
pleased to hear his hon. friend, Mr.<lb/>
McClelan say that if the Government<lb/>
were all right on the question of Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, he would not feel bound to<lb/>
vote against them on any of the minor<lb/>
charges which had been preferred at<lb/>
this time. He thanked his hon. friend<lb/>
for the complimentary allusion which<lb/>
had been made to him; personally they<lb/>
had been on the most intimate terms for<lb/>
ten years, and had, until the last elec<lb break="no"/>tion, acted together in politics, and if<lb/>
there was any circumstances which he<lb/>
regretted, it was that his hon. friend<lb/>
and himself differed in reference to Con<lb break="no"/>federation. There was no member with<lb/>
whom he should be more pleased to be<lb/>
associated than with him. He should<lb/>
not trespass long upon the time of the<lb/>
House, for he was quite sure that he<lb/>
could not make a speech which could<lb/>
for any length of time be interesting.<lb/>
The Government, of which he was a<lb/>
member, were not upon their trial. He<lb/>
had listened to the charges and denuncia<lb break="no"/>tions which had been made without any<lb/>
feelings of alarm or fear: first, because he<lb/>
knew that he had endeavored to do his<lb/>
duty, and that it had been done in such<lb/>
a manner that the public interest had<lb/>
been carefully guarded, and whatever<lb/>
the result of the vote might be, it could<lb/>
make little difference to him personally,<lb/>
for he valued the honorable position<lb/>
which he held only because it was an<lb/>
evidence of the confidence of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple ; he was not in need of its emolu<lb break="no"/>ments, he was not a all in love with its re<lb break="no"/>sponsibilities. One would suppose that <lb/>
some of the Opposition in the House,<lb/>
and many more out of it, imagined that<lb/>
the Government had done some great<lb/>
injustice to the late Government ; such<lb/>
was not the case ; in the words of the<lb/>
famous Memorandum of Council, the<lb/>
late Government were parties to the<lb/>
Quebec Scheme ; they submitted it to<lb/>
the people in their own way and at their<lb/>
own time, and it was rejected, and in<lb/>
rejecting it they rejected its advocates.<lb/>
The present Government had no con<lb break="no"/>certed action during the elections; each<lb/>
discussed the question in its own way,<lb/>
and he should trust fairly and honora<lb break="no"/>bly; and no matter how highly the ser<lb break="no"/>vices of the late Government had been<lb/>
valued, the most of them had been de<lb break="no"/>feated, and their services had been dis<lb break="no"/>pensed with. If any injustices had been <lb/>
done to them, they had to blame their own constituencies and not this
Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. He had no apology to make<lb/>
to the late Government or any member<lb/>
of it; he never wronged them either<lb/>
individually or collectively, and neither<lb/>
was he under any obligation to them ;<lb/>
he thought if the accounts were balan<lb break="no"/>ced, they would be largely indebted to<lb/>
him, so far as political favors were con<lb break="no"/>cerned. It was true, as the Attorney<lb/>
General had stated, that most of the<lb/>
members of the present Government<lb/>
   
            <cb/>
 
were called hastily and unexpectedly<lb/>
      to seat in the Executive Council,<lb/>
and a generous public would not ex<lb break="no"/>pect new men to be just so ready in<lb/>
all duties of an Executive as men<lb/>
who had been for years directing the<lb/>
affairs of the Province; but while they<lb/>
had not their experience, neither had<lb/>
they learned the art of mystifying and humbugging the people.</p>
            <p>Without any wish to operate upon<lb/>
the sympathies of hon. members or the<lb/>
people generally, he would refer for a<lb/>
few minutes to some of the influences<lb/>
which had been used against the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. First, he alluded to the<lb/>
press, the most of which had been not<lb/>
only in favor of Confederation, but in<lb/>
direct opposition to the Government.<lb/>
He was aware that some portion of the<lb/>
religious press had been devoted to ad<lb break="no"/>vocating Confederation, but other por<lb break="no"/>tions of it had exerted all their in<lb break="no"/>fluence against the Government, and <lb/>
had not hesitated to scatter through<lb/>
society "firebrands, arrows and death."<lb/>
He was not one of those who<lb/>
would, if he could exclude the discus<lb break="no"/>sion of important political questions<lb/>
from religious journals, but they should<lb/>
be expected, from their high and holy<lb/>
calling, to urge a calm and dispassion<lb break="no"/>ate consideration of any important mat<lb break="no"/>ter, and to endeavor to operate upon<lb/>
men's reason and judgment, and upon<lb/>
the better part of human nature, but<lb/>
some of them, he regretted to say, had<lb/>
pursued an entirely different course.<lb/>
He had no disposition to say anything<lb/>
disrespectful, and should leave them to<lb/>
their own reflections, which he was sure,<lb/>
in their calm moments, must punish<lb/>
them more than anything which could<lb/>
be said of them; but there were some<lb/>
honorable exceptions. The secular<lb/>
Press had pursued a course of opposi<lb break="no"/>tion unprecedented in the history of this<lb/>
or any other Province, and if the "liars<lb/>
have their place," he pitied the men who<lb/>
had prompted and published such base<lb/>
and calumnious falsehoods. They had<lb/>
learned the art of lying and misrepre<lb break="no"/>sentation to perfection, and would be<lb/>
entitled to a first class certificate for<lb/>
those qualifications. They had acted<lb/>
upon the principle of throwing dirt in<lb/>
hopes that some might stick; they had<lb/>
endeavored to give a false coloring to<lb/>
the most plausible acts of the Government<lb/>
and the papers had teemed with one<lb/>
continued strain of personal abuse,<lb/>
slander and misrepresentation, and<lb/>
when such characters call a man a fool<lb/>
the public are to understand him to be<lb/>
an honest man, and one who will en<lb break="no"/>deavor to do his duty. Their humor<lb/>
means scandal and falsehood. Patriot--<lb break="yes"/>
one who wants to humbug the people<lb/>
and get into office. Promises-mean<lb/>
nothing. Rogue and rascal-means a<lb/>
man of a different political party from<lb/>
themselves ; in fact, the public should un<lb break="no"/>derstand them, to get at the truth, to<lb/>
say. Such papers had been spread,<lb/>
broad-cast over the land, at whose ex<lb break="no"/>pense he was not prepared to say, but<lb/>
he could say, that none of the public<lb/>
money had been used since the present<lb/>
Government came into power, to sub<lb break="no"/>sidize the Press. In connection with a<lb/>
portion of the Press there had been em<lb break="no"/>ployed an organized band of sneaks,<lb/>
who had no taste for anything that was<lb/>
decent or good, who would see nothing<lb/>
to please in the most lovely landscape<lb/>

           but if
they could only see something<lb/>
filthy and decayed they were
sure to<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>stick their bill into it. And such was<lb/>
the character of the miserable band who<lb/>
had so industriously endeavored to poi<lb break="no"/>son the public mind by base and dis<lb break="no"/>honest means, and some men who hold<lb/>
their heads high, and present a friend<lb break="no"/>ly appearance, had encouraged it;<lb/>
but "a man may smile, and smile, and<lb/>
be a villain." He had borne their per<lb break="no"/>sonal abuse and slander for twelve<lb/>
months, and was now going to free his<lb/>
mind, and as he cared little personally<lb/>
for political distinction, he should speak<lb/>
without reserve his honest conviction,<lb/>
let it cut where it would.</p>
            <p> Their political opponents, with some<lb/>
honorable exceptions, had pretended to<lb/>
look upon the Government with contempt.<lb/>
This was a quality seldom seen in a<lb/>
gentleman, it was most prominent in the<lb/>
lower order of men. Gentlemen, al<lb break="no"/>though superior in education and in posi<lb break="no"/>tion, seldom looked with contempt upon<lb/>
those, who in reality were their in<lb break="no"/>feriors; but there was a class of men who<lb/>
became intoxicated with their own sup<lb break="no"/>posed greatness and superiority, having<lb/>
excessive vanity, who in order to gratify<lb/>
a low principle, treated with contempt<lb/>
men who were quite their equals, this <lb/>
quality increased as you descended in the<lb/>
scale of manhood, and was very prominent<lb/>
in the negro character, and he had been<lb/>
informed that in the South the slaves<lb/>
looked upon and treated with contempt <lb/>
not only those of their own class who<lb/>
might not be just equal with them in the<lb/>
social scale, but even the white men who<lb/>
were free and in every respect their<lb/>
superiors. And in animals it is the<lb/>
same. Writers who had studied their<lb/>
habits said, that the lion and the horse<lb/>
were never known to have been influenced<lb/>
by any such disposition, while the ass and<lb/>
the meaner beasts were strongly in<lb break="no"/>fluenced by that principle. He had been<lb/>
amused to see with what contempt some<lb/>
of the very meanest specimens of hu<lb break="no"/>manity pretended to look upon the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Government. A great many of the<lb/>
public officials, from the judge upon the<lb/>
bench down to the humblest employee<lb/>
upon the railroad, had been opposed to<lb/>
the Government, and, with some honora<lb break="no"/>ble exceptions, they had been industrious<lb break="no"/>ly endeavoring to defeat them. It had<lb/>
not been the policy of the Government to<lb/>
remove from office their opponents and<lb/>
replace them with their friends, but acts<lb/>
of kindness and forbearance in too many<lb/>
cases had been met with base ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Personally he had, since his first en<lb break="no"/>trance into public life, been opposed to<lb/>
removals, except where the public in<lb break="no"/>terests require it. He had never been<lb/>
disposed to use any brief authority or<lb/>
power which might have been entrusted<lb/>
to him in any unkind or ungenerous way,<lb/>
and for pursuing that course he had suf<lb break="no"/>fered to some extent with the extreme<lb/>
men of the Liberal party, and now, he<lb/>
believed, that he was likely to suffer from<lb/>
the extreme men of the Conservative<lb/>
party, but so far he had had courage<lb/>
enough in that respect to do what he<lb/>
thought was right, but there was a point<lb/>
beyond which forbearance ceased to be a<lb/>
virtue.</p>
            <p>Having now dwelt long enough upon<lb/>
general matters, he would allude to a<lb/>
few of the charges which had been urged<lb/>
against this Government; and as all of<lb/>
them had been so ably answered by<lb/>
speakers who had preceded him, it was<lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
not necessary that he should dwell long<lb/>
upon any of them.</p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> charged the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with having called the House to<lb break="no"/>gether on the 8th of March instead of<lb/>
the 14th of February. This House was<lb/>
prorogued on the 8th day of June last,<lb/>
and was called together on the 8th of<lb/>
March, covering a recess of only nine<lb/>
months, when formerly twelve months<lb/>
was the time between the sessions; and<lb/>
what interest had suffered in consequence<lb/>
of this delay of three weeks from the<lb/>
usual time? He knew of none. Had any<lb/>
constituency or any hon. member been<lb/>
put to inconvenience in consequence of<lb/>
it? He knew of none. Perhaps his hon.<lb/>
friend, Mr. Fisher, fancied the session<lb/>
might be a few days shorter in conse<lb break="no"/>quence of it, or that some of the large<lb/>
stock of poultry he had said in might not<lb/>
keep during the long days of March. The<lb/>
charge was unworthy of any further no<lb break="no"/>tice, he was satisfied the House and the<lb/>
country would so view it.</p>
            <p>The next charge preferred by Mr.<lb/>
Fisher was, that an Auditor General had<lb/>
not been appointed, and that he was<lb/>
satisfied there were thousands of ac<lb break="no"/>counts in that office not checked at this<lb/>
day. Now he was sure that the duties of<lb/>
that office had never, since its first forma<lb break="no"/>tion, been better and more efficiently<lb/>
done than they had been the last year,<lb/>
and he denied the assertion that such a<lb/>
number of accounts remained in that<lb/>
office unchecked. The last quarter, or<lb/>
rather the first quarter of the fiscal year<lb/>
1866, might not be yet entirely checked,<lb/>
because after the close of the fiscal year,<lb/>
a good deal of time was required to pre<lb break="no"/>pare the report for the Legislature, and<lb/>
then as there were only two persons in<lb/>
the office a few accounts may not be<lb/>
examined immediately on their receipt,<lb/>
but as soon as the report was completed,<lb/>
Mr. Johnson at once attended to that<lb/>
duty; but he (Hon. Mr. Gillmer) would<lb/>
inform the hon. member for York, Mr.<lb/>
Fisher, if there were any accounts in the<lb/>
Audit Office unchecked, when they were<lb/>
neglected, it was when there was an<lb/>
Auditor General and three clerks in that<lb/>
office, at an expense of six or seven hun<lb break="no"/>dred pounds more than it was now, and<lb/>
when Mr. Fisher was in the Government<lb/>
also, that was the time, and not since the<lb/>
office of Auditor General had been vacant,<lb/>
that the public interests had been neglect<lb break="no"/>ed, and this he thought could be fully<lb/>
substantiated. There was no fear of the<lb/>
public interest suffering in that depart<lb break="no"/>ment when Mr. Johnson had charge; he<lb/>
was a most efficient and faithful official.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Up to 1854 there had been only a par<lb break="no"/>tial audit of the public accounts. At that<lb/>
time the political necessities of Mr. Fisher<lb/>
and his friends, together with the con<lb break="no"/>sideration for an old public servant, caus<lb break="no"/>ed the Government to appoint Mr. Parte<lb break="no"/>low, and he remembered that his hon.<lb/>
colleague (Col. Boyd) and himself agreed<lb/>
at the time that £100 per annum
was<lb/>
sufficient salary for that official. But it<lb/>
was also very convenient to have a finan<lb break="no"/>cier so competent to give information and<lb/>
advice convenient to the Government ;<lb/>
but it was well known that for four years<lb/>
before his death he was entirely unfit to<lb/>
discharge the duties of the office, and<lb/>
that the whole duties devoted on Mr.<lb/>
Johnson. Mr. Fisher told them that the<lb/>
Constitution had been violated in not fill<lb break="no"/>ing up the office. Why did not the late<lb/>
Government fill it up? Three or four<lb/>
months elapsed between the death of Mr.<lb/>
         
            <cb/>
           
         
Partelow and their resignation. The<lb/>
reason was, that so many of them wanted<lb/>
it that they could not agree, and they<lb/>
concluded not to fill it until after the elec<lb break="no"/>tion. He thought, if they could not<lb/>
agree to give it to one of their own num<lb break="no"/>ber, there was more than one gentleman<lb/>
who had given them a generous support<lb/>
for ten years, who would have accepted<lb/>
it and would have discharged its duties<lb/>
well. He would not charge them with<lb/>
having violated the Constitution in not<lb/>
filling it up, but he thought they were<lb/>
unmindful of their old friends. Gratitude<lb/>
in old politicians was a rare commodity.<lb/>
He thought the Opposition would fail to<lb/>
convince either a majority of the House or<lb/>
the public that the Government deserved<lb/>
censure for not appointing an Auditor<lb/>
General, when they knew and understood<lb/>
that the duties of that Department had<lb/>
been done as well, certainly and some<lb/>
persons thought better, than they ever<lb/>
were before, and at an expense some<lb/>
$2000 less than formerly. Mr. Fisher<lb/>
said the Minute of Council was an<lb/>
insult to the Queen. He did not so un<lb break="no"/>derstand it, and he was sure it was not so<lb/>
intended and he was not afraid to allow an<lb/>
intelligent public to pronounce on it. He<lb/>
thought there could not in the history of<lb/>
New Brunswick, be found a memorandum<lb/>
of Council, in answer to any dispatch<lb/>
from the British Government, that was<lb/>
more respectful, and at the same time<lb/>
more determined to maintain the rights<lb/>
which belonged to them under the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution. His hon. friend (Mr. Fisher)<lb/>
thought it a great offence to beg to differ<lb/>
from the Colonial Secretary in a matter<lb/>
which affected out best interests; but he<lb/>
did not think it any offence to the Queen's<lb/>
represenative to call his advisers "thim<lb break="no"/>ble riggers," traitors, hypocrites, &amp;c.<lb/>
Such language to men on this side of the<lb/>
water was considered by him quite right,<lb/>
but to dare to differ from Mr. Caldwell,<lb/>
in the most respectful manner, was a<lb/>
crime of the deepest dye. Such arrant<lb/>
nonsense was unworthy the least consid<lb break="no"/>eration. He was proud of that dispatch.</p>
            <p>Another charge was, that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had not made proper provision for<lb/>
the defence of the country; that the<lb/>
money which was to be expended during<lb/>
the sumer for militia purposes, should<lb/>
have been expended on the frontier be<lb break="no"/>fore now. What would the hon. member<lb/>
have said if the Government had expended<lb/>
$30,000 to $40,000 up to the present<lb/>
time for militia purposes. Had they done<lb/>
so, he thought they would justify have de<lb break="no"/>served censure, for until very recently,<lb/>
the Government was not aware of any<lb/>
danger that would have justified such as<lb/>
expenditure; and he was sure the people,<lb/>
of the frontier Countries, who were most<lb/>
exposed, had not yet been so much alarm<lb break="no"/>ed that they would have justified the<lb/>
large expenditure that would have done<lb/>
no good. He charged the Government<lb/>
with vascillation and hypocrisy, and with<lb/>
having pursued a sinuous course. If<lb/>
there was a man in the world who de<lb break="no"/>served to be styled a crooked disciple, it<lb/>
was Mr. Fisher. Politically, he was<lb/>
known as a dodger. There appeared to <lb/>
be a constitutional predisposition to do<lb/>
everything by a sort of side-winded<lb/>
round-about way. He was really the best<lb/>
illustration of the Irishman's gun, that<lb/>
would shoot round a corner, that he had<lb/>
ever seen. He hastened to a part of his<lb/>
speech on declaration day in York, that<lb/>
such frequent reference had been made to<lb/>
during this Session. At that time he<lb/>

<fw type="num">46</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> 
           
wrote a letter to a friend, a copy of which<lb/>
he read as part of his speech:<unclear n=""/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <unclear reason="illegible">Dominion</unclear> day in Fredericton was<lb/>
               <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> forenoon
               <lb/>
There were <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> more than two hundred<lb/>
and <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> men in the Temperance Hall to<lb/>
listen to Mr. Fisher's speech. Surround<lb break="no"/>ed as he was by a packed audience, for<lb/>
very few of Mr. Pickard's friends were<lb/>
present, he was very bold and very loyal<lb/>
if his own assertions are proof of either.<lb/>
I could not have believed that Mr. Fisher<lb/>
would have indulged in so much self-<lb break="yes"/>
glorification, and personal abuse of others.<lb/>
John Pickard, he said, was a good fellow,<lb/>
and had always supports him until the<lb/>
last election, and he (Mr. Fisher) was<lb/>
sorry he had got into such bad company<lb/>
now. (Mr. Pickard is a young man, but<lb/>
rather too old to be caught by the hollow-<lb break="yes"/>
hearted compliments of Charles Fisher.)<lb/>
He would still continue to be a good<lb/>
fellow, in Mr. Fisher's opinion, was he to<lb/>
spend his money for him, and adopt all<lb/>
his opinions. but Mr. Pickard is a man<lb/>
who thinks for himself, and is known,<lb/>
both by his opponents and supporters, to<lb/>
be an honorable man ; and Mr. Pickard<lb/>
knows, also, that these professional poli<lb break="no"/>ticians are dangerous men, seeking, gen<lb break="no"/>erally, to elevate themselves at the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of the public, and in too many<lb/>
instances, at the sacrifice of truth and<lb/>
honor. <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName> stated that he had<lb/>
been urged by requisitions from all parts<lb/>
of the country to come forward at this<lb/>
election—the people stating, in
their let<lb break="no"/>ters, that they had been deceived at the<lb/>
last election, and that they now wanted a<lb/>
chance to reverse what they had done;<lb/>
and they had now shown most nobly that<lb/>
they were in favor of British institutions <lb/>
and of a great British North American<lb/>
nationality. He repeatedly stated that<lb/>
this election was tested upon the question<lb/>
of Confederation. That, and that alone,<lb/>
was the issue. (If there were any anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederates present, who had voted for<lb/>
him, they must have felt exceedingly an<lb break="no"/>noyed for having been thus shamefully<lb/>
deceived, and must have most heartily<lb/>
despised the man who could practice such<lb/>
deception, and it will no doubt be remem<lb break="no"/>bered by many, should he again appear<lb/>
before them.) He read from the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freeman</hi><lb/>
what he called Anglin the Dictator's<lb/>
challenge to the noblemen at York, which<lb/>
they had accepted, and the result would<lb/>
speak for itself. He had beaten them by<lb/>
a majority of seven hundred (meaning the<lb/>
Catholics) many of the best of whom, he<lb/>
said, had voted for him. He accepted<lb/>
the challenge much as a coward would,<lb/>
who, sheltering himself behind some for<lb break="no"/>tification, would shoot his adversary, and<lb/>
then come forth to boast of his pluck and<lb/>
manliness. He repeatedly called Anglin<lb/>
a traitor, said over and over again that<lb/>
there was not a drop of British blood in<lb/>
his veins, and, as an offset, said that <hi rendition="simple:italic">the<lb/>
blood which coursed through his veins had<lb/>
descended from the true old Loyalists.</hi><lb/>
These sentiments, which were several<lb/>
times repeated, invariably called forth<lb/>
hearty cheers. He was very sever on<lb/>
the Government; said they got into<lb/>
power by practising lies and deception,<lb/>
but that the voice from York had sounded<lb/>
their speedy downfall. (it occurred to<lb/>
me that he knew full well that when the<lb/>
members of the present Government were<lb/>
elected, Mr. Tilley and his colleague<lb/>
were then in power, <hi rendition="simple:italic">they</hi> appealed to the<lb/>
people—the dear people in whom Mr.<lb/>
        
            
            <cb/>
        
 Fisher
has such an abiding confidence<lb/>
and the electors throughout the Province<lb/>
returned the men who compose the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Government to represent them. He<lb/>
(Mr. Fisher) several times said that An<lb break="no"/>glin the traitor was the leading genius of<lb/>
the Government; that he held them in<lb/>
the hollow of his hand, and could rule<lb/>
them as he pleased. but he was most<lb/>
surprised that men like R. D Wilmot<lb/>
and W. H. Odell could be influenced to<lb/>
sign a document, so full of disloyalty to<lb/>
the Queen and British Government, as<lb/>
that Memorandum of Council signed by<lb/>
seven of the Council and sent to Mr.<lb/>
Cardwell. It had been written by Anglin,<lb/>
the traitor, over night, and signed by the<lb/>
rest after dinner. These declarations<lb/>
seemed to please the most part of the au<lb break="no"/>dience very much. It could hardly have<lb/>
occurred to them that Mr. Fisher could<lb/>
not possibly know who wrote it, or when<lb/>
it was signed. Had they thought of this,<lb/>
they would have agreed with me that he<lb/>
was a most unscrupulous man for making<lb/>
such a declaration.</p>
            <p>He talked a great deal of nonsense<lb/>
about Fleming's Report, and the Inter-<lb break="yes"/>
Colonial Road, which was soon to traverse<lb/>
the whole length of the County of York<lb/>
and the Province. It occurred to me,<lb/>
while listening to him, that it would be<lb/>
rather unfortunate for <hi rendition="simple:italic">some politicians</hi><lb/>
should that Road be built, as it could not<lb/>
be so conveniently used for different<lb/>
local canvasses as it could now. The re<lb break="no"/>port is remarkable for accommodating<lb/>
a great number of politicians, who can<lb/>
place the Road just where it will secure<lb/>
the most votes. He strutted with great<lb/>
dignity upon the platform, and complete<lb break="no"/>ly snuffed the audience <hi rendition="simple:italic">with his lip loyalty</hi>,<lb/>
all of which was loudly cheered. He<lb/>
would occasionally give the men of York<lb/>
credit for some loyalty, but reserved<lb/>
much the largest share for himself. His <lb/>
audience did not appear to discover<lb/>
the emptiness of such an exhibition.<lb/>
He was very personal in referring to the<lb/>
Representatives of York, and referred to<lb/>
some of them in a very insulting manner.<lb/>
He hinted something in reference to<lb/>
Judge Allen's going on the bench, which<lb/>
I could not understand; he said the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of York had been neglected by<lb/>
them, and about the time the House<lb/>
closed, Allen, Fraser and Hatheway were<lb/>
engaged in figuring how to sustain a<lb/>
miserable Government, while Billy Need-<lb break="yes"/>
ham was drunk and very boastingly, and<lb/>
I think foolishly, said that he had more<lb/>
stake in the country than the three of<lb/>
them put together, he had not much<lb/>
money, and could not, therefore, spend<lb/>
much in elections. And as to their<lb/>
morality, look at George L. Hatheway<lb/>
and W. H. Needham. Lord help the<lb/>
country if they were the standard; men<lb/>
who had not the least regard for the<lb/>
scared and holy ties of matrimony, noto<lb break="no"/>riously unfaithful to every obligation of<lb/>
that kind; then he went into a great deal<lb/>
of <hi rendition="simple:italic">twaddle</hi> about marriage ties, <hi rendition="simple:italic">sacredness<lb/>
of home</hi>, regard for <hi rendition="simple:italic">religion and virtue</hi>,<lb/>
and recommended his devoted friends to<lb/>
go home peaceably and return to their<lb/>
workshop and their counting-house, and<lb/>
that at the general election, WHICH<lb/>
WOULD COME SOON, he with three others,<lb/>
who he would not name would carry<lb/>
York with an increased majority.</p>
            <p>It was quite apparent in a large part of<lb/>
his speech that he had endeavored to ex<lb break="no"/>cite their prejudices, which every true and<lb/>
good man should seek to allay. He could,<lb/>
in conclusion, with truth had said, I

            <cb/>
        
         have endeavored to deceive the people in<lb/>
reference to the matter of Confederation,<lb/>
both in my card and my speech on Nomi<lb break="no"/>nation Day. I treated that matter so in<lb break="no"/>geniously, that in the event of a defeat, I<lb/>
could have said that Confederation was<lb/>
not the question, but should I be elected,<lb/>
I can claim it a great victory for Confede<lb break="no"/>ration. I have been informed that the<lb/>
questions was put to Mr. Fisher by some<lb/>
anti-Confederate: "Is this to be a test<lb/>
of Confederation?" and he answered them<lb/>
IT IS NOT! With that declaration they<lb/>
voted for him. He could say, I have at<lb break="no"/>tempted to make the electors of York be<lb break="no"/>lieve that the men in power intended to<lb/>
remove the Seat of Government, and in<lb/>
other ways fo great injustice to York<lb/>
County. I know that I have not the least<lb/>
foundation for this in truth, but it answer<lb break="no"/>ed my purpose for the time being, <hi rendition="simple:italic">and I<lb/>
did it</hi>. I know that there has been no<lb/>
effort made to remove the Seat of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment since 1858, when I was a member of<lb/>
the Government with Smith, Tiller, Wat<lb break="no"/>ters, Brown, Johnson and Steves, all of<lb/>
whom were favorable to the removal.<lb/>
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Knowing this</hi>, I remained in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with them UNTIL THEY PUT ME OUT.<lb/>
I know also that there are three mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the present Government at the<lb/>
head of three important public depart<lb break="no"/>ments, with twenty-four hundred dollars a<lb/>
years each, that these gentlemen all reside<lb/>
in York County, having their business,<lb/>
their property, and their interest there,<lb/>
and I know full well that the Government<lb/>
would not under those circumstances, even<lb/>
if they wished, attempt a removal of the<lb/>
Seat of Government. YES, I know this<lb/>
well; but I was untruthful enough to state<lb/>
to the electors of York that there was<lb/>
great danger, and that it was necessary<lb/>
that I should be returned in order to pre<lb break="no"/>vent it. I know very well that nearly<lb/>
every official in the Provincial Offices in<lb/>
Fredericton are fill by the inhabitants<lb/>
of York County. I know that they are<lb/>
all paid from the public Treasury, and<lb/>
that persons in other parts of the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince are just as much entitled to them as<lb/>
the men of York. Yet I endeavored to<lb/>
make the people believe that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was disposed to do injustice to her.<lb/>
I know that the thirty thousand dollars<lb/>
appropriated for Militia purposes, was ex<lb break="no"/>pended in York, which was a great bene<lb break="no"/>fit to the people there. I know that others<lb/>
had to contribute this money, and that we<lb/>
got the benefit of its expenditure; yet I<lb/>
tried to make the people believe that the<lb/>
Government was hostile to her interests.<lb/>
I have charged the members of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment with being tools in the hands of<lb/>
T. W. Anglin, and that they were all a<lb/>
disloyal set together, when I knew that<lb/>
Anglin had no more influence than the<lb/>
other members, as is shown by the differ<lb break="no"/>ence of opinion on Western Extension;<lb/>
yet it answered my dishonest purpose to<lb/>
say that they were all dictated to by him.<lb/>
I said that Anglin wrote the famous Me<lb break="no"/>morandum of Council over night, and<lb/>
that it was signed by six of his colleagues<lb/>
after dinner, when I knew nothing about<lb/>
who wrote it. I have said repeatedly<lb/>
that the Memorandum was full of disloy<lb break="no"/>alty to the Queen and British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment; yet I did not attempt to point out<lb/>
the paragraphs that contained disloyal<lb/>
sentiments. I know that the whole do<lb break="no"/>cument is strictly in accordance with<lb/>
the principles of Responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and claims only the rights which<lb/>
are due to us under the Constitution.<lb/>
I know that <hi rendition="simple:italic">I opposed Downing Street</hi><lb/>

<!-- GL, 2016-11-18, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

            <!--<p>FRIDAY, March 23.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Hon. MR. SMITH called the attention<lb/>
of the House to a communication in the<lb/>
Morning Telegraph, which professed to<lb/>
give a statement of what took place be<lb break="no"/>tween Mr. Tilley and himself. This letter<lb/>
was signed by "A Looker on," and he<lb/>
thought he knew the writer, who was one<lb/>
of the most malicious, unprincipled politi<lb break="no"/>cal partisans in the Province, and was a<lb/>
person who had frequently attempted to<lb/>
injure him. He would state that the<lb/>
statements contained in that letter were<lb/>
utterly untrue, which could be proved by<lb/>
twenty witnesses, and he would be much<lb/>
obliged if that paper would publish this<lb/>
denial of their truth.</p>
            <p>MR. GILBERT called the attention of<lb/>
the Chief Commissioner of the Board of<lb/>
Works to the unsafe condition of the<lb/>
bridge over the Memramcosk River, in<lb/>
the County of Westmorland. He had<lb/>
received a letter stating that the bridge<lb/>
was likely to be carried away by the ice<lb/>
in the spring. If this took place it would<lb/>
cause a great deal of inconvenience.</p>
            <p>HON. MR. HATHEWAY said if his<lb/>
hon. friend would place the letter in his<lb/>
hand, he would refer it to the Supervisors,<lb/>
and if they reported the bridge to be in<lb/>
that state, he would have it repaired.</p>
            <p>The House in Committee then agreed<lb/>
to "A Bill to provide for the settlement<lb/>
and support of the poor in this Province"</p>
            <p>A BILL TO INCORPORATE THE ABERDEEN<lb/>
IRON COMPANY.</p>
            <p>MR. CONNELL in explaining the ob<lb break="no"/>jects of the Bill, said it was<unclear n="">?</unclear> 
               <lb/>
the purpose of getting<unclear n="">?</unclear>
               <lb/>
abroad, and every one would<unclear n="">?</unclear>
               <lb/>
desirability of introducing<unclear n="">?</unclear> the<lb/>
country, to open up the mines and min-<lb break="maybe"/>
erlas, which are extensive, the operations<lb/>
upon which are only now beginning;<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>under the General Act there was some<lb/>
doubt about holding lands, and it was<lb/>
necessary in operations of this kind that<lb/>
the company should hold a great deal of<lb/>
land.</p>
            <p>MR. KERR said that there was no<lb/>
doubt whatever under the General Act<lb/>
but what they had power to hold lands.<lb/>
There were several companies of this<lb/>
kind got up in other parts of the Province<lb/>
with quite as large a capital as that pro-<lb break="maybe"/>
possed in this Bill, and the general law<lb/>
gave each of these corporations all the<lb/>
power they needed for the purchase<lb/>
of lands. Unless some special provisions<lb/>
were required, he did not see the neces<lb break="no"/>sity of this Bill.</p>
            <p>HON. MR. SMITH said the company<lb/>
would have to go abroad to obtain capi<lb break="no"/>tal, and if the parties could show a special<lb/>
Act of incorporation it would, no doubt,<lb/>
facilitate their operations very much.<lb/>
Therefore, if this Bill simply contains the<lb/>
provisions of the General Act, it would<lb/>
be unwise in this Legislature to refuse<lb/>
to pass it.</p>
            <p>Mr. ANGLIN stated that under an<lb/>
Act of this kind, stock could be secured<lb/>
more readily; for at the stock exchange <lb/>
it would be proof that the company had a<lb/>
real existence, although it might be a mere<lb/>
nominal existence, but it was something<lb/>
tangible, and parties could recommend<lb/>
themselves more readily in consequence<lb/>
of it. But he thought it would be ad<lb break="no"/>visable to re-enact the old rule that re<lb break="no"/>quired $30 to be paid on all private Bills<lb/>
that came there, because many other<lb/>
Bills of a like nature would be coming in.</p>
            <p>The Bill was then agreed to. The<lb/>
House then went into Committee on "A<lb/>
Bill to empower the Justices in the sev<lb break="no"/>eral Courts in this Province to act in<lb/>
several cases relating to Parish rates and<lb/>
taxes," which produced a long discussion,<lb/>
after which progress was reported.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S<lb/>
AMENDMENT</p>
            <p>HON. MR. GILLMOR resumed—I re<lb break="no"/>gret I had not finished my remarks last<lb/>
evening, which I would have done had<lb/>
the House remained in session a few<lb/>
minutes longer.</p>
            <p>If any further reasons were necessary</p>
            <p>to justify the personal allusions which I</p>
            <p>have made to my hon. friend from York</p>
            <p>(Mr. Fisher) that the attack which he</p>
            <p>has made upon the Government, I can</p>
            <p>give them. I entered the Temperance</p>
            <p>Hall in Fredericton on declaration day,</p>
            <p>a comparative stranger to most of the</p>
            <p>audience, and my friend, not satisfied with<lb/>
attacking the Government, referred to me</p>

            <p>"There is the Provincial Secretary; An-</p>

            <p>kept quiet upon this point until I could</p>
            <p>meet him face to face in this Assembly.<lb/>
To be attacked in that manner before an<lb/>

quite enough to move the indignation of<lb/>

               <unclear n="">A charge against the Government,<lb/>
which I did not notice yesterday, in their<lb/>
               </unclear>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <lb/>
            <p> neglect in not renewing the Export Duty<lb/>
Law." The Chief Commissioner of Pub-<lb break="maybe"/>
lia Works has acknowledged that the<lb/>
Government have been guilty of that<lb/>
omission, and none of us will deny that<lb/>
the present Government are responsible<lb/>
for it. It has given me a great deal of<lb/>
anxiety. I am personally responsible, as<lb/>
well as all my colleagues, but notwith<lb break="no"/>standing the omission, the evil has been<lb/>
entirely remedied, and not one cent<lb/>
has been lost to the people of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. (A member,—You need not
thank<lb/>
the Government for that.) Such is the<lb/>
result. Who should we thank? The<lb/>
Government are responsible for the man<lb break="no"/>agement of public affairs, and cannot<lb/>
shrink from it if they would, but must<lb/>
bear the blame of the omission. It is<lb/>
not an evidence of inability, but is an<lb/>
oversight that might have occurred in any<lb/>
Government, and in extenuation of it, I<lb/>
will not even urge the circumstances un<lb break="no"/>der which the Government was formed,<lb/>
and when the country knows that no<lb/>
harm has resulted from it, I am sure that<lb/>
a generous public will not condemn us<lb/>
on that charge.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>I was a little surprised at the remarks<lb/>
made by the late Surveyor General. One<lb/>
reason he gave for opposing the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, was that the interests of the North<lb/>
had been neglected in the formation of<lb/>
the Government, and I thought it un<lb break="no"/>generous in him to make such an allu<lb break="no"/>sion as he did to the Hon. Mr. Hutchi-<lb break="maybe"/>
son ; from my short acquaintance with<lb/>
him, I believe him quite competent and<lb/>
quite ready to protect the northern in<lb break="no"/>terests, and, although comparisons are<lb/>
odious, I think he will compare favorably<lb/>
with that hon. gentleman, morally, intel<lb break="no"/>lectually, or as a business man, or with<lb/>
any man on the floor of the House. I<lb/>
consider him a man of prudence, ability<lb/>
and sterling integrity. The hon. member<lb/>
(Mr. McMillan) may be opposed to him<lb/>
politically, but that is no reason he should<lb/>
charge him with incapacity. (Mr. McCle-<lb break="maybe"/>
lan—In the absence of my friend
(Mr.<lb/>
McMillan) I will say I understood him to<lb/>
refer to his want of political experience,<lb/>
and not his want of ability.) I under<lb break="no"/>stood him to say both, and I do not think<lb/>
it fair to decry a man thus in his absence.<lb/>
If the interests of the North suffer, it<lb/>
will not be for want of capacity in Mr.<lb/>
Hutchison.</p>
            <p>I should be glad indeed, if the North<lb break="no"/>ern interests could be more largely re<lb break="no"/>presented at the Council Board, but the<lb/>
great question decided at the last General<lb/>
Election precluded them from taking in<lb break="no"/>to the Executive Council those who<lb/>
entertained different opinions upon that<lb/>
question, although it would have been<lb/>
very gratifying to my colleagues and my<lb break="no"/>self if it could have been done. (Hon.<lb/>
Mr Hatheway—My hon. friend on my<lb/>
left says there were two members from<lb/>
the County of Gloucester who were anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederates. Does he not know that<lb/>
there was a scrutiny going on, and while<lb/>
that was pending they could not become<lb/>
members of the Government.)</p>
