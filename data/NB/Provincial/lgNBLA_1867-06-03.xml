<!-- GL, 2018-06-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

            <!--<p>
       Mr. WETMORE remarked that this 
     <lb/>
     question concerning replevin  was well 
     <lb/>
     worthy of their consideration ; there<lb break="no"/>fore he would move that progress be 
     <lb/>
     reported and leave asked to sit again.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      Progress was  then reported and leave 
     <lb/>granted.<lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>AMENDMENTS.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     His Hon.  the SPEAKER called the 
     <lb/>
     attention of the House to the fact that 
     <lb/>
     there was a rule distinctly laid down 
     <lb/>
     in regard to amendments,  which had 
     <lb/>
     been violated in the two last amend<lb break="no"/>ments moved to the second section of 
     <lb/>
     the County Court Bill. An amendment 
     <lb/>
     was moved to the latter clause in the 
     <lb/>
     section which provided that a clerk 
     <lb/>
     should be appointed who should hold 
     <lb/>
     his office during pleasure. A division 
     <lb/>
     took place upon this amendment and it 
     <lb/>
     was lost. After this, another amend<lb break="no"/>ment was moved by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     from Northumberland (Mr. Kerr) on a 
     <lb/>
     previous part of that section. This was 
     <lb/>
     not according to parliamentary prac<lb break="no"/>tice. He then read an extract from 
     <lb/>
      May's Parliamenhary Practice to prove 
     <lb/>
     that when amendment was made to a 
     <lb/>
     clause in a section, and a division taken 
     <lb/>
     upon it, they could not go back and 
     <lb/>
     move an amendment to a previous 
     <lb/>
     clause in the section.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      Mr. JOHNSON said if they were to be 
     <lb/>
      governed by the rules in the House of 
     <lb/>
     Commons they would have to take the 
     <lb/>
      question upon the principle of the Bill 
     <lb/>
     before it was committed at all. We had 
     <lb/>
     a rule in our own Province which we 
     <lb/>
     should be  governed by, and that rule was 
     <lb/>
     our own customs. It had been cus<lb break="no"/>tomary to take up amendments one after 
     <lb/>
     another in any section of Bill that mem<lb break="no"/>bers chose to move them. The  rule in 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons and in Canada  
     <lb/>
     and Nova Scotia was always to take the 
     <lb/>
     question whether they would sustain the  
     <lb/>
     Bill or not upon the second reading, but 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick we read the Bill a 
     <lb/>
     second Â  time and then  go into Committee 
     <lb/>
     and read it section by section. We have 
     <lb/>
     always been governed by our own rules, 
     <lb/>
     and it has always been a rule in this 
     <lb/>
     House for members to move any number 
     <lb/>
     of  amendments to any section or any  
     <lb/>
     clause of a section they thought proper. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>POLLING PLACE.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Hon. Mr. CONNELL</persName> moved the House 
     <lb/>
     into  Committee to take into consideration 
     <lb/>
     a Bill to establish an additional Polling  
     <lb/>
     Place in the County of Carleton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Dr. DOW in the Chair. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      Mr. JOHNSON  asked what the effect 
     <lb/>
     of this Bill would be upon the elections to 
     <lb/>
     be held for  Ottawa ? The elections are 
     <lb/>
     to be held under the law as it now stands, 
     <lb/>
     and the law   fixes certain Polling Places.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     If they  established a new  Polling Place, 
     <lb/>
     and votes were  given there, would it not 
     <lb/>
      affect the seat of the member who was 
     <lb/>
     returned for that County ?   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Hon. Mr. CONNELL</persName>.âThis  Bill is 
     <lb/>
     very  necessary to the inhabitants of the 
     <lb/>
     district, and to avoid the difficulty men<lb break="no"/>tioned by my  hon. friend I shall add to it 
     <lb/>
     a provision that the Bill shall not take 
     <lb/>
     effect until after the first of January. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Bill was then agreed to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Hon. Mr. CONNELL</persName>  brought in a Bill 
     <lb/>
     to amend an Act  to incorporate the 
     <lb/>
     Woodstock Railway Company. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     On motion of Hon.  Mr. McADAM,  
     <lb/>
     the House in Committee agreed  to a Bill 
     <lb/>
     to authorize the erection of a Sorting 
     <lb/>
     Boom on Eel River, in the Counties of 
     <lb/>
    York and Carleton. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Mr. SUTTON brought in a Bill to in<lb break="no"/>corporate the Grand Loyal Ribbon So<lb break="no"/>ciety in New Brunswick. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr.  YOUNG asked the Chief Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner of the Board of Works whether it 
     <lb/>
     was the intention of the Government to 
     <lb/>
     pay the claim of John Lagere, late Super<lb break="no"/>visor, for expenditure on the Roads. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. McCLELAN said there was 
     <lb/>
     a Petition before the Board of Works,  
     <lb/>
      asking that the claim be paid, but part of 
     <lb/>
     the expenditure for  which this claim was 
     <lb/>
     made was not authorized by the Board of 
     <lb/>
     Works, and was unjustifiable in equity. 
     <lb/>
     He had not had time to consider the 
     <lb/>
     matter, and nothing had been decided 
     <lb/>
     upon in regard to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. YOUNG asked the Commissioner 
     <lb/>
     whether he would submit the papers upon 
     <lb/>
     the subject without an address ? 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. McCLELAN replied that the 
     <lb/>
     papers would be furnished. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr.  SMITH</persName> said he saw in the news<lb break="no"/>papers that an  official list of Senators had 
     <lb/>
     been published in Canada, and he would 
     <lb/>
    ask the Government whether they still 
     <lb/>persisted in  concealing and keeping back 
     <lb/> from the people the names of the Senators 
     <lb/>appointed, or the names of the Senators 
     <lb/> they recommended to be appointed.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     Hon. Mr.  FISHER said it was not in 
     <lb/>
     his power to give any more information 
     <lb/>
     than he did before. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     0n motion of Mr. STEVENS, the 
     <lb/>
     House went into Committee an a Bill to 
     <lb/>
     provide for the more effectual repair of 
     <lb/>
    Streets,  Bridges and Sidewalks in the 
     <lb/>Lower  Highway District, in the Parish of 
     <lb/>St. Stephen. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The Blll was  agreed to. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Messrs. Smith, Kerr, W. P. Flewelling, Â  
     <lb/>
     Wetmore and  Fisher were appointed a 
     <lb/>
     Committee to confer with a Committee of  
     <lb/>the Legislative Council, in regard to the<lb/>
    proposed address to   Her  Majesty the 
     <lb/>Queen on the subject of Trade between  
     <lb/>this Province  and the United States of 
     <lb/>America. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The House then adjourned until Mon<lb break="no"/>day morning, at 10 o' clock.

cil, if elected or appointed to a seat at<lb/>Ottawa, shall vacate his seat in the Lo<lb break="no"/>cal Legislature. An Act of this nature<lb/>has been passed in Nova Scotia, and it<lb/>is of some importance that it should<lb/>also pass here. As to our power to<lb/>legislate on matters of this kind, I think<lb/>it is clearly given to us in section 129 of<lb/>the Imperial Act, where it is said that<lb/>all powers and authorities which we<lb/>hold at the time of Union, except as<lb/>otherwise provided by the Act, shall<lb/>remain and continue in force as if the<lb/>Act had not been made, showing clear<lb break="no"/>ly that we have the power to amend our<lb/>constitution if we see fit. The passing<lb/>of this Bill is called for, as an act of<lb/>duty to those who may be left here<lb/>when the Union is consummated, and<lb/>may have left this House to represent<lb/>the people at Ottawa ; for there are<lb/>many persons in the country who will<lb/>readily come forward and here be<lb/>schooled for higher positions in the Do<lb break="no"/>minion, who, if dual representation<lb/>was permitted, would be entirely shut<lb/>out from political life. This is the idea<lb/>of the Bill, and I believe it commends<lb/>itself to the minds of every honorable<lb/>member in this House.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.âI am not at all opposed<lb/>to the principle laid down in this Bill,<lb/>but I should like to see the Attorney<lb/>General in his place, for I want to ask<lb/>him a few questions. It is said that he<lb/>is one of those who are perfectly willing<lb/>to represent the people at Ottawa, and<lb/>at the same time hold on to a seat in<lb/>this House, especially if Â£600 is attach<lb break="no"/>ed to it. This idea, I believe, he put<lb/>forth publicly here in Fredericton, and<lb/>it is said there are others who are quite<lb/>willing to do the same thing. In Ca<lb break="no"/>nada they have taken no steps to pre<lb break="no"/>vent dual representation ; indeed I see<lb/>that the leading minds in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment there seem to foster the idea of<lb/>holding seats in both Houses. I should<lb/>certainly like to know the sentiments<lb/>of the members of the Government on<lb/>the question, as to whether we can leg<lb break="no"/>islate in this matter. We are now pur<lb break="no"/>suing a novel course. Here we have a<lb/>man, who is said to be a Senator of the<lb/>Dominion of Canada, whose name is in<lb/>the Proclamation, yet he is still holding<lb/>his seat here, is a member of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment and Chief Commissioner of<lb/>Public Works. I don't see how the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment can reconcile that to the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of the Act. The names of the<lb/>Senators for Canada are given and pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the papers, but here we can<lb/>get no information whatever. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment are as reticent as ever, and<lb/>won't tell us anything that is going on.<lb/>To judge by their actions they don't<lb/>know what they are going to do at all.<lb/>The Attorney General told us he was<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     going to introduce a Bill for a change 
     <lb/>in the Magistrates' Courts. He went<lb/>to the expense of getting the Bill print<lb break="no"/>ed, and it has been sent to the people,<lb/>but all at once we are told that it is not<lb/>going to be brought in. This is a most<lb/>extraordinary course to pursue ; I never<lb/>heard the like of it before. But it seems<lb/>that all who are connected with this<lb/>question of Union are determined to<lb/>mystify and keep the people in sus<lb break="no"/>pense. I see now that Mr. D'Arcy<lb/>McGee has put forth, here just before<lb/>the Union is consummated, that after<lb/>all Confederation is not quite the thing,<lb/>and that shortly we must inevitably<lb/>settle down into a Legislative Union.<lb/>We are hardly entered into one Union<lb/>before these men want to pull down the<lb/>structure they have raised, and erect<lb/>another. He says also, that every man<lb/>must be called out to drill, and thus<lb/>every man is to be made a soldier, as is<lb/>done in Prussia, where every man,<lb/>prince and peasant alike, has to serve<lb/>two or three years at military practice.<lb/>I regard the present as perilous times<lb/>for our people, the clouds of trouble<lb/>seem gathering very thick about us, but<lb/>I hope that some thing will yet occur to<lb/>prevent the impending evils. As to this<lb/>measure I think the delegates should<lb/>have provided for it in the Imperial Act,<lb/>but it seems as though they had made<lb/>up their minds to hold on to their offices<lb/>here and go to Ottawa as well, if they<lb/>could get the chance. The people, how<lb break="no"/>ever, have shown their opposition to<lb/>such a course, and so at the last the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment make up their mind to provide<lb/>against it. I think the measure is a good<lb/>one, and therefore I shall give it my<lb/>support.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOHN1">Mr. JOHNSON</persName>. As one of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates I could not have agreed to make<lb/>any provision like this binding by Im<lb break="no"/>perial Statute. The delegates had no<lb/>power to lay down what course should<lb/>be pursued, for it was a privilege of the<lb/>people to say whether their representa<lb break="no"/>tives should be allowed to hold a seat in<lb/>the General as well as the Local Legis<lb break="no"/>lature. But whilst I could not agree to<lb/>have it laid down in the Act, yet I had<lb/>very decided feelings as to the require<lb break="no"/>ment of such an Act as this ; for there<lb/>may arise an occasion when the Local<lb/>and General Parliaments are in conflict,<lb/>and to have the twelve or fifteen men<lb/>who represent the Province at Ottawa to<lb/>come back and take their seat here,<lb/>might prove disastrous to the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of the country. I have felt all<lb/>along that it would be putting a power<lb/>into their hands which they should not<lb/>possess. To avoid any such difficulties<lb/>this Bill has been introduced, and I am<lb/>sure that it will meet with the approba<lb break="no"/>tion of the people.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>.âIt is a great pity<lb/>that my hon. friend from Westmorland<lb/>
         

            <cb/>
        
should be so much affected by what Mr.<lb/>McGee may think or say, but I am under<lb/>the impression that he might be much<lb/>more so if he would take to heart the<lb/>language used by a candidate on the<lb/>other side in Nova Scotia, who, if report<lb/>is true, has given vent to his feelings by<lb/>the use of language which is to be de<lb break="no"/>precated by every loyal subject in Bri<lb break="no"/>tish America. I do not think, however,<lb/>that in this House we should be guided<lb/>by what Mr. McGee or Mr. Howe may<lb/>say in their private capacity. When myÂ <lb/>hon. friend gets to Ottawa, for they say<lb/>he is sure to go there, if Mr. McGee<lb/>brings up a measure to make the people<lb/>of the Dominion spend a certain time<lb/>every year in military drill, he can then<lb/>stand up and oppose it ; but it is not ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to bring the matter in here. The<lb/>fact is, Mr. McGee has an idea that the<lb/>militia of the Confederation should be<lb/>made more efficient, and the same idea has<lb/>been expressed by the Administrator of<lb/>the Government here. But there was a<lb/>time, Mr. Chairman, when the people of<lb/>this Province had to turn out and drill<lb/>for three or four days every year. It<lb/>may have proved a hardship for them to<lb/>do it sometimes, but I greatly mistake<lb/>the feelings of our people if they would<lb/>not be willing to do it again to put<lb/>themselves in a position to defend their<lb/>firesides from the attack of an invader.<lb/>But my hon. friend is also very much<lb/>tried too, because Mr. McGee says, that<lb/>we shall ultimately have to come to a<lb/>Legislative Union. But if I mistake not<lb/>my hon. friend made this very thing one<lb/>of the points of his objections to the<lb/>Quebec Scheme, and laid it down as the<lb/>ground of his belief why the Union con<lb break="no"/>templated should not be gone into. And<lb/>as to the question now before us, dual<lb/>representation, as it is called, there is<lb/>an impression generally abroad that the<lb/>hon. member from Westmorland favor<lb break="no"/>ed the idea ; I know it was so believed in<lb/>his own County. Now, I never had but<lb/>one idea on this matter, and that was<lb/>that it was incompatible with the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the country that a man should<lb/>hold seats in both Houses. I believe this<lb/>principle will become general all over<lb/>the Dominion. My hon. friend speaks<lb/>of the withdrawal of a Bill, a draft of<lb/>which was before the House, and which<lb/>the Attorney General had contemplated<lb/>carrying through, as a great crime. Why,<lb/>Mr. Chairman, after consulting with our<lb/>friends on that subject, we found that<lb/>there was no possibility of passing it,<lb/>and so it was withdrawn. I don't see<lb/>anything very dreadful in that. But he<lb/>says the Attorney General must have<lb/>changed his ideas very much if he is<lb/>willing the present Bill should pass. The<lb/>Attorney General is not present, and<lb/>therefore he cannot answer as to his<lb/>ideas on this question, but I think I re<lb break="no"/>member a very important occasion on<lb/>which the opinions of my hon. friend<lb/>were said to have changed. It was said<lb/>

     that he was not unfavorable to Confed<lb break="no"/>eration under certain provisions, but<lb/>when he came to the House he we di<lb break="no"/>rectly against it. He seems to take every<lb/>opportunity day and night, in the House<lb/>and out of it, to alarm the people as to<lb/>the future prospects of this country,<lb/>which he characterizes as dark and<lb/>gloomy and perilous, and all that. It is<lb/>true the state of trade is dull at present,<lb/>but we looking to the Union to aid<lb/>in a material degree, in relieving the dis<lb break="no"/>tress which at present is felt in certain<lb/>quarters, and there is no necessity at all<lb/>to picture out the future as all darkness<lb/>and ruin. As to the Senators. It seems<lb/>that a paper in Canada has a reppresenta<lb break="no"/>tive in regard who has telegraphed<lb/>out the names as contained in the pro<lb break="no"/>clamation, so far as regards Canada ;<lb/>but we have not incurred that expense<lb/>and therefore are not yet in a position<lb/>to make known who have been appoint<lb break="no"/>ed. As to the Chief Commissioner of<lb/>the Board of Works being able, under<lb/>the Act, to hold his seat, it is my private<lb/>opinion that there is nothing to prevent<lb/>his doing so till the first of July, the day<lb/>on which the Union will be consummat<lb break="no"/>ed ; yes, Mr. Chairman, that he can do<lb/>so just as legally as the hon. member<lb/>for Westmorland, whose name, I may tell<lb/>him, is not in the Proclamation.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.âNo, it is not in the 
     <lb/>Proclamation, for the Secretary is well<lb/>
     aware that I would take no favors at their 
     <lb/>hands, and if they had asked me to have<lb/>it put on, I should not have allowed it.<lb/>The Secretary says that I changed my<lb/>opinion on Confederation ; but, Mr.<lb/>Chairman, I have answered that charge<lb/>over and over again. He knows very<lb/>well that the paragraph in the Speech<lb/>was put there by the Governor, who said<lb/>the Government were not responsible for<lb/>it, but he expressed the sentiments which<lb/>he was authorised to do by instructions<lb/>from the Mother Country. But why<lb/>should he refer to this? He knows the<lb/>backstair influence which was used to<lb/>get that inserted, and that it reflects no<lb/>credit on the parties engaged in it. He says<lb/>I changed my opinion. I deny it.<lb/>But he went to England an anti-confed<lb break="no"/>erate, and returned a Confederate.

They worked<lb/>with Governor Gordon in the tyrnnical<lb/>course he pursued towards the people of<lb/>this country, but I should like to know<lb/>the opinion on the Government on Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor Gordon now. I am willing to go<lb/>back to the people on the question then<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     at issue, and leave the verdict with them. 
     <lb/>
     The Secretary talks about the great 
     <lb/>
     benefits which Union ere going to confer 
     <lb/>
     upon us, end of the good times that are 
     <lb/>
     coming. I hope the result will be as 
     <lb/>
     satisfactory as he depicts, but I say the 
     <lb/>
     signs of the time indicate that troublous 
     <lb/>
     times are coming. I am surprised that  
     <lb/>he should treat with the levity the opinions<lb/>of such a man as D'Arcy McGee, who he<lb/>knows speaks the opinions of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of which he is a member ; and he<lb/>says that a Legislative Union is inevi<lb break="no"/>table, and that very shortly. The Secre<lb break="no"/>tary says I was in favor of a Legislative<lb/>Union, but I never was. I was always<lb/>of the opinion that no Union with Canada<lb/>could be obtained that would be fair and<lb/>equitable for us. Here we are now on<lb/>the very verge of Union, and we are to<lb/>pay $50,000 for Governor General, and<lb/>other expenses of Government greater<lb/>than is required to carry on the affairs of<lb/>the United States. The Secretary has<lb/>referred to Joe Howe, but does not tell us<lb/>what is so very objectionable that he has<lb/>said. He is one of the most eminent<lb/>men in British North America, and his<lb/>voice will be resound in the Halls of Ottawa<lb/>âthey can't keep him outâand a large<lb/>member of his friends will be with him.<lb/>He has ever been loyal to the British<lb/>Crownânone more so. His speeches<lb/>have ever breathed a spirit of loyalty and<lb/>devotion, and what does the Secretary<lb/>mean? As to Nova Scotia we shall soon<lb/>see how many of the men who have be<lb break="no"/>trayed their country can be returned by<lb/>the people. Yes, I believe the people<lb/>will rise in their might and show who it<lb/>is that have the power. Never were a<lb/>people so betrayed and trampled on in<lb/>this history of the world as have been the<lb/>people of Nova Scotia. The Secretary<lb/>says that day and night, in the House and<lb/>out, I take every opportunity of opposing<lb/>Union. How does he know? has he<lb/>pimps about me at night? I don't know,<lb/>but it seems that everything I do and say<lb/>becomes known to the Secretary. He<lb/>says that I was in favor of dual repre<lb break="no"/>sentation ; what I said was that I had<lb/>not seen the Act, but that the members<lb/>of Government in Canada was urging<lb/>it strongly on their friends, and I sup<lb break="no"/>posed the practice would be uniform in<lb/>all the Provinces. As to Mr. Howe, no<lb/>one ever heard or saw anything in him<lb/>approaching disloyalty, but the Secretary<lb/>knows that when the question of loyalty<lb/>is touched upon, a throb of excitement<lb/>and feeling is felt by the people, and<lb/>they are all ready to go in and show it<lb/>at all risks. But Mr. Howe is now a<lb/>private gentleman, without official capa<lb break="no"/>city at all, and should not be named. It<lb/>is very different with Mr. McGee. He is<lb/>a public officer, high in the confidence<lb/>of the Government, and as such when he<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          

     speaks he speaks the language and feel 
     <lb/>ings and sentiments of the Government.<lb/>The Secretary says that all he asks for is<lb/>that the militia should be put in a more<lb/>efficient state, but is not so. His idea<lb/>is to organize a standing army, and keep<lb/>it up by the services of the able bodied<lb/>strength of the community. The Secre<lb break="no"/>tary refers to the three or four days for<lb break="no"/>merly spent in drilling our people, and<lb/>says they would be willing to do it again.<lb/>But we all know that those occasions of<lb/>muster produced nothing but vice and<lb/>immortality ; ad I would ask are we to go<lb/>back to such times? Is history to repeat<lb/>itself? That old practice was a burden<lb/>on the people, they rejoiced when they<lb/>were relived from it, and have no desire<lb/>to have it imposed upon them again.<lb/>The Secretary says there is no cause for<lb/>alarm. That is a very different cry than<lb/>was raised when the Fenians were on<lb/>the border. It was said they came down<lb/>in the interest of the Antis, and declare I<lb/>themselves their friends, when they, by<lb/>that very statement, cut our throats, and<lb/>Â 
     played a very important part generally 
     <lb/>
     in the election contest. He says that l 
     <lb/>
     oppose whatever comes up, but I think I 
     <lb/>
     have shown a great deal of forbearance 
     <lb/>
     all through the Session. I have tried to 
     <lb/>
     get information upon certain points, but 
     <lb/>
     the Government seem afraid to let the 
     <lb/>
     public know anything at all. And sec 
     <lb/>
     the cowardice and pusilanimity they dis<lb break="no"/>played in withdrawing a Bill which they 
     <lb/>
     had put before the House and country. 
     <lb/>
     The Attorney General said he was going 
     <lb/>
     to press the Bill, but he has told an un<lb break="no"/>truthâIt has been wthdrawn. And what 
     <lb/>
     have the Government been doing ? I 
     <lb/>
     hnow some of them have been enjoying 
     <lb/>
     themselvey pretty well ; but where is the 
     <lb/>
     Report of the Chief Commissioner of the 
     <lb/>
     Board of Works ? Where is the Post<lb break="no"/>master General's Report? Where is the 
     <lb/>
     Report of the Surveyor General? All 
     <lb/>
     the accounts are closed down to the 31st 
     <lb/>
     October, and one would suppose they hed 
     <lb/>
     plenty of time to make them up by the 
     <lb/>
     time the House meets ; but here the Ses<lb break="no"/>sion is well advanced, and scarcely any 
     <lb/>
     of the Government Reports before us. 
     <lb/>
     Some of them have been away in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and it is said they met with a very 
     <lb/>
     hearty reception, but where have the rest 
     <lb/>
     been? I came up here once, and there 
     <lb/>
     was not a single member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to be found. Mr. Fulton was the 
     <lb/>
     governing power then. As to this Bill. 
     <lb/>
     as I said before, I think it will prove 
     <lb/>
     beneficial, but if, in speaking upon this  
     <lb/>
     or any other question, I see fit to touch 
     <lb/>
     upon other matters aiiecting the general

posed it would have done, but as I have<lb/>no past difficulties to complain of, and no<lb/>evils to redress, I shall confine the few<lb/>remarks I make to the question before<lb/>us. These are, I think, many strong<lb/>reasons why this Bill should pass. It is<lb/>probable that the Houses both here and<lb/>at Ottawa will meet in the winter, and<lb/>hence if a member held a seat in both he<lb/>would have to leave one or the other va<lb break="no"/>cant, and we may be very sure it would<lb/>not be the one at Ottawa. Then it is<lb/>probable that many questions will arise,<lb/>in which the General and Local Legisla<lb break="no"/>tures will not agree. No doubt laws<lb/>will be passed here which will go to Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa and be there discussed, and these<lb/>men who were in the minority here<lb/>might there be able to wield an influence<lb/>suficient to have it repealed. It is evi<lb break="no"/>dent that a man cannot faithfully serve<lb/>two masters or two interests, and there<lb break="no"/>fore he should not be placed in the awk<lb break="no"/>ward position of being compelled to<lb/>sacrifice the interest of either of his constit<lb break="no"/>uencies. I think the rule should also be<lb/>carried out in Canada, and it is probable<lb/>that it will be ; but even though it should<lb/>not be, we shall not suffer by it. Neither<lb/>do I think that because it was not put in<lb/>the Act of Union any reflection should be<lb/>cast on the delegates. They did right I<lb/>think in leaving it to the decision of the<lb/>people by their representatives, and they<lb/>expressed the general feeling of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in doing so. I will say one word asÂ <lb/>to the militia. I am not one of those<lb/>who look upon the old system of training<lb/>for four days as the cause of so much vice<lb/>and immorality. I have seen quite as<lb/>much drunkennessâfor that is the im<lb break="no"/>morality referred toâat our Agricultural<lb/>Exhibitions, at our Crown Land Sales, at<lb/>our Fairs and Races as I ever saw at a<lb/>training ; and to say that we should not<lb/>prepare ourselves for war in times of<lb/>peace, is the same as to say that we should<lb/>not obtain engines till our houses are on<lb/>fire. I do not fear for the future of this<lb/>country. I remember the war of 1812,<lb/>for I was a boy then, and I know the po<lb break="no"/>sition of the United States then was no<lb/>better than ours is now. There were<lb/>troubles all along our borders, but small<lb/>as we were then, I know that their attack<lb break="no"/>ing forces were always driven back, and<lb/>in some cases whole regiments were cap<lb break="no"/>tured, and I have no apprehension that<lb/>we should fall a prey to them, now that<lb/>we are in a so much better position, even<lb/>if they tried to subdue us. I do not be<lb break="no"/>lieve in the Prussian system of taking all<lb/>the available strength of the country and<lb/>converting it to military purposes, but I<lb/>think a plan will be decided on that will<lb/>prove quite effective without being a great<lb/>burden upon the people.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>.âAlthough the<lb/>hon. member for Westmoreland appeared<lb/>
    

            <cb/>
        

     very much alarmed as to the future of 
     <lb/>this country, I thought it was but in ap<lb break="no"/>pearance, and it must now be highly sa<lb break="no"/>tisfactory to the House and country to<lb/>know from his own lips that he does not<lb/>feel that alarm and dread which his words<lb/>would have seemed to imply. As to his<lb/>forbearance this Session in not opposing<lb/>the Government, I thank him for it, but<lb/>with all his forbearance he cannot with<lb break="no"/>hold using very strong language toward<lb/>us. For example, he has called us a<lb/>cowardly Government ; but I know that<lb/>we have not shown ourselves to be so.<lb/>When my hon. friend was in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment with us, I think we fought out the<lb/>question of the Intercolonial Railway,<lb/>and I am sure we did not exhibit any<lb/>such spirit in the question of Union. We<lb/>took our stand and went to the people<lb/>upon it. If cowardice was shown in<lb/>Nova Scotia, I am sure there was none in<lb/>New Brunswick, and I defy him to put<lb/>his hand upon one act of the Government<lb/>which will bear such a title. The only<lb/>case that I know of where there was an<lb/>exhibition of cowardice, was in the case<lb/>I have referred to, when within the last<lb/>fifteen months a Government took a stand<lb/>on the question of Union by submitting<lb/>it in the Speech from the Throne and<lb/>then backed out from it directly they<lb/>came upon the floors of the House. I<lb/>deprecated the introduction of expressions<lb/>of the opinions of Mr. McGee or any one<lb/>else, and my hon. friend says that he<lb/>speaks for his Government ; but how can<lb/>that be the opinions of the Confederate<lb/>Government ? That Mr. Howe, as he<lb/>says, may be in the Legislature at Otta<lb break="no"/>wa, is within the bounds of possibility,<lb/>but that does not affect what he may<lb/>have said in Nova Scotia. It is true, his<lb/>speeches, as reported, have not always<lb/>been acknowledged, and it may be the<lb/>case with Mr. McGee. He may have<lb/>been reported as uttering expressions<lb/>which he may never have used. The<lb/>hon. member says he is not for a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Union, but at the same time he<lb/>acknowledges that he would rather have<lb/>that than a Federal Union. He charges<lb/>the delegates with being away a long<lb/>time and not doing anything. That<lb/>might very well apply to the delegation<lb/>of 1865, but not to that of 1866. He<lb/>does acknowledge that we have got more<lb/>money than we should have had under<lb/>the Quebec Scheme ; well, that's some<lb break="no"/>thing we did. But we did more ; we de<lb break="no"/>cided on resolutions as the basis of Union ;<lb/>we obtained the passage of an Imperial<lb/>Act of Union ; we got the guaranatee for<lb/>the Inter-colonial Railway, and we also<lb/>obtained concessions on the Bill which<lb/>many thought we could not get. I think<lb/>this looks like something more than glori<lb break="no"/>fying ourselves.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.âWhat about the white<lb/>satin breeches ?<lb/>

            <cb/>
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>.â I never saw 
     <lb/>them. I have heard a good deal about<lb/>them, but I have not been fortunate<lb/>enough to see them. My hon. friend is<lb/>mistaken as to the white satin breeches ;<lb/>you know when he was there, although<lb/>he had the honor of an interview, it was<lb/>in morning dress. Well Sir, since the<lb/>matter has been referred to, I may say<lb/>that we went by command of Her Majesty.<lb/>We went once in morning dress and af<lb break="no"/>terward received Her Majesty's command<lb/>to appear in full dress. But, Sir, we did<lb/>not feel that the honor was to us person<lb break="no"/>ally, but to the people of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, and to us as their representatives.<lb/>The hon. member asks if we are to enact<lb/>history over again ? I answer that, in<lb/>some cases, the people of this Province<lb/>are prepared and willing to enact history<lb/>over again. The old arrangement of<lb/>training occupied four days, and then we<lb/>came down to one, and it was not found<lb/>to be as good ; for everybody then said,<lb/>what is the use of drilling a man one day<lb/>in the year ? he does not learn anything.<lb/>I believe the people now are ready to<lb/>move and go into this matter with all<lb/>their heart, and fit themselves for any<lb/>emergency which may arise. There are<lb/>in these Provinces at the present time<lb/>four hundred thousand efficient militia<lb/>men enrolled ; and suppose we could, in<lb/>times of danger, call out but one hundred<lb/>thousand of these, would the knowledge<lb/>that we had at our command such a force<lb/>be sufficient in itself to prevent an ordi<lb break="no"/>nary aggression ? I think the people are<lb/>prepared to do something more than they<lb/>have in this direction, and if any mea<lb break="no"/>sure, with the object of putting the mi<lb break="no"/>litia on a more efficient footing is intro<lb break="no"/>duced, I think it will meet the approba<lb break="no"/>tion of the people. My hon. friend has<lb/>referred to the Fenians, and asks if their<lb/>coming had not some effect on the elec<lb break="no"/>tions ? I think it had, and a most de<lb break="no"/>cided one, for when they came and said<lb/>they were prepared to assist the Antis<lb/>in preventing Confederation, the feeling in<lb/>favor of Union at once became more gen<lb break="no"/>eral, for the people saw that in that alone<lb/>was safety. He talks about the gloomy<lb/>future, but I am not afraid of our pros<lb break="no"/>pects. To-morrow, in order to prepare<lb/>the way for the assimilation of our com<lb break="no"/>mercial relations with those of the other<lb/>Provinces under Union, I shall bring in a<lb/>Bill relating to our fiscal and tariff ar<lb break="no"/>rangements, by which the duties on cer<lb break="no"/>tain articles will be reduced four per<lb/>cent ; but I suppose my hon. friend won't<lb/>support that. I do not doubt, however,<lb/>but that we have full powers to act in<lb/>this matter. He says that the Attorney<lb/>General expressed an opinion in favor of<lb/>dual representation in public. I did not<lb/>hear him, but I saw in the papers that he<lb/>had made some remarks tending that<lb/>

     way. But the hon. member is aggrieved 
     <lb/>
     because it was not put down in the Act 
     <lb/>
     that it would not be permitted. We were 
     <lb/>
     all unanimous on the subject, but had no 
     <lb/>
     power to deal with it, and even if we had 
     <lb/>
     possessed the power, it would not have 
     <lb/>
     been expedient to do so. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>. -It is a novel idea that 
     <lb/>
     the Delegates had not the power. Why, 
     <lb/>
     they were acting as the representatives of 
     <lb/>
     the Home of Commons, and had full 
     <lb/>
     powers to decide on any question affecting 
     <lb/>
     the interests of the Dominion. The 
     <lb/>
     Secretary says he is going to bring in a 
     <lb/>
     Bill to aller the Tariff, and says it can be 
     <lb/>
     done. When I asked him the other day 
     <lb/>
     to take stock in Western Extension he 
     <lb/>
     said it could be done, but I find that it is 
     <lb/>denounced in the other branch, and that<lb/>consequently the Government are not<lb/>going to do it. So they have changed<lb/>their policy on that question, it seems.<lb/>He says that we have four hundred thou<lb break="no"/>sand men enrolled as Militia, but I ask<lb/>him what our revenues are to keep up<lb/>these men in time of war, or how long<lb/>they would last to keep up a standing<lb/>army of one hundred thousand? Our<lb/>people are thoroughly loyal, but I do not<lb/>believe they are willing, at a time when<lb/>things are in such a bad state, with flour<lb/>at $11 or $12 a barrel, and distress pre<lb break="no"/>vailing everywhere, to keep up a large<lb/>body of standing Militia. Now he takes<lb/>credit to himself for what was done in<lb/>England ; but I say if changes were ob<lb break="no"/>tained in the Quebec Scheme, the present<lb/>Government cannot take the credit, for<lb/>they pronounced that scheme faultless.<lb/>I find that some changes have been made<lb/>for the better, but many more for the<lb/>worse. He has now made public the fact<lb/>that the Delegates had two interviews<lb/>with Her Majesty ; I thought there was<lb/>but one. He says it was no honor done<lb/>to him, but to the people. Well, if that<lb/>is the case, I think we ought to see the<lb/>dress in which he appearedâthey say it<lb/>cost Â£60. I saw that while in England<lb/>the Secretary was presented with an ad<lb break="no"/>dress, in which he was lauded to the skies<lb/>for the sacrifices he had made. It gave<lb/>the whole of his political history, and it<lb/>seems strange how they became acquaint<lb break="no"/>ed with it all. The papers state that he<lb/>was so choked with emotion that he could<lb/>scarely reply. I suppose it was all right,<lb/>although I should like to know something<lb/>of the great sacrifices which he has been<lb/>called upon to make.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:JOHN1">Mr. JOHNSON</persName>.â The debate has taken<lb/>a much wider range than I thought it<lb/>would have done, and some remarks<lb/>have been made that I feel called on to<lb/>allude to. Reference has been made to<lb/>Confederation, and a gentleman has been<lb/>named who does not reside in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and if I remained silent it might be<lb/>thought that I concur in what has been<lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         

     said. Mr. Howe has been from my ear<lb break="no"/>liest infancy my tutor. I always have 
     <lb/>
     looked to him as a leader worthy to be 
     <lb/>
     followed, and if now he is attacked, it 
     <lb/>
    must be remembered that it is Howe at<lb break="no"/>tacking Howe. When I first came into 
     <lb/>public life I met Mr. Howe at Stubbs' 
     <lb/>Hotel, in Saint John, and my hon. friend 
     <lb/>who was present will remember the man 
     <lb/>with the high shirt collar. Well, we had 
     <lb/>some conversation,âbut I will not say 
     <lb/>what it was. I will speak of him as a 
     <lb/>Colonist, and when I heard and read what 
     <lb/>he said to the British Government, I 
     <lb/>thought it strange that a men who had 
     <lb/>gone to the United States and had to 
     <lb/>sleep in different beds every night to 
     <lb/>escape detection, I say I thought it strange 
     <lb/>that he should say to the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that we should not go into Union<lb/>lest the United States might take umbrage<lb/>and take measures to annex us. When<lb/>he, as a Colonist, pandered to the men<lb/>who, for the commercial advantages<lb/>which might arise to England from pro<lb break="no"/>longed peace and amity with the United<lb/>States, were willing to prevent our unit<lb break="no"/>ing together, I thought it very strange,<lb/>and I felt that through troubles arose from<lb/>it, and this were the battle ground, the<lb/>people of this Province would boldly and<lb/>bravely stand up for the defence of their<lb/>homes and hearths against the United<lb/>States in such a cause. I do not think<lb/>the United States Government want to<lb/>annex us, but there is a power behind<lb/>them urging them on. Howe said that if<lb/>we were united it might give offence to a<lb/>foreign power, and I felt, as a Colonist,<lb/>that England would consider us wanting<lb/>in that pluck and self-reliance which has<lb/>ever characterized the English race. My<lb/>hon. friend from Westmorland has said<lb/>that it is intended to make us all soldiers,<lb/>and that it will be no better than it is in<lb/>Prussia. But I would ask him if we can<lb/>show me a nation more high in patriotism,<lb/>in position and prosperity than Prussia?<lb/>If the making us all soldiers will make us<lb/>like that country, we need not be afraid<lb/>of it ; I believe in making a man fit to<lb/>fight, even though he may not have to do<lb/>it. On the principle of the Bill my hon.<lb/>friend and I concur, but as reference was<lb/>made to Mr. Howe I thought it best to<lb/>make these remarks. I do not think it is<lb/>judicious to bring him into discussion ;<lb/>but if he is, and is lauded, all we have to<lb/>do is to show what his past life has been<lb/>and what he is now.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>.â The question has<lb/>been asked me, why it is that the hon.<lb/>member for Westmorland takes up so<lb/>much time in denouncing Confederation ?<lb/>Of course, it is expected to have some<lb/>effect. We all know that is the policy of<lb/>the opponents of Union to get as many of<lb/>their number at Ottawa as possible, and<lb/>these speeches now will save a good deal<lb/>
          


    
            <cb/>
        

     of time at the hustings, as they are all<lb/>reported in the papers and Debates. My<lb/>hon. friend asked, What has Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion done thus far? He says the people 
     <lb/>
     are poor and the times are bad. We 
     <lb/>
     have not yet entered into Confederation, 
     <lb/>
     and therefore it cannot be expected to have 
     <lb/>
     done much for us, but thus far even it has 
     <lb/>
     had the effect of giving confidence in the 
     <lb/>
     capabilities and resources of the country 
     <lb/>
     to be developed under Confederation to 
     <lb/>
     persons who would otherwise have left the 
     <lb/>
     country. He says I changed my views, 
     <lb/>
     but he knows that I was willing to get 
     <lb/>
     the very best terms possible, and if we  
     <lb/>
     could not get any changes made then I 
     <lb/>
     was willing to take the basis of the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Scheme And he asks, Who should 
     <lb/>
     take the credit for the changes made? 
     <lb/>
     Well. Mr. Chairman, certainly not those 
     <lb/>
     who have been from the first opposed to 
     <lb/>
     Union on any terms. If my hon. friend 
     <lb/>
     had changed his position, as many others 
     <lb/>
     have done all over the Province, and 
     <lb/>
     which he says he has not done, then he 
     <lb/>
     might have taken some of the credit to 
     <lb/>
     himself, but not now. He says we are all 
     <lb/>
     to be made soldiers, and asks where the 
     <lb/>
     revenues are to come from to support a 
     <lb/>
     standing army? But it is not intended 
     <lb/>
     to call them out and keep them up, but  
     <lb/>
     only to place the Militia upon a good 
     <lb/>
     footing. He says I indulge in a good 
     <lb/>
     deal of self glorification, and referred to 
     <lb/>
     an address which was presented to me by 
     <lb/>
     my Temperance friends, asking how they 
     <lb/>
     got their information. Well, they did not 
     <lb/>
     get it from me. I am not the man who 
     <lb/>
     talks in the House or on the platform of 
     <lb/>
     the personal sacrifices I have made. He 
     <lb/>
     says I was choked with emotion. Well, 
     <lb/>
     I did not know that I was able to do much 
     <lb/>
     that way, but that is a forte possessed 
     <lb/>
     very strongly by my hon. friend. I re<lb break="no"/>member when I was lecturing on Union 
     <lb/>
     in Westmorland some one said to me, 
     <lb/>
     "You should come the pathetic as Smith 
     <lb/>
     does," and hon. members well know that 
     <lb/>
     peculiar tremor in his voice, so fitted to 
     <lb/>
     create an impression on his listeners, 
     <lb/>
     when he feels deeply on any subject. 
     <lb/>
     Seelng that my hon. friend is not free from 
     <lb/>
     this, I may be well pardoned if, on an 
     <lb/>
     occasion like that, I should find a diffi<lb break="no"/>culty of expressing myself, and my 
     <lb/>
     friends may have thought I was more 
     <lb/>
     deeply affected than in reality I was. As 
     <lb/>
     to the expressions of praise I heve re<lb break="no"/>marked that as a general rule our friends 
     <lb/>
     pile it on a little too much one side, while 
     <lb/>
     our enemies do the same thing the other 
     <lb/>
     side. I have to apologize for taking up 
     <lb/>
     so muoh of the time, but it was called for 
     <lb/>
     by the hon. member for Westmorland 
     <lb/>
     travelling out of the record to make Con<lb break="no"/>federation the cause of the distress and 
     <lb/>
     dullness which prevails, when in reality 
     <lb/>
     we are looking forward to Union to 
     <lb/>
     remedy it.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CHAN1">Mr. CHANDLER</persName>. - I see no purpose 
     <lb/>to be gained in prolonging this discus<lb break="no"/>sion. The question of Union has bee<lb/>gone over and over again, and it is well<lb/>picked to the bone. When the Delegates<lb/>went home we thought too many were sent;<lb/>but the work before them was great<lb/>and wanted all the light that could be<lb/>thrown upon it. They have done their<lb/>work and done it well, and the people<lb/>are satisfied. A great deal of ridicule<lb/>has been casto on what was done there;<lb/>but, sir, when our Delegates went home<lb/>we expected them to conform to the man<lb break="no"/>ners of the people and the usages of<lb/>society. Did my hon. friend from West<lb break="no"/>morland expect they were going to eat<lb/>soup with a horn spoon, or burgoo with<lb/>their fingers? - (laughter.) When they<lb/>appeared at Court for presentation to<lb/>Her Majexty they were dressed as very<lb/>body has been since the days of Charles<lb/>I.; and, sir, it must be remembered that<lb/>when franklin went hom as a Delegate<lb/>from the United States he appeared be-<lb break="yes"/>form King George III. in just such a<lb/>costume. I have heard a good deal said<lb/>about the dress and the perturbation of<lb/>feelings exhibited. It is said that one of<lb/>our Delegates got up at three o'clock in<lb/>the morning to wriggle himself into his<lb/>white satin breeches, but I don't believe<lb/>it. However, they accomplished their<lb/>purpose, and I have heard but one expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion upon the result. We now<lb/>look forward to see the lumberman, the<lb/>agriculturist, and every department bene<lb break="no"/>fitted by the Union upon which we are<lb/>about to enter. It is time that many<lb/>young men who have gone away from Char<lb break="no"/>lotte because ther was no work of a<lb/>remunerative character to do, but I know<lb/>that many of them hold themselves in<lb/>readiness to come back directly the coun<lb break="no"/>try shows signs of being able to give<lb/>them a comfortable means of support.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>. - The Secretary seems to
     <lb/>like to make fun of men. He quotes from<lb/>private conversations I have had with<lb/>persons, and says my style of speaking is<lb/>pathetic. My voice may not be so clear<lb/>and full - I may not be so finished in my<lb/>style, so eloquent or so great a purist as<lb/>the Secretary; but I think that he beings<lb/>to feel that his glowing descriptions of<lb/>the prosperity we were to enjoy under<lb/>Confederation are not going to be real<lb break="no"/>ised. He says he never talks about the<lb/>sacrifices he has made, and for very good<lb/>reason - I never knew him to make any.<lb/>Ever since he has been in the House he<lb/>has held an office with a salary of Â£600<lb/>a year, and so he never made any<lb/>sacrifices. As to what Mr. McGee said,<lb/>it was not that the Militia were to be put<lb/>upon a good footing, but that we were to<lb/>have a universal armament, and that we<lb/>must have a Legislative Union shortly;<lb/>and I referred to him because he is a<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
       

     public man and a member of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Government. When I spoke of him<lb/>I spoke of a public man whose acts and<lb/>words may be criticised; but when the<lb/>Secretary referred to Mr. Howe he spoke<lb/>of a private man, which was wrong. I<lb/>have not the ability to defend Mr. Howe<lb/>as he should be, but the question on both<lb/>sides has been argued out and is before<lb/>the public. I dare say my remarks are<lb/>are tedious to some hon. members, going<lb/>over the same ground again and again,<lb/>but I am here to represent the country<lb/>and cannot let statements go unchalleng<lb break="no"/>ed, and so shall refer to Confederation<lb/>and the events which occur around us,- <lb/>in Canada, in England, or anywhere else,<lb/>- and shall not ask permission of the<lb/>Secretary, either.<lb/>

            <p>MY LORD.â As Delegates from the<lb/>Provinces of Nova Scotia and New<lb/>Brunswick, appointed to confer with De<lb break="no"/>legates from Canada and with Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government, upon the question of<lb/>a Confederation of the British North<lb/>American Provinces, we are naturally<lb/>anxious to terminate the suspense in<lb/>which we have been left since our arrival<lb/>here, relative to the time when we may<lb/>hope to accomplish the object of our mis<lb break="no"/>sion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"Believing, as we do, that the abroga<lb break="no"/>tion of the Reciprocity Treaty and the<lb/>Fenian invasion of Canada, were largely<lb/>owing to the failure of the Provinces we<lb/>represent to agree promptly to form a<lb/>united Government, as proposed by the<lb/>Quebec Conference in 1864, and approved<lb/>by the Imperial Government, and that<lb/>the adoption of Confederation would be<lb/>the best means of securing the renewal<lb/>of that Treaty and discouraging Fenian<lb/>designs upon British America, the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernments of Nova Scotia and New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick have been most anxious that no time<lb/>should be lost in accomplishing the<lb/>Union of the Provinces.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"With that view, Messrs. Tupper and<lb/>Archibald visited Ottawa on the 29th of<lb/>June last, and after conferring with His<lb/>Excellency the Governor General and<lb/>the Canadian Government, it was mu<lb break="no"/>tually agreed that Delegates from the<lb/>two Lower Provinces should proceed to<lb/>England by the steamer leaving Halifax<lb/>on the 19th July, and that Delegates<lb/>from Canada should follow by the steam<lb break="no"/>er leaving Quebec on the 21st July.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"Subsequently, Lord Monck intimated<lb/>by telegraph that the change of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in England would render it neces<lb break="no"/>sary to hear from England before the de<lb break="no"/>parture of the Delegates. The Delegates<lb/>from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,<lb/>after the arrival of the latter at Halifax,<lb/>jointly communicated to the Canadian<lb/>Government their views as to the neces<lb break="no"/>sity for immediate action, and their in<lb break="no"/>tention to leave on the 19th July, as ar<lb break="no"/>ranged at Ottawa ; and it was only on the<lb/>eve of their departure that the received<lb/>a telegram from the Hon. J. A. McDon<lb break="no"/>ald, saying that Lord Monck declined to<lb/>go to England or to send a Delegation<lb/>until authorised by the new Secretary of<lb/>State. At the interview with which we<lb/>were honored by your Lordship on our<lb/>arrival in London on the 30th July, we<lb/>understood your Lordship to say that<lb/>

     you would send a message by the Atlan<lb break="no"/>tic Cable to the Governor General, ask<lb break="no"/>ing if the Canadian Delegates had late,<lb/>and if not, requesting that they would<lb/>come without delay. Your Lordship sub<lb break="no"/>sequently did us the honor to inform us<lb/>that a despatch had been sent on the 11th<lb/>August, requesting the Governor General<lb/>to arrange for the Canadian Delegates<lb/>to proceed to England as soon as possible,<lb/>and expressing the hope that in any case<lb/>they would not be later than the latter<lb/>part of September.<lb/>

 description, Her Majesty's Government<lb/>
 agreed to ask Parliament for a guarantee<lb/>
 of Three Millions Sterling, to build the<lb/>
 Inter-Colonial Railway.  
</p>
    <p>
     Considerable difficulty arose with re<lb break="no"/>gard to the investment of the Sinking<lb/>
     Fund, and the legislation required by<lb/>
     Canada previous to the attaching of the<lb/>
     guarantee. The Treasury Department<lb/>
     required that Canada should provide by<lb/>
     special law for raising the necessary<lb/>
     Revenue to defray the Interest on the<lb/>
     Loan before any guarantee should be<lb/>
     made, and that the Sinking Fund should<lb/>
     be invested in British funds. After a<lb/>
     series of interviews they were induced<lb/>
     to abandon their first condition as to<lb/>
     proof of the Revenue required to meet<lb/>
     the Loan, and also to agree to the pro<lb break="no"/>posal of the Delegates, that the Sinking<lb/>
   

   <cb/>


     Fund should be invested in Colonial or<lb/>
     other Securities at the option of Canada.<lb/>

     the patient manner in which he discus<lb break="no"/>sed the different questions that were<lb/>
     raised during the progress of our deliber<lb break="no"/>ations, and for his energy and persever-<lb/>
     ance in carrying the Act of Union through<lb/>
     the House of Lords, and to the Duke of<lb/>
     Buckingham and Chandos for the hearty<lb/>
     manner in which he entered into the<lb/>
     question of guarantee, and for his strenu<lb break="no"/>ous exertions to induce the Treasury<lb/>
     Department to accede to the proposition<lb/>
     we made for securing the money, and<lb/>
     for successfully carrying the Bill for the<lb/>
     guarantee through the House of Lords;<lb/>
  
    
    <cb/>
 

     and to the Right Honorable Mr. Adderley<lb/>
     for the ability he displayed in carrying<lb/>
