<fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw>
            <fw type="num">51</fw>

     
<!-- GL, 2018-02-28, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->   
            <!--<p> elected to oppose
the scheme. Among <lb/>
all their indictments, I cannot see that <lb/>
one has been sustained. I cannot see <lb/>
one reason for turning out the present
<lb/>
Government. It is true, since they came
<lb/>
into power there has been a
continual cry <lb/>
throughout the country that the people <lb/>
had changed their minds about
Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. In the County of King's, if <lb/>
there is any change, it is rather against <lb/>
the scheme. I admit there has been <lb/>
an oversight in not observing that the <lb/>
Export Duty Law was about to
expire. <lb/>
Of that overnight the Government have <lb/>
taken the responsibility and the
difficulty <lb/>
has been remedied without the loss of a <lb/>
single dollar. If they have been guilty <lb/>
of the omission, they might well be ex<lb break="no"/>cused under the circumstances.
There <lb/>
was a continual pressure brought to bear <lb/>
upon them from Canada, England, and <lb/>
the Confederates of this
Province; and <lb/>
the press has been most unscrupulous. <lb/>
The Provincial Secretary has said all I <lb/>
had to say about them, and I agree with <lb/>
every word he said concerning
them. <lb/>
My hon. friend from Carleton (Mr. Lind<lb break="no"/>say) has said the British
Government <lb/>
wished us to enter into Confederation.
<lb/>
I look upon this question as one for the <lb/>
people of New Brunswick to decide. I<lb/>
do not believe we are to be dictated to <lb/>
even by the British Government, and we <lb/>
should not submit to Downing Street <lb/>
dictation. I have heard the hon. mover <lb/>
of the amendment harangue the House in <lb/>
former times, complaining of the
Govern<lb break="no"/>ment being led by Downing Street dic<lb break="no"/>tation. My hon. friend has told us that<lb/>
if we were loyal subjects of Great Britain, <lb/>
we would submit to any thing. (Mr. <lb/>
Lindsay,—I said loyalty
consisted in <lb/>
obedience.) When I speak of the Queen <lb/>
I speak with respect; but those men in <lb/>
office are no more than we are. They <lb/>
may be there to-day and out to-morrow. <lb/>
What does Mr. Cardwell know
about the <lb/>
benefits arising from Confederation? The <lb/>
people have told Mr. Cardwell that they <lb/>
do not want Confederation. but still the <lb/>
scheme is agitated; and we have the for- <lb break="maybe"/>
ty-second member of the House going <lb/>
through the length and breadth of the
<lb/>
land, lecturing the people upon the bene<lb break="no"/>fits of the scheme—a professional poli<lb break="no"/>tician, with nothing to do but to
stir up <lb/>
people's minds about Confederation. He <lb/>
is now on the floors of the House,
or the <lb/>
next thing to it. I heard, my hon. friend <lb/>
(Mr. Wetmore) talk about the stuffing <lb/>
process. I think he is getting
as much <lb/>
stuffing as any other hon. member in <lb/>
this House, and I think my hon. friend <lb/>
from Westmorland is getting stuffed <lb/>
too. </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">MR. WETMORE</persName>.—My
hon. friend re<lb break="no"/>fers to stuffing. I shall be haupy to hear <lb/>
him go on and tell how the Government </p>
            <p>are stuffing him.<lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> MR. SCOVlL.—l will tell him that no <lb/>
Government is stuffing me. I did not <lb/>
come into this House to seek for office.<lb/>
(Mr. Wetmore—They stuff you, and you <lb/>
don't know it.) I have common sense, <lb/>
and I do not allow the Attorney General <lb/>
or the forty-second member to stuff me. <lb/>
Those individuals who are looking up <lb/>
with their mouths open, getting stuffed, <lb/>
will have to disgorge, to explain them<lb break="no"/>selves to their constituency. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> There has
been a great cry raised about
<lb/>
a Minute of Council, signed by the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Government and addressed to <lb/>
Mr. Cardwell, whom the hon. mover of <lb/>
the amendment wishes to bow down
to and<lb/>
worship. I saw this dispatch and thought <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> it a well-written article. I read that
dis<lb break="no"/>patch over to a person who had
told me<lb/>
it was one of the worst documents he<lb/>
ever saw. But before I got through, he <lb/>
said the country ought to be proud that <lb/>
they had seven men, such men in the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, who would honestly express <lb/>
their opinions.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I was always in favor of union, and <lb/>
when the Quebec Scheme came up, I<lb/>
tried, if possible, to agree with it. I<lb/>
sifted it, and came to the conclusion that <lb/>
New Brunswick would be nowhere under <lb/>
that scheme; for under it, I do not be<lb break="no"/>lieve the rights and interests of the people <lb/>
are protected. (Mr. Lindsay,—How,<lb/>
then, can you eulogize the men who said <lb/>
they were opposed to a union of
the <lb/>
Provinces?) I gave them credit for <lb/>
using those strong terms. We do not <lb/>
want any closer union with Canada, un<lb break="no"/>less we see the rights of the people pro<lb break="no"/>tected. (Mr. Wetmore,—Did you
say, <lb/>
during the election, that you were in favor <lb/>
of union?) We had the Quebec Scheme, <lb/>
and we had to allow the whole
of it or <lb/>
reject it. I told the people that
I looked <lb/>
upon a union of the colonies as advan<lb break="no"/>tageous, but I did all I could to satisfy <lb/>
the people that the Quebec Scheme
was <lb/>
not the scheme for New Brunswick; and <lb/>
I should be recreant to my trust if I <lb/>
went against those men who
formed this <lb/>
Government on those principles, for if <lb/>
they were ousted, I have no doubt but it <lb/>
would be an advantage to the scheme. I <lb/>
believe people are apt to change their mind.<lb/>
I have changed my mind in some
things. <lb/>
I was a young politician when I came <lb/>
here, and in the course of my political life <lb/>
in this House, I always condemned <lb/>
a Government for dismissing
good public <lb/>
servants to put others in their
place, but <lb/>
I have got to be almost a smasher on <lb/>
that point. I used to think the
Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would live down such
opposition, <lb/>
but I believe now that when a public offi<lb break="no"/>cer goes out to canvass, and uses his <lb/>
office for a canvassing shop, he should be <lb/>
turned out of his office at once. (Mr. L. <lb/>
P. W. DesBrissy.—I would ask
him how <lb/>
he supports a Government that is unable <lb/>
to turn out even the meanest man holding <lb/>
an office in this Province?) <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> There was then some conversation he- <lb break="yes"/>
tween Mr. Wetmore and Mr. Scovil re<lb break="no"/>garding the appointment in offices, and <lb/>
bribery, after which the debate was then <lb/>
adjurned until 12 o'clock to-morrow. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR.
SCOVlL. by leave, brought in a <lb/>
Bill to change the Constitution of the <lb/>
Legislative Council, after which the <lb/>
House was adjourned until 10 A. M. to<lb break="no"/>morrow <lb/>
T. P. D. <lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:right"> SATURDAY,
MARCH 24.</head>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">MR. BOYD</persName> called
attention to a para<lb break="no"/>graph in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Morning News</hi>—which
he <lb/>
read—reflecting upon his popularity as a <lb/>
militia officer, and asserting
that he had <lb/>
been superseded. So far he said from <lb/>
being the most unpopular officer in the <lb/>
militia; he would take it upon himself to <lb/>
say that there was not a more popular <lb/>
office in the service. Instead of
super<lb break="no"/>seding him, the Government had asked
<lb/>
him if he could conveniently
take com<lb break="no"/>mand of his battalion at this time. He <lb/>
(Mr. Boyd)
had told His Excellency that <lb/>
he could not, and His Excellency then <lb/>
said, if he could not go, he would send<lb/>
another office to take command in his<lb/>
          

            <cb/>

         place. The statements in the News were <lb/>
a parcel of the greatest lies
ever fabrica<lb break="no"/>ted. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> HON MR.
HATHEWAY called the <lb/>
attention of the House to a
statement in <lb/>
an article in the Fredericton <hi rendition="simple:italic">Reporter</hi> in <lb/>
which he (Hon. Mr. Hatheway) was
made
<lb/>
to say that His Excellentcy had entrusted
<lb/>
him with this formation of the
Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. He gave that statement a flat con<lb break="no"/>tradiction. The editor or reporter of that <lb/>
paper in which it appearered, having
sat <lb/>
through the debate, must have known
it <lb/>
to be un'trua What he had said
was that<lb/>
His Excellency had called upon him to<lb/>
form an administration, but he declined.<lb/>
            </p>



            <p> House went into Committee of the<lb/>
Whole on a Bill to amend the act to in<lb break="no"/>corporate
the Albert Railway Company. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> spoke first (but owing to <lb/>
noise in the House we could not catch <lb/>
the exact purport of his observations). <lb/>
He called the attention of the Attorney <lb/>
General to the Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> said the <lb/>
observations of the hon. member of Nor<lb break="no"/>thumberland showed better than any ob<lb break="no"/>servations he could make the effect
of <lb/>
going into Confederation under the <lb/>
Quebec Scheme, with its cardinal prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of representation by population. <lb/>
It was said there was no danger of the <lb/>
Province with its limited representation <lb/>
being swamped. But here at home in the <lb/>
attitude assumed by that hon. member in <lb/>
this Bill, Was an illustration on a small <lb/>
scale of what would happen to
the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince under Confederation. It
had been <lb/>
said that if the Province went into Con<lb break="no"/>federation, that it would not be taxed <lb/>
for the construction of Canals
in
Cana<lb break="no"/>da, for it would have a voice in the mat<lb break="no"/>ter. But how, with an overwhelming <lb/>
Canadian majority, and on questions af<lb break="no"/>fecting Canadian interests, could the re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of the Province protect
it <lb/>
against large expenditures. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Bill under consideration, its <lb/>
object was simply to extend the time <lb/>
given to the Company to construct the <lb/>
railway from two to five years. The Sub<lb break="no"/>sidy Act under which the Company was <lb/>
formed was now the lay of the land; <lb/>
there was no limitation to it. It was no <lb/>
act of grace; therefore to give any Com<lb break="no"/>pany the privileges of the Bill; it was a
le<lb break="no"/>gislative right. He thought the
Com<lb break="no"/>pany ought to have the extension
of time; <lb/>
they were expecting aid from England, <lb/>
and the result would, he anticipated, be <lb/>
the construction of the railway. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR. CONNELL</persName>
had no objection to <lb/>
support the Bill. With reference
to the <lb/>
objections raised by the hon. member of<lb/>
Northumberland (Mr. Kerr), he thought <lb/>
that the people of the North
Shore were <lb/>
much more able to take advantage
of the <lb/>
Subsidy Act, and build a railway in that <lb/>
district, than the people of St. Stephen<lb/>
and Woodstock to construct their bran<lb break="no"/>ches. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:HILL1">MR. HILL</persName> doubted
very much the pol<lb break="no"/>icy of incurring large debts for railways;
<lb/>
he had always thought that railways
<lb/>
should not be built faster than the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the Province required. Though<lb/>
opposed to the principle, yet
now that <lb/>
the Province had adopted the course of<lb/>
construction of railways under
the  Subsi<lb break="no"/>dy Act,
he thought that fair
play to these <lb/>
sections that had not yet taken
advantage<lb/>
of that Act demanded that they should<lb/>
not now go back. He was <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear>

     for the Bill, and to give the North Shore 
     <lb/>
     every facility to build a railway also. 
     <lb/>
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> said it was perfectly out 
     <lb/>of the question to suppose that the pub<lb break="no"/>lic of the North Shore could construct a 
     <lb/>line of railway from Shediac to Mira<lb break="no"/>michi, 186 miles long, under the Sub<lb break="no"/>sidies Act. He had made a calculation 
     <lb/>if the 128 miles of railway, for which 
     <lb/>Acts had been passed, were construct<lb break="no"/>ed under the Subsidy Bill, they would 
     <lb/>involve the Province in a debt of 
     <lb/>$11,400,000, and he did not think that 
     <lb/>that was an amount of debt the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince was prepared to carry. He feared 
     <lb/>if the Province went on and made a 
     <lb/>very large expenditure for railway con<lb break="no"/>struction, it would, in a short time. find 
     <lb/>itself in a tight place. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CUDL1">MR. CUDLIP</persName> went into the history 
     <lb/>
     of the Subsidy Act. It had been intro<lb break="no"/>duced under a very strong pressure, and 
     <lb/>
     he believed now it was only brought in 
     <lb/>
     as a delusion. He supported it because 
     <lb/>
     he was not much in earnest for connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the United States. With re<lb break="no"/>ference to the Bill, he could not see how 
     <lb/>
     they could refuse to pass it, unless the 
     <lb/>
     General Act was repealed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName> said it would be but 
     <lb/>
     right to give the people of Albert this 
     <lb/>
    chance to secure the railway. His 
     <lb/>opinion was, that they had not the 
     <lb/>means to build it, but he would give 
     <lb/>them the chance. He hoped he would 
     <lb/>be mistaken.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> could not see how the 
     <lb/>
     hon. member for Northumberland had 
     <lb/>
     made out his calculation of $11,400,000 
     <lb/>
     as the amount of debt that would be 
     <lb/>
     incurred by the Province for railway 
     <lb/>
     construction under the Act. He (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     L) made it out $1,200,000. He was 
     <lb/>
     perfectly willing to give the company 
     <lb/>
     the extension of time, but thought they 
     <lb/>
     should be obliged either to build the 
     <lb/>
     railway immediately themselves, or 
     <lb/>
     make room for others who would. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BAIL1">MR. BAILEY</persName> had doubted at first if 
     <lb/>
     the Government. would ever be called 
     <lb/>
     upon to subsidize any company under 
     <lb/>
     the Act. But he had seen reason to 
     <lb/>
     change his opinions; and he thought if 
     <lb/>
     the St. Stephen and Woodstock 
     <lb/>
     branches, and, as he hoped. Western 
     <lb/>
     Extension, were built under this Bill, 
     <lb/>
     and if the people of these districts get 
     <lb/>
     the benefit of the Act, he would go for 
     <lb/>
     extending it to Albert and likewise to 
     <lb/>
     the North Shore. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">MR. McMILLAN</persName> could see no rea<lb break="no"/>son why the Bill under consideration 
     <lb/>
     should not pass. and he would certainly 
     <lb/>
     support it. He thought if all the Bills 
     <lb/>
     that had been passed were carried out, 
     <lb/>
     and Western Extension, Eastern Ex<lb break="no"/>tension, and the branches, were secur<lb break="no"/>ed, the country would be greatly bene<lb break="no"/>fitted by the Act passed by the late Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. The present Government 
     <lb/>now took the benefit of that Act, they had 
     <lb/>taken great credit to themselves for the 
     <lb/>contract for Eastern Extension, but that 
     <lb/>contract was founded upon the Subsidy 
     <lb/>Act.<lb/>

     He would like to know if the Bill was

     thought the late Government had con<lb break="no"/>ferred a substantial benefit on the coun<lb break="no"/>try by the passage of that Act. He ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the House if this throwing out

     insinuations and inuendoes against the

     not feel ashamed of the course he had

            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. MR. HATHEWAY</persName>—The hon. 
     <lb/>member of Restigouche knew perfectly 
     <lb/>well the circumstances under which the 
     <lb/>Bill in question was brought in. He 
     <lb/>knew that the late Government, in the 
     <lb/>speech, came down, saying, that they 
     <lb/>did not intend to go on with Railway 
     <lb/>construction. He knew when Canada 
     <lb/>threw up the agreement with regard to 
     <lb/>the Inter-colonial Railway, and all hope 
     <lb/>was given up of that work, that a strong 
     <lb/>pressure was brought to bear upon the 
     <lb/>Government to proceed with Railway<lb/>construction in the Province. The Sub<lb break="no"/>sidy Act, like all other measures, was 
     <lb/>not carried by a majority in council, and 
     <lb/>he (Mr. H.) was in the minority. His 
     <lb/>hon. friend must remember the castiga<lb break="no"/>tion he (Mr. H.) received from Hon. 
     <lb/>Mr. Gray on the floors of this house for 
     <lb/>expressing an opinion while supporting 
     <lb/>the Bill, that not a mile of a Railway 
     <lb/>would be built under it. He would ask 
     <lb/>the member of Restigouche if he, at the 
     <lb/>time the Facility Bill was under consid<lb break="no"/>eration of Council, believed that the 
     <lb/>branch to the North Shore would be 
     <lb/>built under it? He (Mr. H.) had al<lb break="no"/>ways great doubts about the Bill. He 
     <lb/>never believed that any roads but the 
     <lb/>St. Stephen and Woodstock and Fred<lb break="no"/>ericton branches would be built under 
     <lb/>it. He' believed the Fredericton branch 
     <lb/>would be built under it, because it was 
     <lb/>only twenty miles long; the road was 
     <lb/>easy of construction, and because he 
     <lb/>thought this opportunity of thus easi<lb break="no"/>ly connecting themselves with St. John ' 
     <lb/>would not be lost hold of by the people 
     <lb/>of York. But he never did believe that 
     <lb/>one hundred and eighty miles of Rail<lb break="no"/>way would be constructed under it. 
     <lb/>With regard to Western Extension. he 
     <lb/>thought that it ought to have been taken 
     <lb/>hold of by the Government. The Leg<lb break="no"/>islature could not do less in good faith 
     <lb/>than carry out the Act given to the Al<lb break="no"/>bert Company, and assent to the Bill 
     <lb/>under consideration.

            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said he would support 
     <lb/>the Bill cheerfully. He was sorry that 
     <lb/>the Chief Commissioner had shown such 
     <lb/>an aptitude for being squeezed, and 
     <lb/>that he could be under pressure, made 
     <lb/>a party to introduce n measure that he 
     <lb/>thought prejudicial to the country. He 
     <lb/>was astonished that the Chief Commis<lb break="no"/>sioner had made such a confession ; but 
     <lb/>he hoped he did not carry out that prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of acting under pressure in the 
     <lb/>execution of the responsible duties of 
     <lb/>his office. Mr. Gilbert then proceeded 
     <lb/>to speak of Railway matters. He 
     <lb/>thought it ought to be the policy of the 
     <lb/>Government to go on building Railways, 
     <lb/>it could not be expected that these 
     <lb/>works would, in a young country like 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
       

     New Brunswick, pay directly; but in 
     <lb/>
     an indirect way they would, by improv<lb break="no"/>ing the value of property and opening 
     <lb/>
     up the country. He hoped that the 
     <lb/>
     Western Extension, and other railways, 
     <lb/>
     would be built under the Subsidy Act; 
     <lb/>
     but he confessed he had great doubts 
     <lb/>
     if they could induce capitalists to come 
     <lb/>
     in and expend money to carry such 
     <lb/>
     works. If they expected to have more 
     <lb/>
    Railways they would, he feared, though 
     <lb/>he hoped otherwise, have to build them<lb/>out of the Provincial Revenue.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CUDL1">MR. CUDLIP</persName> said, he could perfectly 
     <lb/>
     understand what the Hon. Mr. Hathe<lb break="no"/>way had said about pressure; it was  
     <lb/>nothing but. pressure that induced the   
     <lb/>Government to bring in their Facility<lb/>Bill. The hon. member then quoted<lb/>from the Journals of 1864 the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions moved by himself for the repeal of 
     <lb/>the Inter-colonial Railway Act, and 
     <lb/>dwelt on the subsequent Legislative ac<lb break="no"/>tion that brought about the introduction 
     <lb/>of the Facility Bill. He voted for 
     <lb/>the Bill, though he thought it in 
     <lb/>some degree a delusion, he was not 
     <lb/>without hopes that something would 
     <lb/>grow out of it. Here Mr. Cudlip quot<lb break="no"/>ed from the Journals of 1864, the divi<lb break="no"/>sion, April 5th, of the resolution to post<lb break="no"/>pone further consideration of the Facili<lb break="no"/>ty Bill. (Mr. McMillan said. the hon. 
     <lb/>member's name did not appear on the 
     <lb/>negative side of the division.) Would 
     <lb/>the hon. member of Restigouche dare 
     <lb/>to say that he shirked his vote on that 
     <lb/>question? He would not permit any 
     <lb/>one to throw out insinuations against 
     <lb/>him. It appeared to him that the policy 
     <lb/>of insinuation ran through everything, 
     <lb/>the Press of the country teemed with it; 
     <lb/>the whole business of the country was 
     <lb/>carried away by insinuation. (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Millan never supposed that the hon. 
     <lb/>member of St. John shirked the ques<lb break="no"/>tion.) Though his name did not ap<lb break="no"/>pear on the division, as he was unavoid<lb break="no"/>ably absent from the House when the 
     <lb/>vote was taken, he had supported the 
     <lb/>Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> asked what on earth 
     <lb/>was the matter? Every member who 
     <lb/>had spoken had declared himself in favor 
     <lb/>of the Bill. If they thought it right, 
     <lb/>why did they not vote for it at once, 
     <lb/>without branching out into an irrevelant 
     <lb/>discussion. If the time given by the Bill 
     <lb/>to the Albert Company had elapsed, let 
     <lb/>the House renew it. The Bill merely 
     <lb/>sought for an extension of time to carry 
     <lb/>out the construction of the Railway. 
     <lb/>With regard to railway policy, he would 
     <lb/>tell hon. members that railways ought to 
     <lb/>be owned by the Government of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and ought to be built out of the rev<lb break="no"/>enue of the country, but only as fast as 
     <lb/>not to entail too heavy a burden on the 
     <lb/>people. He did not believe in the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of subsidizing Companies to build 
     <lb/>railways. ' Western Extension and East<lb break="no"/>ern Extension and other lines might be 
     <lb/>built under the Act. but eventually they 
     <lb/>would all have to be ceded over to the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment.

     thing that appeared like an insinuation

<p>
     They opposed the resolution moved by 
     <lb/>
     that hon. member to repeal the Intercolo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway, and moving, as an amend<lb break="no"/>ment, that it would be inexpedient to re<lb break="no"/>peal the Act, and that it was not prudent 
     <lb/>
     by immediate legislation to incur any new 
     <lb/>
     liabilities for the construction of railway. 
     <lb/>
     The discussion of the question excited 
     <lb/>
     great interest. Ît was in the midst of it, 
     <lb/>
     it would be remembered, that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment got news that the Nova Scotia Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment had repealed the Intercolonial 
     <lb/>
     Act; and it was after that action of No<lb break="no"/>va Scotia that the Government came 
     <lb/>
     down with the Subsidy Bill. He was as<lb break="no"/>tonished that any member of the late Go<lb break="no"/>vernment would traduce it by saying that 
     <lb/>
     that Government brought down a bogus 
     <lb/>
     Bill; he was. astonished, that their Chief 
     <lb/>
     Commissioner should appear in such a 
     <lb/>
     position. Much as that Bill had been 
     <lb/>
     condemned, the present Government wish<lb break="no"/>ed to take to themselves all the merits 
     <lb/>
     and advantages of it.

     <persName ref="pers:HATH1">HON. MR. HATHEWAY</persName> was perfect<lb break="no"/>ly willing to take the responsibility of 
     <lb/>
     what he had said, but he was not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to give the late Government all 
     <lb/>the credit the hon. member of Resti<lb break="no"/>gouche assumed for that Subsidy Bill. 
     <lb/>He would ask that hon. member if, when 
     <lb/>that measure was first introduced, he ex<lb break="no"/>pected that one mile of the Railway 
     <lb/>from Shediac to Miramichi would be 
     <lb/>built under it. He knew perfectly that a 
     <lb/>mile would never be built. He (Mr. McM.) 
     <lb/>should not come and laud the late Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, for he should recollect the pres<lb break="no"/>sure put upon it, and the circumstances 
     <lb/>under which the Bill was introduced. He 
     <lb/>(Mr. Hatheway) believed that the Bill 
     <lb/>was one of the most dangerous that was 
     <lb/>ever introduced into the country If 
     <lb/>those, the railways, went on, there would 
     <lb/>be hundreds of thousands of dollars of

     <persName ref="pers:FISH1">MR. FISHER</persName>—The course he had pur<lb break="no"/>sued had put the screws on the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Mr. Fisher here referred at length 
     <lb/>
     to the action of the Legislature from the 
     <lb/>
     debate on the amendment to the resolu<lb break="no"/>tion to repeal the Intercolonial Railway 
     <lb/>Act. (a repeal be resisted from determi<lb break="no"/>nation to maintain the integrity of the 
     <lb/>Province, irrespective of the action of 
     <lb/>Nova Scotia or Canada.) to the introduc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Subsidy Act. He read from 
     <lb/>the Journals of 1864 the resolutions he 
     <lb/>had moved calling on the Government to 
     <lb/>order surveys to be made of the Western 
     <lb/>Extension, Eastern Extension, and Wood<lb break="no"/>stock and St. Stephen routes. With regard 
     <lb/>to the Subsidy Act, or the Lobster Bill, 
     <lb/>as it had been called, though he did hope 
     <lb/>that something might be done under it, he 
     <lb/>did not think at the time it was passed 
     <lb/>that many miles of railway would be built 
     <lb/>under it. But he had changed his opin<lb break="no"/>ion regarding that Bill, and he now be<lb break="no"/>lieved that it was one of the most impor<lb break="no"/>tant acts ever passed in the Province, but 
     <lb/>he also believed that had it not been for 
     <lb/>his action in ordering surveys of the routes 
     <lb/>of the different lines, the whole affair would 
     <lb/>hare been in the most chaotic condition. 
     <lb/>He believed that the Fredericton branch 
     <lb/>would give York a connection with 
     <lb/>St. John, and different Countries, would be 
     <lb/>built under the Bill, and that the road 
     <lb/>would be built very cheaply.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>

     <persName ref="pers:LEWI1">MR. LEWIS</persName>.—The most important 
     <lb/>
     question argued in the course of the de<lb break="no"/>bate was Confederation. He had been 
     <lb/>
     elected to go in for Confederation, and 
     <lb/>
     he was there to support that policy. 
     <lb/>
     During his canvass in Albert, he had met 
     <lb/>
     with strong Opposition from His Honor 
     <lb/>
     the Attorney. who went lecturing through 
     <lb/>
     that County, and by his powers of ora<lb break="no"/>tory and eloquence influenced many who 
     <lb/>
     were in favor of Confederation to vete 
     <lb/>
     against it. Now it appeared that Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of which the Attorney General 
     <lb/>
     was leader was now in favor of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation. The Government had been ar<lb break="no"/>raigned on a number of counts, and all 
     <lb/>
    these had been so fully argued that it 
     <lb/>was not necessary now to do more than 
     <lb/>touch upon them. They had been ar<lb break="no"/>raigned on a charge of not calling the 
     <lb/>House sooner together. He could see no 
     <lb/>objection at all to postponing the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature until March. He thought it an 
     <lb/>improvement from the usual course of 
     <lb/>meeting in February. Hon. members 
     <lb/>would now all be able to get home by 
     <lb/>water, and thought this would be much 
     <lb/>preferable to breaking up before the navi<lb break="no"/>gation opened, and when the roads were 
     <lb/>in an unfit state for travel. At one time, 
     <lb/>he remembered, he had to pay $16 for a 
     <lb/>passage down the Nerepis road, and had 
     <lb/>to walk more than half the way. Ano<lb break="no"/>ther count was, they had not appointed 
     <lb/>an Auditor General. He thought the 
     <lb/>Government were highly capable for 
     <lb/>not having an officer to take charge of 
     <lb/>the Audit Office. The public accounts 
     <lb/>that had been put forth this year might 
     <lb/>be easily understood; but that fact did 
     <lb/>not clear the Government from the charge 
     <lb/>of not having a responsible officer at the 
     <lb/>head of the office. In 1854 the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was condemned for building rail<lb break="no"/>ways without Commissioners according to 
     <lb/>law, and he thought this present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was equally culpable in conducting 
     <lb/>the Audit Office without a responsible 
     <lb/>head, as the law required. The defence 
     <lb/>of the country was another count against 
     <lb/>the Government. The country was alarm<lb break="no"/>ed about the Fenian movement and he 
     <lb/>was somewhat alarmed himself. He did 
     <lb/>think, considering the excitement in the 
     <lb/>country, that the Government ought to 
     <lb/>have done something to put the country 
     <lb/>in a proper state of defence. He hoped 
     <lb/>they would take efficient steps to place 
     <lb/>the country in a state that it would be 
     <lb/>able to resist an invasion should it take 
     <lb/>place . 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     A great deal had been said about the 
     <lb/>
     York election. He could not see that the 
     <lb/>
     country was interested in that election 
     <lb/>
     or that it had anything to do with the 
     <lb/>
     business of the country, or affected its 
     <lb/>
     interests. He could see no use whatever 
     <lb/>
     in dragging it into the debate, and it was 
     <lb/>
     high time to bring the matter to a close. 
     <lb/>
     One charge the Government had plead 
     <lb/>
     guilty to—that was, their neglect about 
     <lb/>
     the Export Duty Law; and they had 
     <lb/>
    thrown themselves upon the mercy of the 
     <lb/>country. If this was the only charge 
     <lb/>they were guilty of, they might be for<lb break="no"/>given, and still keep the confidence of 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
      

     the country. But this was not their only 
     <lb/>
     neglect of dutv. and be thought it would 
     <lb/>
    bo better for their interests if they voted 
     <lb/>them out and brought in a better set of 
     <lb/>men. He had come here to carry out 
     <lb/>Confederation. He thought that was 
     <lb/>the far most important question before 
     <lb/>the country. He believed that the union 
     <lb/>of the Provinces would be of a great 
     <lb/>benefit to New Brunswick. It wouldlesd 
     <lb/>to the construction of the inter-Colonial 
     <lb/>Railway. to the opening up of the coun<lb break="no"/>try and its advancement in wealth arid 
     <lb/>progress. Notwithstanding all that had 
     <lb/>been said against the Quebec Scheme, it 
     <lb/>was better than no scheme at all. If the 
     <lb/>Government were not prepared with a 
     <lb/>better measure, better let them accept 
     <lb/>the Quebec Scheme at once.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>A great deal had been said about the 
     <lb/>staffing process, and about delegations. 
     <lb/>He could not see for what object the dele<lb break="no"/>gation was sent to England. The dele<lb break="no"/>gates, he thought, must have crossed the 
     <lb/>water just to have a good time. He did 
     <lb/>not think the money of the country 
     <lb/>should be wasted in that manner. The 
     <lb/>£800 that delegation had coat would 
     <lb/>have made a very large piece of bye- 
     <lb break="yes"/>road. He considered it a very useless 
     <lb/>expenditure. He thought that the Rail<lb break="no"/>way contract which the Attorney General 
     <lb/>said would be of such vast benefit to the 
     <lb/>Province, could have been made without 
     <lb/>the delegation. In making the contract, 
     <lb/>the delegates had agreed to give more 
     <lb/>than the $10,000 a mile for which they 
     <lb/>had no authority. In closing up, he 
     <lb/>would say that he hardly thought that 
     <lb/>the Government were prepared to bring 
     <lb/>in a scheme of Confederation. If they 
     <lb/>did bring in a measure. he should be re<lb break="no"/>luctantly obliged to vote against them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:YOUN1">MR. YOUNG</persName> said he felt some em<lb break="no"/>barrassment in addressing the House 
     <lb/>upon this question, inasmuch as he dif<lb break="no"/>fered with some of the anti-Confederate 
     <lb/>members, who were elected, as he was, 
     <lb/>to oppose the Quebec Scheme, and also 
     <lb/>inasmuch as he differed with some of 
     <lb/>the members representing the Northern 
     <lb/>Counties. The question that was now 
     <lb/>before the House was, whether the 
     <lb/>Government was entitled to the con<lb break="no"/>fidence of the Representatives of the 
     <lb/>people or not. lf the Government was 
     <lb/>entitled to the confidence of the House, 
     <lb/>it would be his duty, and that of the hon. 
     <lb/>members to support them, and if they 
     <lb/>(the Government) were not entitled to 
     <lb/>the confidence of the House, it would be 
     <lb/>his duty, and that of hon. members, to 
     <lb/>turn them out. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     The position of many of his hon. 
     <lb/>
     friends who represent the Northern 
     <lb/>
     Counties was entirely different to his. 
     <lb/>
     Many of them were elected to support 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec Scheme, and having been 
     <lb/>
     returned to support that scheme they 
     <lb/>
     cannot very well do otherwise than op<lb break="no"/>pose the policy of the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. His position on the question of 
     <lb/>Confederation was just the reverse; he 
     <lb/>was elected by the electors of his County 
     <lb/>to oppose the Quebec Scheme, he put 
     <lb/>it in his election card, he declared it on 
     <lb/>the hustings, and he was here today 
     <lb/>to carry out, in good faith, the pledge 
     <lb/>that he had made to the electors of 
     <lb/>Gloucester. Had he changed his mind 
     <lb/>on this important subject, had he felt 
     <lb/>convinced since his election that the 
     <lb/>views he entertained twelve months ago 
     <lb/>(with reference to the scheme) were er<lb break="no"/>roneous, he would have considered it 
     <lb/>his duty, as a matter of fair play and

     justice to his constituents. to resign his      
     <lb/>
     seat and allow them the privilege of      
     <lb/>
     again giving an expression of their     
     <lb/>
     opinion on the Quebec Scheme; this, he     
     <lb/>
     thought would be much better than for      
     <lb/>
     him to advocate a measure that they   
     <lb/>
     sent him to oppose. (Hear, hear.) But     
     <lb/>
     he would tell this House that he had   
     <lb/>
     not changed his mind in reference to  
     <lb/>
     Confederation : he was as much opposed      
     <lb/>
     to the Quebec. Scheme now as he was     
     <lb/>
     when he was elected twelve months     
     <lb/>
     ago; he was as determined to vote    
     <lb/>
     against it now as he was when he came    
     <lb/>
     here last session, and in doing so he    
     <lb/>
     was doing neithcr more nor less than      
     <lb/>
     carrying out the views and the wishes     
     <lb/>
     of his constituents. When hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers talked about the influences that    
     <lb/>
     were used at the last general election,      
     <lb/>
     he could tell them that he had not forgot    
     <lb/>
    the influences—the Canadian influences     
     <lb/>— that were used in the Northern     
     <lb/>Counties. The hon. member from   
     <lb/>Victoria (Mr. Costigan) alluded the    
     <lb/>other day to the Canadian official that   
     <lb/>came into his County during the elec-    
     <lb/>tion, enquiring about the prices of lime,   
     <lb/>railway sleepers, and material for con-     
     <lb/>structing the Inter-Colonial Railway ; he    
     <lb/>could tell his hon. friend, and he could he    
     <lb/>tell the House, that this influence was    
     <lb/>used in the Northern Counties also,    
     <lb/>he was glad to say that in his County    
     <lb/>the Canadian influence did not succeed.

     It had been stated that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> ad-  
     <lb/>
     vocates the Quebec Scheme; that the    
     <lb/>
    Colonial Secretary, Mr. Cardwell, is 
     <lb/>strongly in favor of Confederation,    
     <lb/>and that Her Majesty the Queen   
     <lb/>is anxious to see the British North    
     <lb/>American Provinces united. He   
     <lb/>(Mr. Young) had not the slightest   
     <lb/>doubt about this, he knew that Union     
     <lb/>was desirable, and he had no objections    
     <lb/>to a Union of the Provinces, provided     
     <lb/>the interests of New Brunswick were     
     <lb/>protected; otherwise he would not con<lb break="no"/>sent to Union. With the permission of    
     <lb/>the House he would read an article he     
     <lb/>had copied from the Times some time   
     <lb/>ago, in which that paper criticised the    
     <lb/>Quebec Scheme, viz. :—

     " But the most important clause in    
     <lb/>
     the whole Resolution, and unfortunate<lb break="no"/>ly by no means the easiest to under-    
     <lb/>
     stand, is the one which defines the     
     <lb/>
     powers of the Central Federative Legis<lb break="no"/>lation. By Resolution 29. the General.  
     <lb/>
     Parliament shall have power to make   
     <lb/>
     laws for the peace, welfare and good   
     <lb/>
     government of the Federated Provin<lb break="no"/>ces, owning the Sovereignty of Eng<lb break="no"/>land and especial laws respecting the    
     <lb/>
     following subjects. Then follow thirty-  
     <lb/>
     six heads of legislation, and a thirty-    
     <lb/>
     seventh which is as follows: And    
     <lb/>
    generally respecting all matters of a   
     <lb/>general character not specially and ex<lb break="no"/>clusively reserved for the Local Govern-     
     <lb/>ments and Legislations. We cannot    
     <lb/>find that the Local Legislatures have    
     <lb/>any exclusive power of legislation given    
     <lb/>them. They have power, by the 43rd    
     <lb/>Resolution, to make laws respecting    
     <lb/>seventeen subjects, the eighteenth be<lb break="no"/>ing: - And generally matters of a pri<lb break="no"/>vate or local nature, not assigned to the     
     <lb/>General Parliament. It is exceedingly    
     <lb/>difficult to construe these provisions.    
     <lb/>First, general powers of legislation are    
     <lb/>given especially to make laws on thirty-   
     <lb/>seven subjects, one of those being all

     tures. Nothing is exclusively reserved to<lb/>Local Legislatures, and it would seem,<lb/>therefore, that the effect of this clause<lb/>is to cut the power of Central Legisla<lb break="no"/>tion down to matters of a general char<lb break="no"/>acter -- a most vague and unsatisfactory<lb/>definition, and one sure, if it be <hi rendition="simple:italic">retain<lb break="no"/>ed, to produce conflict and confusion</hi>.</p>

These were his views with<lb/>regard to the scheme, and it was<lb/>surely his duty as an opponent<lb/>of thises scheme to spuport this<lb/>Government. Unless it could be shown<lb/>that they had not discharged their duty<lb/>faithfully, or been recreant to their duty,<lb/>he would support them; he had no hesi<lb break="no"/>tation in stating that he believed this<lb/>Government had carried on the admin<lb break="no"/>istration of the country in accordance<lb/>with the well understood wishes of the<lb/>people, and, therefore, were entitled to<lb/>the confidence and support of honorable members.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His hon. friend from Restigouche (Mr.<lb/>McMillan) the other day, in complaining<lb/>that the Northern Counties had not suf<lb break="no"/>ficient representation in the Government,<lb/>stated: "How could any member from<lb/>the North Shore support them or vote for<lb/>them." He (Mr. Young) would tell the<lb/>hon. member that he had not desire to<lb/>ignore the right of the people of the North<lb/>Shore from being represented at the Ex<lb break="no"/>ecutive Council Board, and he did think<lb/>that the Northern Counties ought to have<lb/>more represenation in the Government<lb/>than they have at present. But he would<lb/>ask the hon. member in what position<lb/>had the North placed itself on the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation? Take the Coun<lb break="no"/>ties of Restigouche, Northumberland and<lb/>Gloucester, and what would they find?<lb/>They would find that out of thirty mem<lb break="no"/>bers elected at the last general election to<lb/>oppose the Quebec Scheme, and the<lb/>three Counties that he had just named<lb/>had sent but three anti-Confederates, <lb/>vis: the hon. Mr. Hutchinson, his col<lb break="no"/>league (Mr. Meehan) and himself. The<lb/>former was called ot the Executive; and<lb/>without knowing the intentions of the<lb/>Government in the matter, he would un<lb break="no"/>dertake to say that, if they had been dis<lb break="no"/>posed to take his colleague or himself in<lb break="no"/>to the Government, it could not have<lb/>been done in consequence of the Scruti<lb break="no"/>ny that was pending against them. He<lb/>(Mr. Young) referred to this to show<lb/>hon. members from the Northern Coun<lb break="no"/>ties that if the people of the North Shore<lb/>had not the representation in the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that they ought to have, they have <lb/>only themselves to blame. And, while<lb/>he was upon this subject, he would do<lb/>the Hon. Mr. Hutchison the justice to<lb/>say that, notwithstanding the abuse that<lb/>gentleman had received from a portion of<lb/>the Opposition press, and notwithstanding <lb/>the remarks, the other day, of the ex-<lb break="yes"/>Surveyor General, that he (Mr. Hutchi<lb break="no"/>son) had no political experience, and, con<lb break="no"/> <lb/>
         
<cb/>

sequently, was unfit to represent the 
     <lb/>North Shore alone. He would tell the 
     <lb/>hon. member that the interests of the 
     <lb/>Northern Counties during the past year 
     <lb/>had not been neglected. They had re<lb break="no"/>ceived just as much money for their bye 
     <lb/>roads, and great roads, and public works 
     <lb/>as when the late Government were in 
     <lb/>power. He (Mr. Young) had not forgot 
     <lb/>that, during the years 1863 and 1884, 
     <lb/>how difficult it was to get a steamer for 
     <lb/>the North Shore; that notwithstanding 
     <lb/>all the political experience and ingenuity 
     <lb/>of his hon. friend the ex-Surveyor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, it could not be done. The people's 
     <lb/>representatives were put off from time to 
     <lb/>time by being told that a steamer could 
     <lb/>not be got—that they were all down South 
     <lb/>during the war. But how did it happen 
     <lb/>that the Acadia was not engaged ? She 
     <lb/>wes built by a company at Sorel, in Cana<lb break="no"/>da, expressly with a view of being put on 
     <lb/>the North Shore; but the Government of 
     <lb/>which his hon. friend was a member 
     <lb/>would not engage her. He (Mr. Young) 
     <lb/>referred to this to shew that when the 
     <lb/>North was represented by gentlemen who 
     <lb/>claimed to possess great political know<lb break="no"/>ledge, the local requirements of the North 
     <lb/>were not better attended to then than 
     <lb/>they are now. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With reference to the charges that had 
     <lb/>been made against this Government by 
     <lb/>the leader of the Opposition and his fol<lb break="no"/>lowers, he could only say that they were 
     <lb/>not sustained; it was not necessary for 
     <lb/>him to refer to them, for they had been ably 
     <lb/>answered by the Attorney General and 
     <lb/>the Provincial Secretary. He believed 
     <lb/>the Opposition have been premature in 
     <lb/>their movements; they want to turn out 
     <lb/>the Government before they have time to 
     <lb/>lay belore this House an account of their 
     <lb/>stewardship; they do not want to wait 
     <lb/>until the reports from the several heads of 
     <lb/>Departments are laid on the table. 
     <lb/>Their cry is, "Turn them out. turn them 
     <lb/>out, they are a parcel of loafers and 
     <lb/>traitors." And in their great anxiety to 
     <lb/>turn them out they have acted impru<lb break="no"/>dently, and if the term was not unpar<lb break="no"/>liamentary) had acted like office seekers, 
     <lb/>and he had no doubt they (the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion) had brought upon themselves the 
     <lb/>indignation of every lover of fair play 
     <lb/>and justice in the country. He would 
     <lb/>vote against the amendment.

            <p><persName ref="pers:WILL1">MR. WILLISTON</persName> said, before going 
     <lb/>into the general questions he would 
     <lb/>touch upon a few of the matters that had 
     <lb/>come up during the course of the debate. 
     <lb/>A great deal of irrelevant matter had been 
     <lb/>thrown into the discussion, and a great 
     <lb/>deal said about the York election. but he 
     <lb/>could not see what that had to do with 
     <lb/>the question. It seemed to him the 
     <lb/>whole aim of Mr. Fisher's colleagues was 
     <lb/>to break him down. The Hon. Chief 
     <lb/>Commissioner had, in his speech, direct<lb break="no"/>ed the weight of his attack against that 
     <lb/>gentleman and he had been followed by 
     <lb/>his friend Mr. Fraser, who had also at<lb break="no"/>tacked Mr. Fisher with great severity 
     <lb/>and acrimony. He thought that it would 
     <lb/>be much more dignified if the members of 
     <lb/>York had settled their disputes about the 
     <lb/>election outside, and not have brought 
     <lb/>them before the Legislature. He was 
     <lb/>very sorry that the Provincial Secretary 
     <lb/>for whom he personally had the greatest, 
     <lb/>regard, and in whom he had unbounded 
     <lb/>confidence, should so far have forgotten 
     <lb/>his dignity as to have thrown the weight 
     <lb/>of his position on the side of the attack 
     <lb/>against Mr. Fisher. Mr. Fisher he had 
     <lb/>always found courteous, kind and affable.

            <p>
     He did not stand there as Mr. Fisher's 
     <lb/>
     apologist, for he was perfectly well able 
     <lb/>
     to take care of himself. but it was due to 
     <lb/>
     the position he (Mr. W. held, and to the 
     <lb/>
     country, that he should not use such 
     <lb/>
     language as would bring disgrace upon 
     <lb/>
     the halls of the Legislature. If Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Ex<lb break="no"/>chequer, attacked any member of the 
     <lb/>Imperial Parliament in the way the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary had attacked Mr. 
     <lb/>Fisher, it would raise such a whirl of in<lb break="no"/>dignation throughout England as was 
     <lb/>never raised before. Another point that 
     <lb/>had been taken up by his hon. friends the 
     <lb/>members of York, (the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>Hathaway and Mr. Fraser), was that the 
     <lb/>Opposition in their County had attempted 
     <lb/>to excite class against class, and raise the 
     <lb/>fires of religious hatred. If that were 
     <lb/>true, he had not language strong enough 
     <lb/>to denounce those who attempted to take 
     <lb/>that course. He would be derelict to his 
     <lb/>dutv if he did not stand up and condemn 
     <lb/>it. The man who attempted to raise the 
     <lb/>firebrand of religious strife and class     
     <lb/>hatred in this mixed community, ought to 
     <lb/>be looked upon as a moral criminal, 
     <lb/>and shunned by every honorable 
     <lb/>man. ln this community they had 
     <lb/>all equal rights, they were nearly 
     <lb/>as possible for men to on an equali<lb break="no"/>ty, and it was the duty of all to pro<lb break="no"/>mote good feeling, and not to disturb 
     <lb/>the concord and harmony that had hitherto 
     <lb/>always prevailed. Mr. Willtston then 
     <lb/>proceeded to speak to the general ques<lb break="no"/>tion the mode the Quebec Scheme 
     <lb/>placed before the people. The 
     <lb/>late Government had thought proper to 
     <lb/>dissolve the Legislature before submit<lb break="no"/>ting the Scheme. He differed with them 
     <lb/>upon that point, for he thought they 
     <lb/>ought first to have brought the scheme 
     <lb/>before the Legislature, and there thor<lb break="no"/>oughly ventilated the subject, and then 
     <lb/>gone to the country, when the people 
     <lb/>would have been better prepared to 
     <lb/>pronounce upon it. But that was mere<lb break="no"/>ly a question of policy. There was no 
     <lb/>doubt that they would have to proceed 
     <lb/>and consolidate the country. New 
     <lb/>Brunswick, as it stood alone, was a most 
     <lb/>insignificant place, and while it remained 
     <lb/>a community by itself. would always re<lb break="no"/>main so. What was the great object of 
     <lb/>Confederation but to throw down the 
     <lb/>barriers that hemmed the Province in, 
     <lb/>and allow them to unite with  a larger  
     <lb/>people; and would any one say that the      
     <lb/>great and prosperous Canada was not a    
     <lb/>country they would be willing to be unit<lb break="no"/>ed to? He was there as a Confederate    
     <lb/>and to support the principle of Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. At a large meeting in Chat<lb break="no"/>ham, he publicly enunciated his principles     
     <lb/>on that great question. and had pronoun<lb break="no"/>ced without fear, favor, or hopes of per<lb break="no"/>sonal aggrandizement, his judgment. 
     <lb/>Though he came to the House a Con<lb break="no"/>federate and though the Government      
     <lb/>was formed on anti-Confederate basis,    
     <lb/>he had felt that as there was a Con<lb break="no"/>servative element in it, he would sus<lb break="no"/>tain the Government on every point<lb/>except Confederation. He felt that it<lb/>was his duty to support them, and he<lb/>had done so to the best of his ability.<lb/>But what did they did when the<lb/>House rose. They found that some<lb/>of the members of the<lb/>Government went<lb/>to England. In their absence his col<lb break="no"/>leagues drew up the Minutes of Council<lb/>of which so much has been said. He     
     <lb/>objected to that Minute on several points.

     (Here the hon. member quoted the Min<lb break="no"/>ute and commented upon it.) He thought<lb/>it most undignified and unstatesmanlike<lb/>in a grave official document to quote from<lb/>a newspaper. England dealt with the<lb/>question of union as a national question.<lb/>It appeared to be the disposition of the<lb/>British Government that the Colonies<lb/>should unite. (Mr. Williston, he refer<lb break="no"/>red to the New Zealand Colonies, and also<lb/>to the Cape of Good Hope Colonies as<lb/>cases in point. In the latter, Caffraria<lb/>had been united by Imperial legislation.)<lb/>The mother country was anxious tha tthe<lb/>North American Colonies should adopt<lb/>the scheme, and also had a right to make<lb/>them if she though proper. They had a<lb/>right to suppose, if the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment wished to unite these Provinces,<lb/>that it was their interests and gener<lb break="no"/>al interests of the Empire. Was the<lb/>British Government bound, he would ask,<lb/>to protect them? Was the mother coun<lb break="no"/>try bound to throw her ægis around these<lb/>Provinces? Was she bound to defned<lb/>them if, when she said that her policy was<lb/>union, they refused to obey, and unite?<lb/>When they looked at the position of these<lb/>Colonies, and considered from whom their<lb/>protection came, had the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment not the right to say to them that<lb/>they must unite for the general interest?<lb/>What was their situation? The found<lb/>they had upon their borders a restless<lb/>and aggressive people, who were now<lb/>amongst the first military nations of the <lb/>world, and whose constant dream it had<lb/>been to make this Continent a vast re<lb break="no"/>public. the British people saw what might<lb/>arise -- they wished to remain on the most<lb/>friendly terms with the Americans; they<lb/>had no wish to fight; but they saw that<lb/>the time might come, and they said to the <lb/>Colonies: "consolidate, unite under one<lb/>strong general government." If union<lb/>took place, they might possibly send out<lb/>a Viceroy. He said that the Minute of<lb/>Council, in standing in the way of the<lb/>general interests of the Empire, was not<lb/>based on a correct political principle; and<lb/>that Minute was not based upon political<lb/>principles. It did not give an exposition<lb/>of the sentiments of the people, when it<lb/>said that the majority were opposed to<lb/>any closer union with Canada. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved that they were not opposed, and the<lb/>Minute did not even speak the mind of<lb/>the Government, for what did they find<lb/>the leader of the Government say<lb break="no"/>ing that he would be willing to go for<lb/>a scheme of Union based on equi<lb break="no"/>table principles, and that would ad<lb break="no"/>vance the interests of the country. If<lb/>the Government were not favorable to<lb/>Union, why did they not come down<lb/>with a scheme. They had told the peo<lb break="no"/>ple in the speech from the throne that<lb/>they were in favor of a Union, yet they<lb/>did not advance any scheme. When<lb/>they told the country they were in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of Union they either did it to per<lb break="no"/>petuate their own power, or for some<lb/>other reason. He was opposed to the<lb/>Government on Confederation. He <lb/>was also opposed to the Government<lb/>because the<lb/>the North Shore was not<lb/><unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> vernment. He was opposed <lb/>because the interests of the North were<lb/>ignored at the<lb/>in<lb/>North<lb/>a<lb/>vernment<lb/>chison in the Council; if the truth<lb/>were known he believed he (Mr. H.) was<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
   

     promised a seat before the Government 
     <lb/>
     were formed. He was not going to dis<lb break="no"/>parage Mr. Hutchison, he was known 
     <lb/>
     to be a first rate business man, a man of 
     <lb/>
     good capacity and standing, but possess- 
     <lb/>
     of no political experience or attain<lb break="no"/>ments; and the interests of the North 
     <lb/>
     were ignored when the Govemment
     <lb/>
     passed over the other anti-Confederate 
     <lb/>
     members. His hon. friend Mr. Young, 
     <lb/>
     had defended the Government, and said 
     <lb/>
     they could not have taken either himself 
     <lb/>
     or his colleague (Mr. Meahan) into the 
     <lb/>
     Council because there was a scrutiny 
     <lb/>
     against them. But was there not a scru<lb break="no"/>tiny against Mr. Hutchinson whenhe was 
     <lb/>
     taken into the Government, was there 
     <lb/>not a charge against him of the gravest<lb/>
    kind? Mr. Williston then proceeded to 
     <lb/>say that he had been seven yars in the 
     <lb/>House, battling against a Liberal Ad<lb break="no"/>ministration, yet they had given the 
     <lb/>North Shore a fair shake at the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil Board. But what had the present 
     <lb/>Government done for the North? They 
     <lb/>had placed in the Government a gentle<lb break="no"/>man who had no large amount of ad<lb break="no"/>ministrative experience, a gentleman 
     <lb/>unable to cope with his colleagues when 
     <lb/>questions attacking its interests came 
     <lb/>up. His hon. friend, Mr. Young. had 
     <lb/>stated that the interests of the North 
     <lb/>Shore had not been neglected by the 
     <lb/>present Government, that it had re<lb break="no"/>ceived as much school money and bye- 
     <lb break="yes"/>road money, and great road money as it had 
     <lb/>formerly received. But the people of the 
     <lb/>North Shore could not thank the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for that. There appropriations were 
     <lb/>rights that no Government could take away, 
     <lb/>and deserved no t thanks for conceding. 
     <lb/>What the North had reason to complain of 
     <lb/>was that their interests had not been pro<lb break="no"/>perly attended to; that they had not a 
     <lb/>greater representation at the Council Board. 
     <lb/>The Government policy he proceeded to say 
     <lb/>would be disastrous to the North. Its in<lb break="no"/>terests hnd not been sufficiently served, 
     <lb/>and on that, at one ground. he would vote 
     <lb/>for the Amendment.

            <p>
     The question had been raised had the 
     <lb/>
     Government done their duty about the Ex<lb break="no"/>port Duty Law. He was not going to con<lb break="no"/>demn that oversight, but was willing to for<lb break="no"/>give them. It was certainly an oversight 
     <lb/>
     which might have taken from the reve<lb break="no"/>nues of this Province $60,000, had it been 
     <lb/>
     discovered by the exporters of lumber. 
     <lb/>
     Fortunately for the position of the Province 
     <lb/>
     and the revenues, such had not been dis<lb break="no"/>covered and the mistake had been rectified 
     <lb/>
     by the unanimous vote of the House. ln 
     <lb/>
     his mind highly creditable to it. In such a 
     <lb/>
     case, faction might lead to injurious conse<lb break="no"/>quences, and he felt delighted that the re<lb break="no"/>presentatives of the people have risen above 
     <lb/>
     party. and corrected what appeared to have 
     <lb/>
     been an unintentional oversight. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     With regard to the charge against the 
     <lb/>
     Government regarding the disposal of the 
     <lb/>
     Crown Lands to Mr. Gibson, he would not 
     <lb/>
     condemn the Governnitnt for that act. He 
     <lb/>
     only wished that there were a number of 
     <lb/>
     people, with plenty of money in their hands, 
     <lb/>
     who would come into the country, and take 
     <lb/>
     up the wilderness lands of the Province. If 
     <lb/>
     there was a Gibson junior about, they would 
     <lb/>
    be glad to see him in Northumberland. As

     <lb/>But let it be supposed that the Govsmment 
     <lb/>did impose duty on these articles, the South<lb break="no"/>ern part of the Province would get them 
     <lb/>duty free. St. John being an open port, 
     <lb/>while the people of the North would have to 
     <lb/>pay duty. Such a policy would not be to<lb break="no"/>lerated were the Northern Counties properly

     THE MILITIA . 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     MR. OTTY, in explaining the objects 
     <lb/>
     of thc Bill, said that the militia law ex<lb break="no"/>empted volunteers from the payment of 
     <lb/>
     taxes to the extent of six dollars. This 
     <lb/>
     provision did not act fairly, because many 
     <lb/>
     of the volunteers who spent their time at<lb break="no"/>tending drill, paid but a small amount of 
     <lb/>
     taxes, the whole exemption amounting to 
     <lb/>
     but sixty-one cents per head f'or the vol<lb break="no"/>unteers in King's County. They thought: 
     <lb/>
     being exempted from six dollars taxes, 
     <lb/>
     would exempt them from statute labour, 
     <lb/>
     and a case was brought to trial, when the 
     <lb/>
     Chief Justice have his decision that it did 
     <lb/>
    not exempt them from statute labour. 
     <lb/>Therefore it was unfair that the volun<lb break="no"/>teers in the rural districts, who had to 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     travel some distance to attend drill,<lb/>should be exempted from so small an<lb/>amount; while the volunteers in the ci<lb break="no"/>ties who had but a short distance to o to<lb/>attend drill, are exempted from a larger<lb/>amount in consequence of their taxes be<lb break="no"/>ing higher.<lb/>
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> said he would have<lb/>had another section prepared for the Bill,<lb/>if he had known it was going to be in<lb break="no"/>troduced. The volunteers were exempted<lb/>to the extent of six dollars, and if his 
     <lb/>taxes were rated under that amount, he 
     <lb/>was disfranchised, because by the terms 
     <lb/>of their charter, no man could vote unless 
     <lb/>he had a receipt for his taxes from the 
     <lb/>City Treasurer. He had serious doubts 
     <lb/>whether this exemption should be a local 
     <lb/>charge. If five or six hundred volunteers 
     <lb/>in Fredericton were ordered to the North 
     <lb/>Shore, they should share the burden. 
     <lb/>They should have six dollars paid them 
     <lb/>out of the militia treasury, and let it come<lb/>in as a portion of the expenditure for the <lb/>militia. He hoped the hon. mover would<lb/>allow progress to be reported, so that an<lb/>additional section might be added to the<lb/>Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> thought they should<lb/>do all they could to encourage the volun<lb break="no"/>teer movement. There is a great com0<lb/>plaint made in St. John about these ex<lb break="no"/>emptions. they want to raise a certain<lb/>amount of money for a local purpose, and<lb/>when the assessment is made they do not<lb/>know the number of volunteers who are<lb/>relieved from a portion of their taxes,<lb/>which causes irregularity. If the volun<lb break="no"/>teers were for the defence of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, their expenses should be provided<lb/>out of the general revenue.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. OTTY explained that the second<lb/>section of the bill would provide a reme<lb break="no"/>dy for the irregularity complained of.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>COL. BOYD fully concurred with the<lb/>remarks made by his hon. friend from<lb/>York, in thinking that the expense should<lb/>be provided for by the Province at large.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. ANGLIN thought that the volun<lb break="no"/>teers of St. John did not want any ex<lb break="no"/>emptions from taxes, but they expected<lb/>when they gave their time and services<lb/>for the benefit of the Province, they<lb/>should not have to put their hands in<lb/>their pockets and be compelled to pay<lb/>the expenses necessary to be incurred for<lb/>the purpose. The least the public could<lb/>do, would be to provide them with all<lb/>things necessary for the purpose of en<lb break="no"/>abling them to learn their drill. They<lb/>should have a proper drill room, supplied<lb/>with arms, and if they were required to<lb/>wear uniform it should be provided.<lb/>Everything should be provided from the<lb/>Provincial revenues, or by the united ac<lb break="no"/>tion of the Province with the localities.<lb/>In the City of St. John half the expense<lb/>should be provided by the Province, and <lb/>half by the City and County. It was not<lb/>dealing fair with them, that it should be<lb/>necessary that concrts should be go up<lb/>for their benefit, or that they should beg<lb/>from door to door to put a coat on their<lb/>backs. He would protest against that,<lb/>and he hoped their claims upon the coun<lb break="no"/>try would be acknowledged.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. LINDSAY said the present law<lb/>did not work fairly, for it was not right<lb/>that the poor man should be relieved of<lb/>but one dollar while the rich mand was<lb/>relieved of six, for they both lost the same<lb/>time. If they were going to keep up the<lb/>volunteer system, the money should come<lb/>from the Provincial revenues of the<lb/>country. They did not get the right<lb/>class of men to attend the Camp of In<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>struction. They were men who were<lb/>here to-day and away tomorrow, and<lb/>merely went there to have a jolly time. 
     <lb/>If they could have got the young men of 
     <lb/>the country, it would have been some 
     <lb/>benefit. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     MR. MCMILLAN remarked that they 
     <lb/>
    should all be put on on equal footing, and 
     <lb/>not allow one man to receive $1 and an<lb break="no"/>other $6 for the same service. In regard 
     <lb/>to their having a free passage on the rail<lb break="no"/>way, when attending militia duties, he 
     <lb/>thought the railway was Provincial pro<lb break="no"/>perty, and they should be allowed 
     <lb/>travel on it for that purpose. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     MR. McCLELLAN thought something 
     <lb/>
     should be done to aid and encourage 
     <lb/>them, but he objected to this Bill on ac-<lb break="maybe"/>acount of the rich man being exempted<lb/>from more taxes than the poor man.<lb/>Then in regard to localities, a martial<lb/>feeling may exist in one portion of the<lb/>country, in consequence of encourage<lb break="no"/>ments held out, and that portion of the<lb/>country would have to bear the burden of<lb/>these taxes, while the whole Province<lb/>would receive the benefit. It would also<lb/>disfranchise these volunteers, from whom<lb/>we want an expression of opinion, as<lb/>they were likely to be men of thought,<lb/>who took an interest in the affairs of the<lb/>country. their names would not go on<lb/>the Revisor's list, unless they made ap<lb break="no"/>plication to the Revisors; many of them<lb/>would not make this application, and, in<lb/>consequence, would be unable to vote.<lb/>The last section says, they shall pass<lb/>over the railway free of expense. It is<lb/>not fair that certain parties in the County<lb/>of Kings should have a privilege which is<lb/>denied to the rest of the Province. This<lb/>whole system of free passage on the rail<lb break="no"/>road was bad. It was a subject he in<lb break="no"/>tended to enquire into this session, to<lb/>ascertain how many people are allowed to<lb/>pass over the road free of expense. he was<lb/>inclined to think there was a great many<lb/>individuals went over that railroad free.<lb/>The members of the Govenrment pass<lb/>over free, and he was not sure but their<lb/>supporters passed over free too.<lb/>HON. MR. SMITH supposed he in<lb break="no"/>tended his observations to apply to the<lb/>late Government, as the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had not been long in power, and<lb/>has had the control of it only for a few<lb/>months. It was very well for him to<lb/>say he had suspicions of this, and that<lb/>some enquiry ought to be made to see<lb/>whether those suspicions were well<lb/>grounded or not. He thought Mr.<lb/>Lawrence deserved the greatest credit,<lb/>as he saved from fifteen to twenty<lb/>thousand dollars in the expenses con<lb break="no"/>nected with that railroad. (Mr. Lind<lb break="no"/>say -\- I should like to see an account of<lb/>it.) He was speaking of facts. Mr.<lb/>Lawrence had paid a larger sum into<lb/>the reventues than ever had been paid<lb/>before, and that was good proof that<lb/>there was not many free passages. He<lb/>had reduced the running of the trains,<lb/>and had reduced the staff. He only<lb/>runs one through train per day, which<lb/>afforded as much accommodation to the<lb/>country as they wanted. When this<lb/>House came to examine the matter they<lb/>would sse what Mr. Lawrence had done,<lb/>and they would be disposed to give him<lb/>every praise for the manner in which he<lb/>had conducted the Railway. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Bill before the House, he<lb/>would like to give every encourage<lb break="no"/>ment to the Volunteers; but there should<lb/>be some provision to make the exemp<lb break="no"/>tion more equal, and to prevent their<lb/>
