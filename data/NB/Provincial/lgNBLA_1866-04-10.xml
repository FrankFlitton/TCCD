            <!--<p>would be impossible for the members of<lb/>the Government to be in their seats, and<lb/>in their absence they did not know what<lb/>might be brought before the House. The<lb/>request he had made on behalf of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was reasonable, and the usual<lb/>one adopted, and he thought it might be<lb/>complied with.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. CONNELL acquiesced in the re<lb break="no"/>quest of the Attorney General, for although<lb/>the local business of the country might be<lb/>gone on with, yet it was customary to<lb/>adjourn if the Government were not in a<lb/>position to carry on the general business.<lb/>He thought the time asked should be<lb/>granted.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. MCCLELAN did not wish to throw<lb/>any obstacles in the way of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, but he was of the opinion that<lb/>matters not connected with the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment might be carried on by the House,<lb/>and this was the only object he had in<lb/>view in offering his remarks.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. GILBERT had important Bills<lb/>to bring in, yet if circumstances were such<lb/>that the Government were compelled to<lb/>ask for an adjournment, common courtesy<lb/>required that it should be granted<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. WETMORE had not spoken with<lb/>a view to oppose the Government, but,<lb/>knowing that a large number of local<lb/>Bills had to be passed, he though that<lb/>these, as the Government were not con<lb break="no"/>nected with, nor affected by them, might<lb/>be taken up in committee and got<lb/>through with.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of MR. NEEDHAM, the<lb/>House then adjourned till to-morrow at<lb/>3 o'clock P. M.<lb/>J. MARCH.<lb/>

            <p>After the Journals were read, the House<lb/>adjourned until half-past two to-morrow,<lb/>at the request of <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. Smith</persName>, who<lb/>stated that the Government had tendered<lb/>their resignations to His Excellency, but<lb/>the acceptance had not been received or<lb/>the correspondence closed.</p>

<!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

           <!-- <p>WEDNESDAY, APRIL 11.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The House met pursuant to the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment at half-past two P. M.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. KERR moved the House into<lb/>Committee of the Whole on a Bill to in<lb break="no"/>corporate the Northern Bank.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON MR. SMITH then rose and said,<lb/>that he had hoped to have been ready to<lb/>give the reasons why the Government had<lb/>tendered their resignations, but regretted<lb/>he was not yet in a position to do so.<lb/>He had just received a note from the<lb/>Governor saying that he could not give a<lb/>reply to them till four or five o'clock, and<lb/>as under these circumstances it was usual<lb/>to adjourn from day to day, he was com<lb break="no"/>pelled again to ask the indulgence of the<lb/>Houser.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. KERR thought that local matters<lb/>could be gone on with without affecting<lb/>the position of the Government. If he<lb/>imagined that anything could arise to<lb/>affect them, he would [illegible] made [illegible]<lb/>motion. It would probably be three or<lb/>four days before that would be [illegible]<lb/>take up any business of general interest,<lb/>but in the meantime he should like the<lb/>local business to be transacted.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. FISHER said they should remem-<lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>ber that the request for adjournment came<lb/>from the Government, and though he felt<lb/>the necessity of proceeding with the local<lb/>business yet he could not feel it his duty<lb/>to proceed against their motion. He did<lb/>not look for the effect the going on might<lb/>have on the past or present, but on the<lb/>future, and as it was usual to adjourn, he<lb/>was in favor of allowing the Government<lb/>time to conclude their correspondence.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. BOYD said, as the House had<lb/>heard from the Attorney General that the<lb/>Governor had not yet returned an answer<lb/>to their resignation, it was their duty to<lb/>adjourn in compliance with the request of<lb/>the Government.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. SUTTON could see no reasona<lb break="no"/>ble objection to the House proceeding<lb/>with local business whilst the correspon<lb/>dence between the Government and the<lb/>Governor was pending.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. MR. SMITH reiterated that it<lb/>was usual to adjourn the House from day<lb/>to day under such circumstances as the<lb/>Government were now placed, but it was<lb/>in the hands of the House to adjourn or<lb/>go on, as they saw fit.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. GILBERT said this Province was<lb/>not a Crown Colony, but was ruled by a<lb/>Government responsible to the people,<lb/>and exigencies having arisen to cause the<lb/>Government to tender their resignation,<lb/>and a reply to the same not having been<lb/>yet received, he though the House must<lb/>adjourn in compliance with the request of<lb/>the Attorney General. The difficulty<lb/>would be to distinguish between general<lb/>and local business, or where the line<lb/>should be drawn. Under responsible and<lb/>departmental Government all business<lb/>transacted by this House must be con<lb break="no"/>sidered as affecting the general interests<lb/>of the Province, and although business<lb/>might be retarded for a few days by the<lb/>adjournment, yet a precedent must be es<lb break="no"/>tablished that the Government must be in<lb/>a working condition for the business to<lb/>be constitutional, and he should, there<lb break="no"/>fore, support the motion for adjournment.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. THOMPSON said they knew what<lb/>the rules of the British Government were<lb/>on this point, and though time was lost,<lb/>yet it enabled the members to know ex<lb break="no"/>actly how matters stood. He wanted to<lb/>go on constitutionally, manly and fairly,<lb/>and to see the principles established car<lb break="no"/>ried out. A change was made in our<lb/>Constitution about fifteen years ago, by<lb/>those who he believed were seeking office,<lb/>yet having now a responsible Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or having had it up to within the<lb/>past few days, he thought the House<lb/>should adjourn, or they would be like a<lb/>balloon with the cords cut, and go up<lb/>God knows where. To proceed consti<lb break="no"/>tutionally required time, and as the At<lb break="no"/>torney General had asked for an adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment they should do so and save the<lb/>trouble and bother that would otherwise<lb/>arise. The hon. member for York (Mr.<lb/>Fisher) was one of the framers of the plan<lb/>of departmental Government, and he did<lb/>not want to see him like a child with a<lb/>card house, up foot and knock down all<lb/>his work. He was little of a politician,<lb/>and had taken up very little of the time<lb/>Â <lb/>given to talking, but rather to listening,<lb/>
            </p>

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     and had only spoken now to jog the mem<lb break="no"/>ory of the hon, member for York, as they<lb/>all knew the least drop was sometimes<lb/>sufficient to stimulate.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. ANGLIN said it was always the<lb/>case under circumstances like the present<lb/>to adjourn from day to day. He did not<lb/>like this lounging about, not at work, yet<lb/>he believed that a number of hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers had been hard at work during the<lb/>past few days, and they looked as though<lb/>they had heavy care upon their minds.<lb/>The Government might be considered in<lb/>a moribund condition, and as the hon.<lb/>member, the late head of the Opposition,<lb/>but who now, he supposed, he must ad<lb break="no"/>dress as the hon. member for York, would<lb/>naturally be very busy, he thought time<lb/>should be given those forming a new admin<lb break="no"/>istration to mature their plans, and as<lb/>under the circumstances it could not be<lb/>expected that the members of the mori<lb break="no"/>bund Government, as well as the leading<lb/>members of the Opposition, would be able<lb/>to be in their seats, there would be very<lb/>few to discuss the questions that came<lb/>before them, if they should decide to go<lb/>on with Bills of a local character. Under<lb/>such circumstances, matters might be<lb/>brought before the House of great im<lb break="no"/>portance, and carried without the know<lb break="no"/>ledge of many of the members. The hon.<lb/>member for Charlotte (Mr. Thompson)<lb/>had spoken of Responsible Government<lb/>as a balloon with its cords cut, and gone<lb/>off, no one knows where, but he rather<lb/>regarded it as gone up and collapsed.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     HON. MR. HATHEWAY sid the 
     <lb/>Provincial Secretary was away attending<lb/>the supposed death-bed of his father, and<lb/>as soon as the memorandum had been<lb/>sent to and received from him, the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment had laid their resignations be<lb break="no"/>fore the Governor. Time must be given<lb/>to prepare the reply, and the Government<lb/>was not to blame for any delay. His<lb/>hon. friend from Northumberland (Mr.<lb/>Kerr) had never been a member of a Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. If he had, he would not find<lb/>it so very comfortable.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. WILMOT said the delay was first<lb/>charged to the Opposition, and then to<lb/>the Government. He had been in many<lb/>Governments, and had resigned three<lb/>times. The last time it took from Janu<lb break="no"/>ary till April to get a reply accepting it,<lb/>and now the question was, how long would<lb/>it take by the rate of proportion to get a <lb/>reply to the resignation of eight men ?<lb/>He did not understand his hon colleague's<lb/>(Mr. Anglin) reference to the time re<lb break="no"/>quired by what he had termed the " late<lb/>Opposition," but he could assure his hon.<lb/>friend and the House that, so far as he<lb/>was concerned, he was ready to go on<lb/>with the business.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY would en<lb break="no"/>dorse the sentiments of the hon. member<lb/>for St. John, (Mr. Wilmot), and further<lb/>state that there was no question of "cour<lb break="no"/>tesy" to the Opposition. They do not<lb/>ask for the " courtesy" of time to be<lb/>granted to mature plans, and did not<lb/>want it. He came here an independent<lb/>member, and when it was remembered<lb/>that he came to support the Government,<lb/>said that Government had [illegible] to intro<lb break="no"/>duce measures for the good of the coun<lb break="no"/>try.<lb/>
            </p>
