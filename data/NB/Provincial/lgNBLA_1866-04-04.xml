<!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

     <!--of momentary duration, that they them<lb break="no"/>selves cannot rely upon."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     This gentleman's idea coincides with 
     <lb/>my own. That was the reason they<lb/>wanted us to swallow it now, for the<lb/>more it was looked into the more hide<lb break="no"/>ous it would appear. I lately read of a<lb/>ghost which appeared in the United<lb/>States, which had three descriptions of<lb/>heads and two descriptions of horns ; its<lb/>eyes were like fiery streams illuminating<lb/>all around with a greenish blue flame<lb/>That was the ghost of Confederation let<lb/>down there, and they did not know it.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. Cardwell said that Scheme could   
     <lb/>be altered, and this is what he writes<lb/>back to Lord Monck :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" Her Majesty's Government have gi<lb break="no"/>ven to your despatch and to the resolu<lb break="no"/>tions of the Conference, their most deli<lb break="no"/>berate consideration. They have re<lb break="no"/>garded them as a whole, and as having<lb/>been designed by those who framed them<lb/>to establish as complete and perfect a<lb/>union of the whole into one Government,<lb/>as the circumstances of the case and a<lb/>due consideration of existing interests<lb/>would admit. They accept them, therefore<lb/>as being in the deliberate judgment of<lb/>those best qualified to decide upon the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, the best framework of a measure to be<lb/>passed by the Imperial Parliament for at<lb break="no"/>taining that most desirable result."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Cardwell acknowledges the Scheme<lb/>was right, because they were best quali<lb break="no"/>fied to decide upon it. Our Government<lb/>said to Mr. Cardwell, we will not adopt<lb/>it, for we are the best judges of it, but<lb/>Mr. Cardwell does not believe that, be<lb break="no"/>cause it does not suit his purpose, for he<lb/>thinks this union will be a most desirable<lb/>result, and will relieve him of a vast<lb/>amount of difficulty. He says it is the<lb/>best framework of a measure—our dele<lb break="no"/>gates told us it was a building perfect,<lb/>with foundation and superstructure all<lb/>complete. Why then does Mr. Cardwell<lb/>call it a framework set up, which has to<lb/>be finished ? He is perfectly satisfied<lb/>that if that Scheme was adopted, it would<lb/>add new burdens to the country. He says :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" Her Majesty's Government cannot<lb/>but express the earnest hope that the ar<lb break="no"/>rangements which may be adopted in this<lb/>respect may not be of such a nature as<lb/>to increase—at least in any considerable<lb/>degree—the whole expenditure, or to<lb/>make any material addition to the taxa<lb break="no"/>tion, and thereby retard the internal in<lb break="no"/>dustry or tend to impose new burdens on<lb/>the commerce of the country."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Although willing for Confederation,<lb/>Mr. Cardwell puts on record that he gave<lb/>us warning, whether we choose to take it<lb/>or not. In regard to this $10,000,000 to<lb/>be spent in Railroads. How and when<lb/>do we get it and who is to pay for it.<lb/>Our revenue in ten years will amount to<lb/>$10,000,000, and we can have this ex<lb break="no"/>panded in the country year by year with<lb break="no"/>out going into Confederation. In Cana<lb break="no"/>da everything is taxed, and they have<lb/>even enacted a stamp act, and when we<lb/>go into Confederation our taxes will have<lb/>to conform to theirs. I will support the<lb/>Government as long as they are true to<lb/>anti–Confederate principles, and no man<lb/>can charge me with being inconsistent in<lb/>this matter. I hope to see the day come<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>23<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
    

            <p>when this question will be settled and<lb/>settled for ever. I know there are men<lb/>whose souls soar away beyond us, who<lb/>are satiated with all the little New<lb/>Brunswick can give them, and they reach<lb/>forward to the celebrated towers and pa<lb break="no"/>laces of the far-off Ottawa ; for this they<lb/>would let New Brunswick go to the winds<lb/>and be lost for ever. Bring us near to<lb/>the darling of our souls, the far away Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa, with its miles of cornice and its<lb/>acres of plaster, and let us revel there in<lb/>vice-regal glory. But there are loyal<lb/>sons of New Brunswick who will not be<lb/>carried away by all this splendor, and when<lb/>the time comes, it will be seen that this<lb/>splendor has been like a dissolving view<lb/>to their eyes, become " the baseless fa<lb break="no"/>bric of a vision which leaves not a wreck<lb/>behind." In conclusion, I will thank the<lb/>members of the House for having listen<lb break="no"/>ed to me so long, for I felt I could not do<lb/>justice to myself and to the question if I<lb/>occupied less time than I have done. I<lb/>regret that it is out of my power to bring<lb/>before this House all that I would like to<lb/>bring before them, in order that the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the country may understand the<lb/>question. I have shown enough I think<lb/>to satisfy hon. members that I have a<lb/>right to take the stand I do, that I have<lb/>a right to feel I am pursuing an honest<lb/>and disinterested course in sustaining<lb/>that Government, who have determined<lb/>with me to resist to the political death<lb/>any onslaught on the rights and liberties<lb/>of this free people ; and I, so far as I am<lb/>concerned in this matter, believe I stand<lb/>connected with men and with a party of<lb/>men who are quite willing to endorse the<lb/>principles of the Poet :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Strike till the last armed foe expires,<lb/>Strike for our altars and our fires,<lb/>Strike for the green graves of our aires,<lb/>For God and our native land.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>When I forget my country so far as to<lb/>sell it for Confederation, may my right<lb/>hand forget its cunning, and if I do not<lb/>prefer New Brunswick, as she is, to Ca<lb break="no"/>nada with all her glory, then let my<lb/>tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.<lb/>When the day comes when we shall have,<lb/>according to the wish of my hon. friend<lb/>from Charlotte (Mr. Hill), Confederation<lb/>deposited in the grave, those that will be<lb/>there will not be there as mourners, but<lb/>as glorifiers, and they will sing, with<lb/>hearts elate with patriotic joy :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Then safely moored, our perils o'er,<lb/>We'll sing the songs of Jubilee,<lb/>For ever and for ever more,<lb/>New Brunswick, Land of Liberty.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The House then adjourned until 10 A.M.<lb/>to-morrow.<lb/>T. P. D.<lb/>

            </head>
            <p>On motion of MR. OTTY, the House<lb/>went into committe on<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" A BILL RELATING TO WEIGHTS."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OTTY1">MR. OTTY</persName> said the object of the Bill<lb/>was sufficiently explained by the Bill.<lb/>By it, instead of having 112 lbs to the<lb/>hundred weight, they would have the<lb/>decimal system, which would be much<lb/>more convenient in weighing all kinds of<lb/>produce. They had adopted it in Eng<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
      
land, after discussing it in Parliament for 
     <lb/>many years. It is upon the same princi<lb break="no"/>ple as an Act passed in Canada in 1858.<lb/>This Bill had been approved of by the<lb/>Agricultural Societies of King's County,<lb/>and also by the Apricultural Board, and<lb/>no doubt it will be approved of by the<lb/>people of the Province.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">COL. BOYD</persName> said the Bill was in favor 
     <lb/>of the seller and against the buyer.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName> said it was a Bill which 
     <lb/>they had had before them for several years.<lb/>He would ask what advantage there was<lb/>in having these continual changes. This<lb/>Bill was got up, not so much for simplifying<lb/>transactions, as to sell a smaller quantity<lb/>of produce by a measure which would<lb/>convey the idea to the buyers that they<lb/>were receiving a larger quantity. It did<lb/>not make any difference in the weighting<lb/>and the calculation whether they marked an<lb/>article 100 or 112. They had a law say<lb break="no"/>ing what weight should constitute a bushel<lb/>of potatoes, but it was disregarded. They<lb/>ought to be very careful in passing laws<lb/>which will be disregarded, because when<lb/>laws are disregarded it has a tendency to<lb/>bring all laws into contempt.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HILL1">MR. HILL</persName> believed the Bill did not go     
     <lb/>far enough. It ought to included potatoes<lb/>and all other things that are sold by<lb/>weight. We should simplify these things.<lb/>The old established usages are very well<lb/>in their place, but we should progress.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. LINDSAY</persName> moved an additional<lb/>section, that the standard weight of oats<lb/>be 33 1-3 lbs.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">HON. MR. HATHEWAY</persName> saw no need<lb/>of the amendment, as the weight of the<lb/>oats always regulated the price. The<lb/>Bill would cause a great deal of incon<lb break="no"/>venience, as the weights throughout the<lb/>country were according to the present<lb/>method.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">MR. KERR</persName> spoke against reducing the<lb/>standard weight of oats. If under Con<lb break="no"/>federation he would go for the Bill, but<lb/>did not think it was called for at present.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName> said hundreds and 
     <lb/>bushels were arbitrary sounds, which<lb/>from habit and practice convey certain<lb/>ideas. If they were so anxious to get rid<lb/>of the old system, they might as well do<lb/>away with it altogether. In the old<lb/>country everything is sold by weight,<lb/>which is the proper way. If we are going<lb/>to have decimals let us introduce the<lb/>whole system. If you introduce a revo<lb break="no"/>lution in these things, it would be some<lb/>time before it would be understood<lb/>throughout the country, and a great many<lb/>disputes would arise.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">MR. MCCLELLAN</persName> spoke in favor of the Bill. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> said that altering the<lb/>standard weights did not regulate the<lb/>price, for if they sold a less quantity they<lb/>were paid in proportion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said that goods going<lb/>over the railway paid their freight on the<lb/>decimal system, and were bought and<lb/>sold by the old method, which led to con<lb break="no"/>siderable inconvenience and sometimes<lb/>to miscalculation.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SCOV1">MR. SCOVIL</persName> said the true principle<lb/>was that all produce should be weighed,<lb/>which was the only way of determining<lb/>the worth of the article, and this Bill<lb/>provided the most simple way of calcu<lb break="no"/>lating those weights.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR. CONNELL</persName> said that oats in the<lb/>State of Maine were sold at thirty pounds<lb/>to the bushel.

     they would weigh heavier and the would 
     <lb/>
     get the benefit.   lt was very desireable 
     <lb/>
     that there should be a law to provide for 
     <lb/>
     the inspection of batter and pork, in or<lb break="no"/>der that their value might not be deprecia<lb break="no"/>ted.

            <p><persName ref="pers:CUDL1">HON. MR. CUDLIP</persName> spoke in favor of

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:BEVE1">MR. BEVBRIDGE</persName> said this Bill would

     simplify business end prevent mistakes.

     Since they had adopted the decimal sys<lb break="no"/>tem in money matters, they should reduce

     all their business to the same system.

     The Bill was agreed to, and the addi<lb break="no"/>tional section lost.

            </head>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SUTT1">MR. SUTTON</persName> said that as every mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House was expected to speak 
     <lb/>
     on this question, he would have to say a 
     <lb/>
     few words. He felt rather abashed in 
     <lb/>
     rising to address them, after the eloquent 
     <lb/>
     speech which they had listened to for 
     <lb/>
     three days. In regard to the debate be<lb break="no"/>ing delayed, he did not blame either the 
     <lb/>
     Government or the Opposition. He would 
     <lb/>
     not delay it by making a long speech. 
     <lb/>
     When he come forward as a candidate 
     <lb/>
     for a seat in this House, he (Mr. S.) and 
     <lb/>
       two of his colleagues declared themselves 
     <lb/>
    in favor of Confederation. The County 
     <lb/>which he represented had never changed 
     <lb/>their opinion on this question, and he re<lb break="no"/>presented their interest in that great 
     <lb/>Scheme. To go into an argument to 
     <lb/>show how we would be benefitted by it, 
     <lb/>would take up too much time. This    
     <lb/>great question had been made a party 
     <lb/>question, and no person could get office 
     <lb/>under the Government unless he was op<lb break="no"/>posed to the policy of union. He would 
     <lb/>offer no factious opposition to any mea<lb break="no"/>sure which would be a benefit to the 
     <lb/>country. He did not believe that the 
     <lb/>North Shore had a sufficient number of 
     <lb/>members in the Government, for at the 
     <lb/>present there was not a single indi<lb break="no"/>vidual to represent them, as the Hon. Mr. 
     <lb/>Hutchison was absent. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:PERK1">MR. PERKINS</persName> did not think it ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to make a long speech. He was 
     <lb/>
     fully prepared to support the Government 
     <lb/>
     in the stand they had taken against Con<lb break="no"/>federation, believing, as he did, that the 
     <lb/>
     Quebec scheme would be ruinous to the 
     <lb/>
     best interests and liberties of the people 
     <lb/>
     of this Province. The present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment have conducted the general busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the country in a satisfactory man<lb break="no"/>ner, under great disadvantage, for they 
     <lb/>
     had a great pressure brought against 
     <lb/>
     them; especially by a few disappointed 
     <lb/>
     politicians. He would vote against the 
     <lb/>
    amendment.

            <p><persName ref="pers:LAND1">MR. LANDRY</persName> said it would appear 
     <lb/>that he had been sent into the market 
     <lb/>when he came into the Legislature, and 
     <lb/>he would like to know whether he was 
     <lb/>going to be sold by wholesale or retail. 
     <lb/>He thought he was worth more than they 
     <lb/>were disposed to give him; if he could 
     <lb/>not get more, he would not sell himself. 
     <lb/>He would not say whether this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had done right or wrong, as he did 
     <lb/>not consider that this was the question. 
     <lb/>The real question before the House was 
     <lb/>Confederation, and he was sent here to

     sustain the Government on that ques<lb break="no"/>tion. If he went back to his constituents, 
     <lb/>
     and they were in favor of Confederation,  
     <lb/>
     he would go for it, but he did not think 
     <lb/>
     they had changed their mind on the 
     <lb/>
     question. He had often been asked why 
     <lb/>
     he was not anxious to unite with the 
     <lb/>
     French people of Canada. He would 
     <lb/>
     like to unite with the French, but there 
     <lb/>
     were people there worse than the French, 
     <lb/>
     with whom he did not wish to have my 
     <lb/>
     thing to do. Though he would vote with 
     <lb/>
     the Government on this question, as it in<lb break="no"/>volved Confederation, they need not ex<lb break="no"/>pect him to vote with them on my other 
     <lb/>question. As an example of the speeches 
     <lb/>that would be delivered in Confederate 
     <lb/>Parliament, he finished his speech in 
     <lb/>French. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     By the amendment to the reply to the 
     <lb/>
     speech, which to now under discussion in 
     <lb/>
     this Assembly, we are called upon to 
     <lb/>
     pass sentence upon the acts of this 
     <lb/>
     Government during the past year. They 
     <lb/>
     are arrainged by this amendmant as being 
     <lb/>
     unworthy of the confidence of this House 
     <lb/>
     and of the people of this Province. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     This Assembly is the jury before whom 
     <lb/>
     this cause is to be tried in the first in<lb break="no"/>stance, and from our decision lies, soon<lb break="no"/>er or later, the appeal to the Supreme 
     <lb/>
     Court of the people. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It is for us to examine the counts of 
     <lb/>
     this indictment and decide upon them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For the motives of our decision, we are 
     <lb/>
     responsible to our own consciences. For 
     <lb/>
     the wisdom. of that decision, we are re<lb break="no"/>sponsible to our constituents. I have heard 
     <lb/>
     something said to and fro in this debate 
     <lb/>
     about men being held personally respon<lb break="no"/>sible for what they said. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Beyond that which I have before men<lb break="no"/>tioned, I acknowledge responsibility to 
     <lb/>
     no men or set of men. I propose to take 
     <lb/>
     up the different charges against the Gov 
     <lb/>
     ernment so far as I can remember them, 
     <lb/>
     and examine whether, singly or collect<lb break="no"/>ively, they furnish sufficient grounds for 
     <lb/>
     their condemnation. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In the first piece they did not call the 
     <lb/>
     House together soon enough. I did not 
     <lb/>
     understand the hon. mover of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment to say that this was a cause of loss 
     <lb/>
     to the country at large, but rather a 
     <lb/>
     source of inconvenience to the members 
     <lb/>
     of the House, by keeping these from the 
     <lb/>
     rural districts from their farming labors. 
     <lb/>
     Now if the hon. mover and his suppor<lb break="no"/>ters will unite in expediting the business 
     <lb/>
     of the session, and abstain from all fac<lb break="no"/>tious opposition, I think this inconve<lb break="no"/>nience may be in a great degree remedied. 
     <lb/>
     Besides, I think that this charge comes 
     <lb/>
     with ill-grace from the hon. member, act<lb break="no"/>ing in concert with the members of the 
     <lb/>
     late Government, who dissolved the late 
     <lb/>
     House, brought on an election in this 
     <lb/>
     very month, and forced the Legislature 
     <lb/>
     to be called together nt is much later sea<lb break="no"/>son than the present session was called. 
     <lb/>
     The intermission has been two months 
     <lb/>
     shorter than is ordinarily the case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     In Nova Scotia, which is much more 
     <lb/>
     exclusively a farming country, the session 
     <lb/>
     has but commenced; and in Canada, 
     <lb/>
     where they do rather more farming than 
     <lb/>
     in New Brunswick, the session will be still 
     <lb/>
     a month later. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>But I presume that the hon. mover seen 
     <lb/>this matter in a very different light, when 
     <lb/>applied to his friends the Hon. Messrs. 
     <lb/>Galt and Tupper, from its application to 
     <lb/>the Hon. Mr. Smith.    
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But they have not filled up the offices 
     <lb/>of Solicitor General and Auditor Gene<lb break="no"/>ral. I am perfectly willing that they shall 
     <lb/>
            

            <cb/>
        

     leave the offices of Solicitor General un<lb break="no"/>filled for ever. I do not think the coun<lb break="no"/>try will suffer any less in money or other<lb break="no"/>wise by this course, and I have always 
     <lb/>
     been of the opinion that in this small 
     <lb/>
     Province, with a Legislature of but forty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     one members, we have entirely too many 
     <lb/>
     departmental officers on the floor of this 
     <lb/>
    House. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
     But the hon. members say the office of 
     <lb/>
     Auditor General is a part of our Consti<lb break="no"/>tution. It does not seem to be a very 
     <lb/>
     important part. According to the ac<lb break="no"/>count of the hon. member, we are indebt<lb break="no"/>ed for its introduction into our Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion to a despatch of Lord Glenelg in 
     <lb/>
     1837. Nevertheless, the suggestions of 
     <lb/>
     that despatch were not carried off until 
     <lb/>
     the appointment of Mr. Partelow in 
     <lb/>
    1854. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Where was the great constitutional 
     <lb/>
     leader of the Opposition during all these 
     <lb/>
     seventeen years. When the office was 
     <lb/>
     filled, was it not notorious that it was 
     <lb/>
     done almost solely for the purpose of 
     <lb/>
     making provision for the gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     received the appointment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     During the last four years, when through 
     <lb/>
     blindness and other afflictions, that gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen was incapacitated from attending 
     <lb/>
     to its duties, where was our great consti<lb break="no"/>tutionalist? Should sympathy stand in 
     <lb/>
     the way of great constitutional principles 
     <lb/>
     and the pecuniary safety of the Province, 
     <lb/>
     which the hon. mover says are all in<lb break="no"/>volved in the appointment of a suitable 
     <lb/>
     man to fill this office. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I believe that the great constitutional  
     <lb/>
     part of this subject is great political 
     <lb/>
     humbug and clap-trap. I think that the 
     <lb/>
     auditing of the accounts can be as well 
     <lb/>
     and as safely done by the gentleman 
     <lb/>
     now occupying the Audit Office, or in 
     <lb/>
     connection with the Secretary's Office, 
     <lb/>
     as by the appointment of an Auditor 
     <lb/>
     General. At all events, I am willing to 
     <lb/>
     leave the decision of this matter to the 
     <lb/>
     gentlemen composing the Government 
     <lb/>
     of the country, satisfied that if the inte<lb break="no"/>rests of the country require the office to 
     <lb/>
     be filled up, it will not be left va<lb break="no"/>cant. 
     <lb/>
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the land sales, that 
     <lb/>point haa been made a political canvass of 
     <lb/>outside of the walls of this House, but 
     <lb/>has been dwelt upon much more lightly 
     <lb/>here. The standing tirades of the news<lb break="no"/>papers would scarcely bear transplanting 
     <lb/>to this Assembly. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     For my own part, I am satisfied the 
     <lb/>
    Province could well afford to make Mr. 
     <lb/>Gibson a present of that land, rather 
     <lb/>than not have his great business carried 
     <lb/>on—a business which is supplying from 
     <lb/>that single stream one-sixth of the lum<lb break="no"/>ber shipped from the River St. John— 
     <lb/>a business which has caused a permanent 
     <lb/>investment of $100,000, and which has 
     <lb/>given employment to nearly a thousand 
     <lb/>men and five hundred horses during the 
     <lb/>past winter. I may here narrate an inci<lb break="no"/>dent, showing how the investment of cap<lb break="no"/>ital is encouraged in the State of Maine. 
     <lb/>A company wished to build a factory It a 
     <lb/>small village called Lisbon, in the State 
     <lb/>of Maine. They applied to the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture for exemption from taxes for a term 
     <lb/>of ten or twenty years. The Legislature 
     <lb/>passed the Bill, and where a year ago an  
     <lb/>alder swamp stoof by the side of a brook, 
     <lb/>now stands a factory and boarding houses 
     <lb/>built at an expense of $100,000, giving 
     <lb/>employment to 200 operatives, and turn<lb break="no"/>ing out $600,000 worth of manufactured 
     <lb/>goods. Was it not better for Maine by 
     <lb/>granting this privilege, to secure so much 
     <lb/>

     employment for her people and additional 
     <lb/>
     wealth to the State ? My own opinion is 
     <lb/>
     that it would be for the interest of New 
     <lb/>
     Brunswick to sell her timber lands to all 
     <lb/>
     who may wish to purchase them: and I 
     <lb/>
     am ready, at any future time, to go into 
     <lb/>
     this matter at length, but it has not a di<lb break="no"/>rect bearing upon the present subject of 
     <lb/>
     debate sufficient to require me to dwell 
     <lb/>
     upon it now.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The lapse of the export duty was un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly an omission, and one for which 
     <lb/>
     the Government must he held responsible. 
     <lb/>
     It was the duty of the late Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, Mr. Allen, to examine the laws to 
     <lb/>
     see what renewals may be necessary, and 
     <lb/>
     although we know that he was a most 
     <lb/>
     careful and painstaking man, by some 
     <lb/>
     oversight this escaped him. For this we 
     <lb/>
     can scarcely blame the Hon. Mr. Smith 
     <lb/>
     or the Hon. Mr. Gillmor very severely, 
     <lb/>
     nor yet any member of the present Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment and I do not feel that it affords 
     <lb/>
     sufficient grounds to justify a vote of 
     <lb/>
     Want of Confidence. I was a little sur<lb break="no"/>prised at one statement made by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from York (Mr. Fisher), that if 
     <lb/>
     the British troops were sent to guard the 
     <lb/>
     frontier, they would all desert. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     It appears to me that it ill becomes 
     <lb/>
     that ultra loyal member to make so 
     <lb/>
     sweeping a charge against the soldiers of 
     <lb/>
     his country. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I am aware that this expression does 
     <lb/>
     not amount to much, but if it had been 
     <lb/>
     made by a supporter of the Government 
     <lb/>
     how it would have been heralded through 
     <lb/>
     the newspapers as an evidence of our dis<lb break="no"/>loyalty and sympathy with treason and 
     <lb/>
     Fenianism. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Again, the charge is made that the 
     <lb/>
     Government introduced politics into the 
     <lb/>
     Bench. Not until the Bench had intro<lb break="no"/>duced politics into the Court Room, the 
     <lb/>
     public resort and the polling booth. 
     <lb/>
     Could Judge Wilmot expect preferment 
     <lb/>
     from the hands of a Government whom be 
     <lb/>
     continually denounced? From the lead<lb break="no"/>ers of a party whose principles he pro<lb break="no"/>fessed to despise and abhor? I do not 
     <lb/>
     pretend to set in judgment upon his 
     <lb/>
     course of action—I do not pretend to de<lb break="no"/>cide upon his legal or moral right to set 
     <lb/>
     as an advocate of this scheme—as an op<lb break="no"/>ponent of this Government. But, I pre<lb break="no"/>sume, that when he took his course he 
     <lb/>
     was willing to take also its responsibility. 
     <lb/>
     That he expected no preferment from this 
     <lb/>
     Government, and when he received none, 
     <lb/>
     I presume he made no complaint. And 
     <lb/>
     it appears to me that it is most undigni<lb break="no"/>fied in the political friends of that gentle<lb break="no"/>man to now come whining an com<lb break="no"/>plaining over the natural consequences of 
     <lb/>
     his own course of action. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The hon. member from York (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Fisher) said that be was not ashamed of 
     <lb/>
     the way in which he got here. I presume 
     <lb/>
     that he thinks he obtained his seat for the 
     <lb/>
     County of York by straightforward and 
     <lb/>
     honorable means. If, on the platform and 
     <lb/>
     through the press a most unscrupulous 
     <lb/>
     misrepresentation of your opponents—if 
     <lb/>
     taking advantage of the Fenian cry to 
     <lb/>
     excite religious dissention and strife—if 
     <lb/>
     appeals to every sentiment of religious 
     <lb/>
    bigotry and prejudice—if the free use of 
     <lb/>money to corrupt the electors of the 
     <lb/>County—if all these are honorable means 
     <lb/>then his claim is a just one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>  It is said that confederation has noth<lb break="no"/>ing to do with the subject of this debate; 
     <lb/>that there is no confederation in this 
     <lb/>amendment. Yes, Mr. Speaker, but there 
     <lb/>is <hi rendition="simple:italic">much</hi> confederation <hi rendition="simple:italic">under</hi> it.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>This motion—this attack upon the 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
          

     Government is but a part and a continua-   
     <lb/>ion of the plan of action for upsetting<lb/>
     this Government and carrying the Quebec 
     <lb/>
    Scheme, which has been is operation 
     <lb/>since the close of last session. And none 
     <lb/>know this better than the hon. members, 
     <lb/>who, elected as anti-Confederates, are now 
     <lb/>playing into the hands of the Opposition. 
     <lb/>False to their principles, recreant to their professions,    
     <lb/>professions, they now seek to stab the<lb/>very party upon whose shoulders they 
     <lb/>were borne into power as members of this 
     <lb/>Legislature.     
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The hon. member from York said that 
     <lb/>this Government were as low in public 
     <lb/>estimation as it was possible for men to 
     <lb/>become. If this is not true, as I hold it is 
     <lb/>not; it is not owing to any want of effort 
     <lb/>on the part of the party-to which that gen<lb break="no"/>tleman belongs. And what means have 
     <lb/>they used ? Means the most unfair and 
     <lb/>dishonorable. But here I wish to make 
     <lb/>exception of many members of the Con<lb break="no"/>federate party. Both on the floor of this 
     <lb/>House and throughout the country, there 
     <lb/>are many who are honorable men, and 
     <lb/>who would seek ro carry their views by 
     <lb/>fair and honorable means alone. Such 
     <lb/>men we honor and respect though we 
     <lb/>differ from them. If they can carry con<lb break="no"/>federation on the Quebec Scheme, or any 
     <lb/>other, in this Province by fair arguments, 
     <lb/>we shall have no right to complain. The 
     <lb/>minority must submit to the majority. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>Reference has been made to the lectures 
     <lb/>of the Hon. Mr. Tilley throughout the 
     <lb/>country. I can only say that I heard him 
     <lb/>in my own place, and that his address 
     <lb/>there was in perfect good taste. He 
     <lb/>confined himself entirely to the subject 
     <lb/>of Confederation, and made no allusion 
     <lb/>whatever to the Government or  
     <lb/>any of its members. I conceive Mr.<lb/>Tilley has a perfect right to present his 
     <lb/>views to the country in this manner ; and 
     <lb/>were these the means adopted by the ad<lb break="no"/>vocates of the Confederation—fair argument  
     <lb/>on the platform and through the press— 
     <lb/>it would be for us to meet them in like 
     <lb/>manner, and, if beaten before the people, 
     <lb/>to submit like men to the inevitable. But 
     <lb/>such have <hi rendition="simple:italic">not</hi> been the only means. This 
     <lb/>Government has not been the <hi rendition="simple:italic">best</hi> but 
     <lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">worst</hi> abused Government that this 
     <lb/>Province has ever seen.Through the 
     <lb/>columns of a most unscrupulous press,<lb/>the people have been told that they were<lb/>traitors to their country, insulters of their<lb/>Queen; that they were dishonorable, in<lb break="no"/>capable and ignorant. The whole voca<lb break="no"/>bulary of Bil ingagate has been heaped<lb/>upon their heads. Articles most unfair, <lb/>most disgraceful, most indecent, have<lb/>been scattered broadcast through the<lb/>country. I have said this attack up<lb break="no"/>on the Government is but one part of the<lb/>campaign. The course of the newspa<lb break="no"/>pers, the agencies employed to carry the<lb/>York election, the lectures of Mr. Tilley,<lb/>this want of confidence motion, are but<lb/>continuous parts of the plan to upset this<lb/>Government and carry the Quebec<lb/>Scheme. If the present motion should<lb/>succeed, what would be the result ?<lb/>Either the control of the Government<lb/>will pass into the hands of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, and this scheme of Confederation<lb/>rejected by the people, would be by<lb/>some policy forced upon us, or a dissolu<lb break="no"/>tion of this House would be brought to<lb/>pass, and the scheme, unchanged, would<lb/>again be urged upon the people. What<lb/>the result of this would be we know not ;<lb/>what means would be used, what agencies<lb/>employed, we can judge from the past.<lb/>The attention of the people would be di<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
  
verted from the main point by all kinds<lb/>of side issues. Every set of this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, of omission or of the commission, would<lb/>be magnified, distorted, misrepresented ;<lb/>every engine of falsification and abuse<lb/>would be employed. Again the religious<lb/>cry would be raised; every sentiment of<lb/>bigotry and intolerance would be appeal<lb break="no"/>ed to. Where these means would not<lb/>suffice, bribery would seek to buy up the<lb/>people like sheep. More people have<lb/>been cheated out of their liberties than<lb/>ever lost them by violence. And suppos<lb break="no"/>ing Confederation carried by such means,<lb/>what would be the result? A large mi<lb break="no"/>nority left with the most bitter feelings<lb/>of indignation and wrong. A great body<lb/>of the people, who, when the excitement<lb/>of passion had passed away, would feel<lb/>that they have been misled and deceived.<lb/>Many of the now warmest advocates of<lb/>Confederation, who would think that they<lb/>were cheated, either by the promised<lb/>Railway not being built, or by its being<lb/>built elsewhere than where they expect<lb break="no"/>ed. What would there be among all<lb/>these but the seeds of future agitation and<lb/>political strife ?<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     I appeal to the honorable men in the 
     <lb/>Confederate party both here and through<lb break="no"/>out the country, if they are willing to have<lb/>this scheme pressed upon the people by<lb/>such means as have been hitherto adopt<lb break="no"/>ed ? Will they say that the end justifies the<lb/>means ? I quote from one of the first,<lb/>writers of England :<lb/>

            <p>It is said that we should accept con<lb break="no"/>federation because it is the wish of the<lb/>British Government. Now, while we<lb/>would pay every deference to the opinion<lb/>of the British Government, we may justly<lb/>claim for ourselves, as a free people, liv<lb break="no"/>ing under free institutions, the right to<lb/>decide for ourselves upon a question af<lb break="no"/>fecting our own interests and interests<lb/>of our Province for all time to come.<lb/>This country belongs to its own people—<lb/>it is they who have cleared its farms and<lb/>built its villagers and towns— and it is they<lb/>and their children who are to be affected<lb/>for weal or woe by any great political<lb/>change.

I have not considered<lb/>the question of confederation, or the<lb/>merits or demerits of the Quebec Scheme<lb/>as directly involved in the present ques<lb break="no"/>tion.

     <fw type="num">92</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866.</fw> 


     shown by the speech of the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     from Albert (Mr. McClellan). For that 
     <lb/>
     gentleman, with his clear head and great 
     <lb/>
     ability, has utterly failed to show any 
     <lb/>
     substantial grounds of complaint against 
     <lb/>
    them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     He has taken up the time of the House 
     <lb/>
     by talking about mere rumors—by read<lb break="no"/>ing handbills of the York election of six 
     <lb/>
     months ago—by talking about the remo<lb break="no"/>val of officials on account of their politi<lb break="no"/>cal opinions, a charge which he knows in 
     <lb/>
     his heart to be utterly unfounded—by 
     <lb/>
     reading trash from a newspaper about a 
     <lb/>
     Dorchester Scheme, which he knows to 
     <lb/>
     have never had an existence except in 
     <lb/>
     Ihe brain of some of his fellow Confeder<lb break="no"/>ates : and finally coming to the land mat<lb break="no"/>ter, he makes the 15,000 acres dwindle 
     <lb/>
     down to a paltry twenty-seven acres, and 
     <lb/>
     then acknowledges that there is no point 
     <lb/>
     in that.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
      It is charged that the members of the 
     <lb/>
     Government have been actuated by a de<lb break="no"/>sire to obtain and retain their offices. I 
     <lb/>
     well remember how unwilling the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary was to accept his present office. I 
     <lb/>
     know that nothing but his strong desire 
     <lb/>
     to strengthen the hands of that party, in 
     <lb/>
     whose success he believed the best inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the country involved, could have 
     <lb/>
     induced him to leave a business of far 
     <lb/>
     more value to him than any Government 
     <lb/>
     office—to sacrifice his own private inter<lb break="no"/>est and become a target for misrepresen<lb break="no"/>tation, ridicule and abuse. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     And what politician of this country can 
     <lb/>
    point to so proud a record as the Hon. 
     <lb/> Attorney General. Twice he has refused 
     <lb/>the highest offices in the land. The offi<lb break="no"/>ces of Judge and of Chief Justice. Offices 
     <lb/>which every man of his profession looks 
     <lb/>forward to as the highest objects of their 
     <lb/>ambition. And he has refused them be<lb break="no"/>cause he would not sacrifice the best in<lb break="no"/>terests of his country to his own private 
     <lb/>advancement. And no man in this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince to-day stands so high in the esteem 
     <lb/>and affections of the people as does the 
     <lb/>Hon. Albert J. Smith. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     This debate has been prolonged until 
     <lb/>
     it has become wearisome, and the life is 
     <lb/>
     out of it, and I will not take up the time  
     <lb/>
     of the House longer.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     But from what I have said it  may easily 
     <lb/>
     be inferred that I shall vote against  the 
     <lb/>
    amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—I was elected an 
     <lb/>anti-Confederate,  and I am free to state 
     <lb/>that I consider it my bounden duty to 
     <lb/>vote against Confederation in all its 
     <lb/>moods and tenses. I am also in duty 
     <lb/>bound to vote against a class of men who, 
     <lb/>without venturing to state what proposi<lb break="no"/>tions they intend to bring down, tamper 
     <lb/>with the best interests ot the country. 
     <lb/>When I find them submitting to some 
     <lb/>power and influence which they dare not 
     <lb/>resist; when I hear rumors of resigna<lb break="no"/>tions ; when I hear of arguments and in<lb break="no"/>ducements held out to prevent the inser<lb break="no"/>tion of certain measures in the Speech, 
     <lb/>and then quietly submit to it ; when they 
     <lb/>will not give information in regard to 
     <lb/>the views they entertain, I ask if it is 
     <lb/>not the duty of those gentlemen to tell 
     <lb/>the people of the country what is the 
     <lb/>meaning of that paragraph concerning 
     <lb/>Confederation in the Speech. I think if  
     <lb/>we sustain the Government on the pre<lb break="no"/>sent occasion, the people and the House 
     <lb/>will find they will have the Quebec  
     <lb/>Scheme upon them in all its horrors. 
     <lb/>My hon. friend (Mr. Smith) may laugh ; 
     <lb/>how comes it then in that speech. It 
     <lb/>may be that the Government will screen 
     <lb/>themselves, and say they are not  respon<lb break="no"/>sible.  I hold that constitutionally what<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>
 
ever is put in the Speech the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment have to take the responsibility of, 
     <lb/>and not one word should be introduced 
     <lb/>into it which they are not fully prepared 
     <lb/>to explain. Was it anything unreason<lb break="no"/>able  to put a question to the Attorney 
     <lb/>General, and was it fair to the people of 
     <lb/>the country that information should be 
     <lb/>withheld? Far be it from me to take 
     <lb/>any step which would bring Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion upon the country at the present time. 
     <lb/>I consider it my duty to vote against it. 
     <lb/>I believe we are nearer Confederation 
     <lb/>under the present Speech than you think 
     <lb/>of. If that was not so, why do they  
     <lb/>withhold information. The Government 
     <lb/>are in an unpleasant position, for they 
     <lb/>dare not fill their offices or open a con<lb break="no"/>stituency. When the people, in the ex<lb break="no"/>ercise of their discretion upon Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, gave a judgment,  showing no dis<lb break="no"/>position to accept the Scheme. I think 
     <lb/>they wanted no paltry saving of a few 
     <lb/>pounds when they armed those anti-Con<lb break="no"/>federates with power to form a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment that would have been respected in 
     <lb/>the country, the adjoining Colonies and 
     <lb/>the United States. What did they do? 
     <lb/>The Attorney General said he wanted no 
     <lb/>office, but the first thing he did was to 
     <lb/>create an office of dignity for himself. 
     <lb/>Some men like money, and some like dig<lb break="no"/>nity. "Some like apples and some like 
     <lb/>onions." At the time the Government 
     <lb/>was formed, it was known that Mr. Allen 
     <lb/>was to be appointed Judge, and that Sir 
     <lb/>James Carter, who was then in office, was 
     <lb/>going to  resign. Where then was the 
     <lb/>need of Mr. Allen's running an election 
     <lb/>to fill that office, if there was not a de<lb break="no"/>sign of keeping it for some other person. 
     <lb/>The present Attorney General had re 
     <lb/> fused to take office on the platform in 
     <lb/>St. John, and just at that time it was a 
     <lb/>very convenient thing for a man to have 
     <lb/>an enormous amount of patriotism and 
     <lb/>a disinclination to accept honor or mo<lb break="no"/>ney, but when the game is well played, 
     <lb/>and there is a chance for office, the great 
     <lb/>disinclation that existed before ceases to 
     <lb/>exist. It may be that it was a very con<lb break="no"/>venient thing for my hon. friend (Mr. S.) 
     <lb/>that Mr. Allan should take the office for 
     <lb/>a little while, and put the country to the 
     <lb/>expense of holding an election, in order 
     <lb/>to reserve that office for him. He had 
     <lb/>already created an office for himself, 
     <lb/>which was the next highest to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor, and when the office of Attorney 
     <lb/>General became vacant, he was very 
     <lb/>quietly installed into it. He said he 
     <lb/>would never take an office unless the po<lb break="no"/>litical exigencies of the country requir<lb break="no"/>ed it. (Mr. Smith.—I said unless the 
     <lb/>political exigencies of the party re<lb break="no"/>quired it.) 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In reference to forming the Govern 
     <lb/>
     ment, I think this country did not want 
     <lb/>
     any small business about it. The office 
     <lb/>
     of Solicitor General should have been 
     <lb/>
     filled up. According to the Constitution 
     <lb/>
     of the country, there are nine members of 
     <lb/>
     the Government. Of those members the 
     <lb/>
     Attorney General is one, and the Solicit<lb break="no"/>or General is another. Why was not this 
     <lb/>
     office filled up? There was no lack of 
     <lb/>
     strength or support at the last election. 
     <lb/>
     They say it is a saving. How much will 
     <lb/>
     they save when they get their bills paid 
     <lb/>
     up? It may be very convenient to chuck 
     <lb/>
     a bone to this one and that one, but is 
     <lb/>
     that a dignified way to conduct a public 
     <lb/>
     office? Will the people of this country 
     <lb/>
     be disposed to sustain this system of 
     <lb/>
     bribery and corruption ? I am satisfied 
     <lb/>
     they will not, when they get an opportu<lb break="no"/>nity of expressing their opinion. They 
     <lb/>dare not open a constituency in St. John, 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     where, at the last election, a most popular 
     <lb/>
     man was defeated. I refer to the leader 
     <lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     of the former Government, a man of 
     <lb/>
     great strength, undoubted talent, and 
     <lb/>
     unquestionable integrity.  The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from St. John (Mr. Wilmot) would 
     <lb/>
     not take an office because he was not go<lb break="no"/>ing into a one-man Government, who was 
     <lb/>
     politically inferior in every point of 
     <lb/>
     view.  He was not disposed to go there 
     <lb/>
     unless armed with strength and position, 
     <lb/>
     which would give him influence in  the 
     <lb/>
     councils of his country to which his 
     <lb/>
     standing entitled him. It has been said 
     <lb/>
     that they were afraid to open a constitu<lb break="no"/>ency, when they had an enormous majori<lb break="no"/>ty of the people of the country to sustain 
     <lb/>
     them.  If that is the case, are they the 
     <lb/>
     men to conduct the affairs of this country 
     <lb/>
     in the present perilous time. I am satis<lb break="no"/>fied the people of this country do not  
     <lb/>
     want political cowards to look after their 
     <lb/>
     interests. They want men of strength  
     <lb/>
     who are not afraid to express their views 
     <lb/>
     or appeal to the people. It was stated 
     <lb/>
     last session that it was necessary to send 
     <lb/>
     a delegation home, because an influence 
     <lb/>
     was brought to bear from Downing Street 
     <lb/>
     directly opposed to our views on Confed<lb break="no"/>eration. I voted for that delegation, but 
     <lb/>
     I could not have been induced to vote 
     <lb/>
     for it, had I known of the dispatch which 
     <lb/>
     was in possession of the Government. 
     <lb/>
     Was it fair to ask us to send that dele<lb break="no"/>gation home without giving us that dis<lb break="no"/>patch ? It was told us that the House was 
     <lb/>
     going to be dissolved, and we were going 
     <lb/>
     to have Confederation crammed down our 
     <lb/>
    throats, and it was necessary to send 
     <lb/>a delegation home immediately. Not 
     <lb/>many years ago, there was an outcry 
     <lb/>raised because mutilated dispathes were 
     <lb/>sent down to the House. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment said they had sent back such parts 
     <lb/>as contained state secrets No man at 
     <lb/>that time raised his voice more patriotic<lb break="no"/>ally than my hon. friend (Mr. S.) did on 
     <lb/>that occasion. Now he witholds a dis<lb break="no"/>patch that would have obviated the ne<lb break="no"/>cessity of sending a delegation home to 
     <lb/>England, The matter of that dispatch 
     <lb/>should have been before the House of 
     <lb/> Assembly, and a respectful address should 
     <lb/>have been sent, instead of one or two per<lb break="no"/>sons. Their views might have altered to 
     <lb/>a certain extent, were they to ex<lb break="no"/>press the opinions of my constituents. 
     <lb/>What did that delegation do in England? 
     <lb/>They have not informed us. My own 
     <lb/>impression is, by the way they con<lb break="no"/>ducted themselves since their return 
     <lb/>home, that it was an abortion. What<lb/>authority had they to send two dele<lb break="no"/>gates home ? If they had sent but 
     <lb/>one they would have saved a large 
     <lb/>amount of money to the country quite 
     <lb/>as much as they profess  to have saved 
     <lb/>through the non-appointment of a Solici<lb break="no"/>ter General. It has been said that they 
     <lb/>entered into a railway contract with the 
     <lb/>"International Contract Company," but 
     <lb/>it has been assented that no delegation 
     <lb/>was required for this purpose as a paper  
     <lb/>had been filed in the Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary's office, showing that a proposition  
     <lb/> had been  made by the Interaational Con<lb break="no"/>tract Company to build the road under 
     <lb/>the existing Subsidy Act, an answer was 
     <lb/>given them, and they were prepared to 
     <lb/>build the road, provided an arrangement 
     <lb/>was made to build the Nova Scotia line. 
     <lb/>The delegates were not sent home to 
     <lb/>make any arrangements concerning this 
     <lb/>matter at all. What authority had he to 
     <lb/>pledge the credit of the country to pay 
     <lb/>all land damages where they exceeded<lb/>£50 a mile, or are they going to bring<lb/>another <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post facto</hi> law to legalise it. 
     <lb/>These land damages, for which the<lb/>

     credit of this country is pledged, may be    
     <lb/>£500 a mile. Is that the way the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of this country is to be conducted?<lb/>By what authority does he take charge<lb/>of the revenues of this country?

How then can you have confi<lb break="no"/>dence in a Government which has acted<lb/>in the same way. There is another mat<lb break="no"/>ter in reference to the Governor's salary.<lb/>An outcry was raised in 1864 and a reso<lb break="no"/>lution was moved by the present Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General, fixing the Governor's sal<lb break="no"/>ary at a certain amount.  On this ques<lb break="no"/>tion he exerted all his energies to defeat<lb/>the Government. He must have cared<lb/>for his office then, for he could have had no<lb/>object in reducing the Governor's salary.<lb/>as he allows the same amount to be<lb/>drawn as heretofore.  ( <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> - it is<lb/>paid back.) he should have taken a <lb/>manly position, and told the Governor<lb/>that this money should not be drawn. If<lb/>it was he would resign his situation. In<lb break="no"/>stead of this it has been a continual giv<lb break="no"/>ing in.

     THURSDAY, April 5.        
     <lb/>On Motion of Mr. CONNELL, the<lb/>House went into Committee on "A Bill<lb/>to authorize the Woodstock Branch Rail<lb break="no"/>way Company to issue Debentures."<lb/>This Bill produced a lengthy disucssion<lb/>when progress was reported, and the Bill<lb/>referred to a special committee.<lb/>Progress was reported on "A Bill to<lb/>amend the law relating to the Shipment<lb/>of Seamen at St. John."<lb/>Mr. NEEDHAM called the attention<lb/>of the house to a report of his speech in<lb/>the Morning Journal, in which it was stated <lb/>that he called Mr. Cardwell "an<lb/>unprincipled scoundrel and an un- <lb/>qualified liar."

            </p>
            <p>Mr. WETMORE resumed:  I regret<lb/>that I had not occupied a little more time<lb/>last evening, so that there would have<lb/>been no necessity for my making any fur<lb break="no"/>ther remarks. The debate has been pro<lb break="no"/>tracted to an alarming extent, and has<lb/>taken more time than we expected. I do<lb/>not wish to occupy more time than is ne<lb break="no"/>cessary to explain my views on this<lb/>question. When the House adjourned, I<lb/>was commenting on an important feature<lb/>in this case. It is one on which I think the<lb/>hon. gentleman who form the Government<lb/>have sacrificed the views which they en<lb break="no"/>tertained on a previous occasion. It may <lb/>be that the Lieutenant Governor has a right<lb/>to receive that amount of salary. I express<lb/>no opinion upon that point.  What was <lb/>the motive that induced the present.

     to fix the amount of the Governor's

I do not<lb/>charge him with any improper motives,<lb/>for I presume he acted in a fair and legiti<lb break="no"/>mate manner, and did his duty as a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House of Assembly. He says<lb/>nothing but the political exigencies of the<lb/>country could induce him to take office;<lb/>therefore it must have been to set this<lb/>matter right. If His Excellency has a <lb/>right to single penny, by the same prin<lb break="no"/>ciple he may draw every fraction from<lb/>the treasury, for there is no limit. Though<lb/>the excess of salary drawn is regularly<lb/>paid back; yet it does not alter the princi<lb break="no"/>ple that it is wrong to draw it without<lb/>legal authority.  The present Attorney<lb/>General on that occasion said that the<lb/>Lieutenant Governor should receive so<lb/>much and no more, and if he drew one<lb/>single penny, from the treasury outside<lb/>and beyond the amount he was entitled<lb/>to receive, the Government of the day ought<lb/>to take the responsibility of it. I agree with<lb/>that sentiment, and I think that upon the<lb/>formation of the present Government, it<lb/>should have been made a sine qua non<lb/>that His Excellency should not have <lb/>drawn this excess salary.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>My hon. friend (Mr.S.)  In 1864 sought<lb/>to fix the responsibility of it upon the<lb/>then existing Government.  He then<lb/>portrayed the evil of allowing money to<lb/>be drawn, without legal authority, from<lb/>the Treasury, in all its horrors. And<lb/>now, when they have the power to stop<lb/>it, they still allow the evil to exist. Is<lb/>that the way a man should act who as<lb break="no"/>sumes the leadership of the country? I<lb/>am prepared to say I have no confidence<lb/>in men who act in that way. It shows a<lb/>lack of determination, if not a lack of<lb/>principle.  My hon. friend (Mr. Smith)<lb/>says there was a solemn agreement<lb/>made between His Excellency and the<lb/>former Government that this excess of<lb/>salary should be drawn and paid back.<lb/>The Government had no power to make<lb/>agreements regarding the funds of the<lb/>country to bind us for all time to come.<lb/>Such agreements can only be made by<lb/>legislative enactment. If His Excellen<lb break="no"/>cy has a a right to draw this money, he<lb/>has a right to keep it. If arrangements <lb/>of this kind have been made by the Til-<lb break="yes"/>lay Government, it is no reason that the<lb/>Smith Government should follow it up.<lb/>for two wrongs do not make one right. I<lb/>think the people of the country want to<lb/>treat His Excellency with dignity and<lb/>respect, and pay him such salary as his is<lb/>entitled to without any paying back. His<lb/>Excellency may be under the impres<lb break="no"/>sion that he is giving us a bonus, and<lb/>another Governor coming here may not<lb/>have the same liberal spirit, and retain<lb/>the full amount, which has been drawn<lb/>and sanctioned by two Governments, and<lb/>we would have no remedy. My hon.<lb/>friend (Mr. Smith) talks about his pa<lb break="no"/>triotism, as though he was the only man<lb/>that had given up any thing to serve his<lb/>country. I gave up an office, because I was<lb/>induced to come here to endeavor to pre<lb break="no"/>vent the passage of the Quebec Scheme.<lb/>My hon. friend who did not want an<lb/>office, jumped into the late Attorney<lb/>General's shoes before they were hardly<lb/>vacant; he resembles one of the "No.<lb/>I thank you men." who when asked to<lb/>have a piece of cake or a glass of wine,<lb/>always said. "No, I thank you." but <lb/>they generally managed notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing to eat and drink more than anyone<lb/>else in the company. (Mr. smith - You<lb/>wanted an office soon after you got into<lb/>the Assembly.) If I did I sought an<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     office fairly, and there was the most   
     <lb/>solemn pledges and promises given me.<lb/>I hold the man that pledges his word to<lb/>another pledges his sacred honor. and if<lb/>he violates that word he is entitled to no<lb/>respect. Why were those pledges not<lb/>carried out? I am just as much entitled<lb/>to an office as my hon. friend. My<lb/>grandfather held on of the first offices<lb/>in this country, and discharged its duties<lb/>in an efficient manner. I never made a<lb/>pledge to deceive any person and I trust<lb/>my name will never be sullied by break<lb break="no"/>ing a pledge to any man.  In reference<lb/>to expiring laws, the speech of last ses<lb break="no"/>sion says:  "Your attention will be <lb/>called, with a view to their renewal, to<lb/>several enactments which owing to my<lb/>inability to call you together at an earlier<lb/>periord, have either expired or are on<lb/>the point of expiring." And the answer<lb/>says. "We will give our attention to<lb/>such enactments as have recently ex<lb break="no"/>pired or are about to expire." If the<lb/>Government thought proper to overlook<lb/>the re-enactment of such laws, they act<lb break="no"/>ed improperly and are to blame. They<lb/>tried to throw the blame upon Judge<lb/>Allan and upon the leader of the former<lb/>Governemnt. The export duty law was <lb/>known to have expired in September, and<lb/>it was the duty of the Government then<lb/>to have called the Legislature together<lb/>to re-enact that law. Another law has<lb/>expired providing for the prompt pay<lb break="no"/>ment of all demands upon the treasury,<lb/>and all money received without that is<lb/>received without the authority of law.<lb/>Unless there was a law for it, the learned<lb/>aAttorney General had no right to nego<lb break="no"/>tiate a loan of L15,000.  I think they ad<lb break="no"/>mit the error, for they have brought in<lb/>a Bill. (Mr. Smith - The Bill brought<lb/>in now is included in the Treasury Note<lb/>Bill of last year.) If the Governenment<lb/>can make such arrangement as they<lb/>please, pledging the revenues of the<lb/>country without showing law for it, the<lb/>country has got into a bad position. The<lb/>Government, trying to justify the matter,<lb/>only makes it worse; upon whose <lb/>credit did they obtain money in England, <lb/>and upon whose authority? - (Mr. Smith<lb/>There was no money obtained at all, it<lb/>was simply a cash credit. In the event<lb/>of our wanting money we made an<lb/>agreement to authorize us to draw it.)<lb/>I suppose my hon. friend will tell me<lb/>whether there has been any drawn of <lb/>not. (Mr. Smith - There has beenL5000<lb/>drawn recently in consequence of the<lb/>Fenian excitement causing a run upon<lb/>the Savings Bank.) I am rejoiced that<lb/>at last we have got some information<lb/>He has admitted the fact that L5000 have<lb/>been drawn. By virtue of what au<lb break="no"/>thority was that money drawn? What<lb/>right had he to pledge the credit of the<lb/>Provice of L20,000. There is no law<lb/>to justify his doing it. (Mr. Anglin-<lb break="maybe"/>There is a law authorizing the investing<lb/>in England the surplus amount in the<lb/>Savings Bank, which is held there to<lb/>meet any run upon the Bank )  Where<lb/>is the surplus money?  It is all gone.<lb/>(Mr. Smith - It is all right.)  It may be<lb/>all right, but it has been invested in<lb/>England. My impression is, that there<lb/>has been a wrong committed in obtain<lb break="no"/>ing this money without the sanction of<lb/>law.  If that be the case I have no dis<lb break="no"/>position to give the Government an op<lb break="no"/>portunity of interfering with the finan<lb break="no"/>ces of the country. The Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral talks about personal attacks. I <lb/>have attacked the Government becuase<lb/>I thought they deserved it. It is well for<lb/>my hon. friend to consider, who set<lb/>the example. He as assailed the hon.<lb/>
