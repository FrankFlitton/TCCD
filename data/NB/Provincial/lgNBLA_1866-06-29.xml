<!-- GL, 2018-05-08, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 


   
           <!-- <p>
     had said eighty-eight years ago that the 
     <lb/>
     neighboring republic would have been 
     <lb/>
     what it is now, he would have been 
     <lb/>
     stamped as a fanatic. Would New 
     <lb/>
     York ever have stood in the rank of 
     <lb/>
     cities which she now does, if it had 
     <lb/>
     not been for the great western coun<lb break="no"/>try ? If we can get these inland lines, 
     <lb/>and compete for a portion of that trade, 
     <lb/>and pass it through our canals and from 
     <lb/>thence to Britain will it make any differ<lb break="no"/>ence to us if the tolls go into the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian revenue. The Welland Canal a year 
     <lb/>or two ago after paying working expenses 
     <lb/>yielded $200,000 revenue to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I think Canada will  reap no more 
     <lb/>from us than we will from them. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BOTSFORD.—The hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man who proceded me has said, that in 
     <lb/>speaking on a subject of such vital im<lb break="no"/>portance to the country, we should di<lb break="no"/>vest ourselves of party  spirit and party 
     <lb/>feelings. It would be desirable not to 
     <lb/>have such observations made in the 
     <lb/>course of this discussion as were made 
     <lb/>with reference to my hon colleagues in 
     <lb/>the late Government and mysel f; when 
     <lb/>he applies to that  body the word 
     <lb/>treachery, he may be familiar with the 
     <lb/>epithet, but I think it more applicable 
     <lb/>to his political actions and the actions 
     <lb/>of the late Government, of which he 
     <lb/>formed a part. The late Government, 
     <lb/>of which I was a member. acted both 
     <lb/>politically and sociably a fair, honora<lb break="no"/>ble course with the Governor, and they 
     <lb/>treated him with respect and courtesy. 
     <lb/>I have yet to learn that when His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency  chooses to enter the arena of 
     <lb/>the public press and brand  his Council 
     <lb/>with feloniously pilfering a paper from 
     <lb/>the archives of the Council, that they 
     <lb/>have not a right to hurl that imputation 
     <lb/>back, no matter how high the source it 
     <lb/>comes from. I would be wanting the 
     <lb/>the feelings of a man, if I did not reply 
     <lb/>to so gross an imputation. As the 
     <lb/>previous speakers have chosen to take 
     <lb/>ground that the late Executive 
     <lb/>Council have acted with treachery in 
     <lb/>their intercourse with the Lieutenant- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Governor, I will draw the attention of 
     <lb/>the House to a few preliminary facts. 
     <lb/>The Provincial Secretary told us that 
     <lb/>we, in endorsing the answer to the ad<lb break="no"/>dress of the Legislative Council, bound 
     <lb/>ourselves to a Union policy, and that it 
     <lb/>made no matter whether the Governor 
     <lb/>consulted us or not, he was justified in 
     <lb/>answering the address of the Legislative 
     <lb/>Council, praying tor the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament to pass an Act for Union based 
     <lb/>upon the Quebec Scheme. If I under<lb break="no"/>stand the Constitution of the country, it 
     <lb/>is simply this, that when the Governor 
     <lb/>speaks on behalf of Her Majesty the 
     <lb/>Queen, or with reference to the Im<lb break="no"/>perial policy, it is not binding upon the 
     <lb/>Executive of the Province, but if he 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     11 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     chooses to speak on behalf of himself or  
     <lb/>
    his Government, then the Executive 
     <lb/>Council become responsible, under our 
     <lb/>Constitution, for what he says. In the 
     <lb/>first reply to the Legislative Council he 
     <lb/>speaks on behalf of Her Majesty, but 
     <lb/>in the second reply he speaks on behalf 
     <lb/>of himself, and makes his Government 
     <lb/>responsible when there was no need 
     <lb/>for his doing so, for the address was for 
     <lb/>the Queen and not an address to the 
     <lb/>Governor at all. I am accused of pur<lb break="no"/>loining a paper. (Mr. Speaker.—The 
     <lb/>Governor is not responsible for what 
     <lb/>he says ) If the Governor chooses in 
     <lb/>the Royal Gazette to blacken my char<lb break="no"/>acter and parade his name, not in con<lb break="no"/>nection with his Executive Council, I 
     <lb/>think I have a right to make use of 
     <lb/>such language as will clear my skirts. 
     <lb/>I shall make use of the word intrigue, 
     <lb/>unless the House says I am not in 
     <lb/>order. (Mr. Speaker.—That is not 
     <lb/>Parliamentary language.) Then I will 
     <lb/>qualify it by saying political intrigue. 
     <lb/>His Excellency charges his late advisers 
     <lb/>with having improperly taken from the 
     <lb/>files of the Executive Council a docu<lb break="no"/>ment which should have been there. 
     <lb/>That document was what? It was the 
     <lb/>absolute acceptance of our resignation, 
     <lb/>and the moment that paper was given 
     <lb/>to us we ceased to be Executive Coun<lb break="no"/>cillors, and we had no rght to go to 
     <lb/>the Executive Council Chamber, and it 
     <lb/>was our paper. I say that was a gross 
     <lb/>charge against us. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     His Honor the SPEAKER .—This is 
     <lb/>
     contrary to Parliamentary rule. The 
     <lb/>
     communication in which the expression 
     <lb/>
     was made was addressed to his present 
     <lb/>
     advisers, and they are responsible. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. BOTSFORD. —If the Governor 
     <lb/>
     in Council had laid that communication 
     <lb/>
     before the Council, that would have 
     <lb/>
     been the view to take of it. But this 
     <lb/>
     was published in the Gazette and signed 
     <lb/>
     by Arthur Gordon, therefore I treat 
     <lb/>
     him as an individual. I wish to give 
     <lb/>
     the representative of Her Majesty all 
     <lb/>
     due deference, and I shall try to keep 
     <lb/>
     within the bounds of Parliamentary 
     <lb/>
     language, so as not to give offence to 
     <lb/>
     you and the House, and shall err in 
     <lb/>
     judgment  alone. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The debate was then adjourned until 
     <lb/>
     after the Journals were read to-morrow. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The House in Committee agreed to a 
     <lb/>
     Bill introduced by Mr. Kerr, entitled 
     <lb/>
     " A Bill to incorporate the Provincial 
     <lb/>
     Oil Company " 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>

     <lb/>
     water supply and sewerage in the City

     of St. John, on the Western side of the 
     <lb/>
     Harbor."

            <p>
     Mr. BOTSFORD resumed—When 
     <lb/>
     the debate was adjourned yesterday I 
     <lb/>
     was replying to the charges, and asking 
     <lb/>
     explanations with regard to the state<lb break="no"/>ments of the Hon. Provincial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     and the hon. member for Charlotte, (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Stevens,) and notwithstanding the At<lb break="no"/>torney General does not see what this 
     <lb/>
     has to do with the subject before the 
     <lb/>
     House, I shall go into this matter, con<lb break="no"/>ceiving as I do that as a member of the 
     <lb/>
     late Government I should be wanting in 
     <lb/>
     the duty I owe myself and my late col<lb break="no"/>leagues, if, after the remarks of the hon. 
     <lb/>member from Charlotte I did not go into 
     <lb/>an explanation of the whole matter. I 
     <lb/>was speaking, Sir, on the differences 
     <lb/>which occurred in the answers of the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council in their memorandum 
     <lb/>of resignation ; the Government charged 
     <lb/>His Excellency with advising with mem<lb break="no"/>bers and persons in the Opposition, and 
     <lb/>this was not denied. The Governor ad<lb break="no"/>mits having held consultations with Mr. 
     <lb/>Mitchell. But, Sir, the time referred to 
     <lb/>was not the only time. Whilst Mr. 
     <lb/>Smith, the leader oft he Government was 
     <lb/>away on a delegation to Washington, we, 
     <lb/>the other members of the Government, 
     <lb/>knew that he was in communication with 
     <lb/>Government House. On the return of 
     <lb/>Mr. Smith, we informed him of the fact, 
     <lb/>and in his next interview with His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency, he charged it home upon him. 
     <lb/>We knew what was going on, and His 
     <lb/>Excellency could not and did not deny the 
     <lb/>charge. But there is another point he 
     <lb/>also admits, and that is that he did not  
     <lb/>consult with his Council on the answer 
     <lb/>he intended, and did give to the address 
     <lb/>of the Legislative Council. On the 
     <lb/>seventh of April, after a night's reflection 
     <lb/>on the first resolution with regard to the 
     <lb/>address the Legislative Council withdrew 
     <lb/>that and substituted the other. This I 
     <lb/>presume was the time when the Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Secretary was consulted by Mr. 
     <lb/>Mitchell. Then Messrs. Botsford and 
     <lb/>Chandler were appointed a committee to 
     <lb/>wait on His Excellency to know when he 
     <lb/>would receive them with the address, and 
     <lb/>here occurred a case unparalleled in the 
     <lb/>history of our Province. Hie reply was 
     <lb/>that he would receive them in two hours 
     <lb/>from that time. This was at one o'clock . 
     <lb/>At twenty minutes to three a note was 
     <lb/>brought into this House from His Excel<lb break="no"/>

     lency to Mr. Smith informing him that at 
     <lb/>three o'clock he should receive the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council with their address. It<lb/>may not be parliamentary language to<lb/>characterize this as intrigue and treachery,<lb/>but I would ask is it fair, or manly, or<lb/>honorable ? I do not think such an action<lb/>likely to add much lustre to the heraldic<lb/>" name" His Excellency prides himself<lb/>on bearing, or to the " courtesy" and<lb/>" honor" he seems to prize so highly,—" a<lb/>name which for generations has been a<lb/>guarantee for courtesy and honor of those<lb/>who bear it"—a guarantee in this case<lb/>worthless so far as regards His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency. Mr. Smith proceeded to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House and found the Legislative<lb/>Council already there, and the Staff of<lb/>the Garrison in waiting now for the<lb/>answer. To such an address asking that<lb/>it may be forwarded to the foot of the<lb/>Throne, the answer is that the wish of the<lb/>petitioners shall be complied with. This<lb/>is the usual, and I may say the only<lb/>course pursued. But what action was<lb/>taken in this instance ? I think the<lb/>members of the Legislative Council have<lb/>cause to blush as long as they bear the<lb/>name of Councillors. The President pre<lb break="no"/>sented the address, and instead of hand<lb break="no"/>ing it to the Clerk, it was passed back to<lb/>the President, and then His Excellency<lb/>taking upon himself the functions of<lb/>Royalty commanded the address to be<lb/>ready to him. An address to Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty the Queen, received, read, accepted<lb/>and replied to in his own name by the<lb/>Lieutenant Governor of this Province, as<lb/>though he possessed all the powers of<lb/>Royalty ! Was not this unconstitutional?<lb/>When we look at the haste shown and the<lb/>means adopted I have no hesitation in<lb/>saying that His Excellency knew when he<lb/>gave his reply his Council would resign,<lb/>and that it was intended to have that<lb/>effect. But when charged with giving<lb/>this reply without the advice and consent<lb/>of his Council, he says it was merely " an<lb/>accident." An accident ! Mr. Speaker,<lb/>I'll show whether it was an accident or<lb/>not. I'll show that it was design, for we<lb/>now know that the officers of the 15th<lb/>Regiment received their orders to be at<lb/>Government House at three o'clock be<lb break="no"/>fore eleven o'clock in the morning, two<lb/>hours before the Committee of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council had waited on His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency to know at what hour he would<lb/>receive them with the address. He had<lb/>without doubt arranged the whole matter,<lb/>and before the appointment of the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee knew what majority there was to<lb/>carry any motion, and so at 11 o'clock<lb/>the coaches at the livery stables were<lb/>employed to carry the officers to Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House at three o'clock. It was<lb/>known that the Government had a large<lb/>majority on the floors of this House, and<lb/>that they could not gain their ends by<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     legitimate means, and so His Excellency 
     <lb/>by the advice of the Opposition took this<lb/>unconstitutional course, ignored his Coun<lb break="no"/>cil and by design took the only steps pos<lb break="no"/>sible to overthrow them. I ask is this<lb/>" courtesy ?" Is this " honor?" But the<lb/>Provincial Secretary has said that the<lb/>constituencies of this Province have en<lb break="no"/>dorsed the action of the Governor, and<lb/>casts it upon the people of Westmorland<lb/>that they were unenlightened on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject. Well, Mr. Speaker, he lectured<lb/>through that County, and had an oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to enlighten them, but did they<lb/>vote to support the course which had been<lb/>pursued.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. TILLEY—Those that heard me<lb/>did.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BOTSFORD—Did they ? I will<lb/>call the attention of the Secretary to the<lb/>Parish of Sackville, a place having the<lb/>benefits of academies and every other<lb/>means of information ; there after a year's<lb/>deliberation, and after the very able ad<lb break="no"/>dresses of the Secretary, they cast an<lb/>overwhelming vote in support of the late<lb/>Government. He also referred to the<lb/>speech of Mr. Chandler in the Upper<lb/>Branch on the subject of Union. Well,<lb/>that was printed and circulated through<lb/>the county, but the effect desired was not<lb/>produced, for after a calm, deliberate and<lb/>dispassionate consideration of the whole<lb/>matter, the County of Westmorelaud have<lb/>again pronounced against it. I will now<lb/>come to the Resolutions submitted by the<lb/>Attorney General, and the Amendment<lb/>offered by my colleague. It is proposed<lb/>to send delegates to England to co oper<lb break="no"/>ate with delegates from other Prov<lb break="no"/>inces in the formation of a plan of union<lb/>based on the Quebec Scheme. Now I do<lb/>not believe there is a constituency in this<lb/>Province but would condemn the Quebec<lb/>Scheme. Why the hon. Provincial Sec<lb break="no"/>retary, who always openly, fairy and con<lb break="no"/>scientiously supported that Scheme, be<lb break="no"/>lieving it to be the best that could be<lb/>got, acknowledged that his people wanted<lb/>some alterations, and though there may<lb/>be many in the country who would take<lb/>that Scheme with certain modifications,<lb/>the majority of the people are opposed to<lb/>it. We are asked to appoint delegates,<lb/>and who are they to be ? Well I pre<lb break="no"/>sume the Secretary will be one, the At<lb break="no"/>torney General will be the second, there<lb/>is the President of the Council three, and<lb/>if they make the delegation larger, there<lb/>is the hon. member from Northumberland<lb/>(Mr. Johnson) four, and if more are sent,<lb/>there is yourself, sir, who probably as the<lb/>Speaker and Head of this House, will be<lb/>included. This will make five. Five<lb/>leading men who assisted in framing that<lb/>Scheme, and have given their best atten<lb break="no"/>tion to the consideration and promulga<lb break="no"/>tion of its provisions, ans who believe it<lb/>is the best that can be had ; and we are<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     asked to delegate to these men unlimited<lb/>powers, and yet hon. members seem to 
     <lb/>
     imagine that we shall get modifications 
     <lb/>
     and improvements on the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme ; why it is folly to expect any<lb break="no"/>thing of the kind. And suppose they 
     <lb/>
     do attempt to gain some alterations, the 
     <lb/>
     Canadians will at once say, " you have 
     <lb/>
     pronounced this Scheme the very best that 
     <lb/>
     can be had," and what more do you want. 
     <lb/>
     Why even you, sir, if you go, will, me<lb break="no"/>thinks, say : " I'll take that, if I can't get 
     <lb/>
     anything better." I do not think the 
     <lb/>
     Union of these Provinces should be con<lb break="no"/>summated on the principles of a Scheme 
     <lb/>
     which has been condemned by the people 
     <lb/>
     of this Province, and is condemned to<lb break="no"/>day. I think no delegation should be 
     <lb/>
     appointed unless the Government will 
     <lb/>
     say that modifications shall be made. 
     <lb/>
     Hon. members had better beware, for as 
     <lb/>
     sure as unlimited powers are given to the 
     <lb/>
     delegates, they will give us the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme and nothing more. I will now 
     <lb/>
     refer to a few of the provisions of the 
     <lb/>
     Scheme which to my mind are very ob<lb break="no"/>jectionable. The first ingredient is re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population, a principle 
     <lb/>
     which I believe will be ruinous to this 
     <lb/>
     Province. It is clear to all who read 
     <lb/>
     that Upper Canada increases in popula<lb break="no"/>tion faster, and will do so in a yet greater 
     <lb/>
     ratio, than Lower Canada or these Lower 
     <lb/>
     Provinces, and the result of this will be 
     <lb/>
     that in a few years they will have the 
     <lb/>
     predominant power in the Lower Branch 
     <lb/>
     of the Legislature, and yet there is not 
     <lb/>
     one solitary check to counteract the in<lb break="no"/>fluence they will yield. Upper Canada 
     <lb/>
     will have the power to control the expen<lb break="no"/>diture of the public money, and as the 
     <lb/>
     result, she will dole out a pittance to us, 
     <lb/>
     with a shew of justice it may be, but in 
     <lb/>
     reality with none, all her desire being to 
     <lb/>
     secure her own interests. I look in vain 
     <lb/>
     through this Scheme for restrictions 
     <lb/>
     to this principle. But we are told 
     <lb/>
     that we shall have a larger number 
     <lb/>
     of representatives in the Upper Branch, 
     <lb/>
     in proportion, than Upper Canada. 
     <lb/>
     But why should the principle  of repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population be thrust upon 
     <lb/>
     us? Where did they get the idea ? 
     <lb/>
     Not from England certainly, for al<lb break="no"/>though the population of London is 
     <lb/>
     much greater than any other city this 
     <lb/>
     principle is not adopted. There the re<lb break="no"/>presentation is founded on certain in<lb break="no"/>terests. No, they have taken it from 
     <lb/>
     the United States, but they have left us 
     <lb/>
     with no corresponding and controlling 
     <lb/>power in the Upper Branch. I ask the<lb/>Attorney General where he can point to,<lb/>or lay his finger on a Constitution like<lb/>this? There is nothing like it in the<lb/>heavens above or in the earth beneath,<lb/>or in the waters under the earth. No,<lb/>Mr. Speaker, it is a mongrel Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, whose provisions are disastrous to<lb/>

     the best interests of this country. There 
     <lb/>
     is to be also a Court of Appeal, and 
     <lb/>
     there is nobody, Mr. Speaker, that I 
     <lb/>
     should like to see at the head of that 
     <lb/>
     body better than yourself. History 
     <lb/>
     shows us that great difficulties always 
     <lb/>
     arise from the dividing of the people 
     <lb/>
     into distinctive classes, and this has 
     <lb/>
    been clearly illustrated in Upper and 
     <lb/>Lower Canada. These distinctions of 
     <lb/>race and language are, I see, to be 
     <lb/>perpetuated. Now, in this House the 
     <lb/>other day, a Bill came up which was 
     <lb/>local in its nature, affecting no existing 
     <lb/>law, but merely asking that the French 
     <lb/>population of a certain parish should 
     <lb/>assess themselves for the support of 
     <lb/>their own poor, and be relieved from 
     <lb/>the regular parish poor rates, and that 
     <lb/>Bill was thrown out on the ground of 
     <lb/>class legislation. Yet here, in this 
     <lb/>Scheme, they have determined to per<lb break="no"/>petuate the very thing they so much 
     <lb/>oppose amongst ourselves. And not 
     <lb/>only is the difference of race to be per<lb break="no"/>petuated, but they provide also for the 
     <lb/>continuance of two languages in the 
     <lb/>Federal Government and Federal 
     <lb/>Courts. I believe they should have 
     <lb/>decided that the language of the country 
     <lb/>should be either one or the other, and 
     <lb/>when you, sir, as one of the Judges of 
     <lb/>the Court of Appeal, shall be called 
     <lb/>on to decide on some difficulties which 
     <lb/>may arise, say between the Government 
     <lb/>and some of the contractors on the 
     <lb/>Inter-Colonial line, you will be address<lb break="no"/>ed by some of the lawyers in the polite 
     <lb/>language of France, whilst others will 
     <lb/>quote authorities in English. You, sir, 
     <lb/>may be qualified for such a position, 
     <lb/>but there are very few in these Provinces  
     <lb/>that are. Instead of these differ<lb break="no"/>ences of race and language being<lb/>abolished or confined to the places<lb/> where they have previously existed, we 
     <lb/>find that this class distinction is to be 
     <lb/>propagated and engrafted upon Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces where it has never been before. 
     <lb/>This has been the cause of the trouble 
     <lb/>between Upper and Lower Canada, and 
     <lb/> serious difficulties must arise from it 
     <lb/>here. There is another point. Some 
     <lb/>hon. members have admitted that we 
     <lb/>cannot have a Union without the Inter- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Colonial Railway. Great anxiety has 
     <lb/>been expressed on this subject, and we 
     <lb/>have a message from His Excellency 
     <lb/>showing that despatches have passed 
     <lb/>on the question ; although it is put in 
     <lb/>the Scheme, there seems to have been 
     <lb/>a doubt about it. Now, say some, it 
     <lb/>will be made secure by being put in as 
     <lb/>a clause in the Imperial Act. But what 
     <lb/>of that ? Is it not a question for the 
     <lb/>Federal Government to decide ? And 
     <lb/>if they don't choose where is our 
     <lb/>remedy ? I believe the only way to<lb/>secure it is to have a provision in the 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         

     Scheme, that if the railway is not built, 
     <lb/>
     the Union shall cease. But even then 
     <lb/>
     it will be too late, for we shall have 
     <lb/>
     given up to Canada everything we 
     <lb/>
     possess, and all will be chaos ; and 
     <lb/>
     besides I do not think it will be a power 
     <lb/>
     that England would permit. The dele<lb break="no"/>gates may agree to put it in the Act, 
     <lb/>
     but, after all, it will amount to nothing. 
     <lb/>
     In the debate in Canada it was said we 
     <lb/>
     should have the power to make treaties 
     <lb/>
     and to alter the Constitution, but there 
     <lb/>
     is no provision for that in the Scheme. 
     <lb/>
     The interests of Upper Canada are not 
     <lb/>
     lfavorable to the Inter-Colonial Railroad. 
     <lb/>
     They have a road now running down to 
     <lb/>
     Portland, and if the Federal Govern<lb break="no"/>ment find they have not the funds, the 
     <lb/>
     road will not be built, and then to 
     <lb/>
     whom can we appeal? To England? 
     <lb/>
     She will refer it back for the decision of 
     <lb/>
     the General Government. What does 
     <lb/>
     the Governor say in a despatch in

            <p>
     SIR,—A discusssion has lately taken 
     <lb/>
     place in this Province with respect to one 
     <lb/>
     of the. conditions of the Federal Union 
     <lb/>
     of British North America, which has ex<lb break="no"/>cited much interest, and with respect to 
     <lb/>
     which it appears to me desirable that I 
     <lb/>
     should be placed in possession of the 
     <lb/>
     views of he Government. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     The Resolutions agreed to at Quebec, 
     <lb/>
     and which are to form the basis of the 
     <lb/>
     proposed Federal Union of the British 
     <lb/>
     American Provinces, have reference to a 
     <lb/>
     great variety of subjects of very differ<lb break="no"/>ent degrees of importance. With some 
     <lb/>
     of these matters the Local Legislatures 
     <lb/>
    are already fully competent to deal,  
     <lb/>whilst others are of a character which 
     <lb/>removes them beyond their cognizance. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It was my belief that the aid of the 
     <lb/>
    Imperial Parliament would be sought on<lb break="no"/>ly to give effect to those general provi<lb break="no"/>sions of a constitutional nature which 
     <lb/>could not be brought into operation by 
     <lb/>the existing Local Assemblies ; that it 
     <lb/>would be called upon to enact the Feder<lb break="no"/>ative Union, and to define the limits of 
     <lb/>the authority of the Central and Local 
     <lb/>Governments and Legislatures, but that 
     <lb/>the arrangement of matters of purely or 
     <lb/>mainly local interest would be left to the 
     <lb/>Federal Legislature, or to those of the 
     <lb/>seperate Provinces, as it may fairly be 
     <lb/>presumed that these bodies would faith<lb break="no"/>fully carry into execution the conditions 
     <lb/>upon which their Union had itself been 
     <lb/>based.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I find, however, that a very general im<lb break="no"/>pression prevails that the construction of 
     <lb/>
     the Intercolonial Railroad from Riviere du 
     <lb/>
     Loup to Truro, is to be provided for by a 
     <lb/>
     clause in the Imperial Act giving effect to 
     <lb/>
     the proposed Federal Union. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I do not myself consider it probable 
     <lb/>
     that Her Majesty's Government will make 
     <lb/>
     such a suggestion to the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament, for I cannot but conceive that 
     <lb/>
     such a proposal would appear to Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government to be either unneces<lb break="no"/>sary or unjust ; unnecessary if (as we 
     <lb/>
     must conclude will be the case should no 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
 

     unforseen and insuperable obstacles 
     <lb/>arise,) the new Federal Legislature votes<lb/>
    the construction of a work, the immediate 
     <lb/>commencement of which forms one of 
     <lb/>the conditions of the agreement to which 
     <lb/>they owe their existence ; unjust, if it 
     <lb/>were to have the effect of forcing on the 
     <lb/>people of British America the execution 
     <lb/>of a work which their Representatives in 
     <lb/>Parliament may consider it inexpedient to 
     <lb/>undertake.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Nor does it appear to me very likely 
     <lb/>
     that the British Parliament would enact 
     <lb/>
     a law involving a very large  expendi<lb break="no"/>ture of money not collected under  its 
     <lb/>
     own authority, a law moreover which 
     <lb/>
     it would be impossible to enforce, as no 
     <lb/>
     penalty could be inflicted after the pas<lb break="no"/>sage of the Act, in the event of the 
     <lb/>
     subsequent neglect of its provisions by 
     <lb/>
     the Federal Government and Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Neither do I imagine that, the ques<lb break="no"/>tion being one which primarily concerns 
     <lb/>
     the people of British North America, 
     <lb/>
     the British Parliament would consent to 
     <lb/>
     fetter the discretion of their representa<lb break="no"/>tives in dealing with it as they may con<lb break="no"/>sider most conducive to the advantage 
     <lb/>
     of the United Provinces more especially 
     <lb/>
     when it is remembered that the subject 
     <lb/>
     is one which the local Legislatures are 
     <lb/>
     already, even under the existing state 
     <lb/>
     of things, fully competent to consider. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Still less do I think it probable, even 
     <lb/>
     were a clause of a general character, 
     <lb/>
     enacting the completion of this great 
     <lb/>
     work, to be incorporated in an Act of 
     <lb/>
     the Imperial Parliament, that Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government would consent to 
     <lb/>
     introduce into the Bill, or that Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment would consent to sanction, all 
     <lb/>
     those details which would be required 
     <lb/>
     to render such a clause effective ; for, 
     <lb/>
     unless the route, the mode of construc<lb break="no"/>tion, the minimum sum to be annually 
     <lb/>
     devoted to the work, and the time at 
     <lb/>
     which it is to be completed, are all 
     <lb/>
     prescribed, the scheme may be subject 
     <lb/>
     to ultimate defeat by the rejection of one 
     <lb/>
     of these points by the Federal  Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment ; whilst the assumption of those 
     <lb/>
     who believe that a clause concerning the 
     <lb/>
     Railway will form part of the Imperial 
     <lb/>
     Act is that the completion of the work 
     <lb/>
     is to be so secured as to remove all 
     <lb/>
     liability of its being affected by any sub<lb break="no"/>sequent action on the part of the Federal 
     <lb/>
     or Local Governments and Assemblies. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I confess, therefore, that I am unable 
     <lb/>
     altogether to share the confident belief 
     <lb/>
     of my Council, that this work—(of the  
     <lb/>
     importance of which I need not say I 
     <lb/>
     am very fully sensible)—will be under<lb break="no"/>taken under the direct authority of the 
     <lb/>
     Imperial Parliament. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     At the same time it is possible that I 
     <lb/>
     may be mistaken as to the views and 
     <lb/>
     intentions of the Government, and I 
     <lb/>
     therefore respectfully request to be in<lb break="no"/>structed as to the course which I am to 
     <lb/>
     pursue, in the event of my being urged 
     <lb/>
     to state in my Speech from the Throne 
     <lb/>
     on the opening of the Provincial Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, that such a provision will un<lb break="no"/>doubtedly form part of the Act of Union, 
     <lb/>
     or be embodied by the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment in a separate Act. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Such a declaration, if it were after<lb break="no"/>wards proved by facts to be erroneous,<lb/>would, I need not say, excite very gene<lb break="no"/>ral and not ill-founded irritation.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. J. A. Macdonald, a leading member<lb/>of the Canadian Government, is reported<lb/>to have lately used, what appears to me<lb/>very sensible language in connection with<lb/>

this subject, to the effect that the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Railway was certainly not<lb/>part of the Constitution,—(a proposition<lb/>which is self-evident)—and that conse<lb break="no"/>quently, with many other details agreed<lb/>to by the Conference, it would not be<lb/>embodied in the Imperial Act, but that it<lb/>was one of the conditions on which the<lb/>Union was based, and must therefore be<lb/>carried into effect at the earliest possible<lb/>period by the Legislature of the Feder<lb break="no"/>ated Provinces. I am, however, informed<lb/>that Mr. Macdonald has subsequently<lb/>stated that the provisions for the con<lb break="no"/>struction of the Railroad will form part<lb/>of the Imperial Act.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>As the Legislature of this Province will<lb/>meet probably in the first week of April,<lb/>it is highly important that I should be<lb/>enabled by that time to reply distinctly to<lb/>the queries which may be put to me by<lb/>my advisers and by the Legislature,<lb/>whether, in the event of the Federation<lb/>of the British American Provinces being<lb/>accomplished, Her Majesty's Government<lb/>will be prepared to submit to the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Parliament, either as a clause of the<lb/>Constitutional Acct, as a separate Bill,<lb/>provisions to secure the completion of the<lb/>Inter-colonial Railway from Riviere du<lb/>Loup to Truro within a definite time,<lb/>and framed in such a manner as to<lb/>preclude the possibility of any subse<lb break="no"/>quent action in a contrary sense on the<lb/>part of the Federal Government and<lb/>Legislature.</p>

<p>Sir,—I have the honor to acknowledge<lb/>the receipt of your Despatch of the 27th<lb/>February, in which you request instruc<lb break="no"/>tions whether provisions will be made for<lb/>the completion of the Inter-colonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way in the Act of Union, or be embodied<lb/>by the Imperial Parliament in a separate<lb/>Act. In reply, I have to acquaint you<lb/>that Her Majesty's Government have ex<lb break="no"/>pressed their cordial approval of the pro<lb break="no"/>ceedings of the Conference at Quebec,<lb/>and have engaged that if, as they hope,<lb/>the Provincial Legislatures sanction the<lb/>scheme of the Conference, they, on their<lb/>part, will submit to the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment the measures which may be neces<lb break="no"/>sary for carrying that scheme into effect.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Resolutions adopted by the Con<lb break="no"/>ference, the 68th provides that the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government shall secure without<lb/>delay the completion of the Inter-Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway. Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment have understood that Resolution,<lb/>with reference to the Correspondence<lb/>which had previously passed with the<lb/>Governments of the several Provinces ;<lb/>while, therefore, they have entered into<lb/>no new stipulations on the subject, they<lb/>have by no means excepted the 68th Re<lb break="no"/>solution from the general approval which<lb/>they have expressed of the entire scheme,<lb/>or from the engagement respecting it to<lb/>which I have referred.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>What steps it may be proper hereafter<lb/>for Her Majesty's Government to take in<lb/>pursuance of this engagement, cannot be<lb/>stated positively, until it shall be known<lb/>
     

            <cb/>
           
what course has been taken by the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Legislatures, and until Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's Government shall have received<lb/>the communications which they hope to<lb/>receive from persons deputed by the Go<lb break="no"/>vernor General to give to Her Majesty's<lb/>Government the benefit of their counsel<lb/>upon the various measures necessary for<lb/>carrying the Resolutions of the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence into effect.</p>

            <p>Here we are distinctly informed this<lb/>whole question depends on the corres<lb break="no"/>pondence between the Governments-<lb break="yes"/>They agree to advance three millions of<lb/>dollars, taking security on the country,<lb/>but does any one believe that three<lb/>millions is going to build the road ?<lb/>Why five or six millions won't do it,<lb/>and we can't expect the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to advance that amount. This is<lb/>a serious question. If you give unlimit<lb break="no"/>ed powers to the enlightened minds who<lb/>framed the Quebec Scheme, what can be<lb/>expected to be the result ? When it is<lb/>found that Great Britain won't advance<lb/>the money required, where is it to come<lb/>from ? I believe we shall not get the<lb/>Railway at all, and even though I may<lb/>be mistaken, have the hon. members<lb/>from St. John considered the route which<lb/>it is almost certain has been already<lb/>agreed on. It is a foregone conclusion<lb/>that Great Britain will not permit it to<lb/>be located near the American frontier.<lb/>Have they reflected that if they vote<lb/>for these Resolutions they vote to carry<lb/>the Intercolonial Railway up by the North<lb/>Shore ? And what will be the result of<lb/>Union on the County of York ? Where<lb/>will then be the Provincial Buildings ?<lb/>Where the Post Office, where the other<lb/>public offices ? Where will the Courts<lb/>then hold their sittings ? In Frederic<lb break="no"/>ton ? No, but all will be removed to<lb/>St. John. It is to the interest of that<lb/>city, and also to the Eastern section of<lb/>the country, that it should be so. There<lb/>is no more doubt of all this than that<lb/>the river out there flows down to Saint<lb/>John. The consummation of Union will<lb/>be the death knell to the County of<lb/>York. Do they think they will have a<lb/>soldier here then ? No, for we shall<lb/>undertake our military and naval af<lb break="no"/>fairs, for only in times of danger and<lb/>actual war will Great Britain then keep<lb/>her troops in this country. We alrea<lb break="no"/>dy learn that the head quarters of the mi<lb break="no"/>litary is removed to Saint John. The re<lb break="no"/>giment now here will spend about £70,<lb break="no"/>000 this year, and York will have to<lb/>give it up. With these observations<lb/>which I have offered with no desire to<lb/>raise a factious opposition, but because<lb/>my property and interest are in the<lb/>country like other hon. members, I shall<lb/>vote for the Amendment and oppose the<lb/>Resolution.<lb/>

            <p>Mr. CHANDLER said this question<lb/>had been so fully discussed that it<lb/>would be a repetition to go over it all<lb/>again. It was a lamentable fact that many<lb/>of our young men who would be an or<lb break="no"/>nament to any country were moving<lb/>away and becoming absorbed in the<lb/>neighboring Republic. Every steamer<lb/>that left Saint John was draining the<lb/>country. This was what he would call<lb/>practical annexation. But what induce<lb break="no"/>ments were there to remain ? None<lb/>whatever. Why, look at Maine, imme<lb break="no"/>diately on our border. There was Mr.<lb/>Pike could go to Rio Janiero and make<lb/>his fortune, Mr. Pitt Fessenden could be<lb break="no"/>come Financial Secretary of the Union.<lb/>These men had no superior abilities to<lb/>the young men in our Province, but<lb/>they had the field and the higher posi<lb break="no"/>tion to which to aspire. But what, he<lb/>would again ask, were the inducements<lb/>offered here why they should remain ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH—Pretty girls.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. CHANDLER—That might be an<lb/>inducement to the hon. member for<lb/>Westmorland, but there must be some<lb break="no"/>thing more than pretty girls. They<lb/>must be provided for, and there were<lb/>no offices save that of Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary or Attorney General and a few<lb/>others to which a young man could as<lb break="no"/>pire, and they generally cost a man<lb/>more than they were worth to attain them.<lb/>How was this to be obviated ? By com<lb break="no"/>bining the resources and interests of all<lb/>these Provinces in one great Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. This he believed to be the hope<lb/>and salvation of this Province. The In<lb break="no"/>tercolonial Railroad, which would be<lb/>provided for—there was no mistake<lb/>about that—would open up a large tract<lb/>of country, inviting settlers, whilst it<lb/>becomes itself a source of profit to this<lb/>Province. He should very well have<lb/>liked to have had the various terms of<lb/>Union discussed point by point, but the<lb/>explanations made by the Secretary<lb/>were sufficient to prevent this, and he<lb/>felt satisfied that the delegates would<lb/>act with a full desire to secure the best<lb/>terms possible. He would say a word<lb/>or two about this road. It would cost<lb/>some millions to construct it, and those<lb/>who are engaged on it, contractors and<lb/>workmen, must live, a trade will spring<lb/>up in fish and agricultural produce to<lb/>supply their wants, and many new set<lb break="no"/>tlers will come into the country. All<lb/>this will be of great benefit. He was<lb/>speaking yesterday to a gentleman from<lb/>Upper Canada, who told him that in<lb/>that country they raise large quantities<lb/>of grain, but the streams are shallow<lb/>and in the summer they dry up, and<lb/>consequently are wanting in water power<lb/>to grind their grain, but in Union much<lb/>of the wheat grinding will be done in<lb/>this Province.

     Court of Appeal, he thought it was al<lb break="no"/>most time we had one. There was a 
     <lb/>
     case in Charlotte County of the Saint 
     <lb/>
     Andrews Railway and the New Brunswick 
     <lb/>
     and Canada Land Company. They got 
     <lb/>
     into some difficulty, and there was an 
     <lb/>
     appeal to the Courts in England. First 
     <lb/>
     there was a 300 guinea fee to one le<lb break="no"/>gal gentleman and a 300 guinea fee to 
     <lb/>another, and another, that it made it rather 
     <lb/>an expensive affair to the St. Andrews 
     <lb/>Railway Company. If we had a Court 
     <lb/>of Appeal here, these cases would be 
     <lb/>brought before them, and our lawyers 
     <lb/>would be able to plead in them. But 
     <lb/>we cannot plead in any Court in Eng<lb break="no"/>land escept the Court of the Judicial 
     <lb/>Committee of the Privy Council. From 
     <lb/>these and other causes he was opposed to 
     <lb/>the passage of the Amendment. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved that the matter should be pushed 
     <lb/>on with all haste consistent with the in<lb break="no"/>terests of the people. The hon. ex-At<lb break="no"/>torney General was opposed to the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Scheme, but he had seen nothing in 
     <lb/>the objections he had raised. One of the 
     <lb/>great bugbears had been that Mr. Tilley 
     <lb/>was going to be Governor. With re<lb break="no"/>gard to that he did not see that that 
     <lb/>was very objectionable, keeping in mind 
     <lb/>the old Latin <choice><sic>maxin</sic><corr>maxim</corr></choice>—

            <p>The hon. member from Westmorland 
     <lb/>seemed to have no adequate idea of the 
     <lb/>dangers by which the people on the 
     <lb/>border had been menaced. Living away 
     <lb/>from the scene of danger he could  form 
     <lb/>no just conception of the anxiety felt by 
     <lb/> the people there. If he had been an eye0 
     <lb/>witness of the appearance sad evident 
     <lb/>designs of the Fenian scouudrels, he 
     <lb/>would not speak so lightly of the matter 
     <lb/>as he had done. He (Mr. Chandler) had 
     <lb/>seen them in their midst with faces 
     <lb/>scarred, eyes too large for their sockets, 
     <lb/>distilling tears, with low receding fore<lb break="no"/>heads and looking the foul-fiends they 
     <lb/>were. He 'had seen them landing with 
     <lb/> six shot, breach loading Spencer Rifles 
     <lb/>in one hand, and sixteen shot Revolvers 
     <lb/>in the other. They had an immense 
     <lb/>quantities of ammunition in Eastport, and 
     <lb/>had it not been for the timely arrival of 
     <lb/>the gallant 17th Regiment, and the ships 
     <lb/>of War, he had no doubt they would have 
     <lb/>made a descent upon the people that very 
     <lb/>night. The feeling of anxiety was now 
     <lb/>somewhat dispelled, but it became this 
     <lb/>Province to unite with the other Provinces 
     <lb/>for defence against any power that might 
     <lb/>attempt to invade our shores. He would 
     <lb/>not go further into the subject but content 
     <lb/>himself with voting fur the Resolution, 
     <lb/>believing that the delegates who were 
     <lb/>sent home would agree to only such terms 
     <lb/>as would be for the honor and happiness 
     <lb/>of the people of this Province.

            <p>
     Mr. W. P. FLEWELLING did not 
     <lb/>
     intend  make a long speech. The re<lb break="no"/>
    

            <cb/>
    

     marks from the hon. member for West<lb break="no"/>morland (Mr. Botsford) called for a reply. 
     <lb/>
     That hon. member had said that none of 
     <lb/>
     the constituencies of this Province were 
     <lb/>
     in favor of the Quebec Scheme, and that 
     <lb/>
     the measure should be submitted to the 
     <lb/>
     people on the return of the delegates from 
     <lb/>
     London. He thought so far as King's 
     <lb/>
     County was concerned, the people were 
     <lb/>
     perfectly satisfied not to wait for the 
     <lb/>
     Scheme to be submitted to them again 
     <lb/>
     before it should be consummated. They 
     <lb/>
     had confidence in the Government, and 
     <lb/>
     those delegates who may be appointed to 
     <lb/>
     make such alterations in the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme as are needed. No other Scheme 
     <lb/>
     had ever been before the people and on 
     <lb/>
     that basis they had returned by large 
     <lb/>
     majorities the Confederate members. 
     <lb/>
     The hon. member for Westmorland had 
     <lb/>
     also said that he did not believe that 
     <lb/>
     Canada would advance the money to build 
     <lb/>
     the Inter-colonial Railroad, but he be<lb break="no"/>lieved that Canada was assured that the 
     <lb/>
     road would be a great benefit to that Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces and that they would use therefore 
     <lb/>
     every means in their power to secure its 
     <lb/>
     being built. He should support the Re<lb break="no"/>solution.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
      Mr. McQUEEN did not intend to enter 
     <lb/>
     into a lengthy speech on this question, 
     <lb/>
     but as hon. members seemed to be de<lb break="no"/>sirous to have their ideas go the coun<lb break="no"/>try, he should like his name to appear 
     <lb/>
     as having spoken upon it. It had been 
     <lb/>
     hinted that the people of Westmorland 
     <lb/>
     were not very intelligent, and if so they 
     <lb/>
     could not be expected to send a very in<lb break="no"/>telligent representative, but they had 
     <lb/>
     empowered him to speak their views, 
     <lb/>
     and that was that if delegates were sent 
     <lb/>
     home to mature a plan of Union, they 
     <lb/>
     should he restricted in their powers, for 
     <lb/>
     if this were not done, as probably all 
     <lb/>
     who go on the delegation will be in favor 
     <lb/>
     of the Quebec Scheme, and the British 
     <lb/>
     Government, are also in favor of it, we 
     <lb/>
     should not be likely to get any other. 
     <lb/>
    He supposed the "true interests" spoken 
     <lb/>of in the Resolution was to be taken in 
     <lb/>the same sense as the pledges made in 
     <lb/>Canada were understood with regard to 
     <lb/>the improvements provided there, viz : 
     <lb/>that they might be qualified to suit 
     <lb/>the different parties interested. The 
     <lb/>question had been so ably treated on by 
     <lb/>other hon. members, that it was only 
     <lb/>necessary for him to say that he should 
     <lb/>oppose the Resolution and support the 
     <lb/>Amendment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. RYAN was in favor of the Quebec. 
     <lb/>
     Scheme, and believed we never should 
     <lb/>
     get a better,   because we had the best of 
     <lb/>
     the bargain now. At any rate he be<lb break="no"/>lieved the delegates who would be en<lb break="no"/>trusted with the interests ot New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick would do the best they could. When 
     <lb/>
     the Quebec Scheme was first brought 
     <lb/>
     before the notice of the people they op<lb break="no"/>posed it, because they did not understand 
     <lb/>
     its provisions.  The enemies of the mea<lb break="no"/>
       

            <cb/>
          

     sure went about the country disseminat<lb break="no"/>ing falsehoods, and as the people had 
     <lb/>
     little or no information as to the nature 
     <lb/>
     of the Scheme, they believed what was 
     <lb/>
     told them. These men would button<lb break="no"/>hole one man, and tell him how dread<lb break="no"/>fully we were going to be taxed, and to 
     <lb/>
     another they would tell another story. 
     <lb/>
     They managed to feel a man's pulse be<lb break="no"/>fore they decided on what ground to 
     <lb/>mislead him, and so the people thinking<lb/>it is the best and safest plan, opposed the<lb/>measure. The result was, the opponents<lb/>of Union obtained a large majority. But<lb/>
    when  the people had time for reflection, 
     <lb/>when they looked into the matter and 
     <lb/>became informed, they rose in their 
     <lb/>might and hurled their deceivers to the 
     <lb/>ground. One of the cries of the oppon<lb break="no"/>ents of the Quebec Scheme was the cost 
     <lb/>of maintaining the militia, and directly 
     <lb/>they came into power they passed that 
     <lb/>very meritorious Militia Law, providing 
     <lb/>for a Camp of Instruction. And after 
     <lb/>all it was only the scraps of Mr. Tilley's<lb/>Bill. The hon. member for Westmor<lb break="no"/>land (Mr. Botsford) said that the fram<lb break="no"/>ers of the Scheme thought there could<lb/>be nothing like it, and then he declared 
     <lb/>himself that there was nothing like it in 
     <lb/>the heavens above. on the  earth beneath, 
     <lb/>or in the waters under the  earth. Well, 
     <lb/>if that was the case, he did not see why 
     <lb/>they should not worship it. There 
     <lb/>could not certainly be anything wrong 
     <lb/>in that. Then the hon. ex-Attorney 
     <lb/>General did not like for us to buy up 
     <lb/>Newfoundland for $150.000 a year, be<lb break="no"/>cause they had nothing but rats or some<lb break="no"/>thing of that kind there, and yet he said 
     <lb/>they would not come into the Union 
     <lb/>even then. The other hon. member (Mr. 
     <lb/>Botsford) had said that the people of 
     <lb/>New Brunswick were in favor of Union, 
     <lb/>but wanted modifications in the Quebec 
     <lb/>Scheme, so that if modifications were 
     <lb/>made the great majorities the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment party had been returned 
     <lb/>by would be greatly increased. He had 
     <lb/>no doubt about the Inter-colonial Rail<lb break="no"/>road—he believed we should have that 
     <lb/>or nothing. With regard to the route he 
     <lb/>knew it would be a great benefit no<lb/>matter where it was located, of course he<lb/>had his wishes ; he would like it to go by 
     <lb/>the central route. But whatever route 
     <lb/>might be chosen it must greatly benefit 
     <lb/>St. John, and what benefitted St. John 
     <lb/>would be good for all the Province. But 
     <lb/>it had been raised as an objection that we 
     <lb/>did not know the route. As far as that 
     <lb/>went he thought it hardly worth while lo<lb break="no"/>cating the line at a great expense before we 
     <lb/>saw whether we were going to be united or 
     <lb/>not. Again it was said " we don't know 
     <lb/>that it is going to pay." Neither did a 
     <lb/>man know if it was going to pay when he 
     <lb/>planted a hill of potatoes, but be planted 
     <lb/>for all that, and hopefully looked for the 
     <lb/>result. He should oppose the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, and vote for the Resolution.

     <lb/>the Scheme, and, therefore, he would<lb/>not go into it. He should support the<lb/>Resolution.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. YOUNG knowing, as he did, that<lb/>the people had pronounced in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of Union, was ready to go for<lb/>the Resolutions with certain restric<lb break="no"/>tions. First, he would not go for the<lb/>Quebec Scheme ; second, he would<lb/>take the delegates from both side of<lb/>the House, and third, he would sub<lb break="no"/>mit the Scheme when matured to the<lb/>people. He did not think this too<lb/>much to ask. He thought the delegates<lb/>should not be clothed with power to<lb/>change the Constitution of the Country<lb/>without submitting the question again<lb/>to the people for their approval. The<lb/>people had returned thirty-three men to<lb/>support Confederation, but not to support<lb/>the Quebec Scheme, and they should<lb/>know the terms that are to be agreed upon,<lb/>or at least that it should come back to<lb/>the House. The Attorney General had<lb/>said no railway, no Union ; but he would<lb/>ask how was it to be secured ? Could it<lb/>be put in the Constitution ? No, all that<lb/>we could do was to rely on the faith of<lb/>Canada was we did in 1862, and we all<lb/>knew how that fell through. He thought<lb/>it best to have the road built first and let<lb/>the Union come after. Then the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General had said that the United<lb/>States had spent their blood and treature<lb/>to maintain their Union. Yes, but that<lb/>was a Union worth maintaining, but it<lb/>was a Union very different from the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Scheme. If there was the same re<lb break="no"/>presentation in the House of Lords, as it<lb/>is called, as is the Senate it would be<lb/>very different. The Provincial Secretary<lb/>had said that no money would be wanted<lb/>for the improvement of the rivers and<lb/>lakes of Canada, but he (Mr. Young) had<lb/>seen dredging machines at work on Lake<lb/>St. Peters, between Montreal and<lb/>Quebec, and opposite Montreal they were<lb/>constantly in use. There was as much<lb/>improvement needed on the Saint Law<lb break="no"/>rence as on the St. John. He believed<lb/>that the Government should have sub<lb break="no"/>mitted the terms upon which they ex<lb break="no"/>pected to obtain Union. In Canada it<lb/>
       

            <cb/>
          

     had been discussed section by section, 
     <lb/>
     and why not here? He would ask if 
     <lb/>
     ever before men went out of a country 
     <lb/>
     empowered to change the Constitution ? 
     <lb/>
     No, never. Throughout the debate thus far 
     <lb/>
     no new ground had been broken. He 
     <lb/>
     deprecated the manner in which the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment got into power, but that matter 
     <lb/>
     was not before the  House, but for the 
     <lb/>
     reasons he had stated he should vote 
     <lb/>
     against the Resolution.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. LINDSAY did not at first intend 
     <lb/>to speak on this question, but so many<lb/>had expressed their views and opinions<lb/>that he should also say a few words. It<lb/>had been said that the present <choice><sic>Gonern<lb break="no"/>ment</sic><corr>Government</corr></choice> got into power by the unconstitu<lb break="no"/>tional action of the Governor. But if<lb/>the late Government had acted in a fair<lb/>and constitutional manner they should<lb/>have resigned their seats when His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency refused to accept Mr. Wilmot's<lb/>resignation unless they would agree to<lb/>introduce a measure for Union. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency went to Canada in the interest of<lb/>the Government, and the ex-President<lb/>went to Washington, and Mr. Wilmot's<lb/>resignation could not be accepted till his<lb/>return, but when the President got home<lb/>Mr. Wilmot was allowed to retire, be_<lb/>cause the Anti Government were willing<lb/>to go for Union. Some hon. members<lb/>wanted the Scheme, when matured, to be<lb/>sent back to the people. Well the ques<lb break="no"/>tion had been sent to the people, but hon.<lb/>members did not seem satisfied, nor<lb/>would they ever be. The hon. member<lb/>from Gloucester (Mr. Young) wanted the<lb/>delegates to be selected half the number<lb/>from his party. That would be quite an<lb/>idea to send men to consummate a Union<lb/>of these Provinces who were opposed to<lb/>it. The ex-Attorney General had re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the stand taken by the Hon.<lb/>Joseph Howe, but he read an extract<lb/>from a speech made by that gentleman in<lb/>1865 to show that he had always been in<lb/>favor of Union till within the past few<lb/>months. He believed the chief cause of<lb/>his opposition was because he did not<lb/>happen to be in the Government which<lb/>would have the honor of bringing it<lb/>about. The hon. ex-Attorney General<lb/>was also anxious to have the measure laid<lb/>before the House. The best plan would<lb/>be for him to go to England with Mr.<lb/>Howe ; he had been there before on del<lb break="no"/>egations, and the last time he went when<lb/>the Government had in their possession<lb/>a despatch which rendered the delega<lb break="no"/>tion needless. That despatch, it seems<lb/>by accident, got laid aside. This might<lb/>be called a Government accident. He<lb/>had also said that there were no Fenians<lb/>to cause the troubles we had on our bor<lb break="no"/>ders. It was all very well for him to<lb/>make light of the affair when he lived<lb/>away back from the borders where the<lb/>Fenians would have to pass over the bo<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
     

     dies of thousands to get at him. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved that it was from expressions such 
     <lb/>
     as were made by members on the floors 
     <lb/>
     of the house at its last Session that gave 
     <lb/>
     the Fenians the idea that they could ea<lb break="no"/>sily overcome us. It was said that if the 
     <lb/>
     British Government attempted to force 
     <lb/>
     us into Confederation there would be 
     <lb/>
     blood shed, and the people over the bor<lb break="no"/>der thought that it would not be hard to  
     <lb/>
     work up a strong feeling here against 
     <lb/>
     England, and so would have taken us and 
     <lb/>
     made us a part of the Irish Republic, but 
     <lb/>
     how long would that have lasted ? Just 
     <lb/>
     long enough to hand us over to the Unit<lb break="no"/>ed States. But he thought we had pretty 
     <lb/>
     well shown them that we did not want to 
     <lb/>
     change our nationality The Resolution 
     <lb/>
     before the House was just in accordance 
     <lb/>
     with the Speech at the opening of the 
     <lb/>
     Session. Mr. Lindsay read some statis<lb break="no"/>tics to  shew that if they were appointed 
     <lb/>
     according to population, the Maritime 
     <lb/>
     Provinces would have to send home 
     <lb/>
     twenty.  He had been in Canada, and he 
     <lb/>
     would say that he never knew any 
     <lb/>
     one go there and return who were not 
     <lb/>
     ashamed of being opposed to Union. He 
     <lb/>
     did not believe in keeping the matter in 
     <lb/>
     abeyance, but. thought it should be car<lb break="no"/>ried through as speedily at possible; As 
     <lb/>
     thirty-eight  per cent. of all the shipping 
     <lb/>
     of British North America was built in 
     <lb/>
     this Province, he thought we should be 
     <lb/>
     likely to get a pretty good share of the 
     <lb/>
     carrying trade. It had been stated that 
     <lb/>
     we should be sold to Canada at eighty 
     <lb/>
     cents a head, but he did not see that, any 
     <lb/>
     more than Canada would be sold to us. 
     <lb/>
     Our revenues are paltry and insignificant 
     <lb/>
     compared with those of Canada, for where 
     <lb/>
    we put into the General Treasury one 
     <lb/>dollar she puts in twenty. So far as he 
     <lb/>was concerned, he told his people on the 
     <lb/>hustings that he should go for the Quebec 
     <lb/>Scheme if we could not get a better. The 
     <lb/>Antis in Canada opposed Union because 
     <lb/>they said we had the best of it, and that 
     <lb/>we ought not to get the $63,000 for ten 
     <lb/>years. He would not go any furtherer into 
     <lb/>the question, but should vote for the Re<lb break="no"/>solution and against the Amendment, 
     <lb/>which was only a patch to it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. CAIE had listened to the speeches 
     <lb/>
     of hon. members, and though some had 
     <lb/>
      wandered far from the subject before the 
     <lb/>
     House, he had yet gleaned enough to 
     <lb/>
    satisfy him that all who are in favor of 
     <lb/>the Quebec Scheme should vote for 
     <lb/>the Resolution, and all who were op<lb break="no"/>posed to Confederation, all who had the 
     <lb/>slightest objection to any of its provi<lb break="no"/>sions, and all who desired modifications<lb/>to be made, should vote against it. Who<lb/>were to be the delegates ? Those men<lb/>who formed the Convention at Quebec,<lb/>and who would even take a worse than<lb/>the Quevec Scheme to pay themselves<lb/>with some fat office for all the lavor they<lb/>performed in supporting the plan of<lb/>

     Union. He thought very highly of the 
     <lb/>
     Government of Great Britain, but did 
     <lb/>
     not consider them qualified to. sit as ar<lb break="no"/>biters on the destinies of this Province, 
     <lb/>
     or to act in reference to the matter at all, 
     <lb/>
     as they had already spoken in favor of 
     <lb/>
     a Scheme which was refused by the 
     <lb/>
     people of New Brunswick. And the rea<lb break="no"/>son why they were in favor of the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme, was because many of their 
     <lb/>
     members and friends are interested in 
     <lb/>
     the canals and other public works of 
     <lb/>
     Canada, who  had spent millions and tens 
     <lb/>
     of millions in their improvements. If 
     <lb/>
     left to these parties to decide, we should 
     <lb/>
     be swamped. But let restrictions be put 
     <lb/>
     on the delegates, that unless such and 
     <lb/>
     such concessions are made then no 
     <lb/>
     Union can take place. With regard to 
     <lb/>
     the Inter-Colonial Railway, he believed 
     <lb/>
     it would be built, and that if Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion had been put aside it would have 
     <lb/>
     been underway before this. Mr. Caie 
     <lb/>
     was about to enter on some financial 
     <lb/>
     statements with regard to our position 
     <lb/>
     in and out of the Union, but the hour 
     <lb/>
     having come for separation, he merely 
     <lb/>
     would say that he should support the 
     <lb/>
      Amendment.

     AFTERNOON SESSION. 
     <lb/>
            </head>


            <p>Mr. McINERNEY did not rise to offer<lb/>any hostile opposition to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, or to offer any amendment to the<lb/>Resolutions. He was sent to oppose the<lb/>passage of a plan of Union based on the<lb/>Quebec Scheme, or any other that would<lb/>take away the rights of the people.<lb/>Our taxes at present were twelve per<lb/>cent. a head, whilst in Canada they were<lb/>twenty-five per cent. a head. If we go<lb/>into Union we should have to assume<lb/>part of their liabilities, and we should be<lb/>taxed according to their rate. The<lb/>amount of taxes raised will be about a<lb/>million dollars, and our proportion of that,<lb/>according to our population, would be<lb/>$21.00, leaving the balance to go into the<lb/>working expenses of Canada. He might<lb/>be wrong, but this was as he understood<lb/>it. The Scheme provided that public<lb/>works in Canada should be proceeded<lb/>with when the finances would permit.<lb/>He would ask when was that ? Why<lb/>just as soon as they needed it. He was<lb/>under the impression that about forty<lb/>million dollars would be asked for the<lb/>improvement of the lakes and canals of<lb/>Canada, that five million dollars would<lb/>go to buy up the Hudson Bay Territories,<lb/>and about twelve millions of dollars to<lb/>build the Inter-Colonial Railroad. These<lb/>sums we would have to assume in pro<lb break="no"/>portion to our population. The resolu<lb break="no"/>tion now before the House he should<lb/>have to oppose, for knowing the feelings<lb/>of his people, he could not stand there<lb/>and vote for the appointment of dele<lb break="no"/>gates to go two thousand miles away to<lb/>prepare a new Scheme of Union, which<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
        

     we know nothing about, thus abrogating 
     <lb/>
     the rights of the people. It was almost 
     <lb/>
     a folly for him to stand there and raise 
     <lb/>
     his voice when hon. and learned gentle<lb break="no"/>men had so ably spoken on the question. 
     <lb/>
     The Provincial Secretary had spoken of 
     <lb/>
     the ignorance of the peoplc of Kent and 
     <lb/>
     Westmorland. He said they had not 
     <lb/>
     means for obtaining information. But 
     <lb/>
     the supporters of the Quebec Scheme had 
     <lb/>
     used every means in their power to gain 
     <lb/>
     over the people of these Counties, and as 
     <lb/>
     the representative of the County of Kent, 
     <lb/>
     he was proud to say they had failed—the 
     <lb/>
     people of Kent could not be bought. 
     <lb/>
     Expressions had been made with regard 
     <lb/>
     to Fenianism ; he approached the sub<lb break="no"/>ject with great delicacy, being an Irish<lb break="no"/>man, and many people seemed to think 
     <lb/>
     that all Irishmen were Fenians. This 
     <lb/>
     he denied. It was a false position to place 
     <lb/>
     them in. When the time of trial came 
     <lb/>
     and war was upon us, if it ever should 
     <lb/>
     come, he, for one, would be found in the 
     <lb/>
     front rank of the battle prepared to meet 
     <lb/>
     the foe, while those who had maligned 
     <lb/>
     him and call him Fenian and traitor were 
     <lb/>
     skulking in the rear. He stood there 
     <lb/>
     the representative of the sixteen thou<lb break="no"/>sand men of the County of Kent, men of 
     <lb/>
     intelligence, although he did not profess 
     <lb/>
     to be a fair specimen, and he wished to 
     <lb/>
     ask the Provincial Secretary if in his re<lb break="no"/>marks he referred to the hon. member 
     <lb/>from Westmorland and his constituencies<lb/>or to the supporters of that hon. gentle<lb break="no"/>man in the House. He would ask if it<lb/>was applied to him.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. TILLEY—" No." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. McINERNEY was glad to receive 
     <lb/>
     the answer of the Provincial Secretary, 
     <lb/>
     as his people would expect him to know 
     <lb/>
     exactly to whom it was applied. He 
     <lb/>
     could not amuse the House with high 
     <lb/>
    sounding language like some of the hon. 
     <lb/>members. He apologized for occupying 
     <lb/>the time, and should vote for the Amend<lb break="no"/>ment. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Mr. BECKWITH only rose, as so much 
     <lb/>
     had been said, to remove some of the 
     <lb/>
     fallacies put forward by the hon. member 
     <lb/>
     for Westmorland to shew why he could 
     <lb/>
     not vote for the Amendment. That hon. 
     <lb/>
     gentleman possessed a very earnest style 
     <lb/>
     of oratory, so that things which he could 
     <lb/>
     not himself believe—he (Mr. Beckwith) 
     <lb/>
     gave him credit for better sense—was 
     <lb/>
     likely to make an impression on superfi<lb break="no"/>cial observers. The very eloquent speech 
     <lb/>
     of the member for Charlotte (Mr. Chan<lb break="no"/>dler) he did think at the time would con<lb break="no"/>vince the hon. member for Westmorland 
     <lb/>
     that he was all wrong, and he really ex<lb break="no"/>pected to see the Amendment to the Re<lb break="no"/>solution withdrawn. Like Festus, he is 
     <lb/>
     "almost persuaded," het can't come 
     <lb/>
     down just to the right thing. There was 
     <lb/>
     no doubt that the troublous affair on the 
     <lb/>
     border had tended to show the people on 
     <lb/>
     what a volcano they stood. The evident 
     <lb/>
     result of success would have been to cast 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
          

     us into the American Union. A late Chica<lb break="no"/>go paper had said perhaps, after all, it was 
     <lb/>
     best to let Confederation be consumma<lb break="no"/>ted, as it would save trouble. Then 
     <lb/>
     the United States would be able to 
     <lb/>
     swallow all the Provinces at once, in<lb break="no"/>stead of morsel by morsel. The move<lb break="no"/>ment of the Fenians showed us that 
     <lb/>
     it was intended we should be the first 
     <lb/>
     morsel. The ex-Attorney General had 
     <lb/>
     said that the necessities of Canada was 
     <lb/>
     the origin of the idea of Union. He 
     <lb/>
     (Mr. B.) agreed with him to a certain ex<lb break="no"/>tent. . Every inland country requires a 
     <lb/>
     seaboard on which to receive and 
     <lb/>
     ship material, and it thus becomes 
     <lb/>
     a necessity for Upper Canada to 
     <lb/>
     unite with the Maritime  Provinces. The 
     <lb/>
     French peoplc of Canada  are industrious, 
     <lb/>
     kind and frugal, but they are not a pro<lb break="no"/>gressive people. In the House of As<lb break="no"/>sembly in Canada he heard the leading 
     <lb/>
     Lower Canadian statesmen oppose a 
     <lb/>
     measure providing for Light Houses. 
     <lb/>
     But the people of Upper Canada are 
     <lb/>
     constantly moving onward ; they believe 
     <lb/>
     in progress. They see that united to 
     <lb/>
     us they will become a great people, but 
     <lb/>
     alone they are nothing. If they cannot 
     <lb/>
     obtain a Union with us they must have 
     <lb/>
     a Federal Union among themselves, 
     <lb/>
     which would be injurious to us. Now 
     <lb/>
    is the time to strike while the iron is  
     <lb/>hot. He should be delighted to see the 
     <lb/>hon. ex-Attorney General one of the 
     <lb/>delegates to look after the interests of the 
     <lb/>Antis, but whatever was going to be 
     <lb/>done, he would like to see done at 
     <lb/>once. It was objected that Messrs. 
     <lb/>McGee and  McDonald had said that the 
     <lb/>Quebec Scheme could not be altered to 
     <lb/>the dotting of an i or the crossing of a 
     <lb/>t. But, he would ask, to whom was this 
     <lb/>remark addressed? It was said to the 
     <lb/>Canadians that they who formed only 
     <lb/>one party to the bargain could  not alter 
     <lb/>the slightest provision in the Scheme. 
     <lb/>But if the other Provinces are agreed 
     <lb/>then the i's may be dotted and the t's 
     <lb/>crossed, aye and criss crossed. It had 
     <lb/>also been said that Upper Canada was  
     <lb/>increasing so fast that we should be 
     <lb/>swamped. He thought, however, our 
     <lb/>position and the fact that St. John would 
     <lb/>necessarily become the winter port for 
     <lb/>the Confederation, we should increase 
     <lb/>quite as fast as Upper Canada. The ex- 
     <lb break="yes"/>Attorney General also was very much 
     <lb/>alarmed because, as he said, Canada 
     <lb/>would tax us for whatever was needed. 
     <lb/>Now the fact was, all would tax all. 
     <lb/>Another great bugbear was the canals 
     <lb/>of Canada. But these canals were pay<lb break="no"/>ing more than any public works which 
     <lb/>we have in these Provinces, and anyone 
     <lb/>who has read the documents submitted 
     <lb/>to the Convention held at Detroit, must 
     <lb/>be aware that we have a great interest 
     <lb/>in the widening and deepening of these 
     <lb/>canals. When members from Upper 
     <lb/>

Canada say to our members, " We want<lb/>you to assist us to gain a grant to im<lb break="no"/>prove our canals," they will say, "Yes.<lb/>If you will give us your interest to im<lb break="no"/>prove the harbor of Saint John." And<lb/>so we shall see in that city large wet<lb/>and dry docks, for which there is every<lb/>facility, and then waht a prospect opens<lb/>before that city. Further, the harbors<lb/>on the North Shore would need deepening,<lb/>so that ships of a large tonnage could<lb/>pass up. Canada, therefore, would not<lb/>get all the money, for we need public<lb/>works as much as they. Then the<lb/>movement on the border had convinced<lb/>even the ex-Attorney General that we<lb/>should have to spend large amounts to<lb/>preserve ourselves from invasion. Why,<lb/>even the late Government brought in and<lb/>passed a Bill to provide for a navy.<lb/>Well, just now, that might look very<lb/>much like the frog and the ox; but if<lb/>these Provinces were united, it was<lb/>something we could have without burst<lb break="no"/>ing. The ex-Attorney General also said<lb/>the soldiers were to be removed. But<lb/>Great Britain has said nothing of the<lb/>kind. What they have said is that they<lb/>cannot trust to have their men cut off in<lb/>detail, as would be done in case of war<lb/>but that united, they will give us of their<lb/>best men and treasure to preserve us.<lb/>Then the taxation. If we do not have<lb/>Confederation, we shall have very soon to<lb/>resort to direct taxation. But before this<lb/>can be resorted to by the General Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, they will have to put on nearly<lb/>a dollar per had upon the other Prov<lb break="no"/>inces to bring their rate tup to what we<lb/>are now paying. Our revenue is only<lb/>about $800,000, and our fixed expendi<lb break="no"/>ture over $700,000, so that for our roads<lb/>and bridges and otehr works we should<lb/>have to tax ourselves directly out of the<lb/>Union. The Quebec Scheme was not<lb/>so bad a Scheme after all. There were<lb/>checks that were not known to exist till<lb/>carefully looked after. He was willing<lb/>to send men home untrammelled, and he<lb/>thought that the love of approbation in<lb/>man was suficient to guarantee that<lb/>they would not do anything that would<lb/>cause them to be looked upon by their<lb/>fellow-countrymen with scorn and con<lb break="no"/>tempt. He thought that it would be well<lb/>to have a provision inserted that the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Legislative Council should<lb/>live in the Province they represent. If<lb/>the $63,000 bonus for then years was not<lb/>generally deemed sufficient, he had no<lb/>objections to see it increased to $100,<lb break="no"/>000. He should support the Resolu<lb break="no"/>tion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. QUINTON merely rose to declare<lb/>himself in favor of the Resolution. He<lb/>was quite willing to entrust the interests<lb/>of the country in the hands of the dele<lb break="no"/>gates that might be appointed, believing,<lb/>as he did, that they would use every en<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
          
deavor to secure Union on the most ad<lb break="no"/>vantageous terms.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SKINNER wished to speak on the<lb/>question before the House, but had been<lb/>so occupied with other matters that he<lb/>was not then prepared, and, therefore,<lb/>would ask the House to allow him to<lb/>speak after the hon. member for West<lb break="no"/>morland had made his reply to-morrow<lb/>morning.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. DOW said he should claim a like<lb/>favor if the request were complied with.<lb/>He thought it inexpedient to depart<lb/>from parliamentary usage, and he should<lb/>object to such a course being taken.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SKINNER then said the hon.<lb/>member for York appeared to be very<lb/>fastidious, and as his request, which he<lb/>considered a very reasonable one, had<lb/>not been complied with, he should pro<lb break="no"/>ceed with a few remarks. Whilst he<lb/>should vote for the Resolution, he could<lb/>not but express his dissent from the<lb/>manner in which this matter had been<lb/>brought before the House. He could not<lb/>vote for Mr. Smith's Amendment, be<lb break="no"/>cause he believed it would be driving a<lb/>dirk into the very heart of Confederation.<lb/>He was, therefore, placed in a very awk<lb break="no"/>ward position. He did expect that the<lb/>Government would have brought the<lb/>question before the House in a more<lb/>tangible form; that the qustion would<lb/>be discussed in all its bearings, and that<lb/>instructions would be given to the dele<lb break="no"/>gates appointed by which their action<lb/>would be governed. But if this<lb/>bald Resolution were passed, they, on<lb/>their return might say, if teh provisions<lb/>of the plan decided on were not satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory. "Why you gave us no instructions."<lb/>The Government should have come be<lb break="no"/>fore the House and said, that as they had<lb/>but lately come from the people, and that<lb/>as the House knew what the people re<lb break="no"/>quired, they should instruct them what<lb/>to do. This would have been dignified,<lb/>this would have been honorable, and the<lb/>right way to approach the subject. He<lb/>was in favor of Confederation; it was as<lb/>strongly enshrined in his heart as in that of<lb/>any one, but he did think, in reconsider<lb break="no"/>ing the terms of Union, the question<lb/>should be approached calmly and delib<lb break="no"/>erately. The more time taken in its<lb/>consideration the better. But from the<lb/>first there appeared to have been a de<lb break="no"/>sire to rush the matter on. When the<lb/>delegates first met at Prince Edward<lb/>Island this was manifest, but the ques<lb break="no"/>tion had lost nothing in the support it<lb/>received by being held over for fifteen<lb/>months. It had rather been gaining<lb/>support remarkably fast. The question<lb/>was not new to the people. For twenty-<lb break="yes"/>five years they had been in favor of<lb/>Union, but when they found it was con<lb break="no"/>templated to push the matter through in<lb/>a hasty manner, the people would not<lb/>acquiesce, and so the Quebec Scheme<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
          

     was repudiated. He would tell the hon.  
     <lb/>members that representation by popula<lb break="no"/>tion was the hardest thing the people<lb/>had been called upon to submit to. But<lb/>the evils taht arise from this might be<lb/>overcome by proper checks in the Upper<lb/>House. Many people who voted for<lb/>Union in 1864 were opposed to some of<lb/>the provisions of the Quebec Scheme.<lb/>And during the late elections he had fre<lb break="no"/>quently been charged not to accept the<lb/>Quebec Scheme without looking into it,<lb/>and trying to get some modifications.<lb/>He hoped this point of representation<lb/>would be met by providing for an equal<lb/>representation of every Province in the<lb/>Upper Branch. When the election of<lb/>1865 came off a majority of the people<lb/>were against the Quebec Scheme, and if<lb/>those who came into power had confined<lb/>their opposition to that Scheme, and not<lb/>carried it on against all Union, but had<lb/>gone on and matured a better plan, they<lb/>would have obtained better terms. They<lb/>did not do it, the tide turned, and on the<lb/>next wave the thirty-three men on the<lb/>floors of teh House in favor of Union<lb/>were returned. Let them now be very<lb/>careful that the succeeding wave did not<lb/>carry them all away, as it would be like<lb break="no"/>ly to do if they did not treat the question<lb/>in a calm and deliberate manner. He<lb/>thought the question should have been<lb/>laid before the House for their consider<lb break="no"/>ation, and then hon. members would<lb/>have had an opportunity to speak the<lb/>convictions of their minds on this great<lb/>matter. If he could not get Union in<lb/>broad daylight and openly he would not<lb/>have it at all. The foundation must be<lb/>laid and cemented in an open and manly<lb/>way. He would not speak of some of the<lb/>alterations the delegates should demand.<lb/>He would, if he could, secure some<lb/>modifications to the provision for repre<lb break="no"/>sentation by population. He feared<lb/>that this could not be done, but<lb/>still he would claim it as a right<lb/>and a benefit to all the Colonies.<lb/>The Quebec Scheme was started at the<lb/>time of the war in the United States,<lb/>before Grant had taken Richmond or<lb/>Sherman had made his grand march<lb/>through georgia to the ocean, when<lb/>they thought that the republic was in<lb/>the throes of dissolution, and conse<lb break="no"/>quently it was teh negation of all that<lb/>was found in the American Constitution.<lb/>There the states have the power, and<lb/>that power they weild for the general<lb/>good. But in the Quebec Scheme the<lb/>General Government take all the power<lb/>and dribble it out to the separate States.<lb/>This was a feature in the Scheme he had<lb/>always been opposed to. If the dele<lb break="no"/>gates had intended to have formed a<lb/>separate nationality, he could have for<lb break="no"/>given them for this, but they did not,<lb/>neither did the people desire a new flag<lb/>or the power to make war, to coin<lb/>money, or any other functions perform<lb break="no"/>

ed by an independent power. All they<lb/>wanted was to form a Union for the pur<lb break="no"/>poses of commerce and defence. If the<lb/>Provinces had been going into a Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Union they would not have needed<lb/>a Scheme, the Common Law woud have<lb/>sufficed as the basis, but in a Federal<lb/>Union it was necessary that the Consti<lb break="no"/>tution should be a written one, and it<lb/>requires the greatest care and delibera<lb break="no"/>tion in the preparation of its provisions.<lb/>The hon. member for York (Dr. Dow) his<lb/>fastidious friend who opposed his request,<lb/>would rear up a nation in a half-an-hour as<lb/>he would a wood boat. He did not like the<lb/>arrangement with regard to the appoint<lb break="no"/>ment of the Judges. For the first ten<lb/>years they were to be appointed from<lb/>their own respective bars. He woud<lb/>make it for all time. In England, Scot<lb break="no"/>land, and Ireland they had their own<lb/>Judges. It was well known that it took<lb/>the best minds in the country to make a<lb/>lawyer, and then it required years of close<lb/>and careful study to become acquainted<lb/>with the Common Law, and years again<lb/>to know the Statute Law, and it should be<lb/>provided that when Judges are appointed<lb/>they should be taken from the bars<lb/>of the respective Provinces where<lb/>the vacancy occurs. How was it<lb/>in Maine, and the other States ? They<lb/>all had their own Judges, men whose<lb/>decisions and writings on jurisprudence<lb/>are co-even and co-equal with those of the<lb/>Judges in England. He had no objec<lb break="no"/>tion to the appointments being in the<lb/>hands of the Central Government. Then<lb/>the General Government had a veto<lb/>power over all the acts of the Provinces.<lb/>If New Brunswick or Nova Scotia were<lb/>to pass a law which they found to be re<lb break="no"/>quired and it was afterwards declared<lb/>unconstitutional by the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, it would cause a great deal of dis<lb break="no"/>content. The whole might be obviated<lb/>by placing the matter in the Judiciary,<lb/>for the reverence of our people for the<lb/>Bench is deep and constant. See how it<lb/>is ; a man is in political life, deep in the<lb/>turmoil and strife of an election. He is<lb/>a fit mark for the wit or sarcasm of any<lb/>one, but he is raised to the Bench by the<lb/>party in power, and the people cease to<lb/>scoff and already reverence. Yes, if the<lb/>veto power were in the hands of the<lb/>Judges, the people would bow to their<lb/>decisions, but they would not if left with<lb/>politicians. Next with regard to the<lb/>eighty cents a head on the population of<lb/>1861. He would have it altered so that<lb/>it should be on the population whatever<lb/>it might be for all time to come. Why<lb/>not left the eighty cents go on increasing<lb/>with the population ? But it may be said<lb/>Canada will go on and get much more<lb/>than we. That could not be contradicted,<lb/>but how would it be now ? He believed<lb/>if the people thought they were going to<lb/>get eighty cents ahead according to the<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          

     population they would be satisfied. He 
     <lb/>would have it so arranged that in time<lb/>the local governments would get the<lb/>management of the monies rather than<lb/>the federal, thus giving them less to do,<lb/>whilst it increased the work to be done<lb/>by the Local Legislatures. Then he did<lb/>not see any check by which the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion was secured to us provided the other<lb/>Provinces wished to alter it. The Con<lb break="no"/>stitution of the United States provided<lb/>that it could not be altered without an<lb/>appeal and vote of three-fourths of the<lb/>States. He thought if this were done we<lb/>should be much safer. Then if they<lb/>could alter the General Constitution,<lb/>why may they not after a time obtain the<lb/>power to alter the local Constitution ?<lb/>If these things were not secured he<lb/>would have it done. He would pour<lb/>the oil of good feeling upon the wheels,<lb/>so that they might run smoothly and<lb/>work well. He thought the delegates<lb/>should be instructed but not trammelled.<lb/>They would leave with his best wishes,<lb/>but he thought the House should have<lb/>been informed how many were to be<lb/>sent, and who they would be. There<lb/>were some men he would not send for<lb/>his right arm, whilst there were others<lb/>in whom he had every confidence. He<lb/>would pick out five or seven men from<lb/>the Government and from the House,<lb/>or from both Houses, but they should<lb/>be the best men, and the House should<lb/>know who they were. On the second<lb/>application to the people they had de<lb break="no"/>cided, as he believed, right ; but he told<lb/>his people that he would bring his judg<lb break="no"/>ment to bear upon the deliberation of<lb/>the whole matter, and now by the action<lb/>taken by the Government, he was in<lb/>the position, that if he voted against the<lb/>Resolution Confederation would be<lb/>jeopardized. He hoped that all would<lb/>yet turn out well, that the delegates<lb/>would not act with selfish or ambitious<lb/>motives. No delegation ever left<lb/>these or any other Colonies with such<lb/>destinies in their hands, and he trusted<lb/>they would return with a good report.<lb/>If they did not, the people would not<lb/>be satisfied. He should vote for the<lb/>Resolution.<lb/>

            <p>
     Dr. DOW did not know that there 
     <lb/>
     was anything fastidious in asking the 
     <lb/>
     same favor of the House as the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member had done. All he asked for 
     <lb/>
     was that the mover of the amendment 
     <lb/>
     should close the debate as was custom<lb break="no"/>ary. He had always looked upon this 
     <lb/>
     question as one that rose above party 
     <lb/>
     or prejudice. When was the first ob<lb break="no"/>jection taken to the Quebec Scheme ? 
     <lb/>
     not till the people had risen to a sense 
     <lb/>
     of the benefits which  were to arise from 
     <lb/>
     a Union of. these Colonies. It had been 
     <lb/>
     objected by the hon. member for St. 
     <lb/>
     John, that the power was in the hands 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
      

     of the General Government, and he had 
     <lb/>referred to the United States during the<lb/>late war. But did not the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber know that it was because there was<lb/>then a great central head and controll<lb break="no"/>ing power that the Union was pre<lb break="no"/>served ? Had the power been in the<lb/>seperate States, where would the Union<lb/>have been to-day ? The delegates were<lb/>going home to a country and a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment who would not do anything to<lb/>the prejudice of these Provinces. In<lb/>his canvas through the County he had<lb/>said, if you vote for me you vote for the<lb/>Quebec Scheme, and no railway no<lb/>Union. He did not say the scheme<lb/>was perfect ; it was drawn up by men,<lb/>and all are liable to err. But what<lb/>were some of the objections raised.<lb/>Oh ! the people were going to be taxed<lb/>to death. Next Fisher, Tilley and Gray<lb/>had bought up the Fenians at $50 a<lb/>head, and so the people got frightened.<lb/>There was an old lady up in Canterbury<lb/>who was very much alarmed about<lb/>them, and one day when he called she<lb/>asked him how about the Fenians ? He<lb/>replied they were all gone now. But<lb/>said she, " Don't you think they'll come<lb/>back ?" He thought not, unless they<lb/>might turn up on the fishery question.<lb/>
    " There," she said, "I knew it was  
     <lb/>some of that Fisher's work. He is al<lb break="no"/>ways doing some mischief or other. " 
     <lb/>And so it is, the impression was made 
     <lb/>that the Fenians, the Fishery business,  
     <lb/>and Fisher were all mixed up together. 
     <lb/>He did not say the scheme was perfect, 
     <lb/>but he had full faith in the men who 
     <lb/>would go home that they would labor 
     <lb/>for the best interests of the country 
     <lb/>He had seen 45,000 acres of land bought 
     <lb/>up by one man for a mere nominal 
     <lb/>sum, because it was in such a position 
     <lb/>that roads would not likely to be made  
     <lb/>through it for many years. But 15,000 
     <lb/>acres of that land was as pretty farming 
     <lb/>land as the eye could desire to look on, 
     <lb/>and if a railroad were run through it, 
     <lb/>it would be of immense value. Our 
     <lb/>young men were leaving our country 
     <lb/>because there were no improvements 
     <lb/>going on to open our country and de<lb break="no"/>velope its resources. This would only 
     <lb/>be changed by uniting the interests of 
     <lb/>all the Provinces. He was prepared to 
     <lb/>vote for the Resolution. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     Mr. SMITH, in closing the debate, 
     <lb/>
     said—I do not complain of the tone 
     <lb/>
     adopted during this debate, except to the 
     <lb/>
     remarks made by the Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary, and I think the House, on calm re<lb break="no"/>flection, will say that his speech lacked 
     <lb/>
     that dignity which was due to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject and to the House. I stand in a very 
     <lb/>
     different position to the Provincial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary, for while this  feeling of the House 
     <lb/>
     is concurrent with his views, I am aware 
     <lb/>
     that I address an unwilling audience, but

duty to myself and to my country try to require<lb/>that I should reply. I think, Mr. Speak<lb/>er, that the hon. Secretary should have<lb/>striven to combat my arguments rather<lb/>than to have entered into personalities. I<lb/>said nothing to call for his singling me<lb/>out almost by name, and making me the<lb/>subject of an attack. In the late election<lb/>I scarcely referred to any on thing by<lb/>name, but all his speeches have been di<lb break="no"/>rected to the impugning of my motives.<lb/>Now, if this was the question, he would<lb/>like to ask the hon. Provincial secretary<lb/>if he was not influenced in his labors by<lb/>a desire to go to Ottawa?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. TILLEY - No, I do not think<lb/>I am.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH - Yes, Mr. Speaker, you<lb/>see he can't say he is not so influenced,<lb/>there is the reservation - I do not think I<lb/>am. He is not prepared to say in a<lb/>straightforward manner that such motives<lb/>have no effect upon him.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. TILLEY - I know, Mr.<lb/>Speaker, it is hard for a man to know<lb/>himself, and, therfore, I replied in that<lb/>guarded way.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SMITH - Now, I don't say he is<lb/>thus influenced, but he attacked me, and<lb/>he says I am the worst politician in this<lb/>country. Well, in return, I will say that<lb/>he is the most ambitious and unscrupu<lb break="no"/>lous. He has some qualities that I much<lb/>admire. He is certainly persever<lb break="no"/>ing in his efforts to bring about that which<lb/>he desires, but he is not particular about<lb/>the means. He said he was willing to<lb/>get better terms than the Quebec Scheme,<lb/>but did not leave the impression that they<lb/>would be had. Did he not strive to<lb/>prove that it was a perfect Scheme. The<lb/>Speech he has made here will be read by<lb/>the delegates from Canada on their way<lb/>to England and what will he say to them,<lb/>and how will he meet this people again if<lb/>the Quebec Scheme be fastened upon us?<lb/>But I must do honor to the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from St. John, who although he will<lb/>cast his vote on the opposite side, has<lb/>yet taken up and treated this subject on<lb/>broad and philosophical views. He has<lb/>acted in a bold, manly, independent man<lb break="no"/>ner, and has done himself infinite honor.<lb/>The matter should have been submitted<lb/>to us. It is not before us. It is on the<lb/>Journals of last year, but we can't retrace<lb/>our steps and look at it. The Secretary<lb/>tells us - in a manner unheard of before<lb/>- that he cannot tell this House what<lb/>terms they will ask, as somebody may<lb/>get a hold of it in Canada, and thus defeat<lb/>the measure. Is this not political fraud<lb/>and concealment? Is it not clear that<lb/>they are willing to carry a Scheme against<lb/>the will and wishes of a majority of the<lb/>people of this country? The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for York said the scheme was not<lb/>perfect, but he did not tell us his objec<lb break="no"/>tions to it. He says that young men are<lb/>
            

            <cb/>
          
going away; so they are and others are<lb/>coming here. This is only natural. Man<lb/>is restless and roving, and we get men<lb/>from England, Ireland and Scotland, but<lb/>we don't hear anything about them. The<lb/>Provincial Secretary quoted from the<lb/>Journals to show that an offer of Union<lb/>had been made us in 1858. But let us<lb/>see his reply. Here is Tilley against Til<lb break="no"/>ley.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">MEMORANDUM OF THE EXECUTIVE COUN<lb break="no"/>CIL IN COMMITTEE<lb/>
            </head>


            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">To His Excellency the Honorable</hi> J.H.T.<lb/>MANNERS-SUTTON, <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lieutenant Gover<lb break="no"/>nor, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;.</hi><lb/>
            </p>

            <p>The Committee of Council have had<lb/>under consideration the Despatch of the<lb/>Governor General ofthe 9th inst., con<lb break="no"/>taining the Report of the Excutive<lb/>Council fo Canada, on the subject of a<lb/>Federation Union of the British North<lb/>American Provinces.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Council are deeply impressed with<lb/>the importance of the subject, requiring,<lb/>as it does, the most deliberate and ma<lb break="no"/>ture consideration.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The British North American Provinces<lb/>have each attained a great degree of ma<lb break="no"/>terial prosperity under their present Con<lb break="no"/>stitution; and the increased power of<lb/>self-government recently conferred on<lb/>them has left nothing to envy in the po<lb break="no"/>litical condition of the citizens of the<lb/>neighboring Republic.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>*   *     *     *     *     *     *     *<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>This is true; the country has gone on<lb/>with great rapidity. But the trouble<lb/>with the Provincial Secretary is that he is<lb/>too ardent and sanguine. His imagina<lb break="no"/>tion paints things in very bright colors,<lb/>and he is apt to believe it is all real. For<lb/>example, he introduced some yars ago<lb/>the Prohibitory Liquor Law, and he told<lb/>us that if it was carried it would entail<lb/>blessings on the country. Well, it was<lb/>carried, and the result proved that the<lb/>Secretary's predictions were all wrong,<lb/>for not only was the country thrown into<lb/>two elections, but I believe there has beeen<lb/>more drinking since as the consequence<lb/>of that law then ever was before. Now<lb/>he say I never introduced any great mea<lb break="no"/>sure; will, this is one of the great measures<lb/>brought forward by the Secretary. Then<lb/>there was the Inter-colonial Railway.<lb/>He made an arrangement with Canada to<lb/>build that road, and went to England on a<lb/>delegation to consummate the whole affair,<lb/>and when he returned he told us that<lb/>Messrs. Howland and Sicotte, the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian delegates had broken faith, and there<lb/>was the end of that matter. These gen<lb break="no"/>tlemen think they are not guilty of that<lb/>charge. All that time I was Attorney<lb/>General, and was associated with the<lb/>Secretary, and on that question I resigned<lb/>my office. He says I am opposed to<lb/>Railways. That is not the case; but in<lb/>the matter of incurring large liabilities<lb/>I am, and have been very cautious. He<lb/>says I show great inconsistency in my<lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        
action and statements. Now in 1862 I<lb/>said that the Railway was costing £ 200<lb/>a day, and that every passenger cost £ 5.<lb/>That was a fact, but is that any reason<lb/>why at the present time I should not look<lb/>forward to its paying six per cent. Is<lb/>there any inconsistency in that? Now I<lb/>will read what I did say in my resigna<lb break="no"/>tion in 1862.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p rendition="simple:right">"FREDERICTON, Oct.10, 1862.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"SIR: The delegates representing<lb/>the Government of this Province at the<lb/>Convention recently held in Canada to<lb/>consider the subject of the Inter Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway from Halifax to Quebec,<lb/>have undertaken, on behalf of this<lb/>Province, to build the railway con<lb break="no"/>jointly with Canada and Nova Scotia,<lb/>and to bear seven twenty-fourths of<lb/>the cost of the work; and the Council<lb/>have affirmed their action, and are pre<lb break="no"/>paring to take steps to give effect to the<lb/>arrangement so made.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"This scheme is, in my opinion,<lb/>fraught with consequences most in<lb break="no"/>jurious to the welfare and best interests<lb/>of this Province. It involves a heavy<lb/>charge upon the Province, which, added<lb/>to our present indebtedness, will im<lb break="no"/>pose a financial burden which I think<lb/>our population and resources will not<lb/>justify upon any sound principle of po<lb break="no"/>litical economy.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"A very important element in the<lb/>consideration of this subject, in my<lb/>judgement, is the fact that thes works<lb/>are to be constructed with borrowed<lb/>foreign capital, the payment of the in<lb break="no"/>terest of which will be a never-ending<lb/>drain upon our financial resources,<lb/>which ultimately must have a most<lb/>withering effect upon the prosperity<lb/>and seriously retard the advancement<lb/>of the Province.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"It should not be forgotten that the<lb/>interest on the debt already contracted<lb/>for our present railway is about £ 200<lb/>per day. The earnings of the road it<lb/>may be fairly said are not more than<lb/>sufficient to pay the running expenses,<lb/>including wear and tear. The interest<lb/>is paid abroad, and I am much mis<lb break="no"/>taken if the effect of this has not al<lb break="no"/>ready been highly prejudicial to the<lb/>business of the country.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"Our present financial condition<lb/>is by no means flattering, and will require<lb/>the most careful and prudent manage<lb break="no"/>ment in order to meet local require<lb break="no"/>ments and preserve public faith.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"The proposed enterprise if accom<lb break="no"/>plished must largely increase taxation,<lb/>which in my estimation the people are<lb/>unable and unwilling to bear, our pre<lb break="no"/>sent tariff is as high as circumstances<lb/>will warrant.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"My views on this subject may be<lb/>erroneous, but I have given it the most<lb/>careful and deliberate consideration,<lb/>with a full appreciation of its magni<lb break="no"/>tude and the importance of teh step I<lb/>am about to take. Under these circum<lb break="no"/>stances I feel myself constrained by a<lb/>sense of public duty to seperate from my<lb/>colleagues, and retire from the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and I now beg to tender to your<lb/>Excellency my resignation.   *     *     *"<lb/>
