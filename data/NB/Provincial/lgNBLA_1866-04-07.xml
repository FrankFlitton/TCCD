<!-- GL, 2018-03-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 
   
           <!-- <p>
     " I cannot now remember what took 
     <lb/>place in the Conference when that reso<lb break="no"/>lution passed, nor do my minutes show,<lb/>as it was of very secondary importance<lb/>when compared with many of the ques<lb break="no"/>tions which were discussed."<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is a question whether this was of 
     <lb/>very secondary importance. But he goes<lb/>on : " I was not present when the re<lb break="no"/>vised copy, engrossed on parchment,<lb/>was signed by the delegation ; but I<lb/>signed alone some time afterwards upon<lb/>the assurance of Colonel Barnard, the<lb/>Secretary, that it was a true copy of<lb/>what had been agreed upon." He<lb/>signed on the sole authority of Mr. Bar<lb break="no"/>nard ! on so large and important a mea<lb break="no"/>sure without investigation ! This letter<lb/>is signed by Charles Fisher.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Here then it is distinctly proved that 
     <lb/>the Canadian delegates, without con<lb break="no"/>sulting any others who were equally<lb/>interesting in the Union proposed, alter<lb break="no"/>ed this document, which was to be at<lb/>once the bulwark and fortress of free<lb break="no"/>dom.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It had been charged that the despatch<lb/>received from the British Government<lb/>was held back so as to send our delega<lb break="no"/>tion home, but he believed that had that<lb/>despatch been laid before the House by<lb/>the Government, it would have in<lb break="no"/>fluenced a larger number to vote for<lb/>that delegation. The Hon. Attorney<lb/>General had explained this matter, but<lb/>he (Mr. A.) was under the impression<lb/>that it was not received till a day or two<lb/>before the rising the House, and after<lb/>the delegation had been resolved on.<lb/>Upon this he could not now be confi<lb break="no"/>dent, but he was very strongly im<lb break="no"/>pressed that such was the case.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">HON. MR. SMITH</persName> said that the des-<lb break="maybe"/>patch bore no date of its receipt, but he<lb/>was sure it was but a few days before<lb/>the rising of the House that it was laid<lb/>before them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName> continued—The dis<lb break="no"/>patch of the 12th July had been condemn<lb break="no"/>ed in unmeasured terms, but what do the<lb/>Government there put forth to call down<lb/>the charge of disloyalty ? They say :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" A large majority of the people of this<lb/>Province are opposed to any closer politi<lb break="no"/>cal connection with Canada than that af<lb break="no"/>forded by the tie of a common allegiance to<lb/>the British Crown, and consider that such<lb/>union would have a decided tendency to<lb/>weaken that dependence on the British<lb/>Empire which they so highly prize,<lb/>and would lead to the neglect and injury of<lb/>their local interests."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And, he won'd ask, were we not better<lb/>qualified to judge on these points than<lb/>Mr. Cardwell? No man will venture to<lb/>dispute that it was our right and duty to<lb/>consult our own interests in the matter,<lb/>and when Mr. Cardwell speaks of "just<lb/>authority," though it may not be coercion,<lb/>yet it was so near it that it became the<lb/>duty of the Government to speak out and<lb/>say, you may speak of ' just authority,'<lb/>but we have rights upon which you can<lb break="no"/>not infringe without weakening that au<lb break="no"/>thority."<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Again, the Government in their dis<lb break="no"/>patch had said :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" When a wish is expressed by Her<lb/>Majesty's Government, it will be received<lb/>with that deference which is due to sug<lb break="no"/>gestions emanating from so high a<lb/>source."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>26<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>And again :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" They feel assured that Her Majesty's<lb/>Government will expect and desire that<lb/>the Government of this Province should<lb/>act according to their own convictions of<lb/>right, and in conformity with the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the people they represent."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>When the resolutions were first sent<lb/>home, Mr. Cardwell had complained of<lb/>some of the provisions, and yet now he<lb/>was anxious to thrust it upon us, and<lb/>well had he expressed his own and Mr.<lb/>Bright's views, which were, that we should<lb/>be thrown off on our own resources and<lb/>made to provide our own means of de<lb break="no"/>fence. The disposition of this people is<lb/>to hold on to the land they love, but he<lb/>looked upon the carrying out of this<lb/>scheme as the first stepping stone to an<lb break="no"/>nexation. When he heard in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive halls of Canada the statement of one<lb/>of their members, that he had done much<lb/>for that Province, and at length had<lb/>" brought these Colonies to the threshold<lb/>of independence," he knew that the whole<lb/>scheme pointed to this result. On their<lb/>late trip to Canada, they were at the<lb/>small town of Tecona, and learning that<lb/>Mr. Cartier was also there, he (Mr. A.)<lb/>called on him to pay his respects. In<lb/>the course of the conversation, Mr. Car<lb break="no"/>tier asked: " What do you say to the<lb/>dispatches down in the Lower Provinces?"<lb/>He replied that we were now almost dis<lb break="no"/>patch proof. Mr. Cartier said : "Oh, but<lb/>you must come in." He answered that<lb/>we should not come in if we found it was<lb/>not to our advantage. Mr. C. replied :<lb/>" Oh, but wait a few weeks till after<lb/>Smith gets back, and see what dispatches<lb/>you will get." Mr. Anglin said he did<lb/>not know, to which he replied, " But I<lb/>know." Here, then, was the source from<lb/>whence the dispatches came—these dis<lb break="no"/>patches which were put forth as the<lb/>ipsissima verba, the sacred word of Her<lb/>Majesty, when it was more than<lb/>probable that Her Majesty had never even<lb/>seen the despatch. It is well understood<lb/>that the Queen can do no wrong, and<lb/>herein consists the disloyalty and the<lb/>treason, for instead of making the Mini-<lb break="maybe"/>ister of the Colonial Office responsible<lb/>for these acts they desire to turn the<lb/>point back upon the throne itself ; and<lb/>what, he woutd ask, is the good of con<lb break="no"/>stitutional liberties if such action is to<lb/>be tolerated. When the Government<lb/>received that despatch from Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>well, preceded as it had been by all that <lb/>previously had been said and done, they<lb/>felt themselves to be in a perilous posi<lb break="no"/>tion. Was it any wonder that they sat<lb/>down and carefully, calmly and serious<lb break="no"/>ly took the matter in hand, and in<lb/>speaking to Mr. Cardwell to speak in<lb/>unmistakeable language to the people<lb/>of Canada. Not in the midst of drunken<lb/>revelry, but as to slow, solemn and<lb/>earnest work, they sat themselves down<lb/>to the task. And now he would ask, was<lb/>there in that Memorandum of Council<lb/>one word derogatory to the Queen ; if<lb/>there was, he was willing to go on his<lb/>knees and recall it ; but there was not<lb/>one, and in all his public and private life<lb/>since his coming to the country, he chal<lb break="no"/>lenged any one to say that he had com<lb break="no"/>mitted an act that was derogatory to his<lb/>character or damaging to the best inter<lb break="no"/>ests of this Province, and once more he<lb/>would express the pride and satisfaction<lb/>he felt that his name was appended to<lb/>that document.<lb/>

     As I have been called to take the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of Official Reporter, suddenly vaca<lb break="no"/>ted by Mr. Archer, and as I am conscious<lb/>of having done far less than justice to<lb/>this portion of Mr. Anglin's speech, I may<lb/>say that not having followed the debate<lb/>through its windings, and coming in on<lb/>the middle of a speech abounding with al<lb break="no"/>lusions to what had preceded it, it was al<lb break="no"/>most impossible that I should be in a<lb/>position to report with that correctness<lb/>and precision that an accurate acquaint<lb break="no"/>ance with the other speeches would have<lb/>given.

     On motion of <persName ref="pers:COST1">MR. COSTIGAN</persName>, the 
     <lb/>House went into Committee on " A Bill<lb/>to encourage the exploration of vacant<lb/>Crown Lands and the discovery of Tim<lb break="no"/>ber Berths thereon."

     ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName>.—Before I begin, I will 
     <lb/>express my regret at having occupied the<lb/>attention of the House so long. I felt,<lb/>and still feel, that the debate has hung<lb/>on so long that it is scarcely warrantable<lb/>to protract it, but some of the hon.<lb/>members wanted explanations of various<lb/>kinds, which so interrupted me as ren<lb break="no"/>dered it impossible for me to get<lb/>through yesterday. I do not want to<lb/>complain of it, but I bring it forward<lb/>as an excuse for taking up the time to<lb break="no"/>day. I concluded last evening with<lb/>drawing your attention to a despatch<lb/>from Mr. Cardwell, and was endeavour<lb break="no"/>ing to show what there was to justify<lb/>us in entertaining some doubts as to the<lb/>exact meaning of the despatch. There<lb/>was nothing ungenglemanly or uncour<lb break="no"/>teous in our conduct in expressing such<lb/>doubts. I would like to have you point<lb/>out to me what paragraph—what sen<lb break="no"/>tence—what line, or what word there is<lb/>in that Memorandum in which there is<lb/>any thing disloyal or any thing that<lb/>evinces disrespect. True, we alluded to<lb/>the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> newspaper, but we knew that<lb/>those Canadian delegates were in Eng<lb break="no"/>land plotting against the liberties of<lb/>this country, and we knew they had<lb/>with them extraordinary resources to<lb/>enable them to do so. We found in<lb/>that paper false statements which had<lb/>originated in this Province, but had been<lb/>copied in that leading paper of the<lb/>world, and made the foundation of<lb/>newspaper articles; we believed these<lb/>articles were inspired by these Canadian<lb/>delegates and Mr. Cardwell and the<lb/>members of the Imperial Parliament<lb/>

     were told the same stories, and were led 
     <lb/>to misunderstand the whole nature of<lb/>our position. That was the reason which<lb/>led us to say :<lb/>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>" The Committee, of course, cannot<lb/>suppose that the British Government<lb/>share the ignorance with regard to the<lb/>history and character of the Federal<lb/>Scheme which appears to prevail among<lb/>the British public, and which induces the<lb/>" Times" newspaper of the twentieth<lb/>of June, to observe that " the two<lb/>Canadas have put aside their ancient<lb/>jealousies, and are ready to meet in a<lb/>common Legislature, in apparent forget<lb break="no"/>fulness of the fact that they have so met<lb/>for the last five and twenty years," &amp;c.<lb/>

            <p>We thought he did show that ignorance<lb/>in that dispatch, but we think new light<lb/>has been thrown upon it by subsequent<lb/>events. When we found statements of<lb/>this kind in the " Times" newspaper oper<lb break="no"/>ating upon the English people, who are<lb/>Mr. Cardwel's masters, we did not think<lb/>it unjustifiable to make an allusion to an<lb/>article which we believed was put before<lb/>the people of England to create an erro<lb break="no"/>neous impression of the state of things<lb/>which existed in this Province and I do<lb/>not think we should be characterized as<lb/>mean and low by so doing. The House<lb/>will judge whether it was justifiable or<lb/>not. I am free to admit it was out of the<lb/>ordinary course of proceeding, but it had<lb/>become somewhat necessary from the<lb/>state of things that existed. It was not<lb/>in accordance with strict decorum, but by<lb/>so doing we were bringing the matter<lb/>more forcibly, fully and clearly under the<lb/>observation of the Colonial Secretary, and<lb/>I appeal to the Honse to say if there was<lb/>anything low or mean in our referring to<lb/>that paper.

            <p>I again proclaim my solemn convic<lb break="no"/>tion, that that is the language of loyalty<lb/>and truth, and that it was our duty on<lb/>that occasion to have spoken as we did.<lb/>If there be in that memorandum one<lb/>word an honest, impartial man can say<lb/>is unbecoming for the Government of<lb/>this country to utter in an address to<lb/>the Imperial Government, I would<lb/>humbly retract it. We pondered and<lb/>deliberated over every word in it, and we<lb/>had no intention, wish desire or idea o<lb/>conveying in it either insolence or dis<lb break="no"/>respect, much less disloyalty or trea<lb break="no"/>son, and I defy any man to make trea<lb break="no"/>son, disloyalty or disrespect out of it.<lb/>It stands before the intelligence of the<lb/>empire, and it speaks for itself. I feel<lb/>proud of it, and I am prepared to reiter<lb break="no"/>ate every word it contains. There has<lb/>been no change of the opinions of the<lb/>people in regard to Confederation. I<lb/>meet men day after day, of all classes<lb/>and all creeds, I speak to them in fami<lb break="no"/>liar intercourse, and I receive letters from<lb/>all parts of the Province ; but from the<lb/>time of the last election up to the present<lb/>moment, I never yet met the man who<lb/>has changed from being in opposition to<lb/>Confederation and become an advocate of<lb/>the Quebec Scheme. True, the strong<lb/>declarations of the Imperial Government<lb/>have produced an effect upon the minds<lb/>of some parties in the Province. We de<lb break="no"/>clare we are willing and anxious to meet<lb/>and carry out the views of the British<lb/>Government so far as is consistent with<lb/>our interest ; but this Quebec Scheme,<lb/>the more we reflect upon it, the more we<lb/>feel it will bring ruin and destruction<lb/>upon the Province It is said that you,<lb/>the people of New Brunswick, must<lb/>abandon everything—sacrifice your in<lb break="no"/>dependence—throw away your property,<lb/>and place yourselves completely under<lb/>the control of Canada, because Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>well says you ought to do so. That would<lb/>be an unreasonable, slavish loyalty We<lb/>say we object to that scheme, more parti<lb break="no"/>cularly to the principle of representation<lb/>by population ; but we are told that the<lb/>people of Upper Canada have fought for<lb/>that for twenty-five years, and they will<lb/>never give it up. Some people say they<lb/>object to the federal principle ; but the<lb/>people of Lower Canada say they can only<lb/>be protected by that, and they never will<lb/>consent to any other scheme. All our<lb/>objections go for nothing ; we must con<lb break="no"/>sent to any thing Upper or Lower Canada<lb/>may demand. They may refuse to con<lb break="no"/>sent to this or that, but if we refuse to<lb/>accept any of the terms which they choose<lb/>to give us, we are denounced as being<lb/>disloyal. Will such arguments as that<lb/>be accepted by the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try. That Memorandum has been one of<lb/>the chief charges against the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and I have shown how disgraceful<lb/>those charges are.

     though I was dictator. What would 
     <lb/>
     make me dictator? Were my talents of 
     <lb/>
     such wonderful power that I, a compara<lb break="no"/>tive stranger in this country, should have 
     <lb/>
     the control of the Government. The ad 
     <lb/>
     vocates of the Scheme found they could 
     <lb/>
    not appeal to the common sense of the 
     <lb/>people with any chance of success; they 
     <lb/>therefore, appealed to the passions and 
     <lb/>prejudices of the people to do their work. 
     <lb/>At the very time was denounced at the 
     <lb/>hustings of York as " the great monster 
     <lb/>that held the Government in the hollow 
     <lb/>of his hand." I was not virtually a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Government. My colleagues 
     <lb/>knew at that time it was my intention to 
     <lb/>resign, and that I was in the minority and 
     <lb/>could not have my own way. At the time 
     <lb/>when it was proclaimed that the contest 
     <lb/>was between Anglin and the people of 
     <lb/>York, I said to the Attorney General, "you 
     <lb/>know best whether you and I are to part; 
     <lb/>you know best whether the proceedings of 
     <lb/>the Western Extension Company are such 
     <lb/>as to satisfy you ; if they are, I must leave 
     <lb/>you, and you might as well have ben<lb break="no"/>efit of my absence." The Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral said he never would consent to truckle 
     <lb/>to such a cry, and I felt he was right, al<lb break="no"/>though I urged him to make any sacrifice, 
     <lb/>for I did not want my position and 
     <lb/>character to stand between his country 
     <lb/>and its prosperity. Another charge 
     <lb/>made against this Government was, 
     <lb/>that they refused to publish for the in<lb break="no"/>formation of the people of this Province. 
     <lb/>the despatches which were sent from 
     <lb/>the Colonial Secretary. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment never refused any thing of the<lb/>kind. It has been shown by the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General that it is an unusual course 
     <lb/>to publish despatches ; the usual course 
     <lb/>being to submit them to the people 
     <lb/>through the Legislature. Under the 
     <lb/>circumstances in which we were placed 
     <lb/>Mr. Cardwell expected those despatches 
     <lb/>to be published, and now it is called a 
     <lb/>serious crime because they were not 
     <lb/>published here as soon as they were 
     <lb/>published in Halifax. In order to give 
     <lb/>coloring to those charges they have to 
     <lb/>put aside physical position, geographi<lb break="no"/>cal difficulties, space and time. I had 
     <lb/>one of those despatches which had been 
     <lb/>printed in Halifax, and my men were 
     <lb/>putting it in type before it reached His 
     <lb/>Excellency. The despatch received dur<lb break="no"/>ing the last Session of the Legistature 
     <lb/>was forgotten until a few days after the 
     <lb/>House was adjourned. It has been said 
     <lb/>that persons holding Governmental of<lb break="no"/>fices should reside at Fredericton. I 
     <lb/>hold that the County of York is not the 
     <lb/>Province, and they are not entitled to 
     <lb/>all the political offices. lf every mem 
     <lb/>ber of the Government, upon taking of<lb break="no"/>fice, would have to remove to Freder<lb break="no"/>icton, no man having a family in any 
     <lb/>other part of the Province would leave 
     <lb/>his business and remove his family to 
     <lb/>Fredericton upon the uncertain tenure 
     <lb/>of a political office. We cannot per<lb break="no"/>petually have a quorum to attend upon 
     <lb/>His Excellency. The duties of the Com<lb break="no"/>missioner of the Board of Works often 
     <lb/>call him to different parts of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and so do the duties of the Post<lb break="no"/>master General. Must they be at Fred<lb break="no"/>ericton when every steamer from Eng<lb break="no"/>land comes in, because there is a possi<lb break="no"/>bility of their receiving a despatch, 
     <lb/>which must be published within twenty- 
     <lb break="yes"/>four hours ? What difference does it 
     <lb/>make so long as it comes before them 
     <lb/>in ample time for them to consider and 
     <lb/>take action upon it. This is an absurd 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
          

     charge against the Government, and<lb/>which, when tested by the light of com<lb break="no"/>mon sense, disappears altogether. ( <persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Lindsey</persName>—Why was not the despatch of 
     <lb/>
     the 12th of April published during the 
     <lb/>
     Session ?) That was an oversight, it 
     <lb/>
     was published a few days after the Ses<lb break="no"/>sion closed. I think have taken up 
     <lb/>
     every count in the indictment, and 
     <lb/>
     shown how futile they are. In regard 
     <lb/>
     to Confederation, under the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Scheme, there has been no change in 
     <lb/>
     public opinion whatever, and it is almost 
     <lb/>
     a waste of the time and patience of the 
     <lb/>
     House to argue against it. It is a scheme 
     <lb/>
     which cannot bear the light, for the more 
     <lb/>
     light that is thrown upon it the more 
     <lb/>
     hideons does it appear. When the 
     <lb/>
     scheme was first devised its advocates 
     <lb/>
     set their wits to work to find arguments 
     <lb/>
     in its favor, and their chief argument 
     <lb/>
     was, that it was necessary for defence. 
     <lb/>
     They said, whatever else you may think 
     <lb/>
     of it, this one point cannot be disputed. 
     <lb/>
     " union is strength." We must have  
     <lb/>
     this Confederation scheme, as it is the 
     <lb/>
     best we can get We must have some 
     <lb/>
     scheme of Union for the purpose of de<lb break="no"/>fence. It cannot be posponed, the army 
     <lb/>
     of the United States will cross our fron<lb break="no"/>tier, and unless we are united we can<lb break="no"/>not offer any resistance, therefore the 
     <lb/>
     urgency of the case admis of no delay. 
     <lb/>
     The people felt that there was nothing 
     <lb/>
     in this, for that scheme would not give 
     <lb/>
     us one additional man, or one addition<lb break="no"/>al dollar, or enable us to use one man 
     <lb/>
     more efficiently. We have to look to 
     <lb/>
     our own right arms, and our own means, 
     <lb/>
     to defend ourselves if trouble should 
     <lb/>
     come, for it is ridiculous to think we 
     <lb/>
     should receive any help from Ottawa. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot concentrate our strength 
     <lb/>
     where there is no interior ; and no mili<lb break="no"/>tary men of any character would ven<lb break="no"/>ture to take the grounds, that by uniting 
     <lb/>
     with Canada we would concentrate our 
     <lb/>
     strength. Have those fortifications been 
     <lb/>
     erected which the Hon. John A. MacDon<lb break="no"/>ald said would admit of no delay when he 
     <lb/>
     was advocating this scheme of Union. 
     <lb/>
     Since his return from England the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian Legislature has met, but they have 
     <lb/>
     made no provision for defence. There 
     <lb/>
     has been nothing done to erect fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions from Halifax to Sarnia ; the only<lb/>
    money that has been expended has been 
     <lb/>expended by the Imperial Government. 
     <lb/>I has been said that if we went into 
     <lb/>union the Inter-colonial Railway would 
     <lb/>be built, and we would concentrate our 
     <lb/>troops.  If this railway was built, it 
     <lb/>would have to occupy a position no 
     <lb/>over twenty-five miles from the frontier, 
     <lb/>and a mere handful of men could cross 
     <lb/>the border and tear up the rails, burn 
     <lb/> the bridges, and render the road im<lb break="no"/>passable for weeks. From the position 
     <lb/>of the country, it would take all our 
     <lb/>forces to guard that road and the line 
     <lb/>of telegraph which would have to be 
     <lb/>constructed alongside of it. If that 
     <lb/>road was constructed we could not 
     <lb/>spare any men to send to Canada, 
     <lb/>neither could Canada spare any for us. 
     <lb/>If war did occur with the United States,<lb/>it would not be a pigmy war, for we 
     <lb/>would have to content with hundreds 
     <lb/>of thousands of men. I have been 
     <lb/>through Canada and examined the 
     <lb/>country with it view to this question. 
     <lb/>and I can say, that in case of war with 
     <lb/>the United States, that Canada, with 
     <lb/>all the aid the empire could afford her, 
     <lb/>would have as much as she could do to 
     <lb/>take care of herself, and she could not 
     <lb/>
    

            <cb/>
       

     
     send a single man to our aid. Under             
     <lb/>
    the old arrangement for building this 
     <lb/>Inter colonial Railroad, it was said we 
     <lb/>would have to pay 3 1-2 thirteenths of 
     <lb/>the amount required, but under the 
     <lb/>present arrangements we would have 
     <lb/>to pay but one thirteenth. I believe 
     <lb/>that there are some men in this country 
     <lb/>so easily duped to believe that ab<lb break="no"/>surd statement. Instead of paying the 
     <lb/>one thirteenth, we will have to pay it 
     <lb/>all, and they have power to extract it 
     <lb/>from us by means of their tariff. They 
     <lb/>promise to build the road, but we have 
     <lb/>no security that they will do so. If they 
     <lb/>did, it would be charged to the general 
     <lb/>revenue, and so would the extension of 
     <lb/>the canals and the purchase of the North 
     <lb/>West Territory. It had been calculated 
     <lb/>that this territory could be purchased 
     <lb/>from the company for $1,500,000 but  
     <lb/>they have refused to part with 4,000,000  
     <lb/>acres of that territory for £5,000,000 
     <lb/>sterling. We would have to pay<lb/>
               <lb/>our share of that, and we would<lb/>have to pay our share of all <lb/>their extravagance. Within the last 
     <lb/>ten years the expenditure of Canada has 
     <lb/>increased four-fold. It has been stated 
     <lb/>at several public meetings that it was 
     <lb/>not the intention of the Conference. or 
     <lb/>rather the Government of Canada, to<lb/>undertake the construction of this road<lb/>from River du Loup to Truro. but they 
     <lb/>were to give $12,000,000 as a free gift 
     <lb/>to a company to build it. That's $12,000,<lb break="no"/>000 could be obtained under the Im<lb break="no"/>perial guarantee at four per cent., the 
     <lb/>interest on which would amount to 
     <lb/>$480,000. We had submitted to us last 
     <lb/>year the report of the Controller of 
     <lb/>Customs; and it is a most extraordinary 
     <lb/>coincidence that according to his calcu<lb break="no"/>lations of what our revenue of last year 
     <lb/>would have been by the adoption of the 
     <lb/>Canadian tariff, we would have paid 
     <lb/>into Canada the precise sum of $180,000, 
     <lb/>which would have been the interest on 
     <lb/>the whole sum required to build the 
     <lb/>road. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     A few years ago, at the beginning of 
     <lb/>
     the war, there was a foolish and exces<lb break="no"/>sive sympathy shown, by some of the 
     <lb/>
     people of these Provinces, for the South<lb break="no"/>ern states and their cause. We know 
     <lb/>that in several places, and in our <lb/>
     own Province amongst the rest, 
     <lb/>expeditions were fitted out against<lb/>
     the Northern States. A body of 
     <lb/>
     men went from St. John to take 
     <lb/>
     the Chesapeake, and the Government 
     <lb/>
    did not do their duty to the United States, 
     <lb/>for they should have taken means to have 
     <lb/>punished a crime like that. We know 
     <lb/>that such things occurred throughout Ca<lb break="no"/>nada, but when the fortune of war turn<lb break="no"/>ed, they soon quailed before the increas<lb break="no"/>ing strength of the neighboring Republic, 
     <lb/>and to satisfy the Government of the 
     <lb/>United States, they psssed the Alien Act, 
     <lb/>that deprived any stranger coming into 
     <lb/>the country of his legal rights. It enabled 
     <lb/>any person to go to a Magistrate and say, 
     <lb/>I suspect such a one, and he was impri<lb break="no"/>soned without the benefit of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">habeus 
     <lb/>corpus</hi>. Having passed this Act, they 
     <lb/>were relieved of certain restrictions which 
     <lb/>were placed upon these Provinces. I was 
     <lb/>told by some of the hotel keepers of St. 
     <lb/>John that we must do something to satis<lb break="no"/>fy the people of the United States, for 
     <lb/>those restrictions were ruining their busi<lb break="no"/>ness. I said I would never consent to the 
     <lb/>passage of any law that would virtually 
     <lb/>bar this country against the stranger or 
     <lb/>the alien, and any law this kind I

would consider an insult to the independ<lb break="no"/>ence of this people, for we should maintain<lb/>our independence no matter what our<lb/>losses may be. If we had been into Con<lb break="no"/>federation, we would have had the Alien<lb/>Law too, and no Southern refugees<lb/>would have dared to linger about our<lb/>streets. Our land would no longer have<lb/>been an asylum for the unfortunate, and<lb/>while we shared in the glory of Canada,<lb/>we should have drunk to the dregs that<lb/>cup of humiliation. The remark was<lb/>made during the course of the debate that<lb/>it was a pity that we had to go as five dif<lb break="no"/>ferent Provinces, to negotiate concerning<lb/>the Reciprocity Treaty. If we could all<lb/>act as one country, and have our inter<lb break="no"/>ests in common, how much more influ<lb break="no"/>ence we would have, and how much bet<lb break="no"/>ter terms we could get. If nothing else<lb/>would satisfy the people of this Province<lb/>that they are better off out of Confeder<lb break="no"/>ation, the proceedings at Washington<lb/>ought to do so, and we should be glad<lb/>that Mr. Galt had no authority to speak<lb/>for us.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It is said that Canada would reduce her<lb/>tariff, that there were to be two additional<lb/>Legislatures and two additional Govern<lb break="no"/>ments ; we were to have the inter Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Railway build, and were to buy out<lb/>the North Pole ; we were to open up the<lb/>canals, and the Northwest territory ; we<lb/>were to support a great army and navy ;<lb/>we were to keep up bridges, schools and<lb/>all additional expenses, and do it for a<lb/>smaller sum than we now require. To<lb/>prove this, they pile figures together un<lb break="no"/>til ordinary minds cannot distinguish<lb/>falsehood from truth. It is perfectly ab<lb break="no"/>surd, and insulting to the intelligence of<lb/>the people, to tell them all this can be<lb/>done for a less sum of money than is now<lb/>expended. Under the tariff as it stood<lb/>last year, we pay to the General Govern<lb/>ment $700,000, and we receive for local<lb/>purposes only $201,000. In thirty years our<lb/>population is likely to be doubled and of<lb/>course our revenue will be increased in pro<lb break="no"/>portion, but it will all have to be absorb<lb break="no"/>ed in the maelstrom at Ottawa, while we<lb/>will receive only $201,000, notwithstand<lb break="no"/>ing our increased expenses. We came<lb/>here to oppose that scheme The hon.<lb/>leader of the Opposition said Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion had nothing to do with this question.<lb/>If he got a majority he would speak dif<lb break="no"/>ferently. It is very well for him to make<lb/>that assertion now for the sake of get<lb break="no"/>ting the votes of those who proclaim<lb/>themselves to be anti-Confederates. This<lb/>is precisely the same as was done at the<lb/>York election. My hon. friend (Mr. F.)<lb/>got people to vote for him as an anti-<lb break="yes"/>Confederate, little supposing they would<lb/>find themselves declared converts to the<lb/>Confederation scheme. It has been said<lb/>that there is some scheme of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in the Speech. The very men who<lb/>abused the Government of the country<lb/>because they did not publish dispatches<lb/>the moment they received them, now turn<lb/>round and say, because you say you have<lb/>received certain dispatches, and presume to<lb/>submit those dispatches, you prove to us<lb/>that you have some foul design against the<lb/>liberties of the people. I undertake to<lb/>say they have no scheme to submit. If<lb/>they had a scheme I should judge of it<lb/>as it deserved. If there be any attempt<lb/>to force Confederation upon us, I shall be<lb/>found one of the most resolute opponents<lb/>of such a scheme. I believe the Imperi<lb break="no"/>al Government has a right to hold com<lb break="no"/>munication with this House. Mr. Card<lb break="no"/>well has a right to require that any<lb/>
    

            <cb/>
        
dispatch which he chooses to send out<lb/>shall be submitted to the House, and it<lb/>is the duty of the Government to submit<lb/>them. They do not commit themselves<lb/>when they express the hope that<lb/>those dispatches which they submit<lb/>shall receive that respect and attention<lb/>which is due to suggestions emanating<lb/>from so high a source. It is quite true<lb/>that the paragraph in the Speech is broad<lb/>enough to cover anything. It frequently<lb/>happens that the language of the Speech<lb/>is very enigmatical, even in regard to the<lb/>Reform Bill now before the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament, there is no promise in the Speech<lb/>that such a bill would be introduced. The<lb/>members of the Government have been<lb/>repeatedly asked whether they intended<lb/>to bring in a Scheme of Confederation,<lb/>and they have declared they have no such<lb/>intention. I feel bound to believe what<lb/>they say until I see good reason to the con<lb break="no"/>trary. As the Amendment stands, it<lb/>strikes out of the Address the passage<lb/>which says the rights and interests of the<lb/>people of this Province must be protect<lb break="no"/>ed. This is the one portion of this whole<lb/>Address that this Amendment swept<lb/>away : to all other parts they have no ob<lb break="no"/>jection. This is the most serious blunder,<lb/>and I think the whole proceeding is a<lb/>blunder, for it he had allowed the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress to pass, and then brought in a mo<lb break="no"/>tion of Want of Confidence, he could<lb/>have received all the document he choos<lb/>ed to ask for ; neither will he have the<lb/>privilege of making the last speech, for<lb/>there are other paragraphs to pass and<lb/>other members will have an opportunity<lb/>of replying. I have made repeated allu<lb break="no"/>sion to the extraordinary position in which<lb/>I have found myself placed in this coun<lb break="no"/>try, without having done anything to de<lb break="no"/>serve it. While those attacks are<lb/>made on me, I do not allow my<lb break="no"/>self to feel annoyed because I feel<lb/>conscious that I do not deserve them.<lb/>No man can injure me in the estimation<lb/>of my friends, or in my business, but if<lb/>the late York election is any criterion of<lb/>the state of things that exist in this<lb/>Province, if those misrepresentations<lb/>upon my character had the effect, which<lb/>it is said they had, it is a reason why I<lb/>should stand here and refute those at<lb break="no"/>tacks as I am now prepared to do. It<lb/>was reported that I was proclaimed a<lb/>traitor by the successful candidate ; he<lb/>has denied that he said so, but we know<lb/>from experience that it is exceedingly<lb/>difficult to know what he says. His<lb/>voice is clear and distinct, but there<lb/>may be something in the atmosphere<lb/>which does not harmonize with it. It<lb/>may be that ordinary mortals cannot<lb/>distinguish the sounds which he utters<lb/>Certain it is that while he positively and<lb/>repeatedly denies that he said certain<lb/>things, almost every person imagined<lb/>they heard him utter them. When he<lb/>denies that he uttered a certain word or<lb/>expression, I am bound to accept that<lb/>denial, and act as if the denial was true.<lb/>I do not mean to say that the denial is not<lb/>true an apology may satisfy for a<lb/>charge of that kind, but the most com<lb break="no"/>plete, the most abject disgusting apol<lb break="no"/>ogy any man can conceive, is when he<lb/>who has uttered such words afterwards<lb/>says, I never uttered them. I cannot<lb/>believe any man holding his head erect<lb/>or any man who is thought worthy by his<lb/>fellow-men to occupy a seat in this House,<lb/>would ever be guilty of conduct so con<lb break="no"/>temptible. I prefer to believe when he<lb/>says " I did not use such words," he says<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
         
what he believes to be true. I am pre<lb break="no"/>pared to meet the charge of treason,<lb/>and to vindicate my character from<lb/>the day I came to the use of rea<lb break="no"/>son to this hour ; but as my hon. friend de<lb break="no"/>nies making the charge, I am on that point<lb/>most thoroughly vindicated. The hon.<lb/>member (Mr. F.) does admit making se<lb break="no"/>veral charges against me ; one of them<lb/>was that I challenged the people of York<lb/>to do what I did not. I have often been<lb/>called a scoundrel, traitor, and every de<lb break="no"/>scription of vile names in the category,<lb/>but I have yet to learn that I have been<lb/>called a fool, and surely nothing could be<lb/>more foolish and absurd on my part—<lb/>wishing, as I did, that the people of<lb/>York would speak out as they had<lb/>spoken before on the great ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation—than to chal<lb break="no"/>lenge the people of York to ex<lb break="no"/>ercise their free will, or to say anything<lb/>that implied that they had not the right<lb/>to act as they thought proper. I did<lb/>put a challenge in my paper, but it was<lb/>not a challenge to the people of York.<lb/>I thought they were then prepared, as<lb/>they were before, to fight for their<lb/>country against Confederation. I had<lb/>no idea that they were going to be<lb/>called to fight against me. ( <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. Anglin</persName> <lb/>then read his challenge to the confeder<lb break="no"/>ates of York, to bring out a confederate<lb/>to test public opinion in regard to con<lb break="no"/>federation, and after commenting on<lb/>this, he read Mr. Fisher's address to the<lb/>electors of York, on which he also made<lb/>some comments.) Mr. Anglin con<lb break="no"/>tinued. He (Mr. Fisher) said he was<lb/>forced out by the challenge, to vindicate<lb/>the people of York against a man who<lb/>thus dare insult them, and who sympa<lb break="no"/>thised with the enemies of the country<lb/>during the Crimean war and the Indian<lb/>Mutiny. ( <persName ref="pers:FISH1">Mr. Fisher</persName>.—True.) It is<lb/>untrue ; if he (Mr. F.) believed me to<lb/>be a traitor, he should not have worked<lb/>with me day and night in the House of<lb/>Assembly, or been willing to take me<lb/>into the Government if he had got the<lb/>chance to form one. He should have<lb/>turned his back on me and said, " You<lb/>may have talent and strength, but with<lb/>men of such a description of loyalty I<lb/>can have nothing to do." He was glad<lb/>to accept my support, take me into his<lb/>councils and be my intimate friend. I<lb/>was charged with sympathizing with<lb/>the enemies of my country, because<lb/>during the Crimean war I dared to copy<lb/>Dr. Russell's letters to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">London Times</hi>.<lb/>There were many at the commence<lb break="no"/>ment of the war who said that to con<lb break="no"/>quer the Russians was mere holiday<lb/>amusement. They little knew what<lb/>was due to British soldiers, for by thee<lb/>misrepresentations they were depriving<lb/>them of the credit and glory due to their<lb/>deeds. I believe it was best that the<lb/>truth should be known, although I was<lb/>told that I was offending parties, and<lb/>would lose my business. I said it was<lb/>the truth, and it was my duty as a public<lb/>journalist to tell the truth. Then, in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the Indian mutiny, an outcry was<lb/>raised because I stated the truth. After<lb/>the massacre at Cawnpore, little garrisons<lb/>in various parts of the country were sur<lb break="no"/>rounded by overwhelming forces, and<lb/>deeds of valor were displayed and courage<lb/>exhibited unexampled in the history of<lb/>the world. When the tide turned, we<lb/>find men clothed with Her Majesty's com<lb break="no"/>mission forgetting humanity, and commit<lb break="no"/>ting deeds which, according to their own<lb/>accounts, were not justifiable. We find<lb/>

     men who were five hundred miles away 
     <lb/>from Cawnpore, and had never heard of<lb/>
    the massacre there, executed without trial 
     <lb/>or condemnation. I placed the facts be<lb break="no"/>fore the public then, as I did in the more 
     <lb/>recent affair in Jamaica. where men have 
     <lb/>been summarily put to death without one 
     <lb/>tittle of evidence against them, and this 
     <lb/>affaur is now being enquired into through 
     <lb/>a commission appointed by the British 
     <lb/>Government, through the influence of re<lb break="no"/>ligious bodies in England. Fortunately 
     <lb/>for the blacks, they happened to be mem<lb break="no"/>bers of a denomination which is just now 
     <lb/>very powerful in London; if it was not 
     <lb/>so, there might never have been a com<lb break="no"/>mission appointed. lt makes no differ<lb break="no"/>ence to me whether a man is a Protestant 
     <lb/>or a Papist. I deal to all the same mea<lb break="no"/>sure of justice. I would stand up for the 
     <lb/>Musselman, if unoffending, as freely as I 
     <lb/>would stand up for my own countrymen. 
     <lb/>I am in favor of freedom of speech, and I 
     <lb/>attempt to find fault with no man who   
     <lb/>chooses to address his fellow men as he 
     <lb/>pleases ; but there is a limit to freedom 
     <lb/>of speech.   License is not freedom of 
     <lb/>speech. A man may utter falsehoods, but 
     <lb/>the people; when they find how they have 
     <lb/>been deceived, will turn on those men 
     <lb/>and teach them a lesson which they ne<lb break="no"/>ver will forget.

            <p>
     It is much to be regretted that this Fe<lb break="no"/>nian association exists in the United<lb/>States. We here can do nothing to in<lb break="no"/>terfere in any way to lessen its power. 
     <lb/>
     There are various opinions in regard to 
     <lb/>
     the object of that association. Some peo<lb break="no"/>ple may think they are the greatest scoun<lb break="no"/>drels that ever disgraced the face of the 
     <lb/>
    earth; others may consider them mistaken 
     <lb/>men who, goaded by the remembrance of 
     <lb/>bitter wrongs, are led into foolish paths. 
     <lb/>It is hard for anyone who has witnessed the 
     <lb/>famine of 1848 to speak harshly of them. 
     <lb/>At that time, hundreds of my countrymen 
     <lb/>died on the streets of starvation day 
     <lb/>after day they disposed of their property 
     <lb/>at a sacrifice, to prolong their lives, and 
     <lb/>when that was gone, they huddled into 
     <lb/>some back place to starve on a pile of 
     <lb/>straw, exposed to the pittiless rain and 
     <lb/>cold winds; and thus, day after day, they 
     <lb/>pined away until they died, and morning 
     <lb/>after morning their bodies were thrown 
     <lb/>into some pit, and often but half covered 
     <lb/>up. Those who have witnessed such 
     <lb/>scenes can hardly speak harshly of those 
     <lb/>men, whatever they may think of their 
     <lb/>present undertaking. If this body of 
     <lb/>men should come and attempt to conquer 
     <lb/>this Province. their project would not 
     <lb/>only be foolish but most wicked, for these 
     <lb/>provinces have never given them cause 
     <lb/>of offence, but have always oflered an 
     <lb/>asylum and a home to their fellow coun<lb break="no"/>trymen. No hope of redressing the 
     <lb/>wrongs of their native country can justify 
     <lb/>them in invading this Province ;   and if 
     <lb/>they did, they would find the Irish people 
     <lb/>of this Province ready to take the fore<lb break="no"/>most rank to meet and repel such inva<lb break="no"/>sion. If there was danger, at the time of 
     <lb/>the York election, that these parties 
     <lb/>would come down upon us like wolves in 
     <lb/>the fold, was that the time to create jeal<lb break="no"/>ousy in the country, by setting race 
     <lb/>against race, man against man. Can any 
     <lb/>man who really values the peace and wel<lb break="no"/>fare of his country, think of such proceed<lb break="no"/>ings without horror? 
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     I spoke yesterday of an address pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the Canadians to Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>
     asking her to submit to the Imperial Par<lb break="no"/>liament a Bill for a Union of these Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, contrary to our expressed wishes. 
     <lb/>
 

            <cb/>
      

     I did not expect that conduct to be 
     <lb/>repeated by the members of our Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council to-day. I hold in my hand a<lb/>document which I think will startle and<lb/>alarm the people of this Province. I <lb/>want to speak with respect of the other<lb/>
    branch of the Legislature. I presume 
     <lb/>that in this matter the hon. members of 
     <lb/>that House have acted as they thought 
     <lb/>best, and I do not want to question their 
     <lb/>motives, but they have placed themselves   
     <lb/>in a most unenviable position. Under 
     <lb/>the Quebec Scheme, ten of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Councillors are selected from the 
     <lb/>small body of eighteen members in the 
     <lb/>Upper House. This is a large bribe to 
     <lb/>offer them, for they sit there for life. 
     <lb/>where, as has been remarked, they can 
     <lb/>see acres of plaster and miles of cornice. 
     <lb/>They ought to be careful not to give the 
     <lb/>people of this country the slightest cause 
     <lb/>of suspicion that they were influenced by 
     <lb/>anything of that kind. They are not the 
     <lb/>representatives of the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and they have no authority to 
     <lb/>speak in their behalf. They, acting with<lb break="no"/>out the concurrence of this House, will 
     <lb/>scarcely be regarded more than a mere 
     <lb/>aggregation of individuals. Shall it be 
     <lb/>said that gentlemen selected as they have 
     <lb/>been, by the Government—by the Crown, 
     <lb/>representatives of the men appointed to 
     <lb/>choose them, some of them not represen<lb break="no"/>tatives at all—shall be heard above the 
     <lb/>representatives of the people? They 
     <lb/>have undertaken to address Her Majesty, 
     <lb/>asking her not simply to give a favorable   
     <lb/>consideration to Confederation, but bold<lb break="no"/>ly asking her to lay a Bill before the 
     <lb/>Imperial Parliament to sweep away the 
     <lb/>independence of this Province. I regret 
     <lb/>it exceedingly on their own behalf, but 
     <lb/>beyond that I am delighted, as it shows 
     <lb/>their animus. It shows what they think 
     <lb/>of the people and the people's rights.

     These gentlemen may have acted from 
     <lb/>
     the best motives, but they had no right 
     <lb/>
     to act in that way, while the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of the people were debating the 
     <lb/>
     same subjects and in so doing they have 
     <lb/>
     insulted the Government. They should 
     <lb/>
     not have gone beyond passing a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion in favor of adopting the scheme and 
     <lb/>
     asking the concurrence of the House. 
     <lb/>
     That would have been going to the ex<lb break="no"/>treme limit of their power and authority, 
     <lb/>
     and I think the Imperial Government 
     <lb/>
     have too high a regard for constitutional 
     <lb/>
     principles to pay the slightest attention 
     <lb/>
      

            <cb/>
        

     to a document of that kind. They will 
     <lb/>regard it as an attempt of those men to<lb/>get possession of those ten seats in the <lb/>upper House at Ottawa. Should this<lb/>scheme come before us, we will speak on<lb/>behalf of the people and say, in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter the people of the Province are the<lb/>parties who have a right to speak and<lb/>determine concerning this matter.<lb/>

     the present time a political union of any

     <lb/>would be a benefit to the people of this<lb/>Province. I do not know of any one op<lb break="no"/>posed to union in the abstract, but my <lb/>impression is that the time has not ar<lb break="no"/>rived for any kind of union, and I will 
     <lb/>oppose it to the last. At present the 
     <lb/>Provinces are distinct communities with 
     <lb/>conflicting interests, and the Quebec<lb/>Scheme does not reconcile them, and the <lb/>difficulties can only be overcome by sacri<lb break="no"/>ficing the Lower Provinces altogether.<lb/>lf any new scheme comes up, it will be 
     <lb/>for the people to decide upon its merits, 
     <lb/>and I trust they will retain the power in
