     the Upper House of the General Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment. There is another question which<lb/>the crown officers should answer, and<lb/>that is whether those who are appointed<lb/>from the Legislative Council and this<lb/>House can retain their seats now the<lb/>proclamation is issued. This is a point<lb/>of great importance. and should be well<lb/>defined, so that we may know whether<lb/>they are still in a position to legislate for<lb/>this country. I am aware that I have no<lb/>physical power to make the Government<lb/>answer the questions I put, but the<lb/>country will now know why it is the in<lb break="no"/>formation is not given, and with whom<lb/>the responsibility rests.<lb/>

It is a subject for the<lb/>Crown lawyers, and when the proclama<lb break="no"/>tion is received it can be looked into and<lb/>decided.<lb/>

     others. who have begun with their small 
     <lb/>
     earnings. Those who seek to be incor<lb break="no"/>porated wish to establish co-operative 
     <lb/>
     stores and manufactories from the ac<lb break="no"/>cumulation of funds. The object is wor<lb break="no"/>thy of every consideration, and is calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to result in great good. By putting 
     <lb/>
     in their little earnings from time to time 
     <lb/>
     it becomes as it were a kind of Saving's 
     <lb/>
     Bank, and they obtain interest on what 
     <lb/>
     they put in, and get such goods as they 
     <lb/>
     require at a cheaper rate than elsewhere. 
     <lb/>
     The amount of their accumulations in 
     <lb/>
     this instance is limited to $80,000, and I 
     <lb/>
     see no reason why the Bill should not 
     <lb/>pass,<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>.— There was an ad<lb break="no"/>mirable article in Blackwood's Magazine<lb/>for January or February, in which the<lb/>whole matter of these trades' societies<lb/>was taken up and discussed in the most<lb/>able manner, show that the result<lb/>had been most beneficial to all who had<lb/>availed themselves of the privileges of<lb/>the societies. The beauty of these or<lb break="no"/>ganizations is that they are based upon<lb/>a cash principle, and enables the poor<lb/>man who puts in his small earnings to<lb/>feed, clothe and educate his family, and<lb/>place them in a position of comparative<lb/>comfort. The plan thus adopted pre<lb break="no"/>vents litigation, for there is no credit<lb/>given in the stores; the men are paid<lb/>their wages at the end of the week, and<lb/>they at once lay in a supply of goods for<lb/>the use of their families for the ensuing<lb/>week, and the surplus is invested in the<lb/>funds of the society. This conduces, in<lb/>a material degree, to the moral as well<lb/>as social well-being of this class of our<lb/>people who are thus enabled to save their<lb/>earnings, which might otherwise be<lb/>squandered or expended uselessly, and<lb/>raise themselves to positions of useful<lb break="no"/>ness. It is the spending of the small<lb/>surplus earnings that tend to drag a man<lb/>down to ruin, and this society steps in<lb/>and from the commencement infuses a<lb/>spirit of thrift and economy which raises<lb/>the working man eventual to a position<lb/>of standing and integrity. The stores<lb/>are supplied with goods of all kinds,<lb/>which, being bought in large quantities,<lb/>can be sold at prices below what has or<lb break="no"/>dinarily to be paid, for no commission for<lb/>profit is added to the cost, as must be<lb/>the case in other establishments. Under<lb/>such circumstances the Bill, I think,<lb/>must commend itself to the support of<lb/>this House.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I am not quite too san<lb break="no"/>guine of the great benefits to the working 
     <lb/>classes from the operations of these So<lb break="no"/>cieties, s the previous speakers, but 
     <lb/>still the tendency of the Bill is no doubt 
     <lb/>good, and I shall thererore support it. 
     <lb/>The position of the mechanic and work<lb break="no"/>ing man is very different in England from 
     <lb/>what it is here, and the successful work<lb break="no"/>ing of such Societies there is no proof 
     <lb/>that they would be equally successful 
     <lb/>here. Still I see no reason why they<lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        

     should not succeed, provided they are 
     <lb/>
     properly and carefully managed. There 
     <lb/>
     can he no doubt but the establishment of 
     <lb/>
     such Societies tends to thrift and econo<lb break="no"/>my among a class of people who are ex<lb break="no"/>cessively liable to fall into habits of im<lb break="no"/>providence and intemperance, and any 
     <lb/>
     movement which has this for its object is 
     <lb/>
     worthy of every encouragement.

     represent great rural constituencies, and 
     <lb/>
     it is a matter of congratulation that we

     can go to than: and say that although 
     <lb/>
     flour and provisions are so clear and 
     <lb/>
     business generally so dull. yet the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment are enabled to give $10,000 
     <lb/>
     mors for the Bye Roads than was given 
     <lb/>
     last year. There are also amounts ex<lb break="no"/>pended on the Bye Roads and Bridges 
     <lb/>
    I refer to the work performed under the 
     <lb/>Labor Act for grants of Crown Lands, 
     <lb/>which in itself would form a considerable 
     <lb/>item if considered as money expended. 
     <lb/>There are two things for which this coun<lb break="no"/>try should receive all praise, and that is 
     <lb/>that there is no Province of the British 
     <lb/>Empire that does as much, in proportion

     <lb/>
     something to do with the matter; for the

     present Government did not come into

     showing that we shall prosper under

     show the other day, it only proves how 
     <lb/>
     well we could get along if we were only 
     <lb/>
     left alone. With regard to our large ap<lb break="no"/>propriations for Bye Roads and Schools,<lb/>
    I think there are many countries that do 
     <lb/>as much, if not more, than we do for 
     <lb/>these objects.

     with my hon. friend from Westmorland 
     <lb/>
     that the people in some parts of the

     <lb/>
     be necessary to take part of the Bye 
     <lb/>
     Road appropriations to assist them, they 
     <lb/>
     making a return by performing labor on 
     <lb/>
     the roads. It is  therefore necessary the 
     <lb/>
      monies should be distributed as soon as 
     <lb/>
     possible, so that the people may get the 
     <lb/>
     money for their use.  The Secretary has
     <lb/>
     done all he could to meet the views ex<lb break="no"/>pressed by the hon. member for West<lb break="no"/>morland ; he has done all he could to 
     <lb/>
     meet the distress, arising from the high 
     <lb/>
     prices of flour and provisions, in certain 
     <lb/>
     parts of  the Province. Not only has 
     <lb/>
     the  grant for Bye Roads been increased 
     <lb/>
      $10,000 above last year, but $20,000  
     <lb/>
     more than last year are to be put upon

     If he  wants to know anything he should

     <lb/>
     hundred or three thousand dollars to 
     <lb/>
     wards a boat race that is to come  off in

      a large amount of money will have to be 
     <lb/>
     expended upon them. The poor people  
     <lb/>
     in some of the back settlements are al<lb break="no"/>most in a state of starvation,  arising from

     price  of provisions, and I should he very

      glad if  a larger sum could be granted for

     for Westmorland refers to labors per<lb break="no"/>formed by me, and hopes I shall be com<lb break="no"/>pensated by the Government. I am 
     <lb/>
     happy to say for all services rendered by 
     <lb/>
     me I have been pretty well satisfied al<lb break="no"/>ready. I have done  nothing for the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Government ; what l did was on 
     <lb/>behalf of the last, who were so weak that 
     <lb/>they could not get through their work. 
     <lb/>They had no Solicitor General,  for they 
     <lb/>were afraid to fill up the office, and the 
     <lb/>Attorney  General could not devote his  
     <lb/>time to the legal business, they therefore 
     <lb/>had to appoint Tom, Dick and Harry all 
     <lb/>over the country to do it for them, and so 
     <lb/>I happened to get some of the Crown 
     <lb/>business to do for them  among the rest, 
     <lb/>the present Government  paying the Bills. 
     <lb/>My hon. friend says I used to ask him 
     <lb/> questions, which is quite true, but the 
     <lb/>trouble was I could not  get a straightfor<lb break="no"/>ward  answer, although I kept it up for 
     <lb/>about forty days, and that is just the case 
     <lb/>now. I required information, and there<lb break="no"/>fore asked my hon. friend to whom we 
     <lb/>are  indebted for the increase of the reve<lb break="no"/>nues. He has not answered that ques<lb break="no"/>tion,  although it is a very simple one, and 
     <lb/>one he should answer in a straightfor<lb break="no"/>ward manner.

     Saint John will put himself under my 
     <lb/>
     direction I will show him, but unless he 
     <lb/>
     does this he certainly  has no  tight to 
     <lb/>
     question me. The late Government are 
     <lb/>
     not now on their trial, and yet the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from Saint John sees fit to make 
     <lb/>
     a vile attack upon it. The reason is 
     <lb/>
     clear enough ; he only desires to give  
     <lb/>
     vent to his   revengeful feelings. He is 
     <lb/>
      not satisfied that the late Government is 
     <lb/>
     down. They know that their opinions  
     <lb/>
     were not  endorsed by the people, and 
     <lb/>
     now they are willing to comply with 
     <lb/>
     their wishes and give the measures which 
     <lb/>
        

            <cb/>
      

     are  being introduced a fair trial, and yet  
     <lb/>
     without the slightest provocation the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member pours forth a torrent of abuse 
     <lb/>
     against them, and makes an outrageous 
     <lb/>
     personal attack on me. He says that the 
     <lb/>
     late Government were so weak that we 
     <lb/>
     could not appoint a Solicitor General,  
     <lb/>
     and that I was so indifferent to the 
     <lb/>
     duties of my office, that we had to give 
     <lb/>
     the Crown business into the hands of 
     <lb/>
     private legal gentlemen, and so we had 
     <lb/>
     to employ him. But if he was em<lb break="no"/>ployed he has been amply paid for his 
     <lb/>
     services, and therefore it little becomes 
     <lb/>
     him to speak as he has done. The hon. 
     <lb/>
     member and I have always been on the 
     <lb/>
     most friendly terms ; when he was em<lb break="no"/>ployed on Crown business he  was a 
     <lb/>
     supporter of the late Government, and 
     <lb/>
     it therefore seems most  strange that he 
     <lb/>
     should now impute weakness and in<lb break="no"/>difference to us. He knows very well 
     <lb/>
     why it was we did not appoint a Solici<lb break="no"/>tor  General, and he knows too that I 
     <lb/>
     was in England and could not attend 
     <lb/>
     to the duties of Attorney General here.   
     <lb/>
     He would have been quite  willing to 
     <lb/>
     have got the Solicitor or Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eralship, and would be willing, I dare 
     <lb/>
     say, to accept it now, but at present all 
     <lb/>
    the offices are filled up. I do not think 
     <lb/>it at all generous in him to attack in 
     <lb/>such a caustic   and severe way a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that has passed away. Why, 
     <lb/>they  are in a state of dead ducks, and 
     <lb/>surely the hon. member does not want 
     <lb/>to  shoot a dead duck ! Our Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was killed by the action of the 
     <lb/>Governor, who was urged on by the 
     <lb/>party now in power, some of whom 
     <lb/>were not on the floors of this House. 
     <lb/>The people  expressed their feelings 
     <lb/>against us ; they went for the men who 
     <lb/>were willing to carry them into a Union 
     <lb/>which we considered fatal to the best 
     <lb/>interests of the country, and we were 
     <lb/>forced to  comply. But as I said the 
     <lb/>other day I am willing even now to go  
     <lb/>back to the people and leave the ver<lb break="no"/>dict with them, feeling assurred that 
     <lb/>they would now endorse the policy and 
     <lb/>opinions of the late Government. As 
     <lb/>to the hon. member from Saint John,  
     <lb/>when I consider that for many years 
     <lb/>we have been on terms of personal 
     <lb/>friendship, and the position he occu<lb break="no"/>pied with regard to the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, I cannot but look upon his pre<lb break="no"/>sent attack upon me as ungenerous and

     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—I did not attack

     him ; I merely spoke of the reasons why 
     <lb/>
     my name appeared in the public accounts, 
     <lb/>
     to which my hon. friend had referred, and 
     <lb/>
     stated that there  being no Solicitor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral, and the Attorney  General not 
     <lb/>
      attending to the duty, the  legal business

     ernment, and so I, among others, was 
     <lb/>
     called in to do the work. This my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend construtes into a vile attack upon 
     <lb/>
     the late Government and a personal out<lb break="no"/>rage on him. Why, one would suppose 
     <lb/>
     that he was the heart, soul, body and 
     <lb/>
      bones of the late Government, a regular 
     <lb/>
     one  man Government, in fact. But this   
     <lb/>
     is how he  wanders off from the question  
     <lb/>
     which I put to him. He said that the 
     <lb/>
     Provincial Secretary had no right to arro<lb break="no"/>gate to himself or the present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment the praise for the present satisfactory<lb/>state of the revenues. Now, I did not<lb/>rise to defend the Secretary, for I think<lb/>he is quite able to take care of himself ;<lb/>but I simply asked for information—Who,<lb/>then, are entitled to the praise ? On this<lb/>my hon. friend gets up and makes a fierce<lb/>attack on me, but all that is no answer to<lb/>my question, and I again ask him, Who<lb/>are the men we should thank for a state<lb/>of affairs by which we are able to grant<lb/>so much larger sums for public purposes<lb/>than we were able to do last year ? My<lb/>hon. friend has insinuated that I changed<lb/>my position ; but, Mr. Chairman, it is<lb/>well known that it was not I who changed<lb/>but the late Government. My views<lb/>changed, it is true, but I was elected an<lb/>Anti-Confederate and I stood to the<lb/>principle throughout. My personal views<lb/>had changed, but so long as I represented<lb/>an Anti-Confederate constituency I was<lb/>bound to go against anything like Union.<lb/>Who, I would ask, were the first to<lb/>change ? Why the late Government<lb/>came down with a speech that was based<lb/>upon Union—they, who had been elected<lb/>in opposition to it were the first to put it<lb/>in the speech. I then opposed them, as I<lb/>was bound to do. I asked them over and<lb/>over again what they meant by the refer<lb break="no"/>ence to Union, but could get no satisfac<lb break="no"/>tory answer. Here was reason enough<lb/>why I should oppose them, but when they<lb/>allowed the Governor to dictate to them<lb/>what course of action they should pur<lb break="no"/>sue, the reasons strengthened and multi<lb break="no"/>plied, and I did my best to deprive them<lb/>of the power they held. When I was<lb/>first elected I did think that Union would<lb/>be adverse to the best interests of this<lb/>people ; I had little time to examine into<lb/>the subject, and the ruin and danger to<lb/>which we should be subject were continu<lb break="no"/>ally dinned into my ears, till I came to<lb/>believe it. I did not, however, desire to<lb/>become a politician. It was pressed upon<lb/>me most urgently to allow myself to be<lb/>put in nomination. Thus I was forced<lb/>into the position, and having entered I<lb/>would not draw back. I never hesitated<lb/>to express my opinions as adverse to<lb/>Union ; but after a time as I had oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity to examine the subject, I saw that I<lb/>was in error, and that the consolidation of<lb/>these Provinces would prove to be an<lb/>immense benefit. When I was an Anti<lb break="no"/>
           

            <cb/>
         

Confederate I supported the measures of<lb/>the Government on that principle. My<lb/>hon. friend says that I was willing to take<lb/>office ; he knows that I could have been<lb/>in the Government, and with an office,<lb/>too, if I had chosen—but that is apart<lb/>from the question. As long as the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment stood to the principles, I was<lb/>bound to support them, and when my own<lb/>views changed, if they had wished to have<lb/>brought in a measure of Union, I should<lb/>have gone back to the people of Saint<lb/>John and told them my views on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject had changed ; but I think my position<lb/>was right, that I could not support a<lb/>measure of Union while I was an Anti-<lb break="yes"/>Confederate representative. When I went<lb/>before the people of Saint John at the<lb/>first they thought with me that Union was<lb/>bad, but when I went back to them and<lb/>told them my views had changed I found<lb/>that their's had too ; they believed in the<lb/>sincerity of my convictions, and placed<lb/>confidence enough in me to return me to<lb/>this House. My hon. friend hints that I<lb/>was afraid to accept the office of Solicitor<lb/>General because I should have to run my<lb/>election over again. But I will ask him<lb/>if he is aware that the fear lay not with me,<lb/>but with the Government ? The office<lb/>was needed, but they were afraid to fill it<lb/>up. The office is still wanted, for it is<lb/>impossible for the Attorney General to<lb/>attend to all the duties that would other<lb break="no"/>wise be required of him. Now, I sup<lb break="no"/>pose my hon. friend will think that I want<lb/>the office of Solicitor General, because I<lb/>have referred to it, or that I may have<lb/>some desire to become Attorney General,<lb/>but I will tell him that I think I am quite<lb/>as capable as many others to fill either<lb/>office. And I will tell him more, that if<lb/>the Attorney General gives up his office,<lb/>and a good Government think it right and<lb/>proper to offer me the situation, I should<lb/>be willing to accept it, and run my elec<lb break="no"/>tion over, against the best man the late<lb/>Government can bring in Saint John, and<lb/>beat him, too, by a majority of 500, and<lb/>my hon. friend can just put that down on<lb/>his memorandum. I very much regret<lb/>that my hon. friend gets so annoyed at<lb/>the simple question I put, and I really<lb/>hope that his not answering will not have<lb/>a tendency to mar that close friendship<lb/>which he has felt for me for so long a time.<lb/>

     against him by the hon. member from   St. 
     <lb/>
     John (Mr. Wetmore), and I should now 
     <lb/>
     like to ask the Secretary what his opinion 
     <lb/>
     is of sudden  conversions? When the 
     <lb/>
     second  Session  arrived, however, the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member came here disaffected, and I 
     <lb/>
      might say why.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr.  WETMORE</persName>.—Well, do. Don't 
     <lb/>
     spare me at all ; let  us know why it was 
     <lb/>
     I became disaffected.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I remember his conver<lb break="no"/>sion to the idea of Union was very sudden<lb/>indeed, and followed immediately after he<lb/>had strongly urged upon the Government<lb/>his desire to become Solicitor General.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
      <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—I did not ask for 
     <lb/>
     the  appointment, but said that I believed 
     <lb/>
     I was as  capable of filling it as any one. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.— If the hon. member did 
     <lb/>
     not put himself boldly forward, still in 
     <lb/>
     his mild way he let us know that he want<lb break="no"/>ed it. He came out  afterward and as<lb break="no"/>sailed me with preventing his being 
     <lb/>
     appointed, and he knows that when what 
     <lb/>
    had transpired in the Government could  
     <lb/>be disclosed it was found that I  was the 
     <lb/>only one who favored his being appointed. 
     <lb/>The other members of the Government, 
     <lb/>and his  colleagues from Saint John 
     <lb/>among them, were afraid to open the 
     <lb/>constituency, and that was  why he was 
     <lb/>not provided for. He now says  that he 
     <lb/>would be willing to take the office of 
     <lb/>Attorney General if it was offered to him, 
     <lb/>and I have no doubt he would. He has 
     <lb/>only been in this House about two years, 
     <lb/>and yet has shown his desire twice to 
     <lb/>take office. I have shown no such greed 
     <lb/>for office as some have done. I have 
     <lb/>been here about sixteen years, and have 
     <lb/>held office but two years in all that time. 
     <lb/>Why the Attorney General has  expressed 
     <lb/>his willingness to hold on to his seat in 
     <lb/>this House and go to Ottawa, too, in the 
     <lb/> interests of the people of his County. I 
     <lb/> don't think my friend from Saint John 
     <lb/>cares about going to Ottawa ; he would 
     <lb/>rather stay here and be Attorney General.  
     <lb/>He says he can  run his election and beat 
     <lb/>any one we can put  forward, and wants 
     <lb/>me to write down to my friends that he 
     <lb/>challenges them  to bring out their man. 
     <lb/>I certainly don't know why I should take 
     <lb/>so much trouble for him, but I have seen  
     <lb/>so much of political life that I know  how 
     <lb/>to estimate such confidence, for l have 
     <lb/>heard many declare that they could run, 
     <lb/>who, when they tried it, found they could 
     <lb/>not. Why, the Secretary thought he 
     <lb/>could run on the  Quebec Scheme— 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName>.—I did run—<lb/>(laughter).<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>—Yes, he did run, but the 
     <lb/>trouble for him was that he ran out in<lb break="no"/>stead of in—(laughter). Now here is the<lb/>difference between the Secretary and I :<lb/>that whereas I have been in the House<lb/>longer than he has, I have only held office<lb/>two years, he has held office every year<lb/>

but one since he was elected and has<lb/>received a salary of Ł600 a year. The<lb/>hon. member for Saint John (Mr. Wet<lb break="no"/>ore) thinks he could run his election<lb/>again if he got the Attorney Generalship,<lb/>but he might be disappointed—indeed, he<lb/>may not get the chance as soon as he<lb/>would like, but for the Attorney General,<lb/>finding that the dual representation idea<lb/>won't work, will probably continue to hold<lb/>on and not go to Ottawa at all, at least<lb/>not for some time to come. Then, again,<lb/>even if he does decide to lay aside his<lb/>office, I doubt very much whether the<lb/>Solicitor General would yield his rights in<lb/>favor of the member from Saint John.<lb/>But I shall not protract this discussion,<lb/>I have already given an explanation of<lb/>the action taken by the late Government,<lb/>which has gone to the country, and there<lb/>is no need to go into it all again, especi<lb break="no"/>ally as it is entirely outside of the ques<lb break="no"/>tion now before us.<lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I think, Mr. Speaker, 
     <lb/>
     the Petitions introduced by the hon. 
     <lb/>
     member from Saint John are informal, 
     <lb/>
      inasmuch as they do not show on the 
     <lb/>
     back the place of residence of the peti<lb break="no"/>tioners. This is a rule which has always 
     <lb/>
     been complied with and should not be 
     <lb/>
     dispensed with in this case. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—I do not see how the 
     <lb/>
     want of residence being endorsed on the 
     <lb/>
     Petition can affect its coming before this 
     <lb/>
     House. A person has a right to petition 
     <lb/>
     wherever he resides, but if there is a 
     <lb/>
     rule I am quite willing to withdraw them 
     <lb/>
     and insert the residence of the parties. 
     <lb/>
     If, however. there is no rule the Petitions 
     <lb/>
     are certainly in order. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>—There is no direct 
     <lb/>
     rule that the residence should be endors<lb break="no"/>ed, yet it has been practised, as a petition 
     <lb/>
     unendorsed as to residence cannot have 
     <lb/>
     that weight with the House which it 
     <lb/>
    would otherwise have. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName>.—Ever since I have been 
     <lb/>
     here, it has become rule to endorse the 
     <lb/>
     residence upon the Petition, and it is so 
     <lb/>
     entered upon the Journals. It is evident 
     <lb/>
     that such a practice is necessary in or<lb break="no"/>der that we may know that the petition<lb break="no"/>ers are inhabitants of the Province, other<lb break="no"/>

wise we might receive a petition from<lb/>certain persons in Honolulu praying for<lb/>a repeal of our Election Law.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—Even though the<lb/>parties may not be residents of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, I conceive they have a perfect<lb/>right to petition this House. Hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers say there is a rule which requires<lb/>the residence to appear on the petition,<lb/>Mr. Speaker says there is no rule, so the<lb/>petitions are in perfect order.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BOTS1">Mr. BOTSFORD</persName>.—The hon. member<lb/>must know that parliamentary law re<lb break="no"/>quires that the residence should follow<lb/>the name. This is laid down in May,<lb/>and has always been practiced.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FISH1">Hon. Mr. FISHER</persName>.—I take exception<lb/>to the idea that custom makes law, or<lb/>that the parliamentary rules of the House<lb/>of Commons are necessarily to be ap<lb break="no"/>plied to the representatives of a small<lb/>country like this. It may be considered<lb/>that the insertion of the residence tends<lb/>to give weight to the petiton, but if it is<lb/>omitted the burden of that omission must<lb/>rest, not with the House, but with the<lb/>petitioners. There certainly is no rule<lb/>to exclude a petition so presented.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—The practice of the House<lb/>has always been to have the residence<lb/>endorsed on the petition, and you, Mr.<lb/>Speaker, have frequently corrected hon.<lb/>members who have introduced petitions<lb/>without the residence, and handed them<lb/>back to be amended. It is certainly im<lb break="no"/>portant to know where petitioners live,<lb/>so that they may be found if necessary.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SUTT1">Mr. SUTTON</persName>.—If the petition does<lb/>not show where the people belong, we<lb/>have no opportunity of finding out, and<lb/>in justice to hon. members of this House<lb/>I think the information should be given.<lb/>If it is not done I shall certainly take ob<lb break="no"/>jection to the admission of these petitions<lb/>on that ground.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:FLEW2">Mr. W. P. FLEWELLING</persName>.—Although<lb/>I know from some of the names—<lb/>names of very respectable persons—<lb/>where one of the Petitions come from,<lb/>yet other hon. members may not be so<lb/>informed, and I think courtesy demands<lb/>that the residence should be endorsed<lb/>upon them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—The objection<lb/>raised then, is on the rule. Now, I<lb/>say, show me that rule, and I will at<lb/>once withdraw the Petitions and en<lb break="no"/>dorse the residence. I will be the last<lb/>to infringe or break a rule of this<lb/>House, but to my mind there is nothing<lb/>to prevent a Petition coming before<lb/>this House without such an endorsation.<lb/>I have no objection, as I have said, to<lb/>amend them if it is required by the<lb/>rule, but I do not want to be driven to<lb/>it just because my hon. friend from<lb/>Westmorland chooses to pick upon the<lb/>Petitions I introduce to raise an objec<lb break="no"/>tion. It does seem somewhat strange<lb/>that he should have selected these, and<lb/>his hon. colleague (Mr. Botsford) should<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
          

have been all ready with May on Parlia<lb break="no"/>ments with his finger open on the place,<lb/>but I am not to be so driven from my<lb/>position, which is that there is no rule<lb/>making it imperative that the residence<lb/>should be endorsed upon a Petition.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:RYAN1">Mr. RYAN</persName>. —There are certain cases<lb/>in which it would be impossible to put<lb/>the residence upon the back of a Peti<lb break="no"/>tion. Suppose some of the petitioners<lb/>belong to every county of the Province,<lb/>how can the residence be designated ;<lb/>and if one county is named, then there<lb/>would be a fallacy on the very face of<lb/>the Petition. I don't think it is at all<lb/>necessary to say where the parties re<lb break="no"/>side, the fact of the Petition being in<lb break="no"/>troduced by a member of this House is<lb/>certainly sufficient indication of the dis<lb break="no"/>trict from whence they come.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">Hon. Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—What is all<lb/>the trouble Mr. Speaker ? What is the<lb/>question at issue ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SPEA1">Mr. SPEAKER</persName>.—The hon. member<lb/>from Saint John (Mr. Wetmore) has<lb/>introduced two Petitions, but there is<lb/>nothing on the back to show where the<lb/>petitioners reside. This is objected to<lb/>by the hon. members from Westmor<lb break="no"/>land and Northumberland, on the<lb/>ground that although there is no speci<lb break="no"/>fic rule laid down in the matter, yet<lb/>that the unvarying practice of the House<lb/>has been that Petitions should be so en<lb break="no"/>dorsed, and this, in a manner, has es<lb break="no"/>tablished a rule by which all Petitions<lb/>should be regulated. This, I think, is<lb/>exactly how the question stands at<lb/>present.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">Hon. Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—Well, Mr.<lb/>Speaker, perhaps I can assist in settling<lb/>the matter. I hold in my hand a num<lb break="no"/>ber of Petitions which have been re<lb break="no"/>ceived during the past few days. Here<lb/>is one praying for a change in the man<lb break="no"/>ner of measuring cord wood ; another<lb/>praying for a change in the law relating<lb/>to duties at the Port of Saint Stephen ;<lb/>another praying for the incorporation<lb/>of the Saint John Trades Co-operative<lb/>Society. There is nothing on either of<lb/>these to show where the petitioners re<lb break="no"/>side, or indeed that they are inhabitants<lb/>of this country. This is quite sufficient<lb/>to show what is constantly being done<lb/>and that there is no fixed rule or prac<lb break="no"/>tice in the matter at all, for if there had<lb/>been, neither the hon. members nor<lb/>you, Mr. Speaker, would have allowed<lb/>these petitions to lie on the table.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I am willing to leave<lb/>it to the Clerk to say what has been<lb/>the practice ; he has been in the House<lb/>longer than any of us, and therefore<lb/>can speak impartially in the matter.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—I don't see, Mr.<lb/>Speaker, why my hon friend should<lb/>want to apply to the Clerk. I have<lb/>heard him vaunt himself that for sixteen<lb/>
       

            <cb/>
        

years he had filled his place in this<lb/>House, and had only been absent two<lb/>days, and it is something strange that<lb/>the Petitions which have just been re<lb break="no"/>ferred to by the Surveyor General,<lb/>should have slipped through without<lb/>being challenged by my hon. friend, as<lb/>he is so well posted in the rules of the<lb/>House. It is something strane, too,<lb/>that the objection should be raised on<lb/>these Petitions instead of upon others.<lb/>Does my hon. friend intend to oppose<lb/>the Bill, and refuse the prayer of the<lb/>petitioners ? If so, let him come out<lb/>like a man and tell them so openly and<lb/>fairly. It does seem more extraordin<lb break="no"/>ary that whenever I stand up to speak,<lb/>my hon. friend should imagine that I<lb/>have reference to him, and that what I<lb/>say is intended as an attack upon him.<lb/>He has such an exalted idea of his own<lb/>importance, and of what is due to him<lb/>for his vast legislative attainments, that<lb/>he seems to imagine there is no one<lb/>else to whom anything may apply but<lb/>to him. Well, if the cap happens to fit<lb/>let him wear it ; but I most strongly<lb/>object to his constructing every word I<lb/>speak as an attack upon him or intend<lb break="no"/>ed for him alone. I think I have as<lb/>much right to express my opinions in<lb/>my own humble way as my hon. friend,<lb/>and I refuse to bow to his decision in<lb/>every case, for he has very frequently<lb/>been found to have arrived at wrong<lb/>conclusions. This morning he singled<lb/>me out because I asked a simple ques<lb break="no"/>tion, upon which I wished information,<lb/>and now again he takes exception to<lb/>my actions, although it is quite clear<lb/>that I have a perfect right to introduce<lb/>such Petitions, and in form as I have<lb/>done. I dare say now he will think<lb/>that I am attacking him again by mak<lb break="no"/>ing the few remarks I have.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. SMITH</persName>.—The fact is that the<lb/>hon. member is so used to making at<lb break="no"/>tacks that he does not seem to know<lb/>when he does it. He is constantly<lb/>making attacks on me, and I submit it<lb/>to the House, whether the sarcastic re<lb break="no"/>marks which he has just made can be<lb/>construed to mean anything else. He<lb/>did the same thing this morning, and I<lb/>leave it to hon. members whether he<lb/>was not in that instance, as in this, the<lb/>aggressor. And am I to sit still and<lb/>make no reply ? Am I to allow his vio<lb break="no"/>lent assaults upon me to go to the<lb/>country and make no comment upon<lb/>them ? I say that his remaks are most<lb/>unwarrantable and ungenerous. This<lb/>morning two or three hours of the va<lb break="no"/>luable time of this House were occu<lb break="no"/>pied in a discussion which arose from<lb/>the manner in which he assailed me and<lb/>the late Government, and he seems de<lb break="no"/>termined that two or three more should<lb/>be occupied in like manner this after<lb break="no"/>

<fw type="num">72</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1807.</fw> 



     noon. The hon. member has only been 
     <lb/>a day or two in the House since it<lb/>
     
    opened ; he has only now just returned 
     <lb/>after an absence of a week and from 
     <lb/>the anxiety he displays in getting up 
     <lb/>discussions, and the style in which he 
     <lb/>conducts them, I think the country 
     <lb/>would not have suffered if he had not 
     <lb/>come here at all. We were getting 
     <lb/>along with the business very well with<lb break="no"/>out him. Hon. members have express<lb break="no"/>ed their desire to get through as fast as 
     <lb/>possible, but the hon. member appears 
     <lb/>to be desirous to delay the business by 
     <lb/>making unprovoked and uncalled for 
     <lb/>attacks upon me. He has travelled out 
     <lb/>of the record, and now l again say that 
     <lb/>although there is no written rule, yet 
     <lb/>the practice has been, and it is endorsed 
     <lb/>by the Clerk, that whenever a Petition 
     <lb/>is not properly endorsed with the resi<lb break="no"/>dence of the petitioners, the attention 
     <lb/>of hon, members is called to the fact by 
     <lb/>the Speaker. The Petitions referred to 
     <lb/>by the Surveyor General are excep<lb break="no"/>tions, which it appears not only passed 
     <lb/>the notice of hon. members but also of 
     <lb/>the Speaker.  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>—It is just as I ex<lb break="no"/>pected. My hon. friend has again 
     <lb/>
     attacked me, because he says, although I 
     <lb/>
     repudiated the idea, that I attacked him. 
     <lb/>
     He has referred to this morning's discus<lb break="no"/>sion, and although I do not wish to take 
     <lb/>
     up the time unnecessarily, yet it seems 
     <lb/>
     important I should defend myself in my 
     <lb/>
     humble way. The ideas held by my hon. 
     <lb/>
     friend and the remarks he makes shows 
     <lb/>him to be a bundle of inconsistencies. 
     <lb/>This morning he said the Secretary 
     <lb/>should not take the praise of the increase 
     <lb/>in the revenues ; I then asked him to 
     <lb/>whom the increase was due, and who we 
     <lb/>should thank for it ? That he said was 
     <lb/> making a vile attack upon him. He then 
     <lb/>proceeded to charge me with inconsis<lb break="no"/>tency and sudden conversion ; but that 
     <lb/>in his opinion, was not an attack upon 
     <lb/>me. Now he says I am a sarcastic man, 
     <lb/>which certainly is neither a very nice nor 
     <lb/>agreeable name to be called ; but then 
     <lb/>he does not regard that as an attack. I 
     <lb/>said this morning that the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, though pledged against Union, put 
     <lb/>it in their speech, and so I was forced to 
     <lb/>oppose them ; but that he looked upon 
     <lb/>as an outrageous attack upon him. You 
     <lb/>see that whatever he says must not be 
     <lb/>considered as assailling any one, no mat<lb break="no"/>ter how personal his remarks may be ; but 
     <lb/>if I attempt to speak, then what I say is 
     <lb/>regarded as a torrent of abuse upon my 
     <lb/>hon. friend. Now that's just how he looks 
     <lb/>at the matter. He says we occupied two 
     <lb/>or three hours in discussion this morning, 
     <lb/>but as it was after 12 o'clock when we 
     <lb/>went into Committee and we separated at 
     <lb/>1 o'clock, that statement appears to be a 
     <lb/>little exaggeration. The time that was 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     occupied arose entirely from his refusal
<lb/>to answer my question as to who should
<lb/>be thanked, and I think I stated, and if I<lb/>did not I will now state that I do not<lb/>think we have to thank the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment for anything but for getting the
<lb/>country into a state of turmoil and con<lb break="no"/>fusion, My hon. friend has said that I<lb/>wanted to be Attorney General. Well,
<lb/>suppose I did ; is that anything to bring
<lb/>against me ? I think that my hon. friend
<lb/>who says that he is so regardless of office<lb/>wanted and got that office more than
<lb/>once. If I remember rightly, when the
<lb/>present Attorney General was (to use an<lb/>expression which has been used before)
<lb/>bowled out of the Govsrnment, my hon.
<lb/>friend jumped into his shoes before they
<lb/>were scarcely cool ; and when the present
<lb/>Judge Allen was appointed to the Bench,<lb/>although my hon. friend had publicly
<lb/>stated that he would not accept office,<lb/>unless a special emergency arose and the
<lb/>interests of the country demanded it, yet
<lb/>he jumped right into it. Now I never
<lb/>said I wouldn't accept an office, for I tell
<lb/>him that if I got the offer I should accept
<lb/>it, and consider myself just as competent<lb/>to fill it as my hon. friend.<lb/>
