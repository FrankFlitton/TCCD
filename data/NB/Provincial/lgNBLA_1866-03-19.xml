     ernment are going to adopt, then good           
     <lb/>
     bye to Responsible Government. Ano her             
     <lb/>
     cry got up by the Attorney General was            
     <lb/>
     that the press was against them. The                
     <lb/>
     press was exposing their incapacity, and          
     <lb/>
     they do not desire to hear these things.               
     <lb/>
    lt is the duty of the press to deal with           
     <lb/>Governments. It really appears an in<lb break="no"/>jury to the country to denounce a press        
     <lb/>because it speaks out boldly and manly,         
     <lb/>and condemns the acts of a Government.         
     <lb/> He says no injustice has been done to           
     <lb/>York. I think an injustice has been done       
     <lb/>to York, and to other sections of the            
     <lb/>country too. Did not they attempt to do<lb/>injustice to the principles of Responsible<lb/>and Departmental Government, by doing<lb/>away with one of the most important<lb/>offices,  that of Postmaster General ?<lb/>Notwithstanding the additional labour to <lb/>be performed ; the labour is done more<lb/>economically now than it was before the<lb/>office became responsible.  He did<lb/>not think it right for the hon  member for<lb/>York to state at the hustings that this was<lb/>the first step towards the removal of the <lb/>seat of Government. I stated that last <lb/>year. I believed it then and I believe it <lb/>now, that it is not the only first step towards<lb/>the removal of the seat of Government, <lb/>but to do away with departmental govern<lb break="no"/>ment altogether. The present Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would then rule the country with <lb/>tyranny and despotism, holding their po<lb break="no"/>sition without any responsibility at all.<lb/>Look at their whole career-\-at their mea<lb break="no"/>sures of last year-\-the measures fore<lb break="no"/>shadowed in the speech-\-their course in<lb/>reference to Union principles-\-their ne<lb break="no"/>glect in allowing the law to expire for<lb/>collecting export duty, and ask yourselves<lb/>are you prepared to sustain this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. I believe the day will come when <lb/>the country will not sustain those men<lb/>who support them.  Then in reference to<lb/>?????  , I do not think there is much <lb/>danger. The leaders keep the excitement<lb/>up for the purpose of getting money.<lb/>True, I am in the Northern part of the <lb/>Province, where there is no great dan<lb break="no"/>ger.  But I ask the Attorney General if<lb/>he was sincere when he appealed to the<lb/>house in a tremulous voice, and said<lb/>this was no time to discuss a motion of <lb/>Want of Confidence, when the country<lb/>was in danger of a conspiracy on our<lb/>borders.  If he was, has he been sin<lb break="no"/>cere lately in ridiculing the whole move<lb break="no"/>ment? If he was sincere in the one<lb/>case he must have been insincere in the <lb/>other. Viewing the whole policy of the <lb/>Gvoernment I have no hesitation in say<lb break="no"/>ing, they have not my confidence, nor<lb/>the confidence of the people.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    The debate was then adjourned until <lb/>to-morrow at 11 o'clock.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName> presented the fol<lb break="no"/>lowing resolution :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>"Resolved unanimously, that an <lb/>humble address be presented to His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency the Lieutenant Governor, re<lb break="no"/>spectfully assuring His Excellency that<lb/>this House, representing the whole peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the Province, will provide for all<lb/>precautionary measures, that the Exe<lb break="no"/>cutive Governmern may deem necessary<lb/>in the present emergency for the de<lb break="no"/>fence of the country."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. FISHER hoped the House would<lb/>be unanimous, as it would meet a un<lb break="no"/>animous response from the whole peo<lb break="no"/>ple. They must ...... the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to use economy ; but money is no<lb/>object when the country was in danger, <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>and as far as their means went they<lb/>must give effect to that resolution.<lb/>Mr. WILMOT also expressed him<lb break="no"/>self in favor of the resolution, which was<lb/>carried unanimously.<lb/>  The House then adjourned until 10<lb/>A.

            <p>                    SATURDAY, March 17. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>House went into Committee of the <lb/>Whole, on a Bill to alter the place of <lb/>holding elections in the Parish of Hamp<lb break="no"/>ton, in the County of Kings, passed<lb/>without discussion or amendment. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. CUDLIP</persName> introduced a Bill to<lb/>incorporate the Inter-Colonial Railway<lb/>Company.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On the motion of Mr. NEEDHAM-\-se-<lb break="maybe"/>conded by Mr. Sutton-\-the debate on<lb/>the Amendment to the Address was<lb/>adjourned over until Monday at twelve.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. DesBRISAY rose and made an<lb/>explanation, regarding a statement<lb/>made in the Globe newspaper, in its<lb/>report of his speech on Thursday, where<lb/>he was made to say, that he had been<lb/>snubbed by petty Railway officials. He<lb/>had never made such remark. When<lb/>travelling on the Railway he had always<lb/>received every civility from the Railway<lb/>officials, and he did not wish such a <lb/>statement to go abroad uncontraindicated.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. FRASER asked the Provincial<lb/>Secretary if he had been furnished by<lb/>the Canadian Government with copies<lb/>of Mr. Fleming's Report on the Inter-<lb break="yes"/>Colonial Railway routes.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>PROVINCIAL SECRETARY had not<lb/>received any copies of that Report.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. FRASER, the House<lb/>went into Committee of the Whole (Mr.<lb/>Beveridge in the Chair) to incorporate<lb/>the Provincial Oil Company.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Fraser explained, that the object<lb/>of the Bill was to enable a company to<lb/>carry on the manufacture of Oil in the<lb/>Province ; there was no particular loca<lb break="no"/>lity mentioned.  The Bill was almost a<lb/>verbatim copy of the Bill incorporating<lb/>the Caledonia Oil Company ; it went a <lb/>little further and authorised the com<lb break="no"/>pany to deal in monies.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. McCLELAN did not see why <lb/>the company should not form under the <lb/>general act.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. FRASER. The gentleman who<lb/>proposed forming the company preferred <lb/>to have a special act<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. WETMORE could not see why a <lb/>special act should take place merely<lb/>because some gentlemen preferred it.<lb/>All they would have to do to form under<lb/>the general act would be to go into the<lb/>Provincial Secretary's office, fyle cer<lb break="no"/>tain papers, and pay the fees. By allow<lb break="no"/>ing them to take out a special act they<lb/>would escape paying the fees<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. McCLELAN said, that the fee<lb/>was $40 for coming under the general<lb/>act ; but, of course, it could not be the<lb/>object of the company, that preferred<lb/>doing business on the scale they did, to<lb/>escape the fees. He would move that <lb/>progress be reported, an the Bill re<lb break="no"/>ferred to a Committee.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>ATTORNEY GENERAL did not see<lb/>that any harm could be ????????<lb/>the company a special ????? was<lb/>inclined to support the Bill. He was<lb/>disposed to give every ??????<lb/>???? in to ??????  <lb/>the Province, but he would suggest that<lb/>the Bill be referred to a Committee.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. FRASER said, that the gentlemen<lb/>proposing to form the company, were<lb/>wealthy business men of Boston ; it was<lb/>not a bogus company, and they intentded<lb/>to bring in a great deal of money into<lb/>the Province.  He thought the bringing<lb/>in of foreign capital ought to be encou<lb break="no"/>raged. These gentlemen did not ask a <lb/>special act, because they would escape<lb/>paying some small fess.  But if they<lb/>came in under the general act, they<lb/>would not purchase lands or hold mines.<lb/>Finally, progress was reported, and the<lb/>Bill was referred to a Committee.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Mr. FISHER moved<lb/>that the Address of the House, in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with the resolution passed on Fri<lb break="no"/>day :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>"That an Humble Address be pre<lb break="no"/>sented to His Excellency the Lieutenant<lb/>Governor, respectfully assuring His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency that the House, representing <lb/>the whole people of the Province, will<lb/>provide for all precautionary measures<lb/>that the Executive Council may deem to <lb/>be necessary in the present emergency<lb/>for the defence of the Province, be pre<lb break="no"/>sented by the Speaker and the whole<lb/>House."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The members in the House accord<lb break="no"/>ingly proceeded to Government house ;<lb/>and, having returned, the Speaker read<lb/>the Reply of His Excellency :-<lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN:-\-<lb break="maybe"/>"I thank the House of Assembly for<lb/>the fresh proof they have afforded that<lb/>the ancient spirit of loyalty which ani<lb break="no"/>mated the first founders of the Province<lb/>has neither diminished nor decayed.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"I deeply regret that machinations<lb/>of evil-disposed men should render ne<lb break="no"/>cessary a considerable expenditure for<lb/>defensive purposes ; but your liberality<lb/>will have been wisely bestowed, should<lb/>it show to the plotters who dream of a <lb/>descent upon our borders, how little<lb/>they can hope for success in such an <lb/>enterprise.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"The most rigid economy shall be<lb/>exercised in the expenditure of the re<lb break="no"/>sources you have places at my disposal.<lb/>

            <p>"Confiding in the protection of Al<lb break="no"/>mighty God, and assured of the support<lb/>of a gallant and united people, I await<lb/>the future without anxious care."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. NEEDHAM moved the adjourn<lb break="no"/>ment of the House, in honor of St.<lb/>Patrick's Day, which, being carried, the<lb/>day at 10 o'clock.<lb/>                                          A. A, <lb/>

     not do this ; but he would like to make 
     <lb/>
     some remarks during the course of the 
     <lb/>
     debate.  
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
         Mr. OTTY. I was absent from the 
     <lb/>
      House, during part of the  time my 
     <lb/>
     hon. friend (Mr. McMillan) was speak<lb break="no"/>ing, consequently l cannot take up all 
     <lb/>
     his  arguments. I have a want of con<lb break="no"/>fidence, not in the Government, but in 
     <lb/>
     the hon. mover  of the Amendment, 
     <lb/>
     from the peculiar language in which it 
     <lb/>
     is worded. He goes on to state, after 
     <lb/>
     the Amendment  which we have before 
     <lb/>
    us, "  we regret that that no sufficient assu<lb break="no"/>rance has been   given, that the people 
     <lb/>will not be found unprepared to defend 
     <lb/>their families, their homes, and their 
     <lb/>  firesides, against lawless conspirators
     <lb/>from    the neighbouring Republic."  That 
     <lb/>part  was before the public, but he has 
     <lb/>withdrawn it. I can make allowance 
     <lb/>for any gentleman in the excitement of 
     <lb/> speech making errors of this kind, but 
     <lb/>for a man to sit down and write an 
     <lb/>Amendment like that,  shows a great  
     <lb/>want of ability in  language, to say the 
     <lb/>least of it. He has abandoned the most 
     <lb/>important part of it which relates to 
     <lb/>defending our homes, and moved merely 
     <lb/>what relates to " want of confidence in 
     <lb/>the Government," thereby  showing that 
     <lb/>he  considers office the  most important 
     <lb/>part.   The hon.  member for Resti<lb break="no"/>gouche said, the Government was bound 
     <lb/>by the  Address to bring forward some  
     <lb/> scheme for a Union of the Provinces. 
     <lb/> I cannot  see how they are bound either 
     <lb/>by the  Address or Speech from the 
     <lb/>Throne, to do so. It  is putting a con<lb break="no"/>struction upon them which they will not 
     <lb/>bear. He alluded to the " Minute of 
     <lb/> Council" which  says, "a large majority 
     <lb/>of the people of this Province are op<lb break="no"/>posed to any closer political union, &amp;c." 
     <lb/>There is nothing in the Address which   
     <lb/>is contrary to that " Minute of Council." 
     <lb/>The Crown in its  Address to the people 
     <lb/> says, that  despatches received from the 
     <lb/>Home Government will he laid before 
     <lb/>us. The people  say, in answer, that 
     <lb/>they will   consider those despatches, and 
     <lb/>the opinion  expressed by Her Majesty's  
     <lb/>Government will command that respect  
     <lb/>and attention which is due to sugges<lb break="no"/>tions emanating from so high a source. 
     <lb/>That is all the Government promise, and 
     <lb/> they are not bound  to bring in any scheme  
     <lb/> whatever. The Hon.  Attorney General 
     <lb/>said it was not his intention to  bring for<lb break="no"/>ward any scheme for a union of the 
     <lb/>Provinces, and in  so doing he is acting in 
     <lb/>accordance with the wishes of  the people. 
     <lb/>They speak of a  change of  feeling in re<lb break="no"/>gard to this   Quebec Scheme. ln the 
     <lb/>County of Kings there is very litttle 
     <lb/> change from what it was at the  last elec<lb break="no"/>tion.  If the scheme   was brought before 
     <lb/>the public to-morrow, the majority oppos<lb break="no"/>ed to the scheme would be actually larger  
     <lb/>than at the last election. But that does 
     <lb/>not appear to be the point at present.   
     <lb/>Confederation is left out of the party 
     <lb/>nearly altogether. If I understood the 
     <lb/> Speech of the hon. mover of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment, he stands  pledged not to support 
     <lb/> the Quebec Scheme. No  wonder, then, 
     <lb/>that he secured his election from both 
     <lb/> parties.  The people of York  would not 
     <lb/>return a Confederate, for if Confederation 
     <lb/>  was carried, the public  business of Fred<lb break="no"/>ericton would become a nonentity. To     
     <lb/>say, then, that the Confederates have ob<lb break="no"/>tained a victory, is to put forth a false      
     <lb/>statement to the public. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Restigouche makes use of the<lb/>trite  saying, " Union is strength."   It 
     <lb/>
   

            <cb/>
         
may be in come cases, but not in all.<lb/>The abstract idea is very well, but even<lb/>then the union of oil and water will not<lb/>make strength. It will make strength<lb/>where the wolf enters into compact with<lb/>a lamb. The life blood of the lamb, after<lb/>it is devoured, causes strength to the<lb/>wolf. The hon. member for Kent seems<lb/>to have been afraid the members for<lb/>Kings would be stuck in the mud. I do<lb/>not know what kind of soil Kent is com<lb break="no"/>posed of. I think it must be very differ<lb break="no"/>ent from that of King's. When we plant<lb/>potatoes it does not produce pumpkins,<lb/>and when we plant apples it does not pro<lb break="no"/>duce thorns. I think he is like an In<lb break="no"/>dian who was engaged as a guide by a<lb/>party of caribou hunters, who, before <lb/>night, began to think they had lost their<lb/>way, and upon questioning the Indian<lb/>closely about the track, he replied, " In<lb break="no"/>dian not lost ; wigwam lost." I am mere<lb break="no"/>ly taking up the time which should have<lb/>been occupied by the Surveyor General,<lb/>who is indisposed, which has prevented<lb/>him from making any remarks. I have<lb/>no doubt he could answer and completely<lb/>refute all that has fallen from his prede<lb break="no"/>cessor in office. With regard to a union<lb/>of the Provinces hereafter, it is a mat<lb break="no"/>ter which requires serious consideration,<lb/>and I, for one, am disposed to go into<lb/>union upon fair and equitable terms. I<lb/>fully endorse what appears in the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress, " But in any scheme for a union of<lb/>the British North Amerian Colonies,"<lb/>&amp;c. I think a large majority in this<lb/>House endorse those sentiments. I have<lb/>no doubt but a scheme of union will be<lb/>pressed upon us, by the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment. Our Government is in an embar<lb break="no"/>rassing condition in regard to outside<lb/>pressure, but they have done all they<lb/>could under the circumstances, and I<lb/>have no want of confidence in them. The<lb/>charges brought against them by the<lb/>members of the Opposition do not amount<lb/>to any real charges against their charac<lb break="no"/>ter as a Government. If they did I would<lb/>be one of the first to give my vote against<lb/>them. They were in error in allowing<lb/>the law for collecting " export duty" to<lb/>expire, but every Government and every<lb/>man is liable to errors. They throw<lb/>themselves upon the people, and acknow<lb break="no"/>ledge their error. There have been other<lb/>charges made but I do not see anything<lb/>in them to induce me to go for a want of<lb/>confidence in the Government. It has<lb/>been said that the expiring of the " Min<lb break="no"/>ute of Council" regarding the Crown<lb/>Land regulations, should have been pub<lb break="no"/>lished in the Royal Gazette. The same<lb/>rule would apply to the law for collecting<lb/>export duty. I consider it the duty of the<lb/>exporters of lumber, or the persons apply<lb break="no"/>ing for lumber, to search these Crown<lb/>Land regulations, and then they know as<lb/>well as the Surveyor General that such a<lb/>law or order has expired. It is not neces<lb break="no"/>sary when an order expires to have it<lb/>published, although it would have been<lb/>well to have published that the export<lb/>duty law was about to expire, but that was<lb/>the duty of the preceding Government ; <lb/>certainly it was not of this. I only hope<lb/>the Government will be able to steer<lb/>through the shoals and whirlpools thrown<lb/>in its way, and I think they will, for I<lb/>have every confidence in the ability of<lb/>the leader of the Government, who is now<lb/>at the helm of the state.<lb/>

                   A BILL RELATING TO MARRIAGE.     
     <lb/>
            </head>
   
            <p>    Mr. CONNELL in moving this Bill<lb/>said, it was before the Legislature last<lb/>year, and there were two objections<lb/>made to it. One was with reference to<lb/>the amount which should be paid<lb/>for marriage license, and the other in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the manner of registration. One<lb/>of the greatest objections under the law<lb/>as it is now, that it makes the minis<lb break="no"/>ter collector of the taxes. If the House<lb/>do not think proper to reduce the license<lb/>there can be no objection to the other<lb/>part of the Bill, which relieved minis<lb break="no"/>ters from becoming tax gathers for the<lb/>purpose of registration. With regard<lb/>to the license fee, he thought it should<lb/>not be a source of revenue. In Nova<lb/>Scotia they paid but two dollars for a<lb/>license, and the machinery was more<lb/>complex than that provided under this<lb/>Bill. He thought the license should be<lb/>$1.50, and the registration fee 50 cents.<lb/>There was another difficulty in the Bill<lb/>of last year, which a section of this Bill<lb/>provides for. It will enforce the regis<lb break="no"/>tration of these certificates, which in<lb/>many cases is not now done. It also<lb/>provides for the publication of the banns<lb/>of marriage twice, instead of three times,<lb/>as at present.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Col. BOYD</persName> remarked that money <lb/>paid for a license was paid very cheer<lb break="no"/>fully. In regard to the clergymen col<lb break="no"/>lecting the tax, some of them liked to<lb/>do it very well, for they collected the<lb/>tax and did not register the marriage,<lb/>but put the fees in their own pocket.<lb/>He then related an instance of a woman,<lb/>whose husband was killed in battle in<lb/>the United States, not being able to ob<lb break="no"/>tain a pension in consequence of the<lb/>clergyman not having registered the<lb/>marriage.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. CONNELL explained that this<lb/>Bill made provision for that.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. NEEDHAM said that the Bill<lb/>provided that no minister, or any other<lb/>person shall solemnize marriage until<lb/>the party has produced a certificate from<lb/>the Clerk of the Peace, that he has paid<lb/>for the registry thereof. That relieves<lb/>the minister from paying the Clerk,<lb/>which they often do out of their own<lb/>pocket. I do not believe it is good<lb/>policy to reduce the fees. No man was<lb/>ever prevented from getting married<lb/>because he had to pay $4 for a license.<lb/>If he could not do that he could be pub<lb break="no"/>lished, that is the legitimate way of do<lb break="no"/>ing it ; it is the way they do it in Eng<lb break="no"/>land, therefore, no man need be asham<lb break="no"/>ed to be published.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. ANGLIN said, if he understood <lb/>the Bill, it involved an important princi<lb break="no"/>ple, which was, that without the person<lb/>had paid the fee for the registry a legi<lb break="no"/>timate marriage could not be celebrated.<lb/>This was interfering with the rights of the<lb/>clergymen. He would mention a case<lb/>

     in point: In Missouri an order had    the       
     <lb/>
     been issued that no clergyman should                
     <lb/>attempt to preach until he had taken the<lb/>
     
     oath of allegiance. No man disputed<lb/>
     but what it was perfectly right to take <lb/>the oath, but the case was this: A Gen<lb/>eral acting for the State had taken the<lb/>right to license parties to preach after<lb/>administering the oath of allegience to<lb/>them; but many respectable clergymen<lb/>submitted to imprisonment sooner than<lb/>accept of such terms; and several clergy<lb break="no"/>men of Catholic and other denomina<lb break="no"/>tions took the same view. They said<lb/>they were commissioned to perform cer<lb break="no"/>tain functions by authority supreme to<lb/>the State, and they claimed the right <lb/>to preach the Word of God, and <lb/>administer the Sacraments, with<lb break="no"/>out interference from the State. <lb/>They takethis ground, they would <lb/>take the oath at once, but when<lb/>they tell them they cannot peach with<lb/>out taking the oath; then they say you<lb/>attempt to stand between us and the<lb/>person we think are commissioned<lb/>from. Therefore, he thought if any per<lb break="no"/>son did not choose to hand over the 50 <lb/>cents the clergyman should not be pro<lb break="no"/>hibited from marrying him if he chooses<lb/>to do it out of kindness or charity. He<lb/>did not think they ought to reduce the<lb/>license fee at all, and before they touch<lb break="no"/>ed what might be a difficult matter, they<lb/>had better let the present law stand, al<lb break="no"/>though it was not exactly what it ought<lb/>to be.<lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:HILL1">MR. HILL</persName> would go for the reduction<lb/>of the fees, for he considered them far<lb/>too high. It appeared to him that that<lb/>section which requires a certificate of <lb/>registration from the Clerk of the Peace,<lb/>before a clergyman is entitled to solemn<lb break="no"/>ize marriage, will cause inconvenience. <lb/>In one-third of the marriages in his <lb/>County the parties come from the State<lb/>of Maine, in some instances they come <lb/>one hundred miles and are married at<lb/>St. Stephens, and having to get a certi<lb break="no"/>ficate would put them to a great incon<lb break="no"/>venience. It should be provided in the <lb/>Bill that they could get a certificate from<lb/>the Issuer of Marriage Licenses.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">A BILL TO ABOLISH IMPRISONMENT FOR DEBT<lb/>
            </head>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">MR. NEEDHAM</persName> in moving that the<lb/>House got into Committee on the above Bill<lb/>said, I will endeavour to explain to the <lb/>House the nature of the BIll, and the<lb/>reasons that induce me to spend time<lb/>in endeavouring to frame it. In doing <lb/>which I do not pretend that that Bill is<lb/>perfect in all its pats, for it is almost im<lb break="no"/>possible for one man, engaged in a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of such vast moment, to perfect a<lb/>Bill in which, when it comes to be car<lb break="no"/>ried, there will not be found some im<lb break="no"/>perfections. I have been perfecting <lb/>this Bill from the time we last met here<lb/>down to within a few weeks of the pre<lb break="no"/>sent Session ; this being the tenth copy<lb/>from the original draft. I have also <lb/>submitted it to two or three Judges of<lb/>the land, and those Judges approved<lb/>of it in almost every particular. In re<lb break="no"/>ference to the guards I have thrown <lb/>around the Bill. I asked them to make <lb/>any suggestions which they thought<lb/>would be a benefit to it. They replied<lb/>they did not see that anything more was<lb/>required, but we all know that when a <lb/>case is to be tried ; before a court of <lb/>adjudication they would see errors,<lb/>which they do not see in reading the<lb/>Bill. The Bill does not provide against<lb/>imprisonment for debt in cases where<lb/>they have been already contracted, for<lb/>these debts have been incurred under <lb/>certain restrictions, providing certain<lb/>rights for the creditor, and these rights<lb/>are not to be disturbed at all. This <lb/>question of imprisonment fo debt<lb/>is a subject which has occupied the at<lb break="no"/>tention of great statesmen. The ab<lb break="no"/>stract principle is, that it is a barbarian<lb/>custom which has been long disgraced<lb/>the statute book of a civilized country<lb/>and ought not to exist. You imprison<lb/>a man for a felony, and for a debt, thereby <lb/>making the debtor a felon by turning <lb/>the Jailor's key upon him. While I ad<lb break="no"/>mit there are a great number of people<lb/>in the world who have run into debt<lb/>recklessly, and have failed when they <lb/>ought not to have failed, I have yet to <lb/>learn that there is more evil than good<lb/>in the world. Honesty and wrong are<lb/>comparative. It is not every man who <lb/>runs in debt and does not pay is a rogue,<lb/>but the rogue is the man who runs in <lb/>debt and will not pay. When a man <lb/>gets trusted for goods by falsely stating<lb/>he is worth so much property, he should<lb/>be dealt with as a felon, you should not<lb/>jail him, but you should put him in the<lb/>Penitentiary. Why should the unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate poor man suffer for rogues. <lb/>(Mr. Hatheway, did you ever know an<lb/>instance of the kind?) The same law is <lb/>made for both. This Bill is made to <lb/> 

          <cb/>

protect creditors and honest debtors,<lb/>and to punish dishonest debtors. If the<lb/>hon. gentleman will suggest any im<lb break="no"/>provement I shall be glad for I want<lb/>to make it as perfect as possible. It<lb/>has been conceded by the statesmen of<lb/>England, and acknowledged by the <lb/>United States, that imprisonment for<lb/>debt is at variance with the pinciples <lb/>of the day, and had its origin in the dark<lb/>ages of antiquity. Unless we are only<lb/>fit to live in those times we will adopt the<lb/>principles of that Bill. I purpose in this<lb/>Bill to abolish imprisonment for all debts<lb/>that may be contracted after a time<lb/>be fixed by this House. Some people<lb/>may fancy that by doing so the whole<lb/>credit system of the country will be<lb/>abolished, and the lawyers will not have<lb/>so much to do. I do not believe it will<lb/>have this effect at all. In a great num<lb break="no"/>ber of instances when a debtor is incar<lb break="no"/>cerated, he not only loses, but the credi<lb break="no"/>tor also. I am not willing to take away<lb/>any privileges from the creditor without<lb/>giving something in lieu of it. In lieu<lb/>of imprisonment for debt, I substitute<lb/>an attachment law. Some have said <lb/>this was of American origin, so it is;<lb/>but that is no reason why it is not good <lb/>or why we should not adopt it. Ameri<lb break="no"/>canism is itself of British origin, and <lb/>their common law is the same as our<lb/>law. This principle of attachment, if it <lb/>works well in America, will work as<lb/>well here as there. Some men are<lb/>afraid of it, because they think it will <lb/>give one man the power to come down <lb/>and take all the debtor has got, and the <lb/>other creditors get nothing. This is not<lb/>the case, for the very moment all the<lb/>man's property is attached, his business <lb/>is subject to investigation by a Jury who<lb/>shall have power to compel the debtor<lb/>to produce his books, and any docu<lb break="no"/>ments relating to his business transac<lb break="no"/>tions, and to examine witnesses under<lb/>oath, to see if he has conduccted his<lb/>business in a fair way, and that his<lb/>failure has not been occasioned by fraud, <lb/>but has been by acts over which he had<lb/>no control, in which case the verdict of<lb/>the Jury sets the man free, and his pro<lb break="no"/>perty goes to his creditors; but if it is<lb/>shewn that the debtor has been<lb/>guilty of fraud, the law provides<lb/>he is deemed guilty of fraud, and<lb/>on conviction, is liable to punishment.<lb/>It is a very extraordinary thing that we <lb/>should be the only Province or State on<lb/>the whole North American Continent <lb/>that has not a Bankrupt Law. (A mem<lb break="no"/>ber.— We have had three, and they have<lb/>been repealed) Those Bankrupt Laws<lb/>were made for the occasion ; they were<lb/>made to swindle creditors, and as soon<lb/>as they had accomplished their object<lb/>they were repealed. All the debtor had<lb/>to do was to get two-thirds of his credit<lb break="no"/>ors to accept a penny in the pound. I <lb/>have put a good many through thate law.<lb/>A man once came to me, and wanted me <lb/>to put him through the "Unfortunate<lb/>Debtor's Law." I put him through the <lb/>operation, although, at the same time, <lb/>he owed me £50. I got his creditors<lb/>to consent to take a penny in a <lb/>pound, and for that the man got clear of<lb/>all his debts. The cost of putting him<lb/>through was £10, and he turned round<lb/>and offered me ten pence for my cost. <lb/>Served me right. He did not even think<lb/>to offer me the half-dollar for the £50 he<lb/>owed me. That is the way you left us <lb/>lawyers with your Bankrupt Bills. This<lb/> <lb/>

     occurred, although I have no doubt that 
     <lb/>a great majority of the men that took ad<lb break="no"/>vantage of thatAct were honest men, for <lb/>it does not follow that because a man<lb/>went through that Bankrupt Court that<lb/>he was a rogue.

            <p>    It is a very easy matter to give a<lb/>debtor a bad name, which he will find it<lb/>a hard matter to get rid of, when he does<lb/>not deserve it. We should protect the<lb/>poor unfortunate honest man, even if<lb/>some rogues get the benefit of it. You<lb/>hear judges, lawyers and ministers quote :<lb/>" It is better that ninety-nine guilty per<lb break="no"/>sons should escape, than that one inno<lb break="no"/>cent person should be punished." The<lb/>Judges, in laying down the principles of<lb/>the law, in addressing the Jury, say : " If<lb/>you have a reasonable doubt concerning<lb/>the guilt of the prisoner, give him the<lb/>benefit of that doubt." There are forty-<lb break="yes"/>one of us here, and we say in our own<lb/>strength, we are the assembled wisdom<lb/>of New Brunswick. The law says so,<lb/>when it commands the Sheriff to return<lb/>wise and discreet men, and they have<lb/>returned those men who sit here. There<lb break="no"/>fore, if we are the assembled wisdom,<lb/>let us show our wisdom, not only by our<lb/>conduct as men while here, but by our<lb/>acts as legislators, which will prove to the<lb/>people of this Province that we have not<lb/>been sent here in vain. Let us legislate<lb/>for the poor as well as for the rich. If<lb/>we cannot feel for the poor, some of us<lb/>cannot feel for ourselves. This Bill has<lb/>long been called for, and somebody had<lb/>to take what is called in Parliamentary<lb/>language, the initiative. I have done it,<lb/>but I am perfectly willing for any other <lb/>member who has a better Bill, to strike<lb/>out this Bill from the beginning to the<lb/>end, and introduce other sections in lieu<lb/>thereof. I would not care if it was cut<lb/>up so I would not know it, so long as it<lb/>contained the principles of this Bill. I<lb/>should rejoice to think that though my<lb/>Bill should sink, I had been the means of<lb/>bringing forth a Bill that would have the<lb/>desired effect. But if you have no bet<lb break="no"/>ter, don't go against this because it is a<lb/>new thing. You have tried Bankrupt<lb/>Bills, and they have proved a failure.<lb/>Try this, and you will never repeal it.<lb/>Is it a new principle ? We came here to<lb/>legislate on new principles. What is the<lb/>use of men sitting down here and origi<lb break="no"/>nating no new thing at all ? When the <lb/>Sheriff returned " Mr. Needham" as the<lb/>most wise in all York, why should he tell<lb/>the Sheriff by his acts that he told an<lb/>untruth ? I want to show them they did<lb/>not make a mistake. Are you afraid of<lb/>all new things ? If so, the world would<lb/>soon come to an end. It is a new thing<lb/>for a man to get married, and if all men<lb/>were afraid of new things, men would<lb/>never get married. It is because people<lb/>are afraid of new things that makes so<lb/>many bachelors. The same thing might<lb/>be said regarding the Canadian volun<lb break="no"/>teers, who were dragged from under the<lb/>beds, and brought up to the mark at the<lb/>point of the bayonet. It is no wonder<lb/>

     they wanted to get the Bluenoses to fight<lb/>for them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. FRASER said that, under this<lb/>Bill, a creditor could attach nine-tenths<lb/>of his debtors' property, not allowing<lb/>the other creditors to share in it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. NEEDHAM. My impression<lb/>was, that when the whole of a man's<lb/>property was taken, it was an act of<lb/>bankruptcy, but if a less amount was<lb/>required to constitute such an act, I<lb/>would have no objection. My object<lb/>in guarding the Bill in this way was,<lb/>that I did not want to give the debtor a<lb/>chance to become bankrupt until he<lb/>ought to be. Therefore, I put in that<lb/>all his property must be attached before<lb/>he could take advantage of the act.<lb/>There never was a time in the history<lb/>of the country, when it was more ne<lb break="no"/>cessary and essential that something of<lb/>this kind should be done. We have had<lb/>seasons of depression in consequence of<lb/>the war across the border, which has<lb/>caused our trade to be depressed, but<lb/>now we are looking up a little. The<lb/>little cloud which, when it commenced,<lb/>was about the size of a man's hand, has<lb/>rained the last drop upon the top of<lb/>Mount Ararat, and times of great pros<lb break="no"/>perity are coming. I do not prophecy<lb/>it ; but any man looking at the past, and<lb/>from the past, judging the future, will<lb/>say, there are seasons of prosperity<lb/>coming over this little spot called New<lb/>Brunswick. Commerce is going to rise,<lb/>business is increasing, deals are up,<lb/>and it is only when men are enjoying<lb/>prosperity, that they will go into large<lb/>operations, expecting large returns ; but<lb/>all at once a crash comes, and then the<lb/>honest man is bowed down to the dust.<lb/>Therefore, let us prepare for the unfor<lb break="no"/>tunate time to come afterwards ; and in<lb/>our prosperity make a law which will<lb/>not only benefit the debtor but the credi<lb break="no"/>tor, and, by so doing, show to the world<lb/>that our aim and object is to make such<lb/>laws as shall reflect credit upon our<lb break="no"/>selves and do our duty to the men who<lb/>sent us here.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Dr. THOMPSON said he could not<lb/>agree with the principle of abolishing<lb/>imprisonment for debt. If they wanted<lb/>to keep men honest, they must make<lb/>them amenable for every dishonest act. If a<lb/>man does not pay his debs, and has no<lb/>wish to pay them, he ought to be punish<lb break="no"/>ed, and under the present law we have<lb/>the power over him to punish him. Un<lb break="no"/>der the proposed law a poor man could<lb/>not get along ; if he could not get his wages<lb/>people would not trust him, for by abol<lb break="no"/>ishing imprisonment for debt, they would<lb/>have no power over him. There was no<lb/>great quantity of debtors put in jail, not<lb/>more than one out of a hundred. They<lb/>had better let the 99 excape as heretofore<lb/>and let this law alone. If a man who<lb/>gets into difficulty is an honest and civil<lb/>man, they would not find one man out of<lb/>ten thousand who would incarcerate him.<lb/>He was going to vote against the bill, for<lb/>they had had too many bankrupt laws alrea<lb break="no"/>dy ; by one of them he had already lost thir<lb break="no"/>teen hundred and some odd pounds. " A<lb/>burnt child dreads the fire." They had <lb/>better not put temptation in the debtor's<lb/>way. We pray to be delivered from<lb/>temptation, and he would add, deliver<lb/>us from this Bill.<lb/>

            <p>    <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Col. BOYD</persName> thought a Bill of this kind<lb/>was very desirable. If a man owed them<lb/>sum of money, they had a chance by<lb/>this attachment to secure themselves ; and<lb/>if the man owed more than his property<lb/>

was worth, the creditors all shared alike.<lb/>He had sued a man a few days ago who<lb/>gave him notice that he would swear out.<lb/>He had property, but he swore he had<lb/>none. The Justice had almost come to<lb/>the conclusion that he must discharge<lb/>him. He (Mr. Boyd) offered him one dol<lb break="no"/>lar a day to work for him, and would<lb/>pay him half his wages every Saturday<lb/>night, the other half to go to his credit ;<lb/>but he would not work. If there had<lb/>been an attachment law, he would have<lb/>paid himself out of that man's pro<lb break="no"/>perty.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. WILMOT said he differed from<lb/>his hon. friend who said that an honest<lb/>man never would be sued. As far as he<lb/>had watched the course of events in St.<lb/>John, the only plan for an honest debtor<lb/>was to run the country. The idea of lock<lb break="no"/>ing a man up in jail, he looked upon as one<lb/>of the relics of barbarism. He knew an<lb/>honest man in St. John who had given all<lb/>his property up to trustees, but had been<lb/>kept on the limits for four years by<lb/>one man, and that was not the only case<lb/>of the kind. The only way for them at<lb/>present is to run the country. He did<lb/>not think it was desirable to drive men<lb/>out of the country because they met with<lb/>losses over which they had no control.<lb/>In England they had abolished all bank<lb break="no"/>rupt laws and imprisonment for debt, and<lb/>had some very simple law instead. Im<lb break="no"/>prisonment for debt was also abolished in<lb/>the United States. Whatever would do<lb/>away with the credit system would be be<lb break="no"/>neficial to the country. There is plenty<lb/>of property in the country, but there is a <lb/>want of a circulating medium. When<lb/>times get bad, there is no money to re<lb break="no"/>present the property, and in consequence<lb/>property becomes depressed in value,<lb/>therefore difficulties will arise. What we<lb/>want is less credit and more cash, and<lb/>then we would have less debt.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. NEEDHAM thought it advisable<lb/>that the Bill should be referred to a Select<lb/>Committee, to take into consideration the<lb/>suggestions thrown out by hon. members<lb/>for its improvement. He would there<lb break="no"/>fore move that they report progress.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    A conversational debate then took place<lb/>concerning how the bill should be im<lb break="no"/>proved in the hands of the Committee,<lb/>and progress was reported.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    House adjourned until 10 A.M. to-mor<lb break="no"/>row.<lb/>

            <p>    The House went into Committee of<lb/>the Whole (Mr. Young in the Chair)<lb/>on a Bill " to make better provisions for<lb/>the naval defence of the Province."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    The PROVINCIAL SECRETARY<lb/>said, the Bill explained itself. The<lb/>House had already given the Lieutenant<lb/>Governor and Council authority to make<lb/>such provisions for the defence of the<lb/>Province as the exigencies of the time<lb/>might require, and the present Bill<lb/>asked no further authority than had<lb/>been given, further, than it gave special<lb/>legislative power to provide for naval<lb/>defence.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>    Mr. WETMORE remarked, when the<lb/>Provincial Secretary said the Bill ex<lb break="no"/>plained itself, he did not understand<lb/>him, for the Bill did not explain itself<lb/>at all. He was not opposed to it, but<lb/>he thought that the House had a right<lb/>to expect some further information.<lb/>
