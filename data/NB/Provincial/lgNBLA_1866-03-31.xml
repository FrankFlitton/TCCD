            <p>
     Editor Carleton Sentinel. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Your Excellency acquiesces in the pru<lb break="no"/>dence of the advice then tendered to 
     <lb/>
     Your Excellency with regard to the call<lb break="no"/>ing out the Militi, and which subsequent 
     <lb/>
     events have justified, as they have also 
     <lb/>
     the still later correspondence addressed 
     <lb/>
     by my colleague and myself to Your Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I still adhere to the opinion that if our 
     <lb/>
     advice had. been acted upon in its earlier 
     <lb/>
     stages, this correspondence need not have 
     <lb/>
     been so extended, and the general alarm 
     <lb/>
     along the border in the upper district 
     <lb/>
     might have   been allayed. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     
     In the present instance, Your Excel<lb break="no"/>lency appears to have been guided by the<lb/>counsel of Your Excellency's constitu<lb break="no"/>tional advisers, a course quite consistent,<lb/>placing, as it does, the responsibility<lb/>where it should fairly rest.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     I have the honor to be,         
     <lb/>Your Excellency's<lb/>Most obedient servant.<lb/>CHARLES CONNELL.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     To His Excellency, the Honourable A. H.      
     <lb/>Gordon C.M. G., Lieutenant Gover<lb break="no"/>nor, &amp;e., &amp;c., &amp;c.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     Mr. Connell then proceeded to speak on 
     <lb/>
     the subject of   Confederation, and   to say 
     <lb/>
     that it had been alleged throughout the 
     <lb/>
     discussion  on the subject —that the dele<lb break="no"/>gation from the Province    to the Quebec 
     <lb/>
     Conference was  totally unauthorized. He 
     <lb/>
     believed, on the contrary, that it was au 
     <lb/>
     thorized : but even if the late Govern<lb break="no"/>ment had not any authority to appoint 
     <lb/>that delegation, he considered they<lb/>would like to ask, the duty of a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment? Was it merely to draw their<lb/>salaries and transact the routine business<lb/>of the country?  Was it not rather the<lb/>duty of a Government to advance, by all<lb/>the legitimate means in their power, the<lb/>interest of the country - to introduce<lb/>measures that would benefit it and lead<lb/>it on the path of progress and prosperity.<lb/>Let what might be said to the contrary,<lb/>be considered they had a perfect right to<lb/>appoint delegates to consult with the<lb/>delegates of the other Provinces on a<lb/>measure that would advance the interests<lb/>and consolidate the power of all these<lb/>British North American Colonies. (Mr.<lb/>Needham - Was it right for the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to adopt a new Constitution for the<lb/>country, and determine to put it through<lb/>the Legislature without giving the people<lb/>an opportunity to pronounce upon it.?)<lb/>He would tell the Hose what as the <lb/>the course the late Government ought to have<lb/>taken.  He thought, in the first place,<lb/>that they should not have gone out-side<lb/>their own members to form the delega<lb break="no"/>tion. That, he considered, was wrong.<lb/>In the next place, they should have been <lb/>satisfied with reporting to the House the<lb/>result of that delegation, and with sub<lb break="no"/>mitting the resolutions passed at the<lb/>Conference in Quebec; and if they had<lb/>taken that course and given the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture an opportunity to have discussed<lb/>those resolutions freely and calmly, they<lb/>would have carried out their measure.<lb/>They did wrong in dissolving the House<lb/>and agginz to the country when they did.<lb/>But when it was said they had not authori-<lb break="maybe"/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     ty to appoint the delegation, he maintain<lb break="no"/>ed they had, and he would have made<lb/>it a grave charge against them if they<lb/>had not done it. (Here the hon. member<lb/>quoted from a dispatch from Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>well, of March 9, 1865, to show that the<lb/>delegation was fully authorized.)<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Connell the, in concluding went<lb/>on to say that he hoped the result of the<lb/>vote on the question before the House<lb/>would be to make the Government place<lb/>their resignations in the hands of His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency, and give place to another set of<lb/>men who better understood the feelings<lb/>and wishes of the people. And he hoped <lb/>that these other men would take an op<lb break="no"/>portunity to allow the people to give<lb/>expression of opinion on the question that<lb/>was agitating the country.  He wished<lb/>to put an end to the unsettled state of<lb/>things in the Province.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     
     
     [ An irregular conversation followed, on           
     <lb/>a question of order, raised on the Attor<lb break="no"/>ney General's rising to answer Mr.<lb/>Connell on some charges in the correspon<lb break="no"/>dence that that hon. member had just<lb/>read. He appealed to the justice of the<lb/>House if he had not a right to answer<lb/>that gentleman when he brought charges<lb/>against the Government subsequent to<lb/>the bringing in of the vote of con<lb break="no"/>fidence. It was finally ruled that <lb/>member had a right to speak twice to<lb/>the question before the House.]<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     Mr. BAILEY said the Opposition had          
     <lb/>made a number of charges against the<lb/>Government, but he could not see that <lb/>they had established a case against them<lb/>They had asked hon. members to with<lb break="no"/>draw confidence from the Government<lb/>because they had not sooner called the<lb/>House together. He did not think that<lb/>change so grave as to merit a vote of<lb/>want of confidence. The Government<lb/>had also been charged with having allow<lb break="no"/>ed the Export duty Law to expire, and<lb/>having collected revenue illegally. But<lb/>as they had pleaded guilty to that charge, <lb/>and as he did not believe that the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the country had suffered, he<lb/>would not condemn them on that point.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     There was another charge of not filling | 
     <lb/>up the public offices - of not having an<lb/>Auditor General, according as the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution demanded - of not having ap<lb break="no"/>pointed a Solicitor General. He con<lb break="no"/>fessed he was not prepared to judge them<lb/>on those questions. But as to the other<lb/>charge against them about the sale of<lb/>Crown Lands, he thought that when Mr.<lb/>Gibson made his application to purchase<lb/>lands, if the Government were not pre<lb break="no"/>pared to receive his application and sell<lb/>the lands, they should not have ordered<lb/>the survey. Why, he should like to<lb/>know, make out an order of survey, and <lb/>subject Mr. Gibson to the cost of that<lb/>survey, if they had no intention that he<lb/>should have the lands? He considered<lb/>it a very great hardship that a man should<lb/>be compelled. as Mr. Gibson was, to pay<lb/>$500 for the survey of lands if no sale<lb/>was to follow upon it.  He had had per<lb break="no"/>sonal experience on this head. (Here the<lb/>hon. ,member gave two cases where he<lb/>made applications for lands on or near <lb/>the Salmon River, and near Newcastle,<lb/>where surveys were ordered to be made,<lb/>for which surveys he had to pay, and<lb/>pocket the loss of the amount, as no sale<lb/>followed. ) With regard to the sale of the<lb/>Crown Lands of the Province, his<lb/>opinion was that they ought to be sold<lb/>while they were available, before they<lb/>were stripped, or before all the timber<lb/>was burnt off. The sale of the public<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     
     
     
     
     
     lands he showed, was far better for the     
     <lb/>revenue of the country than to lease them<lb/>for lumbering purposes. Some of the<lb/>hon. members who had spoken had<lb/>charged it against the Government that<lb/>they had not filled up the Auditor Gener<lb break="no"/>al's office, and the office of the Solicitor<lb/>General. For his own part, he thought that<lb/>the present system of Departmental<lb/>Government was a curse to the country.<lb/>Here they were in the Government, on<lb/>the floors, of the House, half-a-dozen poli<lb break="no"/>tical offices, which gave the holders great<lb/>influence and patronage, and the people<lb/>had to fight against them. No doubt the<lb/>Government had been guilty of a few<lb/>deeds of omission and, it may be, of com<lb break="no"/>mission; but no men or Government were <lb/>perfect. He was not prepared to con<lb break="no"/>demn them on the charges brought<lb/>against them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Reference had been made to the dele<lb break="no"/>gation that had been sent home to Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and it had been said that no good<lb/>had come out of it, and that it was an<lb/>useless expenditure. His opinion was<lb/>that it had not been sent soon enough,<lb/>but late as it was sent, he held the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment could not have done otherwise,<lb/>and he hoped that he would hear of some<lb break="no"/>thing being done. He found that the<lb/>House had been in session for twenty-<lb break="yes"/>one days, and not much had been done.<lb/>The cry through the country was. when<lb/>was the House going to get through with<lb/>this debate?  He had made a calculation<lb/>of the amount of money this debate had<lb/>cost the country. and what did hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers think was the sum total? No less <lb/>then$12,000. He did not think that the<lb/>charge of wasting that amount of money<lb/>could be brought home to the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment.  (Hon.   member, - What charge <lb/>had been brought home?)  Not one.<lb/>Under all the circumstances. he could not<lb/>support the amendment and go with the<lb/>Opposition. What he had said, and the<lb/>vote he would give, he was prepared<lb/>to stand by.  He came to the House as an <lb/>independent member, and he was perfect<lb break="no"/>ly unpledged to any party or set of men.<lb/>He came here to do his duty to his con<lb break="no"/>stituents and to his country.<lb/>The HOse then was adjourned over <lb/>until Saturday at ten o'clock.<lb/>A.A.<lb/>

<head rendition="simple:right">SATURDAY, MARCH 31, 1866.</head>

<p>House went into Committee of the<lb/>
Whole on further considersation of a Bill<lb/>
to abolish the property qualification of<lb/>
members to serve in the General Assem<lb break="no"/>bly of the Province. After considerable<lb/>
discussion the question was taken, when<lb/>
the House divided- 12 nays, 11 yeas.<lb/>
Mr. Costigan then moved the reconsidera<lb break="no"/>tion of the question, on the ground that<lb/>
several members were absent, and that he<lb/>
was satisfied that the majority of mem<lb break="no"/>bers, from their expression of opinion,<lb/>
were in favor of the Bill. The motion to<lb/>
reconsider the question prevailed, and<lb/>
finally a motion to report progress was<lb/>
carried. A long discussion took place on<lb/>
the subject of Bills for placing roads on<lb/>
the great road establishment, and the<lb/>
question was raised whether they should<lb/>
be dealt with by the Government, or re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the Chief Commissioner of the<lb/>
Board of Works. Mr. L. P. DesBri<lb break="no"/>say argued that the result of referring<lb/>
such Bills to the Chief Commissioner was<lb/>
that nothing was done for twelve months.</p>

            <p>It was suggested that when Bills were re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the Chief Commissioner, he<lb/>should be called upon to report upon<lb/>them within a certain number of days,<lb/>and ten days were thought to be proper<lb/>limit of time. It was objected that the<lb/>Chief Commissioner could not give his<lb/>attention to such Bills during the session<lb/>of the House. With regard to the House<lb/>dealing with the Bills, it was held, that it<lb/>would be in direct opposition to the<lb/>principle of initiation of money grants by<lb/>the Government. Besides to discuss<lb/>such Bills would take up an immense deal<lb/>of the time of the House. They ought<lb/>to be referred to the Chief Commissioner.<lb/>In placing roads on the great road estab<lb break="no"/>lishments it was necessary to take into con<lb break="no"/>sideration all the roads of the Province,<lb/>and the wants and claims of particular<lb/>localities, and the smaller could only be<lb/>dealt with by those who had a general<lb/>knowledge of all the roads. Ten days,<lb/>it was argued, was entirely too short a <lb/>time to allow the Chief Commissioner to<lb/>report upon Bills referred to him during <lb/>the sitting of the House. Hon. members<lb/>called attention to the roads in their<lb/>Counties they wanted to be placed in the <lb/>great road establishment. Mr. DesBri<lb break="no"/>say and Mr. Caie, hon. members of Kent,<lb/>particularly drew attention to the most<lb/>important roads in their County, one<lb/>tapping the Buctouche and Cacaigne<lb/>Rivers, and bringing Moncton within 23<lb/>miles of Richibucto instead of 70 ; the<lb/>other, a road running to the Miramichi<lb/>River. Mr. Costigan called attention to<lb/>" a leak of six miles in the road from<lb/>Grand Fall to Quebec."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, a resolution in amendment of<lb/>a previous motion was carried, that all<lb/>the Bills before the House to place roads<lb/>on the great road establishment, be re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the Chief Commissioner of the<lb/>Board of Works, to report thereon within<lb/>ten days.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:centre">THE ADJOURNED DEBATE ON MR. FISHER'S<lb/>                                   AMENDMENT. <lb/>
            </head>

            <p>The Adjourned Debate on the amend<lb break="no"/>ment to the fourth paragraph in the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress was then taken up. Some objec<lb break="no"/>tion was urged by Mr. Needham against<lb/>going on with the debate, but Mr. Bev<lb break="no"/>eridge said he would prefer speaking then,<lb/>whereupon<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:BEVE1">Mr. BEVERIDGE</persName> remarked that so<lb/>much had been said on the question by<lb/>honorable members, that it was useless<lb/>further to take up the time of the House.<lb/>But as it appeared to be understood that<lb/>every hon. member should express an op<lb break="no"/>inion, he would do so very shortly. It<lb/>had given him great pleasure to listen to<lb/>what had fallen from the member of Car<lb break="no"/>leton as to the great resources of Canada,<lb/>on the position of the Government on<lb/>the question of Union, and on the impor<lb break="no"/>tance to the interests of the country to<lb/>have it settled. He had to express an<lb/>opinion, as the Government were not in<lb/>favor of Union, he would therefore vote<lb/>against them. He was for Union ; he <lb/>thought that ought to be the policy of the<lb/>country. He did not care what men<lb/>or set of men brought about that object,<lb/>so it was brought about. It had been re<lb break="no"/>marked that it was undesirable that New<lb/>Brunswick should be united more closely<lb/>with Canada ; but it appeared to him<lb/>that such a union must benefit the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince immensely ; it would be a similar<lb/>case with a poor man joining in part<lb break="no"/>nership with a rich one ; and had they<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
           
ever, he would ask, heard of a poor<lb/>man being unwilling to unite in business<lb/>with a man who was a great deal wealth<lb break="no"/>ier than himself ; the benefits must be<lb/>greatly on the side of the poor man. The<lb/>great object they should all strive for<lb/>should be to get Union ; without Union<lb/>taxes must increase in this province—<lb/>what with its general increased expendi<lb break="no"/>tures and the construction of so many<lb/>railroads, when he thought of all the<lb/>branch railways now building, or for<lb/>which Bills had been passed, of the Ex<lb break="no"/>tensions - Western and Eastern—he won<lb break="no"/>dered where all the money was to come<lb/>from. It seemed to him that while the<lb/>revenue was decreasing their expenditures<lb/>were increasing, and he did not see how<lb/>the country could go on under the present<lb/>system supporting its burdens, and meet<lb/>its liabilities without resorting to direct<lb/>taxation. Had the Government submit<lb break="no"/>ted a Scheme of Union, he would have<lb/>been willing to go for them. Let them<lb/>look at the question as they liked, there<lb/>was no use shutting their eyes to the<lb/>fact that Union must come sooner or<lb/>later, and to his mind the sooner it came<lb/>the better. It was admitted that to join<lb/>in with Canada, they would be united<lb/>with a larger and richer people, and such<lb/>a Union must be beneficial to them. He<lb/>thought they should all unite to bring<lb/>about that most desirable object. Had<lb/>the Government, as he had said, come<lb/>down with a measure, and shown what<lb/>the objectionable features of the Quebec<lb/>Scheme were, and explained where the<lb/>proper check was to be put that would<lb/>neutralize the undue influence that they<lb/>said Upper Canada must have by the<lb/>principle of representation by population,<lb/>he would have been willing to go for<lb/>them, but as they had said they had no<lb/>intention to submit any Scheme, he must<lb/>go against them, and vote for the amend<lb break="no"/>ment.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. NEEDHAM</persName> said, it was not his<lb/>intention to have occupied the attention<lb/>of the House at this time, and he would<lb/>have been better satisfied if he had been<lb/>allowed to take his own way, and to have<lb/>spoken when he felt inclined ; but rather<lb/>than it should be said that he was not<lb/>disposed to go on with the debate, he<lb/>would now proceed to offer some pre<lb break="no"/>liminary remarks.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It was a most important subject they<lb/>were discussing—the most important<lb/>that had ever been discussed in that<lb/>Legislature, involving, as it did, the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the country ; and according as it<lb/>was settled, it would affect not only the<lb/>destinies of the men who formed the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment of the Province, but, ultimately,<lb/>the destinies of the Province itself. In<lb/>dealing with the subject, he would ob<lb break="no"/>serve no exact order, but take it up as it<lb/>came to him. He would take up the re<lb break="no"/>mark of the hon. member for Victoria,<lb/>Mr. Beveridge, who said that they had<lb/>never heard of a poor man who was not<lb/>willing to go into partnership with a rich<lb/>man, applying this to the union of New<lb/>Brunswick with Canada. No doubt there<lb/>were great advantages to a poor man in a<lb/>union of that kind ; but the benefits of<lb/>such a partnership were not so evident<lb/>when the riches of the reputed wealthy<lb/>man—and he applied this to Canada—<lb/>were reported to be of a very doubtful<lb/>character, and especially when entering<lb/>into such a partnership, the poor man had<lb/>to give up the control of his own effects<lb/>and the general management of his own<lb/>affairs.<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p>With regard to the immediate question<lb/>before the House, he had never, through<lb break="no"/>out all his experience of political matters,<lb/>known a vote of want of confidence<lb/>against a Government to be pursued on<lb/>so slight a ground—on ground that took<lb/>so much the character of clap-trap. A<lb/>vote of want of confridence should be<lb/>grounded on malfeasance on the part of<lb/>the Government. The evidence of malfeas<lb break="no"/>ance and incapacity against them should be<lb/>clear and manifest. One of the great charges<lb/>against the Government was that the<lb/>Legislature had been called together<lb/>some three weeks later than was custom<lb break="no"/>ary. It was all very well for the mover<lb/>of the the amendment to say that by delay<lb/>the rights of the people had been sacri<lb break="no"/>ficed, their interests neglected. There<lb/>was no truth whatever in that assertion.<lb/>When they spoke of sacrificing the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of the country, what was to be said<lb/>of his hon. colleague, who, of his own<lb/>motive, voluntarily brought in this vote<lb/>of want of confidence, grounded, he (Mr.-<lb break="yes"/>N.) held, on insufficient grounds, that<lb/>had taken up more than three weeks of<lb/>the time of the House, and that was still<lb/>dragging along, delaying the business of<lb/>the country, and that had already cost<lb/>the country some $21,000 ? Some hon.<lb/>member had said that if the money had<lb/>been expended on the bye roads, it<lb/>would have been much more profitable<lb/>for the country, and so said he ; but be<lb break="no"/>fore he was done, he would show that<lb/>that money was a mere drop in the bucket<lb/>compared with the interests at stake by<lb/>the agitation of this question. He<lb/>thought he could show that the delaying<lb/>the calling together of the Legislature<lb/>was not a serious charge against the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. He held the Government<lb/>were quite right in not calling it together<lb/>sooner. They were there met not for the<lb/>purpose of legislating for Canada or No<lb break="no"/>va Scotia, but for themselves. This<lb/>Legislature was not to be convened for<lb/>the convenience of Lord Monck or to<lb/>meet the views of Canadian politicians.<lb/>Why was it that the Canadian Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture was not yet in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gazette</hi> called to<lb/>gether for the despatch of business ?<lb/>Why did they make this delay ? They<lb/>did so for their own convenience, he be<lb break="no"/>lieved, with a view to the action of this<lb/>Legislature. The Government would <lb/>have deserved a vote of want of confidence<lb/>if they had played into the hands of the<lb/>Canadian tricksters. If they had, he<lb/>would have moved a vote of want<lb/>of confidence against them himself.<lb/>He would pursue the subject under dis<lb break="no"/>cussion as it came to his mind, and if he<lb/>was not so methodical as he might other<lb break="no"/>wise have been, the House must excuse him<lb/>as he had been obliged to speak when he<lb/>was not quite prepared. The hon.<lb/>mover of the amendment had said that<lb/>the Government deserved to be thrown<lb/>out, that they knew the feeling in the<lb/>country was against them, and they dared<lb/>not fill up their offices, because they had<lb/>not a constituency they could call their<lb/>own. He dared his hon. colleague to re<lb break="no"/>sign his seat and run an election against<lb/>him (Mr. N.) in their County. Let his<lb/>hon. colleague run him if he dared, he<lb/>was prepared to resign his seat and test<lb/>the feeling of York on Confederation. It<lb/>was most extraordinary the position some<lb/>hon. members took on that question.<lb/>They saw, they said, union foreshadowed<lb/>in the speech ; they were, they also as<lb break="no"/>serted, elected to support Confederation.<lb/>But they were insincere in their profes<lb break="no"/>

sions if when they said that union was<lb/>the Government policy they did not sup<lb break="no"/>port it. For his own part he had come<lb/>to the House an anti-Confederate, opposed<lb/>to the Quebec Scheme, and he was as<lb/>strongly opposed to that measure as ever<lb/>he had been.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>So much had been said about the York<lb/>election during the course of this debate,<lb/>that he did not intend to enter into it at<lb/>great length. The result of that election<lb/>had been loudly proclaimed to be a tri<lb break="no"/>umph of Confederation. He believed<lb/>that those who most loudly claimed it as<lb/>a triumph were insincere, and knew that<lb/>what they said was untrue. At the last<lb/>election in York, both candidates were<lb/>opposed to Confederation. There was<lb/>no doubt it. In speaking of what took<lb/>place at that election, he did not intend<lb/>to be personal. With regard to the re<lb break="no"/>marks his hon. colleague, Mr. Fisher,<lb/>had made about himself, (Mr. N.) he was<lb/>willing to interpret them freely, and put<lb/>them down to the elation of success.<lb/>He had been accustomed to be freely spo<lb break="no"/>ken about, and he was one of those men<lb/>with whom people took greater liberties<lb/>than they did with others. No doubt,<lb/>if he was in the Government, and had<lb/>power and patronage at his disposal, they<lb/>would speak differently of him. But he<lb/>did not intend to retaliate on his col<lb break="no"/>league the personalities that gentleman<lb/>had uttered regarding him. The people<lb/>of York, unbought, uncorrupted, of their<lb/>own free mind, had returned him at the<lb/>last general election by an immense ma<lb break="no"/>jority over his hon. colleague, and put<lb/>him in the position he had now the honor<lb/>to occupy, and he would not condescend<lb/>to disgrace it by retorting personalities.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the late election, he<lb/>had just a little to say. That election<lb/>had decided something that he could not<lb/>before understand. In reading the elec<lb break="no"/>tion law, there was something in it<lb/>about bribery and corruption. He had<lb/>always thought that bribery and corrup<lb break="no"/>tion meant one and the same thing, and<lb/>he never could understand why two terms<lb/>meaning the same thing, should be used,<lb/>when an incident at that election settled<lb/>the question to him mind. Here he held<lb/>an object in his hand (holding up a bank<lb/>note), when he first saw it and gazed<lb/>upon it, the words of Hamlet's address<lb/>to his Father's Ghost came into his<lb/>mind—<lb/>

gue could not claim a Confederate<lb/>triumph, for it was patent to all that it<lb/>was the sensation got up about the Fe<lb break="no"/>nians that carried it. It was a clever<lb/>and cunning dodge. When Fisher was safe<lb break="no"/>ly returned Fenianism was entirely ignor<lb break="no"/>ed ; its work was done. But the alarm<lb/>about Fenianism was not over, for its<lb/>work had not been yet done. He never<lb/>had believed in this Fenian alarm. And<lb/>there were men in the States who had<lb/>means of knowing who said that Fenian<lb break="no"/>ism was nothing but a trick—a sensation<lb/>got up by Canadians politicians to carry<lb/>Confederation. With regard to this vote<lb/>of Want of Confidence, a greater anomaly<lb/>had never been raised. When the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor came down and asked the House<lb/>for power and money to enable him to<lb/>place the Province in a state of defence,<lb/>did the opposition oppose the granting of<lb/>that money and these powers. No. They<lb/>went as strongly as the Government party<lb/>to put all the resources of the Province<lb/>in the hands of His Excellency, and this<lb/>at the time when they were running a<lb/>vote of Want of Confidence against the<lb/>Government. Was that statesmanlike—<lb/>was that the course they ought to have<lb/>taken. No. They ought either to have<lb/>ceased at once from their Want of con<lb break="no"/>fidence, or have stuck out to the last,<lb/>and refused to vote the money awy.<lb/>That was what they ought to have done.<lb/>Mr. Needham proceeded to say that he<lb/>had once remarked that he took a broad<lb break="no"/>er view of these matters that came before<lb/>the House than most members. He liked<lb/>to look into the past and look forward<lb/>to the future ; when he looked back into<lb/>the past of his colleague, Mr. Fisher,<lb/>and contrasted his position with the<lb/>positions he held in times past he<lb/>must come to the conclusion— if the<lb/>country had reason not to confide<lb/>in the present Government, ten thou<lb break="no"/>sand times less had they reason to<lb/>have confidence in Mr. Fisher. When<lb/>he declared that the Government sent<lb/>home a despatch to the Colonial Office ;<lb/>a despatch that he called insulting to<lb/>Her Majesty, and said he felt so humil<lb break="no"/>iated, he could not but remember that he had<lb/>said as much when in 1856 he went<lb/>home on the Railway delegation, and a<lb/>long legged Yankee bearer of despatches<lb/>in a blue bag got superior honor on<lb/>board the steamboat, and his luggage<lb/>before him when he arrived at Liverpool.<lb/>He felt humiliated then for his country<lb/>that greater honor should have been paid<lb/>to this American than to himself. Now<lb/>he was humiliated because this present<lb/>Government had sent home a dispatch,<lb/>one of the best and most independent<lb/>documents that had ever emanated from<lb/>a Colonial office. There was no man that<lb/>withstood the scheme of Confederation<lb/>but must endorse it. Humiliated ! He<lb/>would tell the House when he felt humi<lb break="no"/>liated for his country. At the time the<lb/>Conference took place in Canada, where<lb/>Galt said to the delegates of the Province,<lb/>" What is the least possible amount of<lb/>money you can get on with ?" With<lb/>bent brows and after deep cogitation, they<lb/>concluded that the least possible amount<lb/>was$210,000. Think ; after surrender<lb break="no"/>ing to Canada the entire revenue of the<lb/>Province, to be asked what was the least<lb/>possible amount they could get on with ;<lb/>after surrendering the glorious right of<lb/>self-government, after giving up their<lb/>political independence, after giving away<lb/>all they could give away, to be asked by<lb/>Galt " What is the <hi rendition="simple:italic">least</hi> possible amount<lb/>

            </p>
   
            <p>
     With regard to the dispatches from the 
     <lb/>Colonial Office, it was only now that his<lb/>hon. friend, Mr. Fisher, had come to obey<lb/>them. There was a time when his hon.<lb/>friend had no such reverence for home<lb/>dispatches. (Here the hon. member re<lb break="no"/>ferred to the political primer.) With<lb/>regard to the dispatch of March 23rd,<lb/>1865, from Mr. Cardwell, Mr. Fisher<lb/>said if it had been laid before the House<lb/>during the last session, there would have<lb/>been no need of a delegation. He held<lb/>that there would have been more need.<lb/>If the House had had that dispatch before<lb/>it, the vote for the delegation would have<lb/>been passed without a division.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In reference to his own position with 
     <lb/>regard to the Government, he was inde<lb break="no"/>pendent. They did not hold him by a<lb/>hair of his head. He had never had any in<lb break="no"/>structions how to vote. He came to the<lb/>Legislature to vote against Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion and to support a Government who<lb/>would prevent the Quebec Scheme from<lb/>being inflicted upon the country.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     If he should do anything contrary to 
     <lb/>the pledge he had given ; if he should<lb/>say or do anything that should prove<lb/>him recreant to his trust, let them class<lb/>him with Arnold, the greatest traitor<lb/>known in American history.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the celebrated des<lb break="no"/>patch of the Government, (of July) and<lb/>the imputed disloyalty of the men who<lb/>drew it up, he had a word to say. Loy<lb break="no"/>alty was a very good thing, as religion<lb/>was a very sacred thing ; but there were<lb/>no two words that had been more dese<lb break="no"/>crated than religion and loyalty ; they<lb/>could be made to mean anything. The<lb/>Confederate scedmers had made very<lb/>free use of Her Majesty's name in order<lb/>to give force to their arguments. He<lb/>had no hesitation in saying that they<lb/>had no authority to bring Her Majesty's<lb/>name into this controversy at all. It<lb/>was with Mr. Cardwell, the British Min<lb break="no"/>ister, with whom they had to do. Sup<lb break="no"/>pose the British Government attempted<lb/>to coerce these Provinces into adopting<lb/>the scheme against their will, and the<lb/>same result followed, as followed for the<lb/>coercive course of the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment towards the twelve American<lb/>colonies, he held that resistance to un<lb break="no"/>just authority was not disloyalty to Her<lb/>Majesty. He has had as loyal affection<lb/>to the Queen, and esteem for her many<lb/>virtues as any of her subjects that breath<lb break="no"/>ed. But loyalty, as he understood the<lb/>term, was not abject submission to ty<lb break="no"/>ranny and oppression, but it was the<lb/>devotion of the heart,based on the hon<lb break="no"/>est conviction of the judgment. While<lb/>there was a loyalty to the Queen, there<lb/>was also a loyalty to themselves, a loy<lb break="no"/>alty to the land of their birth. They all<lb/>knew the lines :<lb/>

            <p>That was real absolute loyalty. When<lb/>those two principles of loyalty came in<lb/>contact loyalty to their country must<lb/>take the way.

they would sound a tocsin that would lead<lb/>ultimately to independence. These<lb/>were his honest sentiments.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. Needham</persName> referred to Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>well's despatch, and asked if it was not<lb/>a strong intimation that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment desired Confederation under the<lb/>Quebec Scheme. Looks at the position<lb/>of the Government and then let them<lb/>say if they could have answered that<lb/>despatch in any other terms than they<lb/>did. The Government were formed on<lb/>an anti-Confederate basis, directly op<lb break="no"/>posed to that scheme. When he went<lb/>through the contest at the general elec<lb break="no"/>tion he was opposed to that Quebec<lb/>Scheme, and had shewn up its defects<lb/>to the best of his ability. But half of<lb/>its iniquity had not been told. He<lb/>would tell the House some things con<lb break="no"/>cerning it that would amaze them. If<lb/>there was ever a sell perpetrated against<lb/>any country it was that Quebec Scheme.<lb/>He would not only show, but prove it,<lb/>before he was done. Mr. Cardwell<lb/>might be a very nice man, (so they were<lb/>all very nice men) but he must not at<lb break="no"/>tempt to coerce this Province. He<lb/>thought, perchance, that they were a<lb/>small people here—only some 250,000<lb/>men and women—that to his mind<lb/>might be a very small number, only the<lb/>population of some third rate town in<lb/>England. But he forgot there was a<lb/>difference between man and man. But<lb/>where would he find in England 250,000<lb/>that were equal to the 250,000 of New<lb/>Brunswick. There could not be found<lb/>in Europe or Asia, 250,000 with equal<lb/>general intelligence, ability, and equal<lb/>administrative talent. They in New<lb/>Brunswick breated from their birth the<lb/>pure bracing air of freedom. They were<lb/>accustomed to self-government, and<lb/>would yield to none their civil and po<lb break="no"/>litical rights. Every man born in New<lb/>Brunswick felt himself to be a man, and<lb/>every woman felt herself to be a wo<lb break="no"/>man. The mind was the standard of<lb/>the man. When the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment invested this country with the<lb/>right of self-government had they any<lb/>right to take it away again ? (Here the<lb/>hon. member at great length showed<lb/>that it was the intention of the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, and had settled at the Conference,<lb/>that the scheme was to be put through<lb/>the various legislatures without any<lb/>appeal to the people. He had been<lb/>present, he said, in Woodstock, when<lb/>Mr. Fisher made the first grand devel<lb break="no"/>opment of the scheme ; when he spoke<lb/>of the Union of the Colonies, the found<lb break="no"/>ing of a grand nationality, as a theme<lb/>demanding the power of a Demos<lb break="no"/>thenes ; when he compared the dele<lb break="no"/>gates who met at Quebec to the men<lb/>of the first American Revolution who<lb/>sealed the independence of the United<lb/>States. Those latter where very great<lb/>men. Mr. N. proceeded to say, they<lb/>did not meet and finish up their consti<lb break="no"/>tution in seventeen days, and afterwards<lb/>sign it on a Sunday ; but they took years<lb/>before they finished their work, and it<lb/>was a constitution that had stood the<lb/>political turmoil and the battle shock of<lb/>seventy-four years, and would last for<lb/>ages. When he heard his hon. colleague<lb/>say, that the steamer that took the dele<lb break="no"/>gates to Quebec reminded him of the<lb/>Mayflower freighted with the pious pil<lb break="no"/>grims who landed on Plymouth rock ;<lb/>he could not help thinking if the May<lb break="no"/>flower, instead of being freighted with<lb/>pious pilgrims, had such a band on<lb/>

board as those men who played such a<lb/>part at the Conference at Quebec, she<lb/>would have sunk before she got half<lb/>way on her passage to this continent.<lb/>With regard to the Quebec Scheme,<lb/>its supporters said that it was the best<lb/>scheme they had got, or would ever get.<lb/>Why, while he was speaking he wou;d<lb/>check out a better and more honest<lb/>measure. He would never consent that<lb/>the scheme should be inflicted upon the<lb/>country. He gave the Government a<lb/>perfectly independent support. Let the<lb/>Government tell the House if Needham<lb/>had ever asked them for anything, or<lb/>solicited any favor. He felt above that ;<lb/>true friendship was unbought, and<lb/>friendship was best displayed when<lb/>needed. What had the leadership of<lb/>the Government said—" rather than sub<lb break="no"/>mit to the Quebec Scheme he would go<lb/>down with the ship." So would he ;<lb/>he would stick to the ship and go down<lb/>with it, if go down he must. It was<lb/>said by several hon. members that Con<lb break="no"/>federation was foreshadowed in the<lb/>Speech, but he said it was not. With<lb/>regard to the question of Union, he was<lb/>not going to tell the House whether he<lb/>was in favor of it or not. He was not<lb/>going to tell his enemies his ideas con<lb break="no"/>cerning it, and give them the benefit of <lb/>his brains.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. Needham</persName> then said, that he would<lb/>now come down to the despatches. His<lb/>hon. colleague said that those despatches<lb/>ought to have been published. Why<lb/>did he not, when in Government in<lb/>1850, publish the dispatches of<lb/>Sir Edmund Head. When they did come<lb/>before the House it was in a mutilated<lb/>form, rows of asterisks between gaping<lb/>paragraphs. There was a great dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction, and a resolution was moved in<lb/>the House calling on the Government to<lb/>submit them whole. He would ask his<lb/>hon colleague if any Government had<lb/>ever published despatches before they<lb/>were submitted to the House. Let hon.<lb/>members judge how absurd it was for<lb/>his colleague (Mr. F.) to charge this<lb/>Government with not doing what his<lb/>Government had not done.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>(The hon. member here quoted from<lb/>the " political primer" to show the in<lb break="no"/>consistency of Mr. Fisher, and contrast<lb break="no"/>ed the position he held when in the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment in 1850, with regard to the<lb/>Colonial Office, and his disregard then<lb/>for despatches emanating from the Col<lb break="no"/>onial Office, and the position he took<lb/>against the present Government on these<lb/>points.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. Needham</persName> then branched into a<lb/>history of the struggle for Responsible<lb/>Government. He knew all the men who<lb/>had taken part in that great contest. He<lb/>revered the memories of those who had<lb/>passed away. Some were still upon the<lb/>stage of life, and some had taken to them<lb break="no"/>selves all the glory of the measure. Je<lb/>though that the glory should be given to<lb/>who the glory was due—the plume of<lb/>victory to those who had really fought the<lb/>battle. It had been said that Judge Wil<lb break="no"/>mot and Mr. Fisher had fought the fight, <lb/>and certainly they had enjoyed all the<lb/>honor and credit of the victory. But who<lb/>were the men who did the work—who<lb/>went into the back settlements of the<lb/>country and fought the battle side by side<lb/>by night and by day—who were they ?<lb/>John Pickard and others, whose services<lb/>have never been acknowledged. It was<lb/>accident often that caused men to be he<lb break="no"/>

roes. If Wilmot and Fisher had not had<lb/>such men as those fighting the hard fight,<lb/>they would never have enjoyed the glory<lb/>gave it to an opponent of Responsible<lb/>Government had not been won for the<lb/>people. Was it Wellington that won the<lb/>victory of Waterloo, and freed Europe<lb/>from the thraldom of Napoleon ? Was<lb/>it not rather the brave fellows who fought,<lb/>bled and died without due meed of honor<lb/>What he blamed Wilmot and Fisher for<lb/>was, that they had not given equal credit.<lb/>to those who had fought the battle with them.<lb/>There was a man now living than whom<lb/>no man had done more for the cause by<lb/>his pen and his word. He referred to<lb/>Dr. Livingstone of St. John—a man true,<lb/>faithful, honest, sincere—a man of great<lb/>sagacity and indomitable energy, who<lb/>had done more to give the people Re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Government than any man who<lb/>had engaged in the contest—more<lb/>than those who had gained all the<lb/>honor had done combined, and how<lb/>had he been rewarded for his ser<lb break="no"/>vices ? And what did Wilmot and<lb/>Fisher do ? They, alarmed by the<lb/>strength of a great principle, went into a<lb/>coalition Government. When an appoint<lb break="no"/>ment was made that would have been of<lb/>some service to Dr. Livingstone—who<lb/>they knew had worked so hard—they<lb/>gave it to an opponent of Responsible<lb/>Government. The proper place for the<lb/>Doctor would have been in the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council. They ought to have put<lb/>him in the Upper House, but though they<lb/>had the opportunity, they neglected to<lb/>give honor to whom honor was due. They<lb/>were afraid to put him there, more shame<lb/>to them. He thought they should not<lb/>have been so anxious to get into Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. They would have done them<lb break="no"/>selves more honor if they had waited.<lb/>However, they had received pay for all<lb/>they ever did. His friend got the Puisne<lb/>Judgeship, and he left his (Mr. N) hon.<lb/>colleague in the Government to fight the<lb/>battles all alone.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>He would wind up with a few words<lb/>about the despatch—he meant the glo<lb break="no"/>rious despatch of 15th July. The hon.<lb/>member of Albert (McClellan) called it<lb/>the immortal despatch. The Attorney<lb/>General said, when he read it in the Col<lb break="no"/>onial Office in London, he was proud of<lb/>it, and endorsed it every word. He had<lb/>never had doubt about it himself, and he<lb/>thought the people would endorse it also.<lb/>He was delighted to have an opportunity<lb/>to express his opinion upon it ; when he<lb/>first saw it and read it, his heart leapt<lb/>for joy.
