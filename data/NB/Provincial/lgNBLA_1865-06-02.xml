<!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

<!--<p> people of
Canada to the delegates from <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I merely refer to this to show the first<lb/>
statesmen in these Provinces, who were <lb/>
nominated by the several Lieut. Gover<lb break="no"/>nors to meet at Quebec to confer,
not for<lb/>
the purpose of taking away the liberties<lb/>
of the people, and for the purpose of <lb/>
acting tyrannically in the matter, but for<lb/>
the purpose of considering a union that<lb/>
would be for the good of all the differ<lb break="no"/>ent Provinces, and we find by the Co<lb break="no"/>lonial Secretary's despatches that the<lb/>
course pursued by them met with the<lb/>
highest commendation of the British<lb/>
Government and people. It is said Her<lb/>
Majesty the Queen and her advisers de<lb/>
sire to force upon the people of
this <lb/>
country a union which will take away<lb/>
their liberties. This is a direct charge<lb/>
against the British Govemment and<lb/>
against her Majesty the Queen.
Al<lb break="no"/>though there are but few in favor of this <lb/>
union in the House, yet I am happy to<lb/>
know that throughout the country there
<lb/>
is now a large majority in favor of it.<lb/>
The hon. member for St. John (Mr.<lb/>
Cudlip) talks about rebelling ; is that a<lb/>
proper position to take, because
a <lb/>
change of opinion takes place?
In re<lb break="no"/>ference to this subject not having been <lb/>
discussed in the Legislature, Ican say I<lb/>
always was of opinion that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was wrong in dissolving the
As<lb break="no"/>sembly before this
question was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. Before the dissolution of the<lb/>
House I took no part in this
question on<lb/>
account of my health, being
unable to <lb/>
leave my room the whole winter, and I <lb/>
would not have been in my place
now <lb/>
only that I considered the question of  <lb/>
such vast importance to the
country.<lb/>
If this question had been fully discussed<lb/>
in the House, the people of the country<lb/>
could not have complained that
the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not fairly settled. As it was<lb/>
the people did not give a fair expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion upon it. Those opposed <lb/>
to the scheme took advantage of the<lb/>
prevailing opinion among emigrants<lb/>
from the old country of the unfairness <lb/>
of the union between England and
Ire<lb break="no"/>land, and argued that because
that  <lb/>
union was the means of
depopulating<lb/>
and bringing a tax upon Ireland, the  <lb/>
same state of things would exist
here if<lb/>
we entered upon this
union. It
was <lb/>
argued that it would bring a tax upon <lb/>
every thing they had, and
finally
they<lb/>
would lose their Parliament, which<lb/>
would be carried away to Ottawa.<lb/>
Was not this unfair to represent these <lb/>
things in the most
odious light and cir<lb break="no"/>culate them where they
would have <lb/>
most effect, in order to
alarm
the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. The President of the
Council says<lb/>
how very convenient it was for the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment to state there
would be
twenty <lb/>
four seats in the Legislative Council at <lb/>
Ottawa for the members of
the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council in the Lower
Provinces, <lb/>
and this would have a great influence<lb/>
upon their votes. That may be the<lb/>
opinion of the hon. member,
and
it may<lb/>
be the opinion of those who are anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederates, but it may
not be a
cor<lb break="no"/>rect opinion after all, for they have al<lb break="no"/>ways been characterized as an
indepen<lb break="no"/>dent class of men. The President of the <lb/>
Council has also discussed
the great<lb/>
bug-bear of taxation. I believe,
under  <lb/>
the arrangements made by the
delegates, <lb/>
we would be in a far better
position
than<lb/>
we are now ; under that arrangement<lb/>
we would have had the Inter-colonial<lb/>
railway built at cost? of "$14,000.000
or<lb/>
$15,000,000, of which we
would
have <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>       
            <p> to have paid but the one thirteenth part,<lb/>
we would be relieved of our debt on<lb/>
which we now pay about £90,000 a year<lb/>
interest, and would have a large amount<lb/>
of money at our disposal for our roads,<lb/>
bridges and schools, and other local<lb/>
purposes, then we now have.</p>
            <p>House adjourned until 10. A. M., to<lb break="no"/>morrow.</p>
            <p>T. P. D.</p>-->


            <p rendition="simple:right">FRIDAY MORNING, June 2.</p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr CONNELL</persName> resumed.—The minori<lb break="no"/>ty in this question of Confederation have<lb/>
been denominated " conspirators," and<lb/>
it has been said that they are using " se<lb break="no"/>cret influences" to force it yet upon the<lb/>
country, that there is a " hidden hand"<lb/>
at work. What, I would ask, is the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of sending a new delegation to Eng<lb break="no"/>land? Is it to overcome the action of<lb/>
those who, though defeated and in the<lb/>
minority, have still a greater influence<lb/>
over the English mind and the English<lb/>
Parliament than those who hold power<lb/>
in the present House? Is this the "hid<lb break="no"/>den hand" spoken of? They were not<lb/>
afraid to submit the question to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this Province, and dissolved the<lb/>
House that no other issue than this great<lb/>
question might be before the people's<lb/>
minds. That dissolution was called for<lb/>
by the hon. President of the Council,<lb/>
although he now condemns the late Go<lb break="no"/>vernment for it. And who brings for<lb break="no"/>ward this resolution ? Is it not done at<lb/>
the instigation of the Government? If<lb/>
they are convinced that the interests of<lb/>
this country are in peril, why not take<lb/>
the responsibility of appointing this dele<lb break="no"/>gation upon themselves? It is said that<lb/>
owing to the dissolution this resolution<lb/>
has been found necessary to bring these<lb/>
resolutions forward. It seems some<lb break="no"/>thing very extraordinary that at this<lb/>
late period of the session, when hon.<lb/>
members are all anxious to get home,<lb/>
that another week should be given to<lb/>
debate this question, and all to justify<lb/>
the Government in appointing a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to go to England to tell the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament that we are still a loy<lb break="no"/>al people. It has been put forth here<lb/>
and elsewhere that there was no autho<lb break="no"/>rity for the action taken by those in<lb/>
favor of Confederation. But I think the<lb/>
despatches of the Secretary of State<lb/>
have settled that question, and he, it is<lb/>
to be presumed, is pretty good authori<lb break="no"/>ty : he says it was done " with the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Crown." But I want to say<lb/>
a few words on these " conspirators."<lb/>
I have here an extract from a speech<lb/>
made by a gentleman, who is a French<lb/>
Canadian, and who was said to be con<lb break="no"/>cerned in the difficulties in Canada some<lb/>
years ago. It was said that the people<lb/>
of Canada at that time were guilty of<lb/>
rebellion, because they stood out for cer<lb break="no"/>tain rights which they supposed they<lb/>
had, and the leaders were termed " re<lb break="no"/>bels." But the people of England have<lb/>
see that the rights claimed were just,<lb/>
and two who were charged with being<lb/>
leaders of that rebellion have since re<lb break="no"/>ceived much honor, and Her Majesty has<lb/>
seen fit to reward them, and their conduct<lb/>
has been justified more I think than the<lb/>
professed loyalty of Anti-Confederates ever<lb/>
will be. One of these, Sir H. LaFontaine,<lb/>
has gone to his rest, the other, Sir E<lb/>
Tache, who in 1812 shouldered his musket<lb/>
in defence of his country, and was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed Aid-de-Camp to Her Majesty, is<lb/>
still living, and giving his influence and<lb/>
energies to the forwarding of this great<lb/>
Scheme. When the Scheme was first<lb/>
         
            <cb/>
      

brought forward, as the Hon. President of<lb/>
the Council knows, I regarded it with dis<lb break="no"/>gust, but the fact that it would give us the<lb/>
Intercolonial Railway, and on terms which<lb/>
were most favorable, my mind became<lb/>
convinced that the Scheme was good, and<lb/>
this impression has become stronger the<lb/>
more I have looked into the matter. One<lb/>
honorable member has said that an insigni<lb break="no"/>ficant body in St. John—the Chamber of<lb/>
Commerce—was at the bottom of the <lb/>
whole affair, as they invited the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Canada to come down and visit us.<lb/>
If this is the case, then the hon. mover of<lb/>
these Resolutions (Mr. Cudlip) must be<lb/>
regarded as one of the "conspirators,"<lb/>
as he, I believe, was the President of that<lb/>
body. But I think the term applied to<lb/>
such men as the Hon. John Robertson<lb/>
and Lauchlan Donaldson, Esq., men of the<lb/>
highest respectability in this Province, and<lb/>
who are leading members of that body, is<lb/>
unjust and uncalled for. At that very<lb/>
time when the Canadians were with us, in<lb/>
those festivities of which we have heard<lb/>
so much when men's minds were not in<lb/>
train to say and do the things they would,<lb/>
the sam hon. gentleman who now charges<lb/>
those favorable to Confederation with be<lb break="no"/>ing " conspirators," said that " we must<lb/>
have a Union of these Colonies or drift<lb/>
into Annexation."<lb/>

            </p>


            <p> I will now read the extract from a<lb/>
speech delivered by Mr. Cartier, Attorney<lb/>
General of Lower Canada, now in London<lb/>
as one of the delegates who have gone<lb/>
home from that Province. He says :-<lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>" I, however, avail myself of this oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of remarking that if we in Canada<lb/>
take our share in the defence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, that will necessarily involve a great<lb/>
expenditure ; but I may add that you need<lb/>
not fear what you have been told will hap<lb break="no"/>pen—an increase in the duty on the goods<lb/>
imported from England into Canada.<lb/>
( Hear. ) Assertions to that effect are not<lb/>
warranted ; and as they are causing a<lb/>
great deal of mischief, I am glad of the<lb/>
opportunity of making the statement that<lb/>
there is no foundation for them. (Hear,<lb/>
hear.) It has been stated in speeches in<lb/>
both Houses of Parliament, as well as in<lb/>
certain newspapers in this country, that<lb/>
since Canada is so vulnerable it would be<lb/>
better for the security of England that<lb/>
Canada should be left either to assume a<lb/>
position of independence or to be annexed<lb/>
to the United States. (" No, no.") We<lb/>
understand in Canada that a cause of war<lb/>
can scarcely arise from ourselves. War<lb/>
in Canada must arise from an Imperial<lb/>
cause. We understand that we are vul<lb break="no"/>nerable ; but we are willing that our coun<lb break="no"/>try should be the battlefield in order that<lb/>
the honour of England may be vindicated.<lb/>
(Loud cheers.) We have no desire to be<lb/>
independent of this country, and still less<lb/>
have we any desire to be annexed to the<lb/>
United States ; we have no desire to be<lb break="no"/>come a portion of the American republic.<lb/>
(Cheers.) Such an idea we view with<lb/>
horror—(renewed cheers)—but from Her<lb/>
Majesty's speech on the opening of the<lb/>
present session of Parliament we know<lb/>
that our scheme of confederation is ap<lb break="no"/>proved by her Majesty's Government, and<lb/>
by the sense of the English people. (Hear,<lb/>
hear.) Subsequent proceedings have<lb/>
shown that it has the approval of both<lb/>
Houses of Parliament, and we feel that,<lb/>
under such a system, we can aid England<lb/>
in any struggle she may have with the<lb/>
United States. (Cheers.) if the falla<lb break="no"/>cious argument prevailed that, because<lb/>
the defence of a particular colony was<lb/>
likely to become expensive to the mother<lb/>
country at a particular juncture, that<lb/>

<fw type="num">122</fw> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> 

colony should be left to itself, then all
the <lb/>
colonial possessions of England
must go. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) If that argument
was car<lb break="no"/>ried out to its logical extent, the result<lb/>
must be that the British Empire is to be<lb/>
reduced to England, Ireland, and Scot<lb break="no"/>land ; and I presume that no one present<lb/>
was in favour of that proposition. (Cheers.)<lb/>

            </p>
            <p>Mr. Galt.—The toast of the British<lb/>
colonies, which has been so warmly re<lb break="no"/>ceived by this company, is one in
which <lb/>
not merely those colonies but all England 
<lb/>
must feel deeply interested. By the <lb/>
course of the struggle which has been go<lb break="no"/>ing on for the last four years in America,<lb/>
the interests of England have been, to a <lb/>
certain extent, imperilled. We have all <lb/>
hope, and we still hope, that our friends
<lb/>
and neighbours in the United States will <lb/>
be enabled once more to come together. <lb/>
We desire, in the interests of
humanity, <lb/>
that the struggle between the North
and <lb/>
the South should cease, and cease
at an <lb/>
early period. (Hear, hear.) We
desire <lb/>
that, irrespective of any personal interests <lb/>
which we may have in the matter—we <lb/>
desire it on account of the disastrous
re<lb break="no"/>sults of war, in respect of the interests
of <lb/>
the world at large. (Hear, hear.) And<lb/>
now I may take this opportunity—the<lb/>
first which has been afforded to me—of<lb/>
alluding to the sad news which has reach<lb break="no"/>ed London to-day—(hear, hear)—news <lb/>
which I believe will be a subject
of regret. <lb/>
to every Englishman and every inhabitant
<lb/>
of the North American colonies. (Hear.) <lb/>
We have not got the particulars of the <lb/>
tragedy to which I allude, but
whatever <lb/>
may have been our sentiments—whatever
<lb/>
our sympathies—with regard to the strug<lb break="no"/>gle in America, we cannot but
feel that <lb/>
the death of these two men, the
first men  <lb/>
in America, who have fallen victim to<lb/>
the hands of the assassin, is an event<lb/>
which must shock the public mind of
<lb/>
this country and of the whole
world. <lb/>
(Hear, hear.) I must say of these two <lb/>
men, differing as I do from much
of their <lb/>
policy and many of their acts, that I be<lb break="no"/>lieve Mr. Lincoln, who has now
passed<lb/>
away, was a pure-minded and
patriotic <lb/>
citizen of the United States—(hear)—and<lb/>
I will say of Mr. Seward that I deplore <lb/>
most sincerely his removal from
a position <lb/>
in which I believe he was performing<lb/>
very high duties in a manner which proved<lb/>
that he had not only the interest of his<lb/>
own country at heart, but that he was de-<lb break="yes"/>
desirous of preserving peace with this and <lb/>
every other country. (Cheers.) I am <lb/>
sure, therefore, that the news
which has <lb/>
reached London to-day, will carry
a shock <lb/>
of alarm to the mind of every one who <lb/>
is desirous that the peace of
the world<lb/>
should be preserved. (Cries of " Hear, <lb/>
hear.") With regard to the proposed <lb/>
Confederation of the North
American <lb/>
Provinces, after what hsa been said by
<lb/>
my friend Mr. Cartier, I will only observe<lb/>
that our object is not to weaken
our ties <lb/>
with the mother country, but to
put our<lb break="no"/>selves in a position to perform those du<lb break="no"/>ties which we think may he demanded of <lb/>
a great and growing British Colony. <lb/>
(Cheers.) We are not coming to ask of <lb/>
the mother country to undertake a greater <lb/>
responsibility than that which has hitherto <lb/>
devolved upon her. On the contrary, we
<lb/>
are come to show that if this Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion be carried out, we shall be able to <lb/>
assume a greater responsibility than that <lb/>
which has hitherto fallen upon Canada. <lb/>
(Hear.)  And let me add this, we
feel <lb/>
that the North American colonies ought<lb/>
not only to be a support to the mother <lb/>
country in time of war, but that
they<lb/>
should also aid in developing the sources <lb/>
of Imperial industry in the time
of peace.<lb/>
       
            <cb/>         
         
(Hear,
hear.) It is our desire that the<lb/>
thousands and tens of thousands who<lb/>
emigrate from this country should not<lb/>
pass from under the dominion of the <lb/>
British Crown. (Hear, hear ) We wish<lb/>
that they should come to the North Ame<lb break="no"/>rican provinces, where we can offer them<lb/>
employment and the means of advancing<lb/>
in life, and where they may still remain<lb/>
connected with the empire of Great Britain.<lb/>
(Loud cheers.)"<lb/>

have such a gentleman among them,
who
<lb/>
could express such noble sentiments, and <lb/>
so strongly attest to the loyalty of
the <lb/>
French Canadian. The hon. President <lb/>
of the Council spoke of the difficulties in<lb/>
Canada with regard to the difference of<lb/>
race and creed. There is no doubt but<lb/>
there were and are difficulties ; but is it<lb/>
any disparagement to this cause that men<lb/>
are found who, seeing these difficulties,<lb/>
have determined to rise above them, and<lb/>
place these Colonies in such a position<lb/>
that they cannot occur again? The hon.<lb/>
member for St. John, (Mr. Anglin) said<lb/>
that this Government could in two hours<lb/>
pass a Bill calling on the Governor Gen<lb break="no"/>eral to call out every man capable of <lb/>
bearing arms in time of trouble ; yet, <lb/>
when the Militia Bill was being discussed,<lb/>
he took a very different ground. I believe<lb/>
that when the people of this Province<lb/>
awake to a sense of their true interest,<lb/>
and have an opportunity to express their<lb/>
feelings on this subject, a change will <lb/>
then be made apparant. Our securities <lb/>
now have fallen
in the English market, <lb/>
and we hardly dare to put out any more <lb/>
lest they should fall still lower in value ; <lb/>
but I am of opinion that under Confed<lb break="no"/>eration we should have been able
to have<lb/>
got what money we required on the most
<lb/>
advantageous
terms, and that is some<lb break="no"/>thing that cannot be done by any delega<lb break="no"/>tion this Government may now send <lb/>
Home. We are told by the hon. Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council of the disadvantages<lb/>
the opponents of Confederation labored <lb/>
under at the late elections by the late<lb/>
Government having the power to offer<lb/>
certain vacant offices to those who would<lb/>
support their Scheme ; but he did not tell<lb/>
us that the leader of the Opposition had<lb/>
still greater power to influence voters and<lb/>
candidates than the then existing Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. I heard it said that the holders<lb/>
of office under the late Government were<lb/>
to be turned out all over the country. It<lb/>
was known that the hon. President of the<lb/>
Council would be the leader of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, if Confederation was not upheld,<lb/>
and it was reported that those who an<lb break="no"/>nounced themselves as opponents to the<lb/>
Scheme would have a chance of filling<lb/>
these offices. Such being the case,— </p>



            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—Now, Mr. chairman,<lb/>
I rise to order. The hon. member says, I<lb/>
made offers of filling certain offices, if I<lb/>
were supported. I deny it most emphati<lb break="no"/>cally.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—I
did not say you
did ;<lb/>
but if such were the case,-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.—Mr.
Chairman, I <lb/>
also rise to order. The hon. member <lb/>
need not deny his words, they were after <lb/>
stating that promises of offices had been <lb/>
made, " such being the case ;"
and, if <lb/>
necessary, I would be willing to
swear to <lb/>
it. His denial is in keeping with his <lb/>
whole course.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—I
said that it was re<lb break="no"/>ported that offers were made, and if such <lb/>
were the case, they had a
greater power <lb/>
than that of the late Government, and the
<lb/>
statement of the hon. member for
St. <lb/>
John does not make it more
true. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. WETMORE</persName>.—Mr.
chairman, I took <lb/>
          
            <cb/>

especial notice of the words, and they<lb/>
were, "such being the case, clearly
affirm<lb break="no"/>ing that the hon. President of the Council<lb/>
did not make promises of office. He need<lb/>
not try to shuffle out of it. Why can't he<lb/>
tell the truth ?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—I
will now repeat what <lb/>
I said, that when it was said the late Go<lb break="no"/>vernment used influences to bring about <lb/>
the accomplishment of their
Scheme, the <lb/>
President of the Council, and
others who<lb/>
opposed it, had a greater power to influ<lb break="no"/>ence voters and candidates and could if <lb/>
they chose, and if the reports which
cir<lb break="no"/>culated were true, they did make offers of <lb/>
offices to aid them in their canvas. It <lb/>
has been said
that our roads, bridges and <lb/>
schools would be in a worse
condition un<lb break="no"/>der Confederation than now. But
look at <lb/>
the condition of the Province ; we have <lb/>
to pay now £90,000, besides other sums <lb/>
annually to meet an interest here and at <lb/>
home ; under Confederation we should <lb/>
receive $200,000 beside the $63,000 sub<lb break="no"/>sidy for ten years Export duty and Crown <lb/>
Lands annuity to nearly $150,000,
in all <lb/>
more than we have now for local purpo<lb break="no"/>ses ; but what, I ask, will be our position <lb/>
now if the contemplated railways are car<lb break="no"/>ried on ? By the the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>way Act which was adopted in
1851, they <lb/>
agreed to pay $15,000,000 for the
work, <lb/>of which we were to pay three-twelfths, <lb/>
which would be $l,375,000. By the Con<lb break="no"/>federation Scheme we should pay one-<lb break="yes"/>
thirteenth, which makes $1,153,846, leav<lb break="no"/>ing a balance in favor of Confederation <lb/>
on this work alone of $3,221,153.
The <lb/>
highest estimate of expenditure for Ca<lb break="no"/>nals is $22,500,000, which added to the <lb/>
cost of the railroad $15,000,000
is $37,<lb break="no"/>500,000. New Brunswick's share of cost, <lb/>
one-thirteenth, equals $2,884,615
or $1,<lb break="no"/>490,384 less than the amount
assumed by <lb/>
our Act of 1861. Thus it would
cost <lb/>
New Brunswick $1,490,384 less to
build <lb/>
the Canals and the Intercolonial Railway <lb/>
under Confederation, than it would cost <lb/>
us to build the railroad out of Confede<lb break="no"/>ration. I believe with reference
to these <lb/>
Canals that they would be of
immense ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to us and that therefore we <lb/>
should be interested in the matter. We <lb/>
should be able to get our rivers improved <lb/>
and a Canal cut across from the Gulf to <lb/>
the Bay of Fundy, with other public <lb/>
works. <lb/>
            </p>







            <p> <persName ref="pers:DESB2">M . L. P.W .DESBRISAY</persName>.—That has been <lb/>
looked into and found to be impractica<lb break="no"/>ble. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName> —I
believe that it would <lb/>
be practicable and of immense advan<lb break="no"/>tage to our shipping
interests. Then as <lb/>
to our position with regard to Canada,<lb/>
have we no interest in the protection and
<lb/>
prosperity of the people of that Colony ? <lb/>
I believe that we have, and that we should <lb/>
encourage emigration so that the resour<lb break="no"/>ces of that great country might be deve<lb break="no"/>loped. Look at the Valley of the Sakat<lb break="no"/>chewan, one of the finest agricultural <lb/>
districts in the world, a valley 1,000 <lb/>
miles long and eighty wide, and capable of <lb/>
supporting an immense population.
No <lb/>
part of the United States can compare <lb/>
with it, and we have an interest that it <lb/>
should be opened up by canals
and rail<lb break="no"/>roads, so that emigrants may go in there. <lb/>
It has been shown that through this val<lb break="no"/>ley and across this country from the Pa<lb break="no"/>cific to this shore commodities will be <lb/>
brought from the East Indies, and Saint <lb/>
John or Halifax be made the great entre<lb break="no"/>pot of Western traffic. We cannot stand <lb/>
still, we want an introduction of
foreign <lb/>
capital that we cannot get without Con<lb break="no"/>federation. The Intercolonial Railway <lb/>
would open up our farming lands right <lb/>

through to
the Canadian boundary so<lb/>
that in a few years there would
not be an<lb/>
acre but would be taken up and settled.<lb/>
It would pass through the great
iron dis<lb break="no"/>trict of these Colonies, and
develop our <lb/>
mines and mineral resources. The value <lb/>
of our iron deposits is untold : the small
<lb/>
operations so successfully prosecuted by<lb/>
Norris Best, Esq., shews what could be<lb/>
done if they were but properly develop<lb break="no"/>ed. But it is useless now to go to Eng<lb break="no"/>land to try to obtain money for any such<lb/>
       
            <cb/>   
  
purpose. Capitalists there would tell us<lb/>
to show some interest in the means of our<lb/>
defence ; they would say we are split up<lb/>
and have no bond of strength, and that<lb/>
there is no security that money invested<lb/>
would be at all profitable. But if we had<lb/>
Confederation this would not be brought<lb/>
against us, and the railway would give to<lb/>
our shipbuilders a new strength by open<lb break="no"/>ing new fields for ship timber, whilst our <lb/>
young men would no longer have to go to<lb/>
other countries to obtain a livelihood,<lb/>
      
            <cb/>

but go
back to our rich interior and open <lb/>
up homes for themselves in their native<lb/>
country and under the protection of the<lb/>
British flag. Great alarm has been ex<lb break="no"/>pressed with regard to the debt of Cana<lb break="no"/>da ; it has been said that they cannot<lb/>
raise means to meet their liabilities, and<lb/>
so want us to help them along. I will<lb/>

            <p> My object in making use of these<lb/>
figures is to lay a fair statement before <lb/>
the country, and I believe in
reviewing <lb/>
these figures it shows that if we connect <lb/>
ourselves with Canada, we go with
a <lb/>
country that has resources that
we have <lb/>
not. We are curtailed,
circumscribed <lb/>
and fenced round. We are told that
our <lb/>
market is the United States; that argu<lb break="no"/>ment is put forth in favor of
Western <lb/>
Extension. Of course it is very desira<lb break="no"/>ble that we should be able to buy in the <lb/>
cheapest market and sell in the dearest, <lb/>
but this is not all. We should look at the <lb/>
position to which we should arrive under <lb/>
a Union with Canada that we cannot at<lb break="no"/>tain without it. These are some of my <lb/>

proposition will be laid before that people <lb/>
and they be allowed to express an opinion <lb/>
upon it. The 14th Section reads thus ; <lb/>
"The first selection of the members of <lb/>
the Legislative Council, shall be made, <lb/>
except as regards Prince Edward Island.<lb/>
from the Legislative Council of the vari<lb break="no"/>ous Provinces, so far as a
sufficient num<lb break="no"/>ber be found qualified and willing
to <lb/>
serve ; such members shall be
appointed <lb/>
by the Crown at the recommendation <lb/>
of the General Executive Government,
<lb/>
upon the nomination of the
respec<lb break="no"/>tive local Governments, and in such <lb/>
nomination due regard shall be had  <lb/>
to the claims of the members of the 
<lb/>
Legislative Council of the opposition in <lb/>
each Province, so that all political parties <lb/>
may, as nearly as possible, be fairly re<lb break="no"/>presented." In fixing the appointment of <lb/>
the Legislative Council thus,
and in mak<lb break="no"/>ing
them permanent, the delegates had <lb/>
the
best interests of the Colonies before
<lb/>
them. I look upon this as a safeguard <lb/>
against any encroachments that might be <lb/>
made. I would not go into Confederation <lb/>
unless the building of the
Intercolonial <lb/>
Railway was guaranteed and prosecuted, <lb/>
and what an advantage it would be to this 
<lb/>
country to have $16,000,000 laid
out on <lb/>
this work ; the majority of which
would <lb/>
be spent here. A few days ago the Mili<lb break="no"/>tia Bill passed, and we granted $30,000<lb/>
to form a Camp of Instruction, and now<lb/>
in such great has'e are we to show our<lb/>
loyalty that I find an announcement in<lb/>
the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Royal Gazette</hi> calls the Militia out in<lb/>
July, when the whole country will be in<lb/>
          
            <cb/>

          the midst of haying, withdrawing
the la<lb break="no"/>bor from farms and increasing the
rates <lb/>
of wages, and injuring other
Agricultural <lb/>
products. Perhaps this is done that the <lb/>
delegates, who I suppose are also
to be <lb/>
sent in like haste, may convey to the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish people a report of what we
are doing <lb/>
to show our loyalty. The Hon.
President <lb/>
of the Council brought in a
Resolution <lb/>
with regard to a Maritime Union, but <lb/>
there was no debate upon it. I
think <lb/>
that subject should have been thoroughly <lb/>
discussed, so that it might have some <lb/>
weight on the delegates who are now to <lb/>
be sent home, and that it might be ex<lb break="no"/>plained for the benefit of the country ; <lb/>
but that did not suit their purpose. But <lb/>
why need the Government come down to <lb/>
this House to ask us to appoint delegates?
<lb/>
Why not appoint them themselves? they <lb/>
have the power. I want to know if, when
<lb/>
delegations have been appointed before, <lb/>
the Government has pursued such a
<lb/>
course? When Messrs. Howe, Tilley, <lb/>
and others, went to Canada, did
the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment then bring down a measure to <lb/>
relieve them of all responsibility in the
<lb/>
matter? And the same will apply to our <lb/>
Railway delegates, the President of the <lb/>
Council being then a member of
the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment. Oh, but things have
changed <lb/>
now. Yes, a change has taken place, but <lb/>
one I think that does not add to the <lb/>
dignity if the Executive. They are
ex<lb break="no"/>pected to initiate measures and being <lb/>
them before this House for an expression <lb/>
of an opinion, but now they strive
to get <lb/>
the opinion of the House without commit<lb break="no"/>ing themselves to any measures, as is evi<lb break="no"/>dent by these Resolutions, and
by
those <lb/>
that are to be brought in by the hon. <lb/>
member for St. John (Mr.Cudlip) with <lb/>
regard to Western Extension. The hon. <lb/>
President of the Council says
the dele<lb break="no"/>gates to the Quebec Conference
had no <lb/>
authority to meet. I say they
had. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I
said they had no <lb/>
authority from the people. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—The
delegates who are <lb/>
now to be appointed will have
no authori<lb break="no"/>ty from the people either. The
matter of <lb/>
Confederation was brought before
the <lb/>
people, and the decision for the present <lb/>
is adverse to it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—They
were invited <lb/>
by the Governor General to meet
but <lb/>
they bound <hi rendition="simple:italic">themselves</hi> to the provisions
of <lb/>
the Scheme. <lb/>
            </p>



            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName> —Yes,
they bound them<lb break="no"/>selves ; they did not shrink from the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility, and what is the result ? They<lb/>
have gone out and others have taken their<lb/>
places. The hon. President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, and the hon. Chief Commissioner of<lb/>
the Board of Works differ on the question<lb/>
          
            <cb/>
    
 of authority
and I take sides with the <lb/>
Board of Works on that point. That
<lb/>
hon. gentleman made up his mind
that he <lb/>
would not hold office unless it was sub<lb break="no"/>mitted to the people. This was
done, and <lb/>
the Government suffered by it. The hon. <lb/>
Chief Commissioner took grounds against <lb/>
the Scheme as early as the first
of No<lb break="no"/>vember ; but he does not tell us what took <lb/>
place between that time and the 19th <lb/>
January, when he resigned his
office. He <lb/>
does not say why he did not resign be<lb break="no"/>fore, although I believe he acted consci<lb break="no"/>entiously in the matter. It is
not a mat<lb break="no"/>ter of any great importance, however.<lb/>He complains that a despatch was re<lb break="no"/>ceived in 1364 that he did not
see till a <lb/>
long time after, although he was
a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Government. He was busy, <lb/>
no doubt, about his office duties
when it <lb/>
was received, and it was known that he <lb/>
was not opposed to any action with regard <lb/>
to Railways ; but I will not go into this,<lb/>
as the hon. member opposite (Mr. Mc<lb break="no"/>Millan) will doubtless take it up and ex<lb break="no"/>plain it satisfactorily. Some
observations <lb/>
have been made by the hon. member from <lb/>
Victoria, (Mr. Costigan) and
the hon. <lb/>
member from the County of St. John, <lb/>
(Hon. Mr. Anglin), with regard
to the <lb/>
hardware and stoves in Canada. It is <lb/>
well known that the iron of this Province <lb/>
is not fit for the manufacture of hollow<lb break="no"/>ware and stoves ; but that of Canada, from <lb/>
the Marmora Mines, is just suited for that
<lb/>
purpose. But this fact is no argument at<lb/>
all, as those who know anything about the<lb/>
subject, are aware that the iron for farm <lb/>
implements, and most other
purposes, is <lb/>
now imported from Scotland at consider<lb break="no"/>able
cost, whilst in Canada the iron
for <lb/>
hollow-ware is found on their own soil <lb/>
and manufactured. In this respect, there<lb break="no"/>fore, they have the advantage of
us. But <lb/>
it is no argument
against Confederation <lb/>
that we have to import iron. The hon. <lb/>
member for St. John, (Mr. Anglin), says<lb/>
the delegates
were not sanctioned ; but <lb/>
it is well known that they were sanction<lb break="no"/>ed, both by the Governor General and <lb/>
the Home Government. He says, also,
<lb/>
that scheming measures were
employed to <lb/>
force it through the Legislature.
There <lb/>
might have been scheming, but I think if <lb/>
such were the case, it was carried
on by <lb/>
those of whom he seems to have the most <lb/>
knowledge. With regard to the confer<lb break="no"/>ence being conducted with closed doors, <lb/>
I think, although such is the usual course, <lb/>
that it would have been better to have<lb/>
made it public. It is said that Confede<lb break="no"/>ration would have had on injurious influ<lb break="no"/>ence on our finances ; but the opening<lb/>
up of our country, the introduction of<lb/>
foreign capital, the cultivation of our soil,<lb/>

 the natural results which would flow <lb/>
from Union—would have proved at
im<lb break="no"/>mense benefit to the country. And then 
<lb/>
the question of defence is one of great<lb/>
importance. If we are to be
protected,<lb/>
and if Imperial interests here are to be<lb/>
protected, we ought to know it
at once<lb break="no"/>the sooner the better. The hon. Presi<lb break="no"/>dent of the Council has now gone
into the<lb/>
question pretty fully ; but it is said that<lb/>
he was invited to discuss the matter in<lb/>
public by Mr. Tilley, before the
elections,<lb/>
and declined. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—That was wrong ; it <lb/>
was not so. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName> —I
am glad to hear it,<lb/>
for the people would very much have <lb/>
liked to hear the arguments for
and against<lb/>
the Scheme from such able men. I regret <lb/>
that that distinguished
gentleman is not <lb/>
now on the floors this House to
cope<lb/>
with the hon. President of the Council.<lb/>
But I think that there are men
still on the<lb/>
floors of this House, who, though humble, <lb/>
will be able to adduce arguments as con<lb break="no"/>vincing to the public mind as those given<lb/>
by those opposed to the Scheme, and they <lb/>
will be so convinced that a change will <lb/>
take place. It is said that the question
is <lb/>
to be forced on the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. The hon. member for St. John, <lb/>
(Mr. Anglin), puts his views before the <lb/>
public, and they should be replied to. It<lb/>
is to be regretted that he can come here <lb/>
and discuss the question, while
Mr. Tilley's<lb/>
mouth is shut. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> <persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr.
NEEDHAM</persName>.—The people shut it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—Yes,
the people shut it ;<lb/>
but who shut the mouths of these
gentle<lb break="no"/>men before the elections, when the people<lb/>
might have been informed on the
subject<lb/>
by a full discussion of it ? The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for St. John says, there are
plotters. <lb/>
and tricksters, and schemers all around <lb/>
us, at the corners, on the streets, in the<lb/>
hotels, and he applies these
terms to the <lb/>
men who are in favor of Confederation.<lb/>
But I should like to know who were the<lb/>
plotters in Ireland in 1848 ?
Perhaps if<lb/>
he were to go Home as one ol the dele<lb break="no"/>gates, he would be well known by
his<lb/>
antecedents, and it might come out, and<lb/>
maybe that would be as good a
way as<lb/>
any to cut off some of these plotters and<lb/>
schemers. I think we should have heard <lb/>
less about plotters if some hon. gentlemen<lb/>
had stayed in the home of their fathers. I<lb/>
was born in this country, and I remember<lb/>
when there were not more than fifty<lb/>
houses on the upper St. John, and they <lb/>
were the homes of those who have made<lb/>
the bone and sinew of the country. But<lb/>
new comers step in and take it upon <lb/>
themselves to call our people
plotters and<lb/>
schemers ; the very men who are
uphold<lb break="no"/>ing the rights and interests of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince are thus called. The
majority of<lb/>
votes east in opposition to Confederation<lb/>
were by men who are not natives of this <lb/>
Province ; but I think a short time will <lb/>
suffice to convince many of them that they <lb/>
were in error,—many of them are so al<lb break="no"/>ready. The reason why I speak strongly<lb/>
on this subject is that I am strongly in<lb/>
favor of Confederation, and so these
<lb/>
terms may be applied to me. But
even<lb/>
though the question comes up before this<lb/>
people again, and fail to he
carried, we<lb/>
will not rebel,—as it was said on
the<lb/>
floors of this House that if Co federation<lb/>
carried, those who opposed it would<lb/>
have rebelled. Why, this
question of Con<lb break="no"/>federation was urged on the old colonies<lb/>
by Benjamin Franklin, and why did
he <lb/>
fail to carry through his measure? Be<lb break="no"/>cause the British Government were op<lb break="no"/>posed to it, and afraid that their power
<lb/>
would be lost if the Colonies united. <lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>     

 
            <p> They said
if we allow them to unite we<lb/>
shall lose all control over them ; they are<lb/>
increasing in numbers and strength, and<lb/>
we shall not be able to hold them. But<lb/>
what is the case now? Instead of this<lb/>
the Imperial Government are anxious that<lb/>
we should unite, and feels that her power<lb/>
would be strengthened by it. If this had<lb/>
been the case before the revolution, in<lb break="no"/>stead of now being divided up into a vast<lb/>
number of States, the British flag would<lb/>
have floated over the whole of this conti<lb break="no"/>nent. But in spite of all, Franklin stood<lb/>
to his post ; neither gifts nor emoluments<lb/>
could move him from his purpose.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr.
ANGLIN</persName>.—He was Post
Mas<lb break="no"/>ter General.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr.CONNELL</persName>.—Yes, and lost his office<lb/>
too.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.— Yes, but his head<lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.— His son was appointed<lb/>
as Governor of one of the Colonies ; but<lb/>
that is what a Colonist can't get now, al<lb break="no"/>though I believe they would make as good<lb/>
Governors as those that come from across<lb/>
the water.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. NEEDHAM</persName>.— Was not Mr. Hinks<lb/>
made a Governor ?</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.— Yes, but Mr. Hinks was<lb/>
an Irishman. He lived in Canada, and I<lb/>
wish he were out here now ; he would have<lb/>
carried through a railway system before<lb/>
this. I think that we in these Colonies<lb/>
have men of ability and talents that fit<lb/>
them for the office of Governor ; we should<lb/>
still have a link to bind us to England-<lb/>the Governor General. I would not object<lb/>
to have a French Canadian for Governor<lb/>
of this Province, by way of exchange, for<lb/>
they have men of talent and influence<lb/>
there, who would fill the office well,—so<lb/>
they have in Nova Scotia. Among dis<lb break="no"/>tinguished and able men I need only<lb/>
mention the name of the Hon. Joseph<lb/>
Howe, of Nova Scotia, and the Hon. J.<lb/>
A. MacDonald, of Canada. I think we<lb/>
need not look upon ourselves as so very<lb/>
diminutive ; we have men who have gone<lb/>
away from us and became famous. Look<lb/>
at the Inglis, of Nova Scotia, and General<lb/>
Williams, of Kars. I have no doubt that<lb/>
the hon. President of the Council and the<lb/>
hon. membrr for St. John, (Mr. Anglin),<lb/>
will be appointed delegates to go home,<lb/>
and show the people of England what a<lb/>
great wrong they intend to inflict upon<lb/>
us. And yet I hope there will be some<lb/>
means by which we shall be able to show<lb/>
the British Government that there was a<lb/>
very large minority in favor of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, and that it has been stated that the<lb/>
people have not had a fair chance to test<lb/>
the question. I believe the not getting<lb/>
it has already shown that we should have<lb/>
been financially and commercially better<lb/>
off it we had got it. I believe that the<lb/>
great minority will not be over-ridden by<lb/>
the delegates who go home. The Govern<lb break="no"/>ment are the patriots now ; they hold the<lb/>
interests of the people in their hands,<lb/>
they guide the ship of State, and should<lb/>
keep it off the shoals in time of peril. We<lb/>
shall see what they can do in managing<lb/>
the affairs of a country with 250,000 in<lb break="no"/>habitants, less than many towns in Eng<lb break="no"/>land. In Nova Scotia the question is in<lb/>
abeyance ; but I hope that it will be de<lb break="no"/>cided favorably. In Lower Canada there<lb/>
was but a small minority in opposition to<lb/>
the Scheme, and that was led by Mr.<lb/>
Dorion, the leader of the Rouge party.<lb/>
I oppose the delegation now, because I<lb/>
believe it will be useless. I happen to<lb/>
know that it will have no effect there. I<lb/>
will now close by quoting the opinion of<lb/>
a great Colonist, (General Williams), ex<lb break="no"/>pressed in a speech made at Toronto. He<lb/>
       
            <cb/>
       
is not a " conspirator;" he did not con<lb break="no"/>spire against the people of England ; he did<lb/>
not publish his feelings and triumph in a pa<lb break="no"/>per when the British soldiers were compell<lb break="no"/>ed to retire before the Russian troops ; but<lb/>
he is a man, and a General, whose name<lb/>
will go down to posterity with honor :</p>
            <p>" The concluding paragraph of your<lb/>
address alludes to the great questions<lb/>
of colonial policy which at the present<lb/>
moment are under discussion, and express<lb break="no"/>es your regrets that I should quit your<lb/>
shores during that discussion. I never<lb break="no"/>theless leave you with every hope that the<lb/>
unity of all the British Provinces will be<lb/>
a great fact, which will grow out of the<lb/>
mature, calm and friendly debates now in<lb/>
progress. I think those legislators will at<lb/>
last come to the right conclusion, and that<lb/>
unity and strength will take the place of<lb/>
division and weakness. This unity bears<lb/>
with greater weight upon the defences of<lb/>
those vast colonies than it does on the<lb/>
commercial advantages, which are in<lb/>
themselves obvious and most important."</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName>.—Mr. Chairman, the Re<lb break="no"/>solutions in your hand, which have been<lb/>
submitted by the hon. member for Saint<lb/>
John (Mr. Cudlip) express that the Con<lb break="no"/>federation of the B. N. A. Provinces<lb/>
would be injurious to the best interests of<lb/>
these Colonies, and recommends that a<lb/>
delegation proceed to England to force<lb/>
that idea on the ministry of that country.<lb/>
I have listened with a great deal of atten<lb break="no"/>tention, and I may say patience too, to<lb/>
the long address of the hon. member from<lb/>
the County of Carleton. He says he has<lb/>
given this subject his attention prior to<lb/>
the elections, and turned it over, and re<lb break="no"/>volved it in what he is pleased to term<lb/>
his mind, and come to the conclusion that<lb/>
it will be beneficial. I have listened ,<lb/>
willing to be convinced, ready to yield<lb/>
to reason whether it comes from a friend or<lb/>
an opponent ; and I must confess I have not<lb/>
discovered anything to lead me to believe<lb/>
that his premises are correct. When, in<lb/>
the early part of Session, we had un<lb break="no"/>der discussion the the Governor's Speech, I<lb/>
took occasion to express my disappoint<lb break="no"/>ment at the policy which the Government<lb/>
were pleased to set forth in that Speech, I<lb/>
not in reference to a Union of the Colo<lb break="no"/>nies, but in reference to the great public<lb/>
works which should have been taken up. I<lb/>
said I regretted that the Government was<lb/>
not formed on any defined policy. I then<lb/>
expressed my desire and intention to give<lb/>
them my support so far as they introduc<lb break="no"/>ed measures which I believed for the good<lb/>
of the country. Not taking my position<lb/>
as a tame follower, or servile supporter<lb/>
of the Government, I have supported<lb/>
them when their measures were good, and<lb/>
opposed them when I considered they<lb/>
were not so. On the Militia Bill I oppos<lb break="no"/>ed them, as I thought the money could be<lb/>
better expended. The Post Office Bill I<lb/>
supported, thinking it would save some<lb/>
$3,000 or $4,000 a-year to the country.<lb/>
I supported the Treasury Note Bill also,<lb/>
because I believed it would be the means<lb/>
of saving a large amount of money to the<lb/>
country. And now lest the people might<lb/>
misconstrue my position on Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, I desire to express my opinions on<lb/>
these Resolutions, so that I may not be<lb/>
misinterpreted or misunderstood by my<lb/>
constituents on a question, the greatest<lb/>
that ever came before this House. I say<lb/>
it is of great importance, and therefore<lb/>
we feel a deep regret that we are called<lb/>
on to discuss it, for it has not grown out<lb/>
of our wants, but of the local necessities<lb/>
of Canada—out of the differences which<lb/>
exist between Upper and Lower Canada,<lb/>
and their pecuniary difficulties. We all<lb/>

regret that the late Government took. ?ld <lb/>
with such avidity and adopted
the Cana<lb break="no"/>dian views, without having come to this<lb/>
House and asked the appointment of the<lb/>
delegation. I think if this had been<lb/>
done, from my knowledge of the position<lb/>
they held in the estimation of the Impe<lb break="no"/>rial Government, although they ran round <lb/>
from place to place on a regular spring <lb/>
and autumn tour, yet they would
have been <lb/>
met by nothing more than a Resolution <lb/>
of want of Confidence. The Constitution <lb/>
of a country cannot be changed except
by <lb/>
the consent of the people, or by
the
em<lb break="no"/>ployment of force. In matters
that did <lb/>
not contemplate the annihilation
of the <lb/>
Constitution, it would have been
legiti<lb break="no"/>mate to appoint a delegation ; but to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss the Constitution under which they <lb/>
were acting was unconstitutional. If they <lb/>
had come to this House and asked
for a <lb/>
delegation, they would have been met by <lb/>
a vote of want of confidence, and we <lb/>
should have had an incoming Govern<lb break="no"/>ment who would have appointed a dele<lb break="no"/>gation which would have
represented the <lb/>
true ideas of the people, instead of
a de<lb break="no"/>legation which represented the views and <lb/>
feelings of the late Government only. In <lb/>
the late election in my County
the ques<lb break="no"/>tion stood on that of Confederation ;
al<lb break="no"/>though they felt the do-nothing policy of <lb/>
the Government they would not
make the <lb/>
election turn on any thing but
Confede<lb break="no"/>ration or non-Confederation. I say this<lb/>
Scheme, as far as I have looked
into it, is a<lb/>
one-sided Scheme ;
a Scheme
by which <lb/>
the interests of Canada would be promo<lb break="no"/>ted to our detriment ; a Scheme for the <lb/>
legislation of British North
America <lb/>
which would be entirely Westward, a ter<lb break="no"/>ritory immense when compared with ours. <lb/>
The preponderance in ten years
would be <lb/>
largely in favor of Western Canada. <lb/>
This we know, and if it contemplated to <lb/>
open up their canals,
and populate that <lb/>
great country west of Lake Superior,
that <lb/>
would increase the population
greater than <lb/>
ever. The great influence then would be <lb/>
centred in Western Canada, and the <lb/>
power would be all in the their hands. <lb/>
Those delegates who visited us
said we <lb/>
have the population element, and the ag<lb break="no"/>ricultural element, we want your mari<lb break="no"/>time element. If they valued our mari<lb break="no"/>time element, why did they not
leave the <lb/>
seat of Government to be settled after<lb break="no"/>wards? Why did they not appoint St, John <lb/>
or Halifax as the place where the
archieves <lb/>
of a great people should he deposited. <lb/>
where ships of war could come
and <lb/>
protect them? Why did they place it at <lb/>
Ottawa, on the head waters of a river far<lb/>
in the interior? I look upon the choice <lb/>
of the seat of Government as one
of vast <lb/>
importance, as of great importance as
<lb/>
when they took the capital from Ireland <lb/>
to England, from which influences grew <lb/>
up to the detriment and destruction of <lb/>
Ireland. Our population and our capital <lb/>
would all go to Canada, and we
should <lb/>
become the hewers of wood and drawers <lb/>
of water to them. How much do they
<lb/>
value our maritime element ?
They give <lb/>
us fifteen members out of 194, according <lb/>
to population. Now the question of re<lb break="no"/>presentation by population is a debatable <lb/>
one. We have a great country, with a <lb/>
noble river running through it, one
of the <lb/>
finest in the world, with a great extent
of <lb/>
sea board, and a territory larger than that <lb/>
of Great Britain. Why did not the dele<lb break="no"/>gates urge our importance upon them ?
<lb/>
Suppose this principle were applied to<lb/>
the kingdom of Scotland, as compared to <lb/>
the City of London, with her great
natu<lb break="no"/>ral beauties her mountains, her
valleys <lb/>
and lakes and mines, would the people <lb/>
          
            <cb/>


 have submitted to it for a moment? <lb/>

Would it not be unjust that a whole coun<lb break="no"/>try should have a less representation than <lb/>
a City, merely because her population<lb/>
was less? And shall we be neutralized<lb/>
and equalized by the Cities of Montreal <lb/>
and Quebec. These Cities have as great <lb/>
a population as all New Brunswick. There <lb/>
is one thing that requires explanation, and <lb/>
that is, why the Conference carried on<lb/>
their deliberations in secret conclave ; the<lb/>
hon. President of the Council has very<lb/>
ably referred to this. It is not constitu<lb break="no"/>tional. Look at the history of the United<lb/>
States, and the discussion on the framing<lb/>
of their Constitution. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName>.—Will the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber say that when they were framing the<lb/>
constitution of the United States that they<lb/>
discussed it openly.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName>.—There
might have been<lb/>
some preliminaries that were attended to<lb/>
in secret, but it was openly debated,
but<lb/>
of this Conference at Quebec we are not <lb/>
able to get the opinions of the men who<lb/>
framed the Scheme ; we are shut out from<lb/>
asking the delegates, for they are not now<lb/>
in the House, and they were afraid to<lb/>
bring the matter before the late House.<lb/>
On Section 71, we require some informa<lb break="no"/>tion. It reads thus, ' That Her
Majesty <lb/>
the Queen be solicited to
determine the<lb/>
rank and name of the Federated Provin<lb break="no"/>ces." What does that mean? Was not<lb/>
the idea that we should still be a Colony<lb/>
depending on England? Did they
intend<lb/>
to establish a Viceroy here with all the<lb/>
pomp and circumstance of Royalty ?
<lb/>
Would any man vote for that? Let us not<lb/>
copy after antiquated Europe ; let us copy<lb/>
anything that is beneficial ; but for Hea<lb break="no"/>ven's sake not the antiquated
forms that<lb/>
do no good. Imagine the hon. ex-Sur<lb break="no"/>veyor General, on bended knee kissing the<lb/>
boney hand of a Viceroy ; he would have<lb/>
no objection to kiss a lady's hand, that<lb/>
would be nice enough, but I do not think<lb/>
he would be willing to try the
other. I <lb/>
think these Colonies have a mark to make<lb/>
in History, when they become able to fly<lb/>
their own flag, but that time has not yet<lb/>
arrived. We even now can compare with<lb/>
almost any country save England, France,<lb/>
the United States and perhaps Russia in<lb/>
our commercial importance as
owners of<lb/>
tonnage, and if we had it all within the<lb/>
borders of our own Province it
would be<lb/>
all right ; but with a line to defend from<lb/>
the farther Cape of Newfoundland
to the<lb/>
head waters of Lake Superior,
and a popu<lb break="no"/>lation sparse and scattered along the whole<lb/>
of this line, numbering only some four <lb/>
millions, it would be folly to think of<lb/>
hoisting our own flag and striving to guide<lb/>
the ship of State. Does any one suppose<lb/>
would put up with dictation from
Downing <lb/>
Street? Look at our own House
with<lb/>
only 41 members ; we will not
submit to<lb/>
their dictation in anything that we think<lb/>
is injurious to our inserests ; and would<lb/>
the united Colonies long remain attached <lb/>
to the mother country ? They would not ;<lb/>
we should soon all be "gobbled up" by<lb/>
the neighbouring republic, and I am not<lb/>
prepared as a descendant of the old refu<lb break="no"/>gees, wtth the blood of the Loyalists
in my<lb/>
veins, to be annexed to the United States.<lb/>
And when the time comes for us to go off<lb/>
by ourselves, will this one-sided
Scheme<lb/>
be the one to be adopted ? No :
it
will be<lb/>
one that is fair in every respect. We shall<lb/>
then have a population of some fifteen<lb/>
millions, and then we may heave the an<lb break="no"/>chor, hoist the sails and steer the ship of<lb/>
State without fear of breakers. If this<lb/>
question has not been decided as it has<lb/>
been, the consequences would have been<lb/>
         
            <cb/>

 most
disastrous. The hon. member has <lb/>
referred to the Upper House of twenty-<lb break="yes"/>
four members being able to put a veto<lb/>
upon anything that might prove disadvan<lb break="no"/>tageous. But it is well known that the<lb/>
Upper House cannot always hold out<lb/>
against the people's House ; this has been<lb/>
proved in the House of Lords in England,<lb/>
and at last they must yield. Our very<lb/>
best rights would be jeopardized, and if<lb/>
we have no local rights then why should<lb/>
we keep up a local Parliament here, and<lb/>
another in Nova Scotia ? We have heard<lb/>
of delegations proceeding from Canada, as<lb/>
the most influential of the British North<lb/>
American Colonies, to make known the<lb/>
state of the Provinces, and it seems they<lb/>
wish to bring to bear the powerful influ<lb break="no"/>ence of England, to force us to this<lb/>
Union. They doubtless intend to press<lb/>
the Scheme, and leave room for us to<lb/>
come in afterwards. I think the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment very wise in bringing in their reso<lb break="no"/>lutions, for although they come from an<lb/>
independent member, yet I presume from<lb/>
the remarks of the Hon. President of the<lb/>
Council that the Government sanction it.<lb/>
This is something practical, and although<lb/>
I am opposed to delegations as a general<lb/>
thing, this one under the circumstances<lb/>
has my support, and I think the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will act wisely and well in sending<lb/>
our best men to "frustrate their knavish<lb/>
tricks."</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName>.—The hon. member<lb/>
(Mr. Gilbert) says something about frus<lb break="no"/>trating their knavish tricks, and further<lb/>
says that he has Loyalist blood in his<lb/>
veins ; I think the difference between him<lb/>
and his good old ancestors is, that where<lb break="no"/>as they suffered because they stood by the<lb/>
British Government, their descendant <hi rendition="simple:italic">will<lb/>
not</hi>. With regard to this question, I am<lb/>
only anxious that the people should have<lb/>
a full and clear statement laid before<lb/>
them. The Hon. President of the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, previous to the elections, travelled<lb/>
round through our part of the country<lb/>
expounding his views ; I had no time to<lb/>
reply to him then, and therefore it will be<lb/>
expected that I should do so now in reply<lb/>
to his speech of yesterday. The Hon.<lb/>
President of the Council said our delega<lb break="no"/>tion should have gone to the Conference<lb/>
and returned without pledging themselves<lb/>
to any Scheme.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—I said that it was<lb/>
unprecedented that a constitution should<lb/>
be changed without being submitted to<lb/>
the people. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName>.—Now I do not know<lb/>
what our constitution really is ; I thought<lb/>
we had always been under the British<lb/>
Government and Constitution, and I can<lb break="no"/>not see how the fact of the delegates go<lb break="no"/>ing to Quebec to confer with regard to<lb/>
the management of our local Government<lb/>
can affect the constitution at all. It was<lb/>
all right they admit to go to Charlotte<lb break="no"/>town for this purpose, and why then could<lb/>
they not extend their operations. Since<lb/>
this Province has been under a seperate<lb/>
Government there have been a good many<lb/>
delegations on different subjects, some on<lb/>
a Union of Colonies, some on Rail<lb break="no"/>ways, to one of which the Hon. President<lb/>
of the Council belonged, and I think then<lb/>
the question of Union was discussed ; at<lb/>
any rate I think I can show from the<lb/>
Journals that the question has been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. Nearly all these delegates went<lb/>
without the knowledge of the people or<lb/>
consent of the House, and this is a good<lb/>
precedent. But the delegates to Quebec<lb/>
had authority.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOTS1">Hon. Mr. BOTSFORD</persName>.—Sir. R. G. Mac-<lb break="yes"/>
Donnell says they had not, and Mr. Card-<lb break="yes"/>
well agrees with him.<lb/>

<p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr.
MCCLELLAN</persName> —Another point dwelt<lb/>
upon was the origin of the idea
of a Union<lb/>
of the Colonies. I do not know whether<lb/>
he refers to the difference in the race and<lb/>
creed of the Canadians. He quotes from <lb/>
Mr. Galt's speech, and says these difficul<lb break="no"/>ties were sufficient in themselves-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—No ; I said that the<lb/>
idea was form from these difficulties.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName>.—He
said the difficul<lb break="no"/>ties were sufficient in themselves to bring <lb/>
this about, but it might have been <hi rendition="simple:italic">lapsus<lb/>
linguce</hi>. But let us look at the
opinion of<lb/>
the Lower Canadians on this point. Mr.<lb/>
McClellan here read from Cartier's speech,<lb/>
who is a Frenchman himself, to show that<lb/>
the difference of races and religions was <lb/>
an additional argument in favour of Union; <lb/>
thus merging everything in one
general<lb/>
rally around one general constitutional<lb/>
Government, filled from petty
sectarian, or<lb/>
national, factious, impediments and en<lb break="no"/>tanglements. That I think is a much<lb/>
higher view to take than to bring it
down<lb/>
to a matter of creed and races, and to get<lb/>
her out of her difficulties while we incur <lb/>
none ourselves by this great Union. It is <lb/>
somewhat embarrassing to rise and speak<lb/>
for Confederation, for we may be charged<lb/>
with being actuated by selfish motives
; it <lb/>
may be said that we are looking toward<lb/>
Ottawa. I should like to see the Hon. <lb/>
President of the Council at Ottawa. for I<lb/>
am sure his abilities would shine there,<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> and I think he would gain a wider and a  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> higher view of the wants of these Colo<lb break="no"/>nies. It is a poor principle, however, to <lb/>
refuse great national benefits, because<lb/>
some personal benefit may arise from it.<lb/>
If this principle were to hold then all<lb/>
would be precluded from doing anything<lb/>
for the good of mankind. But all these<lb/>
charges of ambitious and selfish motives<lb/>
need not be confined to one side. May<lb/>
we not also ask if the Hon.
President of <lb/>
the Council did not in the position he took,<lb/>
see his present seat looming up in the <lb/>
distance ? I say nothing against it ; I am<lb/>
glad to see him there, and should like to<lb/>
see him higher, but I do not
like to see<lb/>
him in his present company. Is he not as <lb/>
open to these kind a charges as these <lb/>
delegates ? Did not some other office
<lb/>
even than that he now occupies open up <lb/>
before him ? And I do not blame him if<lb/>
it did. I do not say it was so,
but simply<lb/>
that he is as open to such charges as<lb/>
others. He says the Government was un<lb break="no"/>popular ; why not say that they
were a <lb/>
dead weight on Confederation ? And that <lb/>
if as they went down the great talents of <lb/>
my hon. and learned friend were to be <lb/>
called up, there would be chance opened<lb/>
for many for office and emolument ; I
say<lb/>
this might have been if the principle he<lb/>
enunciates be true. Although this ques<lb break="no"/>tion has been a long time before the<lb/>
mother country, yet it has only
been a <lb/>
short time before our people, and to take<lb/>
up a great principle and oppose it on the<lb/>
simple basis of taxation is
certainly tak<lb break="no"/>ing advantage of the ignorance
and credu<lb break="no"/>lity of the people. This argument of the<lb/>
opponents of the Scheme had its weight.<lb/>
And then in the southern part of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince the people were vary much
guided<lb/>
by ecclesiastical influences ; for although <lb/>
the Archbishop of Halifax had boldly come<lb/>
out and declared in favor of the Scheme, <lb/>
yet by some means or other the priests in<lb/>
the southern part of the Province at least<lb/>
were combined to use their influence over<lb/>
the people to vote against it.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> (This proposition was denied by <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon.<lb/>
Mr. Anglin</persName> on the part of the Catholic<lb/>
Clergy of St. John, and by <persName ref="pers:LAND1">Mr. Landry</persName> on<lb/>

            </p>

            <cb/>
            
<p>My impression at any rate is that such<lb/>
was the case. I do not wish to utter a<lb/>
word against that body, but I do believe<lb/>
that a strong and combined effort was put<lb/>
forth to get the people to oppose it. I<lb/>
do not say, and I do not believe that it<lb/>
was general, for I know many intelligent<lb/>
and respectable men of that church who<lb/>
were favourable to it.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:DESB2">Mr. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName>.—I would ask<lb/>
if the clergymen of other denominations<lb/>
used their influence in favor of the<lb/>
Scheme? I know they did.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr.
MCCLELLAN</persName>.—They might have<lb/>
done so, and if the hon member knows<lb/>
that such was the case he need not have<lb/>
asked.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>(At this stage there was considerable<lb/>
disorder arising from a regular round of<lb/>
calls to order as one member after anoth<lb break="no"/>er stood up to say something with regard<lb/>
to the length of the speeches of different<lb/>
members, and the state of feeling which<lb/>
should be exhibited by the supporters of<lb/>
the Government toward the small opposi<lb break="no"/>tion, at the close of which Mr. Wetmore<lb/>
remarked that if hon. members choose to<lb/>
go outside and get crammed and plugged<lb/>
with what to say indoors, he did not know<lb/>
that other hon. members need to put<lb/>
themselves out at all to listen, but the<lb/>
speakers could get the plugging out as<lb/>
best they could. The Reporter was in<lb/>
his place and that was enough.—REPOR<lb break="no"/>TER.)</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr.
MCCLELLAN</persName>.—I do not know what<lb/>
the hon. member for the City of Saint<lb/>
John means by cramming and plugging,<lb/>
but from such expressions becoming fre<lb break="no"/>quent of late and appearing in the Re<lb break="no"/>ports, I am getting used to it. He can<lb break="no"/>not stifle free discussion in this House, if<lb/>
such did prevail at elections. It seems to<lb/>
be inferred that all who are opposed to<lb/>
Confederation must necessarily be in fa<lb break="no"/>vor of these Resolutions. Now although<lb/>
there may be a majority here against the<lb/>
Scheme, yet they may not all be willing to<lb/>
appoint the delegation, as the people of<lb/>
England by the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> and the action of<lb/>
this country know all about it. There<lb/>
may be many who may think the state of<lb/>
the country will not admit of these splen<lb break="no"/>did delegations. We heard that we were<lb/>
not to have so many of them as hereto<lb break="no"/>fore, but the anxiety to have one now ap<lb break="no"/>pointed puts me in mind of a boy going<lb/>
through a churchyard and whistling to<lb/>
keep his courage up. It seems as though<lb/>
after all the apparent carelessness as to<lb/>
the result that there was a feeling lest<lb/>
Confederation was not quite dead yet, or<lb/>
at least that it might after all rise up and<lb/>
frighten them. I do not know who the<lb/>
delegates will be, probably the hon. Pre<lb break="no"/>sident of the Council and the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from Saint John, (Mr. Anglin) will be<lb/>
among them, and if so it may be as well<lb/>
for the one to visit the home of his child<lb break="no"/>hood and the familiar scenes that will be<lb/>
presented to him there, the other may<lb/>
perhaps go to Paris, where he would have<lb/>
a very nice time of course, and all at the<lb/>
people's expense. The Resolutions now<lb/>
under discussion clearly affirm that the<lb/>
judgment of the people has been pro<lb break="no"/>nounced, and that Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has been apprised of the fact, and<lb/>
it goes on to ask the appointment of a<lb/>
delegation to go home to tell them again. I<lb/>
will now read a little article I have here,<lb/>
transcribed from the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> to<lb/>
the columns of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Freeman</hi> with the com<lb break="no"/>ments of A ?
an hon. correspondent who<lb/>
does not report the remarks of members<lb/>
always fairly or correctly : " Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion comes to us from the Colonies and it<lb/>
is for the Colonies to decide upon it. We<lb/>
          
            <cb/>
   
cannot coerce the New Brunswickers into <lb/>
a new political union, nor can
we object <lb/>
to their remaining in the
position which <lb/>
they have so long occupied without com<lb break="no"/>plaint on our part or theirs." The hon. <lb/>
member, (Mr. Anglin) quoted the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, <lb/>
to justify his position. I give the above, as <lb/>
his own quotation too—a complete
offset. <lb/>
The hon. President says the sayings of  <lb/>
public
men can be properly referred to. <lb/>He was a public man in 1857, and what
<lb/>
did he then say in this House of Mr. Til- <lb break="yes"/>
ley,
when that gentleman had been reject<lb break="no"/>ed by his constituents on another question.<lb/>
He (Mr.Smith) deeply regretted the ab<lb break="no"/>sence from office of the late Provincial<lb/>
Secretary, Mr. Tilley. To that gentle<lb break="no"/>man, who was now within his hearing—so <lb/>
was he yesterday—he would offer no eulo<lb break="no"/>gism ; but this he would say, his absence <lb/>
from the office was a great loss, and was <lb/>
so regarded throughout the whole Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, where his talent and honesty were <lb/>
known and recognized. <hi rendition="simple:italic">Was it such a <lb/>
man who would lend himself to the
syste<lb break="no"/>matic ruin of the Province ?</hi> or
were hon. <lb/>
members to be told by the political pro<lb break="no"/>teous who now held the office that
Mr. <lb/>
Tilley was not fit to discharge his duty, <lb/>
&amp;c.. &amp;c." What change has "come over <lb/>
the spirit of his dreams,"- -the political <lb/>
proteus, his colleague now, is converted <lb/>
into a miracle of finance, and the Hon. <lb/>
Mr. Tilley has been plotting and conspir<lb break="no"/>ing to enslave
his native country ! It is <lb/>
perfectly understood that
Confederation <lb/>
will not be forced on this
country, and yet <lb/>
I heard an hon. member say that
unless <lb/>
a delegation were sent Home
this con<lb break="no"/>spiracy would have its effect, and the <lb/>
country would be enslaved. I can
im<lb break="no"/>agine my hon. friend going to
Fishmonger <lb/>
Hall and making his mark there ; but I <lb/>
hope if they go they will tell not only the <lb/>
truth, but the whole truth. Tell them <lb/>
that the number of Anti-Confederate <lb/>
members in this House does not corres<lb break="no"/>pond with the feeling on the question in <lb/>
the country. I hope that they
will show <lb/>
that there were not over six hundred <lb/>
votes majority against the Scheme in the <lb/>
late elections, and that many of those who <lb/>
opposed it then have since changed their <lb/>
views. This is the case I know in Albert ; <lb/>
I find, in conversation with intelligent <lb/>
men, that it is so in Fredericton, and I <lb/>
hear it is the same in many other parts of <lb/>
the country. I hope they will tell the <lb/>
people of England and Ireland, or where-
<lb break="yes"/>
ever they go, that the people of
this <lb/>
Province are not such fools as to reject <lb/>
Colonial Union—a Union upheld by all <lb/>
the colonists of distinction
for the past <lb/>
half century. The Hon. Joseph Howe <lb/>
has always stood up for this Union, and <lb/>
so has Judge Johnston, a man of the <lb/>
highest attainment.<lb/>
I may here advert to a remark of Lord <lb/>
Durham, to show that a Colonial Union <lb/>
was necessary in the opinion of that
<lb/>
eminent constitutionist, in order to rid <lb/>
the separate colonies of the
disorders <lb/>
arising from the influence of designing <lb/>
and ambitious individuals, as by afford<lb break="no"/>ing a large scope for the desires of such <lb/>
men as shall direct their ambition into <lb/>
the legitimate character of
furthering, <lb/>
and not of thwarting, their
Government. <lb/>
" By creating high prizes, in a
general <lb/>
and responsible Government, we
shall <lb/>
immediately afford the means of pacify<lb break="no"/>ing the turbulent ambitious, and
of em<lb break="no"/>ploying,
in worthy and noble occupa<lb break="no"/>tions, the talents which are now only<lb/>
exerted to foment disorder." I am <lb/>
anxious to give my friend, the President <lb/>
of the Council, a wider scope for
his <lb/>
powers and ability, and I hope
that he <lb/>

Brunswick get the best of the bargain.<lb/>
The hon. President quotes Galt's speech<lb/>
at Sherbrooke, to shew the origin of the<lb/>
movement, which proves nothing, un<lb break="no"/>less it be that to remove a social or po<lb break="no"/>litical evil existing amongst our Cana<lb break="no"/>dian fellow-colonists without at the<lb/>
same time injuring ourselves, forms an<lb/>
objectionable feature. Surely the hon.<lb/>
member ought to attach great weight to<lb/>
the arguments of Mr. Dorion, who, like<lb/>
himself, has the <hi rendition="simple:italic">patriotism</hi> to oppose<lb/>
British interests, and Colonial pro<lb break="no"/>gress. A fellow-feeling ought to make<lb/>
them co-incident in opinion, if not<lb/>
wondrous kind to each other. An<lb break="no"/>other objection taken was, the Bills<lb/>
framed by the local Legislatures would<lb/>
be liable to be disallowed by the Gener<lb break="no"/>al Government. I do not see the point<lb/>
of this objection, as our local bills may<lb/>
now be disallowed by a power farther<lb/>
off, and whereas in the General Govern<lb break="no"/>ment we should have representatives to<lb/>
explain and support them, in England<lb/>
we have none at all. Then another, ob<lb break="no"/>jection was, a large expenditure of<lb/>
money would be made on canals in Can<lb break="no"/>ada. It is evident, however, that this is<lb/>
entirely dependent on the state of the<lb/>
finances ; it is not made a basis of the<lb/>
scheme, but a subject for future consid<lb break="no"/><cb/>eration. It may be found necessary to<lb/>
extend the canals of Western Canada,<lb/>
but the lines would all be taken away,<lb/>
and we should not look upon Canada or<lb/>
New Brunswick, but upon one great<lb/>
united country. The hon. member has<lb/>
further said that our voice will not be<lb/>
heard in Canada ; but taking our repre<lb break="no"/>sentatives in both branches our voices<lb/>
would be something after all, and then<lb/>
we shall have more there after a while,<lb/>
for our increase of population is 3 per<lb/>
cent, while that of Lower Canada is only<lb/>
2 1-2 per cent. And then there is no<lb/>
danger of our being swamped by West<lb break="no"/>ern Canada. How has it been in the<lb/>
United States? Where does the popu<lb break="no"/>lation centre and increase most? Is it<lb/>
not on the sterile sea coasts? There the<lb/>
manufactories arise, there the mechanics<lb/>
and artizans congregate, whilst the<lb/>
great and fertile interior is given up to<lb/>
the pursuits of agriculture. The hon.<lb/>
President of the Council further said<lb/>
that our railway would, before long, be<lb/>
likely to pay per cent interest, and it<lb/>
would be folly to give this up. He must<lb/>
think the country is improving very<lb/>
fast, and that the population is also in<lb break="no"/>creasing. I want these delegates, who<lb/>
go home, to tell them in Downing Street<lb/>
the truth and the whole truth, to tell the<lb/>
views of the people of this Province,<lb/>
and the means used by the Antis to carry<lb/>
our their purposes. Tell them that in<lb/>
the Upper House there is a large majori<lb break="no"/>ty, men of the highest respectability,<lb/>
who are in favor of this scheme. I do<lb/>
not know how they regard this branch<lb/>
of the Legislature, but I think they de<lb break="no"/>serve the thanks of this people. To<lb break="no"/>day I learn that the third Government<lb/>
Bill this Session has been laid aside by<lb/>
that body. There was the Banking Bill,<lb/>
the result of twenty years study, sum<lb break="no"/>marily disposed of ; then the Treasury<lb/>
Note Bill, that wheel-barrow steam en<lb break="no"/>gine, double-back-action, money-pro<lb break="no"/>ducing machine, is thrown out, as it<lb/>
ought to have been, and now the Post<lb/>
Office Bill, that was to move the office<lb/>
to St. John, and save so much money<lb/>
to the country. I want the delegates to<lb/>
tell them that that House has a large<lb/>
majority in favor of Confederation. The<lb/>
hon. member says our railroad is good<lb/>
to give up, but he says nothing of the<lb/>
the value of public works in Canada. He<lb/>
does not speak of their 234 miles of<lb/>
canals, costing $16,000,000 ; the Vic<lb break="no"/>toria Bridge, costing $10,000,000 ; the<lb/>
lines of railway, 2000 miles ; their navi<lb break="no"/>gable lakes ; their 4000 miles of tele<lb break="no"/>graph &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—Does the hon.<lb/>

member mean to say that the railways<lb/>
in Canada would belong to the General<lb/>
Government?</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName>.—Let me get through.<lb/>
I wish to say that these are all great pub<lb break="no"/>lic works in Canada in which the people<lb/>
have an interest. Another remark was<lb/>
about the Conference being carried on<lb/>
with closed doors. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> ( <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName> here quoted from<lb/>
" Guizot's Life of Washington," to prove<lb/>
that the Convention of America, held their<lb/>
consultations with closed doors.)</p>
            <p>But we need not look to the United<lb/>
States for a precedent, the same thing is<lb/>
done in all countries when any change is<lb/>
considered requisite in the form of the<lb/>
Constitution, and the hon. President of<lb/>
the Council would have had closed doors<lb/>
too if he had been a delegate. And if it<lb/>
be wrong to hold secret sessions on mat<lb break="no"/>ters of this nature, why not have the doors<lb/>
         
            <cb/>
   
of the Executive Council thrown open, so<lb/>
as to let the people know all that is go<lb break="no"/>ing on? Now about the bearing of the<lb/>
Union on the country financially. My<lb/>
friends Mr. McMillan has taken up and<lb/>
treated on it length. Mr. Dorion thinks<lb/>
New Brunswick would get the best of the<lb/>
not most important part of the Scheme.<lb/>
We should be all fellow-colonists, and if<lb/>
one man gets a few more cents than ano<lb break="no"/>ther it is not worth talking about. In the<lb/>
consideration of such a question as this,<lb/>
I hold that taking into consideration the<lb/>
deductions that will be made, that we<lb/>
shall have enough to carry on the Gene<lb break="no"/>ral Government without taxing the peo<lb break="no"/>ple more than a few cents a head more,<lb/>
and this not worthy to be thought of<lb/>
when we look at the great principles of<lb/>
trade and defence relying upon it. These<lb/>
are the higher magnitude and more worthy<lb/>
of the attention of statesmen. I think<lb/>
that even without the Intercolonial Rail<lb break="no"/>road, it will be shown that we should<lb/>
have the best of the bargain, yet when we<lb/>
remember that we are to get over 200<lb/>
miles of this road built through the heart<lb/>
of our country, it is sufficient argument<lb/>
against any cry of taxation that has been<lb/>
raised. It may do at election times, and<lb/>
people may be influenced by it for a time,<lb/>
but when they learn that the amount we<lb/>
are to pay for a Steamer on the North<lb/>
Shore is about as much as our share of<lb/>
interest on the amount that would carry<lb/>
on the work of road, they will change<lb/>
their views. The hon. member for St.<lb/>
John spoke of the remarks he made at the<lb/>
dinner given to the Canadians at Stubb's<lb/>
hotel, where he said that they need not<lb/>
interpret the feelings of the people of the<lb/>
Province as favorable to a Union by the<lb/>
demonstrations with which they were re<lb break="no"/>ceived ; but did he not go on to say, what<lb/>
is stated as a fact, that he further observ<lb break="no"/>ed that we must either have Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion or Annexation ?<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.—I did not say it.</p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName>.—It was so reported,<lb/>
and I did not hear that it had ever been<lb/>
denied, or that it was susceptible of de<lb break="no"/>nial. But now Confederation is to be<lb/>
killed, and we are to have a Western<lb/>
Railroad to assist in carrying us into the<lb/>
United States. I am not averse to Wes<lb break="no"/>tern Extension, but I do wish to have the<lb/>
Intercolonial road, when it can be built at<lb/>
so small a cost.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—Where will Canada<lb/>
get money to build ?<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. MCCLELLAN</persName>.—Where is the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment going to get money to carry on<lb/>
public works now, the Banking Bill is de<lb break="no"/>feated? I might go on to speak of the<lb/>
influences brought to bear on our electo<lb break="no"/>ral franchise, and our little country, not<lb/>
larger in proportion than many towns in<lb/>
England, while with the smaller Provinces<lb/>
the same still more applies. When there<lb/>
are so few offices, and so many to fill<lb/>
them ; when there are so many members<lb/>
in the Government, and each wanting to<lb/>
be a general, it shows that we need a<lb/>
larger House ; where everything of a gen<lb break="no"/>eral interest to the Colonies could be dis<lb break="no"/>cussed without party or money interests,<lb/>
and be carried out on the plan of the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish Government, which has been found to<lb/>
work so well. The Hon. President of the<lb/>
Council referred to the four corners of the<lb/>
Constitution. I don't know exactly what<lb/>
that means, nor how it is made up, but<lb/>
perhaps it may be that one is the Military<lb/>
corner in the person of the Hon. Attorney<lb/>
General ; the Social corner represented<lb/>
by the Hon. Chief Commissioner of the<lb/>
Board of Works ; Financial corner per<lb break="no"/><pb n="129" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-06-02_Page_129.jpg"/> <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> <fw type="num">129</fw>sonified by the hon. member for St. John,<lb/>

who introduced the Treasury Note
Bill ;<lb/>
 and the Patriotic corner so ably
repre<lb break="no"/>sented by the other hon. member for St.<lb/>
John in the Government. It will be seen <lb/>
the Council, and the Hon. Provincial<lb/>
Secretary ; they are not corner stones, and<lb/>
should not be in it at all, and I hope they<lb/>
will attach themselves to some other party<lb/>
and work in a different manner—more in<lb/>
accordance with their political antecedents.<lb/>
But there is a military point of view in<lb/>
which this matter should be viewed. I<lb/>
trust there will be no difficulty with the<lb/>
United States ; I have favored the North<lb/>
all through their struggle, but we all<lb/>
know that the Americans are avaricious of<lb/>
increased territory. We know that un<lb break="no"/>der the Ashburton Treaty they took a<lb/>
good slice off us, and that would not have<lb/>
been done it we had been united. Then<lb/>
on the Pacific Coast it was the same, and<lb/>
now they are casting longing eyes and<lb/>
would very much like to get a slice of the<lb/>
fertile belt of the Red River Settlement.<lb/>
They have 10,000 miles of Railways pro<lb break="no"/>jected, and it is stretching out to cover<lb/>
the continent ; but if united these en<lb break="no"/>croachments would cease at least in our<lb/>
direction.</p>

 <!-- GL, 2016-11-01, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

           <!-- <p> SATURDAY, June 3rd.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. MCCLELLAN resumed.—There<lb/>
were some remarks made by my hon.<lb/>
friend from Charlotte, (Dr. Thomson)<lb/>
during the interruption yesterday, in re<lb break="no"/>ference to as statement I had made about<lb/>
the influence of the clergy at the late<lb/>
elections. I did not design any disre<lb break="no"/>spect to any denomination, and do not<lb/>
think any member could say I made use<lb/>
of offensive language at all. My hon.<lb/>
and learned friend from the City of St.<lb/>
John, (Mr. Wetmore) during the inter<lb break="no"/>ruption, made some covert insinuation,<lb/>
that members who undertook to address<lb/>
this House after having been crammed<lb/>
the night before, were not entitled to<lb/>
great consideration. I did not clearly<lb/>
understand the inuendo at the time, at<lb/>
first I thought he referred to the splen<lb break="no"/>did social affair at the Exhibition build<lb break="no"/>ing the night before, and possibly the<lb/>
hon. member himself may have satisfied<lb/>
himself to expletion on that occasion,<lb/>
as for me, I was not present, and did not<lb/>
participate in those festivities. If he<lb/>
referred to intellectual as cramming, I<lb/>
can only tell him confidentially, for this<lb/>
matter does not concern the public at all,<lb/>
that on his part it is all a matter of fancy,<lb/>
not of fact. It is better for hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers to express themselves frankly and<lb/>
openly, and not deal in such ambiguous<lb/>
allusions, and if my hon. and learned<lb/>
friend thinks he can suppress discussion<lb/>
by interruptions of that kind he is very<lb/>
much mistaken ; it may be well to resist<lb/>
discussion upon important questions at<lb/>
an election, but it will not be so easy to<lb/>
strangle free discussion on the floors of<lb/>
the Legislature. My learned friend<lb/>
(the Dr.) has taken occasion to proclaim<lb/>
himself a representative of the Tory ele<lb break="no"/>ment ; he frankly avows his sentiments ;<lb/>
he said the duties and attributes of Tories<lb/>
were to " fear God, honor the King, and<lb/>
deal uprightly with all men" ; and it was<lb/>
upon that his political principles were<lb/>
founded. I recollect a story told to il<lb break="no"/>lustrate the principles of toryism. A<lb/>
Tory was represented as being like a<lb/>
toad which had been buried in the solid<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> rock for a hundred years, but upon ex<lb break="no"/>posing him to the light of day and the<lb/>
vivifying beams of the sun he would,<lb/>
with twinkling eyes, pop out from his<lb/>
hiding place to the other toads, his com<lb break="no"/>peers, and perfectly oblivious of the fact<lb/>
that he is a hundred years behind the<lb/>
age. I do not wish to apply this to the<lb/>
learned Dr. from Charlotte. I am not<lb/>
saying that he is hopping along with<lb/>
the other toadies. I merely refer to this<lb/>
to show the sentiments and principles<lb/>
of Torryism. The resolution before you<lb/>
says Confederation will be politically,<lb/>
commercially and financially injurious<lb/>
to this Province. I shall not speak now<lb/>
upon the financial part of the subject,<lb/>
because that has been gone into by the<lb/>
hon. gentlemen from Carleton and Res-<lb break="maybe"/>
tigouche. I think that aspect of the<lb/>
question has been met, and the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion to the measure have failed to show<lb/>
such results would follow this union as<lb/>
would justify the appointment of this<lb/>
delegation. I feel confident that Con<lb break="no"/>federation can be sustained upon finan<lb break="no"/>cial grounds alone, without regard to<lb/>
the benefits arising from the construc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Inter-colonial railway, which<lb/>
gives us 200 miles of railway, bringing<lb/>
the traffic of the West into New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. Immense advantages will flow<lb/>
from that road, uniting, as it does, the<lb/>
coal fields of the Eastern section with<lb/>
the metaliferous regions of the Western<lb/>
part of the Province and Canada. This<lb/>
road is not to be built with our own<lb/>
money, but the money of a people who<lb/>
have beeen denominated by many in this<lb/>
House as strangers. They are not<lb/>
strangers, but brother colonists, united<lb/>
and bound one colony to another. We<lb/>
should have that feeling of regard for<lb/>
them as would induce us to legislate<lb/>
for their interests as well as our own.<lb/>
It is the correct principle for any peo<lb break="no"/>ple to so legislate that they will place<lb/>
themselves in a position to buy in the<lb/>
cheapest market and sell in the dearest.<lb/>
This road will not only give us an ex<lb break="no"/>tended market, but will enable us to re<lb break="no"/>ceive the surplus productions of West<lb break="no"/>ern Canada ; it will produce benefits of<lb/>
which we have at present no conception.<lb/>
A person would suppose from listening<lb/>
to the remarks of some of the hon<lb break="no"/>orable gentlemen that they wished to<lb/>
re-enact the old protection laws, which<lb/>
were abolished years ago. They<lb/>
tell us that those men who signed a<lb/>
document in St. John expressing their<lb/>
views on this question, were men of no<lb/>
influence. They were men doing a large<lb/>
business, and were favorable to the exten<lb break="no"/>sion of the principles of free trade and<lb/>
fair competition with their neighbours, for<lb/>
they felt confidence in the resources of<lb/>
New Brunswick. The Hon. President of<lb/>
the Council alluded to a statement which<lb/>
I had made, that in six months there would<lb/>
be a change in the opinions of the people<lb/>
on this question, and there would be a<lb/>
large majority of the people of this coun<lb break="no"/>try in favor of Confederation ; he took the<lb/>
opposite ground, and did not believe that<lb/>
this would be the case. I said " try it."<lb/>
he answered that the cause of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion was desperate, and we were willing<lb/>
to try anything. I did not in my allusion<lb/>
refer to a dissolution of the House, but I<lb/>
referred to putting the matter before the<lb/>
country as a distinct question, outside of<lb/>
party difficulties and troubles altogether,<lb/>
so that the people could vote yea or nay<lb/>
upon the question, free from the entangle<lb break="no"/>ments of politics ; if it was so submitted,<lb/>
and means of instruction afforded them<lb/>
upon this question, I said they would have<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> a two-thirds majority in a very short time<lb/>
in favor of this measure. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber says that was my opinion before ; I<lb/>
says I never was very sanguine of carrying<lb/>
this question before, for I knew the<lb/>
strength and ability of my learned friend<lb/>
—I knew his declamation powers—I knew<lb/>
his influence in the County of Albert, and<lb/>
I feared the effect of that declamation ;<lb/>
but in that County they took hold of the<lb/>
question and sifted it to the bottom, and<lb/>
they came to the conclusion that Confed<lb break="no"/>eration would build up this country, and<lb/>
it would prove a benefit to them whether<lb/>
they were miners, farmers, or fishermen.<lb/>
My hon. friend says my eyes were in Ot<lb break="no"/>tawa. I can tell him that I had no aspira<lb break="no"/>tions of that kind. I had no idea of go<lb break="no"/>ing into a new arena, but was content to<lb/>
serve my country in that Legislature,<lb/>
which, to adopt their own style of argu<lb break="no"/>ments, would be a mere municipality ;<lb/>
therefore, I cannot see how they can stig<lb break="no"/>matize as being actuated by any views<lb/>
of self-aggrandizement. He has put for<lb break="no"/>ward his great magnanimity in resigning<lb/>
his large salary and giving up a high posi<lb break="no"/>tion to protect the country from a great<lb/>
infliction, as he expressed it a that time ;<lb/>
and he considers that a reason why the<lb/>
people should give him credit for being<lb/>
the most patriotic man in the country.<lb/>
Although I never was in a position to<lb/>
give up a salary, or an office, yet I have<lb/>
been in a position to refuse to accept of<lb/>
one ; when parties were evenly balanced<lb/>
in this Legislature, I was offered one of<lb/>
the highest positions in the country, if I<lb/>
would desert my political principles, but<lb/>
I felt that while men were only for the<lb/>
passing hour, principles were undying. I<lb/>
hope that when this delegation—or this<lb/>
little pleasure excursion—goes to Eng<lb break="no"/>land at the expense of both Confederates<lb/>
and Anti-Confederates, they will repre<lb break="no"/>sent to the British Government the true<lb/>
state of feeling in this country, had state<lb/>
that a large majority of the other branch<lb/>
of the Legislature are in favor of the<lb/>
Scheme. When they arrive in England<lb/>
they will receive very little sympathy<lb/>
from the English people, or ministry. The<lb/>
British Government will reply to them in<lb/>
this way : "Gentlemen, we knew this be<lb break="no"/>fore ; we have received information that<lb/>
the people of New Brunswick have reject<lb break="no"/>ed this Union, therefore we do not see the<lb/>
object of your mission." After they have<lb/>
received this rebuff they had better<lb/>
lengthen their excursion, and go to Africa.<lb/>
There, according to Dr. Livingston or<lb/>
Capt. Spoke, they will find little kingdoms<lb/>
with about 20,000 inhabitants holding<lb/>
their Courts with all the ceremony of lar<lb break="no"/>ger kingdoms, their interests all being<lb/>
centered in themselves, each one of these<lb/>
having its own peculiar habits and cus<lb break="no"/>toms, and it is their particular care to<lb/>
keep these distinctions up. There they<lb/>
will find the exact exemplification of the<lb/>
principles enunciated here. They are not<lb/>
willing to break down the barriers of trade<lb/>
and carry out the principles of liberalism<lb/>
and reform, neither are they willing to<lb/>
unite these Colonies and make them the<lb/>
germ of a mighty nation. They are not<lb/>
willing to do what would advance our best<lb/>
interests and prove a lasting benefit ; for<lb/>
to unite would prove a benefit whether we<lb/>
remain as a great Colonial Confederacy<lb/>
united under the British Government, or<lb/>
whether we adopt the other alternative<lb/>
and drift into Annexation. I can imagine<lb/>
the feelings of this delegation on their re<lb break="no"/>turn, after finding the matter had been<lb/>
fairly discussed in the House of Commons.<lb/>
Homeward bound, they will repeat the old<lb/>
nursery rhyme:—
