            </head>
            <p>After the Journals were read, His<lb/>Honor the Speaker remarked that it was<lb/>unnecessary to proceed with the third<lb/>reading of the Bills before them, because<lb/>there would be no time for the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council to assent to them, as the<lb/>duct. He would now call attention to<lb/>o'clock.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName>, in resuming, said he un<lb break="no"/>derstood that the Government had conde<lb break="no"/>scended to give him permission to reply<lb/>to a speech made by a member of the<lb/>Government in the Legislative Council,<lb/>which was an attack upon him. He<lb/>trusted that they would not exercise and<lb/>prostitute the prerogative of the Crown<lb/>to prevent any person speaking upon a<lb/>point upon which they feel they have a<lb/>right to speak. (Mr. Wilmot said that<lb/>he had not been informed that the House<lb/>was to be prorogued at three o'clock.)<lb/>Mr. Smith said that showed the way the<lb/>business was carried on. The leader of<lb/>the Government states—after the an<lb break="no"/>nouncement made by you—that he does<lb/>not know that this House is to be pro<lb break="no"/>rogued at three o'clock. Who governs<lb/>the country, the Governor or his consti<lb break="no"/>tutional advisers ? It is extraordinary<lb/>that we have had no announcement made<lb/>yet whether the public departments are<lb/>filled or not, although it is nearly a week<lb/>since the late Government resigned. This<lb/>conduct cannot be justified. Responsible<lb/>Government, which took us so long to<lb/>win, and which we have cherished with<lb/>such jealous care, seems to be laid pros<lb break="no"/>trate before the power of despotism, and<lb/>we are told by His Excellency that it<lb/>was the result of accident. If the people<lb/>have an opportunity of having a voice in<lb/>this question, they will try to bring it<lb/>back again. He (Mr. S) had been told<lb/>that he had been charged by a member<lb/>of the Government in the Upper House<lb/>with an act of discourtesy to Captain<lb/>Hallowes. It was said that the Govern<lb break="no"/>or's answer to their resignation delivered<lb/>to him by Captain Hallows, was to be re<lb break="no"/>turned. We sent in our resignations at<lb/>one P. M. on Tuesday, and did not get an<lb/>acceptance of it until Thursday at 6½<lb/>P. M. The next day they met to prepare<lb/>an answer to it, and while there, Captain<lb/>Hallowes came and requested him to re<lb break="no"/>turn the paper. He (Mr. S.) replied<lb/>
           

            <cb/>
    

that they wanted the paper in order to<lb/>prepare their answer, which it would take<lb/> <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>which his Excellency wished to make,<lb/>taking them away with him and seeming<lb/>satisfied, for he made no complaint. It<lb/>is a novel proceeding to ask for a paper<lb/>of that importance to be returned while<lb/>the controversy was going on, but the<lb/>most remarkable thing is that one paper<lb/>was sent to them, and a different one was<lb/>published in the Royal Gazette, in which<lb/>material alterations had been made.<lb/>That very night another paper, in which<lb/>other alterations were made, was tele<lb break="no"/>graphed through to St. John without<lb/>waiting for their answer, and for this the<lb/>public will have to pay. Should that pa<lb break="no"/>per, in which serious charges were made<lb/>against him, have been published in the<lb/>Royal Gazette without his reply? He<lb/>would leave it to the House and country<lb/>to said if that was fair. In reference to<lb/>Responsible Government, he would read<lb/>a passage from His Excellency's commu<lb break="no"/>nication as published in the Royal Ga<lb break="no"/>zette :<lb/>
            </p>

    
   <quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     " His Excellency may be in error, but 
     <lb/>he believes that a vast change has alrea<lb break="no"/>dy taken place in the opinions held on<lb/>this subject in New Brunswick. He ful<lb break="no"/>ly anticipates that the House of Assembly<lb/>will yet return a response to the commu<lb break="no"/>nication made to them not less favorable<lb/>to the principle of Union than that given<lb/>by the Upper House."<lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     They were elected upon the anti-Con<lb break="no"/>federate ticket, and His Excellency ex<lb break="no"/>presses the hope that they will be recreant<lb/>to their trust, and that they will, like the<lb/>Legislative Council, pass an Address<lb/>adopting the Quebec Scheme, and ask<lb/>Her Majesty to force it upon the people<lb/>of this country by Imperial Legislation.<lb/>His Excellency goes on to say :<lb/>
            </p>
   
<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>
     " In any event he relies with confidence 
     <lb/>on the desire of a great majority of the<lb/>people of the Province to aid in building<lb/>up a powerful and prosperous nation un<lb break="no"/>der the sovereignty of the British Crown.<lb/>To their verdict His Excellency is ready<lb/>and willing to appeal."<lb/>
            </p></quote>
   
            <p>
     This last clause was not in the manu<lb break="no"/>script submitted to the Government. One<lb/>paper was given to them, another publish<lb break="no"/>ed in the Gazette, and another sent to<lb/>St. John, and these three were all differ-<lb break="yes"/>end. There is no justification for these<lb/>alterations. In another part he says :<lb/>
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>" The Lieutenant Governor, of course,<lb/>feels that previous communication be<lb break="no"/>tween himself and his advisers as to any<lb/>step he is about to take, is, when prac<lb break="no"/>ticable, both desirable and essential."<lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>The word essential seems to imply that<lb/>it was his duty to consult his Council,<lb/>but that word is not in the manuscript<lb/>submitted to them, but has been substi<lb break="no"/>tuted for the word <hi rendition="simple:italic">convenient</hi>.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> said there was a very<lb/>rough copy of the original kept, which<lb/>was the reason His Excellency wished it<lb/>sent back in order that they could have a <lb/>copy of it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR WILLISTON said that if he right<lb break="no"/>ly understood Mr. Smith he agreed at the<lb/>time to give the paper back.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said he told Captain Hal<lb break="no"/>
          

            <cb/>
        
lowes that he could not return it, as an<lb/>answer had to be prepared to it. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency goes on to make other directions.<lb/>He says :
            </p>

<quote rendition="tccd:blockquote">
            <p>" So strong was His Excellency's wish<lb/>that the contents of his Reply should be<lb/>known to the Council before its deli<lb break="no"/>very."<lb/>
            </p></quote>


            <p>That was added to the paper submitted<lb/>to them, and it puts a different face upon<lb/>the document. He (Mr. S.) would ask<lb/>the House why it was, if His Excellency<lb/>had so strong a wish for the contents of<lb/>his reply to be known to his Council, that<lb/>he used such unbecoming haste in re<lb break="no"/>turning an answer ? Did he expect this<lb/>effort of the Legislative Council would be<lb/>successful, and the British Government<lb/>would force the Quebec Scheme upon the<lb/>people of this country. As sure as the<lb/>sun sets in the west they will rebel<lb/>against any such attempt. He (Mr. S.)<lb/>felt satisfied that many of those gentle<lb break="no"/>men who desired Confederation wished<lb/>to obtain it by constitutional means, and<lb/>did not desire by coercion to force Con<lb break="no"/>federation upon the people. He believed<lb/>they would resist any such attempt to<lb/>force upon the people of this country a<lb/>scheme which they have rejected. There<lb/>must be a hidden hand in the matter, for<lb/>the answer of His Excellency to the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council was known to several<lb/>members of the Opposition a day or tw<lb/>before it was delivered. If that be true<lb/>is it not lamentable and outrageous that<lb/>such a state of things exist. The ques<lb break="no"/>tion to be considered is not Confederation<lb/>or anti-Confederation, but it is a great<lb/>constitutional question. If he (Mr. S.)<lb/>was the worst man that ever lived, it<lb/>would be not excuse for His Excellency<lb/>not consulting with his advisers, against<lb/>whose character he could say nothing,<lb/>for it was due to them that they should be<lb/>consulted. The intelligence of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this country has been insulted by<lb/>His Excellency's telling them that his not<lb/>consulting his Executive Council was the<lb/>result of an accident. He (Mr. S.) felt<lb/>assured that many of the members of the<lb/>Legislative Council would now be willing<lb/>to retrace their steps, for they feel that<lb/>an injustice has been perpetrated upon<lb/>the country. He did not know whether<lb/>the House was prorogued in view of a <lb/>dissolution or not, but he was satisfied<lb/>that this transaction must inevitably end<lb/>in a dissolution, in order that the people<lb/>may express an opinion upon their con<lb break="no"/>duct. He would now call attention to<lb/> some resolutions which were now pend<lb break="no"/>ing before the House, in order that they<lb/>may see exactly the position they were in.<lb/>There was an important principle in these<lb/>resolutions, for they contained not only a<lb/>want of confidence in the Government,<lb/>but in the Governor himself. Mr. Smith<lb/>then read the following Resolutions, mo<lb break="no"/>ved by Mr. Otty :<lb/>

<fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1866</fw> <fw type="num">119</fw>


            <p>1. Therefore, Resolved, that this House<lb/>as representing the People of New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick, is in no wise disposed to admit that<lb/>a Union of the Colonies under the Que<lb break="no"/>bec Scheme is an object to be "highly<lb/>desired," or essential to their future<lb/>prosperity or influence, nor calculated to<lb/>strengthen and perpetuate the ties which<lb/>bind them to Her Gracious Majesty's<lb/>Throne and Government ; and this con<lb break="no"/>viction was fully expressed by the people<lb/>of this Province at the General Election<lb/>held in March, 1865, by the return of a<lb/>large majority of candidates opposed to<lb/>the Quebec Scheme.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. Resolved, That this House is fully<lb/>convinced that the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Representative Body</hi> is<lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">alone</hi> competent to represent the senti<lb break="no"/>ments of the people, and that the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council, representing merely the<lb/>personal opinion of certain Members, and<lb/>irresponsible to the people, is not an au<lb break="no"/>thority competent to require the passage<lb/>of an Imperial Act compelling the people<lb/>to submit to a Scheme subversive of the<lb/>Constitution of the Province, and indig<lb break="no"/>nantly rejected by its inhabitants when<lb/>lately proposed to them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>3. Resolved, That no interference on<lb/>the part of the Imperial Parliament with<lb/>the Constitution of this Province, which<lb/>should not be founded on the wishes of<lb/>the people freely expressed either through<lb/>the House or in any other constitutional<lb/>manner, would in any wise tend to pro<lb break="no"/>mote any scheme of Union between the<lb/>Colonies, and the connection between this<lb/>country and the Parent State, will be du<lb break="no"/>rable in proportion to the direct influence<lb/>exercised by the people in the manage<lb break="no"/>ment and control of their own affairs.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>4. Resolved, That the Legislative<lb/>Council, by acting with such aimed hos<lb break="no"/>tility to the sentiments of the people,<lb/>have forfeited the confidence of this<lb/>House of Assembly ; and their proceed<lb break="no"/>ings during the session in passing the<lb/>said Address to Her Majesty, and pre<lb break="no"/>senting the same to the Lieutenant Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor, previous to the passing of the<lb/>Address by the House of Assembly in<lb/>answer to His Excellency's Speech at<lb/>the opening of the Session, and during<lb/>the continuance of a debate on a want of<lb/>confidence motion, have destroyed all<lb/>hopes of seeing the Council act in har<lb break="no"/>mony with the House of Assembly :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>And this House is convinced that Her<lb/>Majesty's Government will abstain from<lb/>acting upon an Address emanating from<lb/>an irresponsible body of the Legislature,<lb/>and advocating a scheme for an import<lb break="no"/>ant constitutional change, and one where<lb break="no"/>by the members of that body alone would<lb/>individually obtain increased salaries and<lb/>higher official position.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>5. Resolved, That the answer of His<lb/>Excellency the Lieutenant Governor to<lb/>the Address of the Legislative Council is<lb/>directly adverse to the views and desires<lb/>of the majority of the Representatives of<lb/>the people, and the assumption of the re<lb break="no"/>sponsibility of such answer by the Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council would admit a willingness<lb/>to adopt that very scheme which the peo<lb break="no"/>ple <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> the last General Election rejected<lb/>by a large majority, and which the Mem<lb break="no"/>bers of this Council, with other Represent<lb break="no"/>tatives, were elected to oppose.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>6. Resolved, That the manner in which<lb/>the said answer was submitted by his<lb/>Excellency the Lieutenant Governor to <lb/>his Executive Council <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>sincere disapproval, <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>of said Executive Council having been<lb/>
            

            <cb/>
          

     consulted by His Excellency with regard 
     <lb/>to the terms thereof until within a few<lb/>minutes before the same should hae been<lb/>and was delivered.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>7. Resolved, That we cannot but high<lb break="no"/>ly approve of the conduct of the Members<lb/>of the Executive Council in tendering<lb/>their resignations to a Governor who has<lb/>exhibited so little regard for the wishes<lb/>of the people, and treated with such dis<lb break="no"/>courtesy the Members of his Council, the<lb/>Representatives of the people, and used<lb/>such means to destroy the principles of<lb/>Responsible Government which this<lb/>country has hitherto enjoyed.<lb/>

            <p>8. Resolved, That His Excellency, by<lb/>thus exercising his authority, prevent<lb/> the Legislature from going into consider<lb break="no"/>ation of the matters contained in his Ad<lb break="no"/>dress ; and although a large majority of<lb/>the Representatives have expressed their<lb/>opinions upon the want of confidence mo<lb break="no"/>tion in approval of the course of the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, and sustaining them therein,<lb/>yet by such conduct a Government pos<lb break="no"/>sessing the confidence of the people have<lb/>been compelled to resign, and the rights<lb/>and Constitution of a free people tram<lb break="no"/>pled upon and disregarded.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>9. Resolved, That it is deeply to be re<lb break="no"/>gretted that His Excellency should have<lb/>persisted in such a course, after the al<lb break="no"/>most unanimous expression of this House<lb/>antagonistic to the Quebec Scheme at<lb/>its last session, and adopted upon a calm,<lb/>patient, and deliberate consideration of<lb/>its provisions, and also after so decided<lb/>and independent a majority of the people<lb/>had expressed their condemnation there<lb break="no"/>of.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>10. Resolved, That in thus placing him<lb break="no"/>self in direct opposition to the recorded<lb/>opinions of the majority of the House of<lb/>Assembly, and also of his Executive<lb/>Council, his Excellency has pursued a<lb/>course fraught with consequences so<lb/>detrimental to the interests of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, and so subversive of the rights<lb/>and liberties of the people thereof, that<lb/>the same should immediately be brought<lb/>under the notice of Her Majesty, in the<lb/>hope that He Majesty will be graciously<lb/>pleased to make such a change in the<lb/>Executive Department of this Province as<lb/>will ensure the affairs of the Province be<lb break="no"/>ing so conducted as to secure harmony<lb/>among the different brances of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and perpetuate that system of<lb/>Colonial Policy and Government which<lb/>was secured to us by the success of a for<lb break="no"/>mer political struggle.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>11. Resolved, That an Address of this<lb/>House, based upon and embodying the<lb/>foregoing Resolutions, be at once trans<lb break="no"/>mitted to Her Most Gracious Majesty,<lb/>and a copy of the foregoing Resolutions<lb/>forwarded to his Excellency.<lb/>

            <p>Was there any precedent in this<lb/>country for His Excellency's prorogu<lb break="no"/>ing the House before it has passed the<lb/>address in answer to the speech. The<lb/>Opposition, during the continuance of<lb/>this debate on the address, lost all hopes<lb/>of overturning the Government by their<lb/>motion of want of confidence, and they<lb/>had to resort to another method. He<lb/>hoped the [illegible] of the Crown<lb/>would not be [illegible] prevent the<lb/>representatives <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear><lb/>pressing <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> <lb/>prerogative of the Crown, and said,<lb/>

thank God we live in a free country,<lb/>and have enjoyed a free Government<lb/>for many years, and it was their duty<lb/>to cherish it, and maintain its principles<lb/>inviolate. He had no doubt but that<lb/>the people of the country would do this,<lb/>and that they would not surrender their<lb/>privileges to any man who came from<lb/>England, and would not probably stay<lb/>here twelve months. He respected the<lb/>man who was sent here to preside over<lb/>them, and he would be sorry to encroach<lb/>upon his privileges and prerogatives,<lb/>yet it was the duty of the House to pro<lb break="no"/>tect the liberties of the people. The<lb/>prerogative of the Crown was com<lb break="no"/>mitted to the Crown, not only for its<lb/>own benefit but for the benefit of the<lb/>people. It does not involve a mere<lb/>passive obedience to the will of the<lb/>Sovereign, but it is a high and mighty<lb/>agent which should never be employed<lb/>except for the benefit of the people.<lb/>This prerogative of prorogation, which<lb/>is for the benefit of the people, is now<lb/>to be used to interpose between the<lb/>voice of the people and the Governor,<lb/>who was sent here to govern them.<lb/>This is a high handed proceeding, when<lb/>those resolutions are before the House<lb/>involving a question between the<lb/>Lieutenant Governor and the people.<lb/>We ask permission to lay our grievance<lb/>at the foot of the throne, and we have<lb/>a right to be heard. Has the Governor<lb/>a right to use his prerogative to stifle the<lb/>voice of the people, and prevent them<lb/>from being heard by Her Majesty, who<lb/>will condemn these proceedings? That<lb/>is what we ask for, and it is our right.<lb/>We have assembled here by the lawful<lb/>authority of the Crown, but we feel an<lb/>act of outrage has been perpetrated<lb/>upon us, that our constitutional Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment has been violated and we want<lb/>to be heard by Her Majesty the Queen.<lb/>Is that an unreasonable request ? If<lb/>not, why are we not allowed to have<lb/>it? He trusted the Government would<lb/>stay their hand, and allow them an op<lb break="no"/>portunity to discuss those resolutions,<lb/>and have them laid at the goot of the<lb/>throne, in order that justice may be<lb/>done, which is a reasonable request.<lb/>He (Mr. Smith) had not heard the<lb/>speech of the member of the Government<lb/>in the Legislative Council, but he<lb/>had been told that it was an attack<lb/>upon him, and that he (Mr. Mitchell)<lb/>had referred to a conversation with<lb/>him.So far from having a conversa<lb break="no"/>tion together, they held no intercourse.<lb/>So fixed was the Government's deter<lb break="no"/>mination to hold no intercourse with<lb/>Mr. Mitchell, that he (Mr. Smith)<lb/>thought they were scarcely courteous to<lb/>him. He (Mr. S.) had told the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor that whatever was done, was done<lb/>with the full concurrence of his (Mr.<lb/>Smith's) friends. His Excellency ad<lb break="no"/>mits that a committee was to be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed. Why did he not wait until the<lb/>commuttee was appointed? It has been<lb/>said that the answer to the address<lb/>given to the Legislative Council, when<lb/>they presented to His Excellency an<lb/>[illegible] speech, foreshadowed a<lb/>[illegible] was an answer<lb/>[illegible] There<lb/> <unclear reason="illegible">[?]</unclear> they<lb/>prevailed.

be presented to Her Majesty and not to<lb/>His Excellency ; why then could he not<lb/>have spoken professedly in behalf of<lb/>Her Majesty ? in so doing he would have<lb/>discharged his duty. He (Mr. S ) had<lb/>no doubt but that there was an arrange<lb break="no"/>ment beforehand. When he was sent for,<lb/>His Excellency asked during the course<lb/>of his observations, " if we had not<lb/>better give up, and allow him to form a<lb/>new Government, and get this question<lb/>of confederation out of the way." His<lb/>Excellency thought that he (Mr. S.) had<lb/>better bring his colleagues to the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment House ; doubtless he thought<lb/>that rather than take the responsibility<lb/>of his reply they would resign, and Mr.<lb/>Stratton was there he (Mr. S.) believed<lb/>for the purpose of swearing the new<lb/>Government in. Could this conduct be<lb/>justified ? (Mr. Wilmot said he had<lb/>read a note from the Governor, stating<lb/>that nothing of the kind was intended.)<lb/>Mr. Smith said his hon. friend may not<lb/>have known anything about it ; the note<lb/>he (Mr. W.) had read did not relieve<lb/>his position. His Excellency had said<lb/>that Mr. Stratton was there to obey any<lb/>commands, but he (Mr. S.) believed<lb/>that one of the commands which His<lb/>Excellency expected to give him, was<lb/>to swear in a new Government. He<lb/>(Mr. S.) could not tell when this extra<lb break="no"/>ordinary change came over his Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's mind, neither could he tell the<lb/>agencies or means employed to induce<lb/>him to change his opinions. Will it<lb/>not astonish the country to hear that<lb/>those parts of the despatch of the 12th<lb/>of July, which have been called insult<lb break="no"/>ing to her Majesty the Queen, were<lb/>written by his Excellency. (Mr. Wil<lb/>mot said that in the original draft drawn<lb/>by his Excellency, there was a para<lb break="no"/>graph in favor of union, this was struck<lb/>out, although upon the question being<lb/>taken, Mr. Hutchinson and himself had<lb/>declared themselves in favor of union.<lb/>The late Attorney General and the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment are already committed to a<lb/>principle of union, and were prepared<lb/>to carry it through the House in their<lb/>own time and way )<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName> asked leave to explain,<lb/>he had been called a mean low fellow—<lb/>one who would insult the Queen—was<lb/>disloyal to the throne, because it was<lb/>said he had written a despatch which<lb/>was an outrage upon the people of this<lb/>Province, and induced his colleagues to<lb/>sign it while drunk. Every part of that<lb/>despatch, to which objections have been<lb/>made, was written by his Excellency.<lb/>He had a section in it which would have<lb/>committed them to a principle of union,<lb/>but they repudiated it at once. If things<lb/>had proceeded in the ordinary course,<lb/>and party fought party in the House,<lb/>he (Mr. Anglin) would have been<lb/>ashamed to make any allusion to the<lb/>fact that his Excellency had prepared<lb/>that portion of the despatch which has<lb/>been characterized as insulting to the<lb/>Queen, but as he has chosen to take an<lb/>extraordinary course, he (Mr. A.) would<lb/>no longer bear the odium which some of<lb/>the members of the late Opposition at<lb break="no"/>tach to the writer of those portions of<lb/>the despatch. The Government were<lb/>charged with violating the principles of<lb/>Responsible Government by truckling<lb/>to the Governor in not making cer<lb break="no"/>tain appointments. His Excellency in<lb/>a conversation with the leader of the<lb/>Government objected to making any<lb/>alterations, not on the ground that it<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
      
was not right to make such changes, but<lb/>because he thought it would be preju<lb break="no"/>dicial to the purpose for which the dele<lb break="no"/>gation were going home to England.<lb/>His Excellency said he wished to write<lb/>home certain letters to help the delega<lb break="no"/>tion, and the Government agreed to<lb/>postpone the changes until after the re<lb break="no"/>turn of the delegates. When they re<lb break="no"/>turned, the Governor was on his way<lb/>to England, and they knew the admin<lb break="no"/>istration would not desire to make any<lb/>changes during the absence of his Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency. (Some conversation then<lb/>took place between Mr. L. P. W. Des<lb break="no"/>Brisay and Mr. Hatheway in regard to<lb/>changing officers in the County of<lb/>Kent.)<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Mr. Anglin</persName> continued—The appoint<lb break="no"/>ments were never actually made, because<lb/>they thought they would have a prejudicial<lb/>effect upon the delegation. His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's connections held a high position in<lb/>England, and the Government thought it<lb/>was of importance to secure his earnest<lb/>co=operation, in comparison with which a<lb/>few paltry appointments was a matter of<lb/>small account. The Governor in Council<lb/>never refused to make one single appoint<lb break="no"/>ment. His hon. colleague (Mr. Wet-<lb break="yes"/>more) thought he had made a strong point<lb/>when he spoke of the Governor's salary.<lb/>At a meeting of the Council they told his<lb/>Excellency that they were individually<lb/>pledged, and the people of the country<lb/>required that there should be some ar<lb break="no"/>rangement made concerning this matter.<lb/>They found, according to an arrange<lb break="no"/>ment made with the previous Government,<lb/>the Lieutenant Governor drew the whole<lb/>amound and refunded part of it. They<lb/>discussed the question, and maintaned<lb/>that he should receive the same amount<lb/>as under the old arrangement. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency said that would put him in a po<lb break="no"/>sition of having taken what he was not<lb/>entitled to. The Council replied that<lb/>they must have the matter settled one way<lb/>or the other, and His Excellency spoke of<lb/>writing home to be recalled rather than<lb/>settle it. He suggested that he should<lb/>have time to obtain permission from the<lb/>Home Government to withdraw the des<lb break="no"/>patch sent by the Duke of Newcastle, so<lb/>that he would not be disobeying orders.<lb/>The Council thought that would not af<lb break="no"/>fect their rights, and that the salary<lb/>would then be taken out in the old way.<lb/>That was made a distinct understanding,<lb/>but he (Mr. A.) was informed that this<lb/>arrangement was never carried out.<lb/>Whether or not it was the fault of the<lb/>late Government in neglecting to carry<lb/>this out. It is clearly the duty of the<lb/>present Government to do so.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said he told His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency that he was determined to have the<lb/>matter settled, and he would not sacri<lb break="no"/>fice the course which he had taken.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> said he was the person<lb/>that had brought the question up.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said that the Government<lb/>expected the arrangement would have<lb/>been carried out when they went to Eng<lb break="no"/>land. He then spoke of Mr. Wilmot as<lb/>the leader of the Government formed to<lb/>carry out the Quebec Scheme, and Mr.<lb/>Wilmot replied that he was not more fa<lb break="no"/>vorable to the Quebec Scheme than be<lb break="no"/>fore. Mr. Smith said he (Mr. Wilmot)<lb/>was bound hand and foot to the Quebec<lb/>Scheme, and had no way to extricate him<lb break="no"/>self. His (Mr. Smith's) motives had been<lb/>impugned by his hou. friend (Mr. Fisher)<lb/>when he charged him with not acting<lb/>upon principle, but from a feeling a ma<lb break="no"/>
        

            <cb/>
       
lignity against the late Government. He 
     <lb/>(Mr. S.) did not think the question involv<lb break="no"/>ed the position of the Government at all,<lb/>as the Governor had power to draw these<lb/>warrants himself. This arrangement<lb/>made by the Tilley Government to allow<lb/>his Excellency to draw this money and<lb/>pay it back, was an extraordinary thing.<lb/>Did they want a donation from him ? If<lb/>he was entitled to the money, it was but<lb/>justice that he should have it. Mr. Smith<lb/>then spoke of the despatch of the 12th<lb/>of July, and said his Excellency had<lb/>himself written the most objectionable<lb/>part. He then referred to a remark made<lb/>by a member of the Upper House that he<lb/>was twice sent for by his Excellency.<lb/>He (Mr. Smith) did not think his Excel<lb break="no"/>lency was doing right in consulting with<lb/>a member of the Opposition. When he<lb/>(Mr. S.) returned from the United States<lb/>his colleagues told him that some scheme<lb/>for union was in contemplation, and that<lb/>the Governor had consulted with a mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the Opposition regarding it. He<lb/>had mentioned to the Governor that this<lb/>rumor was in circulation. Why did not<lb/>his Excellency say at once : " It is true,<lb/>I advised with Mr. Mitchell." That<lb/>would have been a frank and generous<lb/>course ; instead of this he said, " Mr.<lb/>Mitchell and some others dined at Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment House." He (Mr. S.) did not<lb/>blame Mr. Mitchell but he had no lan<lb break="no"/>guage strong enough to express his dis<lb break="no"/>approbation of the Governor's consulting<lb/>him, while a member of the Opposition,<lb/>in regard to matters which ought to be<lb/>considered of a confidential nature, in<lb break="no"/>stead of taking the advice of his own Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. (Mr. Wilmot asked whether<lb/>any arrangements were made to bring the<lb/>subject of Union before the Council.) Mr.<lb/>Smith said that his hon. colleague knew<lb/>exactly what was done. The arrangement<lb/>was that he (Mr. S.) was to consult his<lb/>friends, then the despatches were to be<lb/>submitted to the House, and afterwards<lb/>referred to a Select Committee. They<lb/>discussed the question whether they<lb/>should refer them to a joint committee of<lb/>both Houses or seperately to each House.<lb/>This matter was discussed from time to<lb/>time, and the names taken down of<lb/>those who should be on the committee.<lb/>He insisted that the friends of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment should have a majority in the<lb/>Committee, and he wanted a Joint Com<lb break="no"/>mittee of both Houses. On a late occa<lb break="no"/>sion, when he was at Government House,<lb/>he felt there was treachery contemplated,<lb/>that the Governor was under the influ<lb break="no"/>ence of some evil genius who was acting<lb/>antagonistic to them. He told the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor that he had violated the under<lb break="no"/>standing between them. His Excellency<lb/>replied that circumstances had changed,<lb/>and he did not know that the Legislative<lb/>Council were going to do as they hve<lb/>done. He (Mr. S.) said that they could<lb/>not control the Legislative Council, and<lb/>therefore they had no authority to take<lb/>any action in this matter, and he told him<lb/>that the Government were prepared to<lb/>carry out their arrangements, and they<lb/>expected his Excellency would do the<lb/>same. The despatches were not before<lb/>the House, therefore they could not yet<lb/>take any action in the matter. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency did not charge him with using<lb/>deceit or duplicity, though now the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment is charged through outside influ<lb break="no"/>ence with being guilty of deceit because<lb/>we did not act to suit the purposes of<lb/>those who favored the Quebec Scheme.<lb/>It was a cool proposition for the Govern<lb break="no"/>

     or to say that the Government had better 
     <lb/>resign their seats and let him form a new<lb/>Government to carry out the scheme and<lb/>get rid of it. He said this while we were<lb/>fighting an unscrupulous Opposition, and<lb/>while victory was perching upon our ban<lb break="no"/>ners. He (Mr. S.) told his colleagues<lb/>this, and he also told them of another<lb/>conversation, where his Excellency stated<lb/>that he had taken down in writing the<lb/>results of their different conversations.<lb/>He (Mr. S.) asked if that was right, and<lb/>told him that he repudiated the paper,<lb/>and he would not allow it to rise against<lb/>him in judgment. His Excellency said<lb/>he would destroy the paper, but instead<lb/>of that the paper is now part of the docu<lb break="no"/>ment which has been submitted to them.<lb/>He (Mr. S.) told his colleagues at that<lb/>time that His Excellency was trying to<lb/>place him in a false position, and subse<lb break="no"/>quent events have proved the truth of<lb/>his statement.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">MR. WILMOT</persName> asked whether the late<lb/>Government had agreed to bring the<lb/>question of Union before both branches<lb/>of the Legislature, and were going to<lb/>give weight to any scheme agreed upon,<lb/>by sending a delegation to England.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">MR. SMITH</persName> said that the only ar<lb break="no"/>rangement made was that a select<lb/>committee should be appointed. They<lb/>often discussed what this committee<lb/>should do, and what power they should<lb/>have, but he (Mr. S.) would declare be<lb break="no"/>fore this House and the country, that<lb/>he never would consent, by word or<lb/>deed, that a delegation should be ap<lb break="no"/>pointed to go home to England and<lb/>there settle upon the terms of a scheme<lb/>to be effected, without being left to the<lb/>people of this country. He knew that<lb/>the Quebec Scheme was confirmed at<lb/>the Colonial Office, and he knew that<lb/>the Canadians had great influence there<lb/>therefore it was mere mockery to send<lb/>a delegation home, for they might as<lb/>well save the expense. The House has<lb/>no right to arrogate to itself the power<lb/>to delegate men to go to England for<lb/>this purpose. A delegation of this kind<lb/>should only be appointed by the con<lb break="no"/>sent of the people, for if a scheme is<lb/>forced upon the people without their<lb/>consent, it will lead to dreadful conse<lb break="no"/>quences and disastrous results. He<lb/>had told His Excellency that he had<lb/>many objections to the Quebec Scheme ;<lb/>he had looked over the scheme with<lb/>His Eqcellency, and there was scarcely<lb/>an objection which he pointed out that<lb/>did not meet with His Excellency's con<lb break="no"/>currence, but now when he is about to<lb/>leave the Province he has altered his<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
          
mind in regard to them. His object<lb/>may be to build up a reputation for<lb/>himself at the Colonial Office, and<lb/>thereby elevate himself to a higher<lb/>pinacle. He has changed his mind<lb/>since he went to England ; when he<lb/>helped prepare the minute of Council<lb/>on the 12th of July, his mind was not<lb/>under this influence ; he had brought all<lb/>his influence to bear to help the delega<lb break="no"/>tion which went to England to prevent<lb/>the consummation of this union. His<lb/>judgment then was of more weight<lb/>than now, when other influences are<lb/>brought to bear upon him. He (Mr.<lb/>Smith) believed that Mr. Wilmot's re<lb break="no"/>signation was prepared with a view to<lb/>his being appointed to form a new<lb/>Government. ( <persName ref="pers:WILM1">Mr. Wilmot</persName> said that<lb/>there was no such understanding.) Mr.<lb/>Smith said he assumed it to be so, and<lb/>he was prepared to draw his inference ;<lb/>he did not believe Mr. Wilmot could at<lb/>that time have formed a Government<lb/>which would have stood. ( <persName ref="pers:WILM1">Mr. Wilmot</persName> <lb/>said that he believed the reason his re<lb break="no"/>signation was recommended to be ac<lb break="no"/>cepted was, that the Government had<lb/>come round and would support a<lb/>scheme of union. That was proved by<lb/>these documents.) Mr. Smith said that<lb/>during the whole of this discussion on<lb/>the vote of want of confidence, there<lb/>was not a charge made against the<lb/>Government for which he (Mr. W.) was<lb/>not responsiblh, even to all observa<lb break="no"/>tions made in reference to that minute<lb/>of Council. He speaks against a Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, and charges them with acts of<lb/>mal-administration and with being de<lb break="no"/>rilict in their duty, although he was a<lb/>participator in those very acts. He was<lb/>as much bound to vote against that<lb/>" want of confidence " motion as any<lb/>man in the Government. He (Mr. S.<lb/>regretted that the prerogative of the<lb/>Crown was to be used in order to stop<lb/>Mr. Otty's resolutions, which involved<lb/>the recall of the Governor. If they<lb/>looked into the annals of any free coun<lb break="no"/>try, they would never find the preroga<lb break="no"/>tive of the Crown interposed to prevent<lb/>the people laying their grievances at<lb/>the foot of the throne. The country<lb/>has been forty-eight hours without his<lb/>Excellency's having constitutional advi<lb break="no"/>sers, and this when we are in danger of in<lb break="no"/>vasion by Fenians from abroad. Instead<lb/>of disunion being created at this time eve<lb break="no"/>ry man, woman and child should be bound<lb/>toether to defend their common coun<lb break="no"/>try. He would resist this Quebec Scheme<lb/>to the last, as it would destroy the best<lb/>interests of the people of this country<lb/>
   

            <cb/>
       

     He had studied that scheme thoroughly, 
     <lb/>
     he had  heard all that could be said in its 
     <lb/>
     favor both in England and by the Cana<lb break="no"/>dians, and the conclusion he arrived at 
     <lb/>
     was that it was prepared with reference 
     <lb/>
     to the local politics of Canada. He said 
     <lb/>
     he had made sacrifices, and he was pre<lb break="no"/>pared to make more for the good of the 
     <lb/>of the country. The people had placed their<lb/>confidence in him for fourteen years, and<lb/>if now they withdraw their confidence,<lb/>and he died politically, he would die<lb/>struggling to maintain the honor and in<lb break="no"/>dependence of his country.<lb/>

     The Council, in reply, would respect<lb break="no"/>fully remark, that in their opinion it was<lb/>incumbent upon your Excellency to con<lb break="no"/>sult your Constitutional Advisers in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the answer so given, and in as<lb break="no"/>suming to yourself the right to reply to<lb/>such Address without consulting them,<lb/>your Excellency has not acted in accord<lb break="no"/>ance with the true spirit of the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In connection the Council would<lb/>beg to refer to the statement appended<lb/>hereto, giving an account of two inter<lb break="no"/>views between your Excellency and the<lb/>Attorney General.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Reply so given by your Excellency<lb/>to the Legislative Council is a distinct<lb/>and emphatic approval of their proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, the responsibility of which your<lb/>advisers are unwilling to assume for the<lb/>following reasons :<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     1st. That in any measure involving an 
     <lb/>organic change in the Constitution and<lb/>political rights and privileges of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple, they should be consulted, and unless<lb/>approved of by them no such measure<lb/>should be adopted or forced upon them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2d. That in March last a dissolution<lb/>took place professedly with a view to as<lb break="no"/>certain the sense of the people upon the<lb/>Quebec Scheme, and they pronounced un<lb break="no"/>mistakably against its adoption by large<lb/>majorities.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>3d. That the Representatives of the<lb/>people at the last Session of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture passed resolutions condemnatory of<lb/>such Scheme, by a majority of twenty-<lb break="yes"/>nine to ten.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>4th. That the Legislative Council are<lb/>not elected by the people, and are not<lb/>constitutionally responsible to them for<lb/>their Legislative conduct, and have no<lb/>rightful authority to pray Her Majesty to<lb/>give effect, by Imperial Legislation, to<lb/>any measure which the people have re<lb break="no"/>jected.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>5th. That such proceeding violates<lb/>every principle of responsibility and self-<lb break="yes"/>government, and is subversive of the<lb/>rights and liberties of the people, and<lb/>seeks to take from them their Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion, not only without their consent but<lb/>against their clearly expressed wishes.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>6th. That such a course is calculated<lb/>to bring the Legislative Council and<lb/>House of Assembly into collision, and dis<lb break="no"/>turb that harmony that should subsist<lb/>between them, and manifests an entire<lb/>disregard of the power and majesty of the<lb/>people.<lb/>
          

            <cb/>
           

     That the Legislative Council have a 
     <lb/>legitimate right to express their opinion<lb/>upon any public question, the Council<lb/>do not deny ; but to invoke the aid of the<lb/>British Government to coerce the people<lb/>into Confederation, is a proceeding in<lb/>the opinion of this Council without par<lb break="no"/>allel and wholly unwarrantable.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Council would further remark, 
     <lb/>that they have good cause to believe your<lb/>Excellency has, ever since the opening<lb/>of the Legislature, consulted and advised<lb/>with gentlemen of the Opposition, and<lb/>made known to them matters which they<lb/>think should be regarded as confidential.<lb/>This we feel your Excellency has con<lb break="no"/>tinued to do, notwithstanding the re<lb break="no"/>peated objections of one or more Mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the Council who told your Excel<lb break="no"/>lency that it was not right, and that it<lb/>gave the Opposition a decided advantage<lb/>in the debate then pending ; and your<lb/>Excellency having taken the advice, as<lb/>they truly believe, of a gentleman of the<lb/>Opposition, as to the answer given to the<lb/>Legislative Council on Saturday last, in<lb break="no"/>stead of that of your Constitutional Ad<lb break="no"/>visers, they would respectfully express<lb/>their conviction that such a course was<lb/>unconstitutional, and without precedent<lb/>in any country where Responsible Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment exists.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Council would further state that<lb/>the Government were supported by a<lb/>majority of the members of the House of<lb/>Assembly, of which fact your Excellency<lb/>was fully aware.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Under these circumstances, the under<lb break="no"/>signed would beg respectfully to tender to<lb/>your Excellency the resignation of their<lb/>offices as Executive Councillors.<lb/>

that day, and I had not the most distant<lb/>idea that he intended to do so. I then<lb/>parted with him.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>A few minutes before three o'clock of<lb/>the afternoon of the same day, in my<lb/>place in the House of Assembly, I re<lb break="no"/>ceived a note from him saying that he<lb/>wished to see me at once. I immediate<lb break="no"/>ly repaired to Government House, and<lb/>after a short conversation with him upon<lb/>other matters, he informed me that he<lb/>was going to receive the Legislative<lb/>Council with their Address at three<lb/>o'clock. I expressed my surprise at<lb/>this, and inquired what answer he in<lb break="no"/>tended to make. He then handed me a<lb/>paper which contained his proposed an<lb break="no"/>swer, accompanied with a Memorandum<lb/>for the Executive Council. I expressed<lb/>my disapproval of it, and complained<lb/>that he had not advised with his Council<lb/>before preparing it; that as they were<lb/>responsible for it, they should at least<lb/>be consulted before it was given. He<lb/>remarked that, if they did not approve<lb/>of it, they could relieve themselves of<lb/>responsibility. I replied, even if that<lb/>were true, was it courteous and fair that<lb/>the Council should be treated in that<lb/>way ; that what they asked from His<lb/>Excellency was fair play, not as a favor,<lb/>but as a matter of right? He then pro<lb break="no"/>posed that I should drive down to the<lb/>House of Assembly and see my collea<lb break="no"/>gues, and return in half an hour, and he<lb/>would keep the Legislative Council (who<lb/>in the meantime had arrived at Govern<lb break="no"/>ment House) waiting until I returned.<lb/>I said I could not di this, that the De<lb break="no"/>bate on the Vote of Want of Confidence<lb/>was going on, and that they could not<lb/>leave the House, and besides, they could<lb/>not possibly consider so important a<lb/>question in a few minutes. His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency then proposed to send one of the<lb/>carriages that were standing at the door<lb/>for them. I then stated that they could not<lb/>leave the House. He replied, " I sup<lb break="no"/>pose not." I further stated that it was<lb/>unfair and ungenerous, and not such<lb/>treatment as the Council had a right to<lb/>expect, to be called upon in this sudden<lb/>and extraordinary way in a matter so<lb/>important. I expressed my condemna<lb break="no"/>tion of the course adopted by the Legis<lb break="no"/>lative Council, and urged the impropriety<lb/>of their praying Her Majesty the Queen<lb/>to cause a Law of the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to be passed, giving effect to a<lb/>scheme of Union which both the People<lb/>and the House of Assembly had rejected<lb/>by overwhelming majorities, and that I<lb/>never would consent to any Address<lb/>which authorized the Imperial Parlia<lb break="no"/>ment to pass an Act of Union without<lb/>reference to the people. I thought His<lb/>Excellency seemed disposed to yield the<lb/>point and strike out the last paragraph<lb/>of the answer, which I consider very ob<lb break="no"/>jectionable. He then asked me to ex<lb break="no"/>cuse him, and left the room to consult,<lb/>as I thought at the time, and from infor<lb break="no"/>mation received since, I am confirmed in<lb/>that opinion, a gentleman of the Opposi<lb break="no"/>tion and a member of the Legislative<lb/>Council, who was in the House at the<lb/>time. He returned in a few minutes,<lb/>and after some conversation similar to<lb/>that already detailed, told me that he<lb/>would deliver the answer as it was, and<lb/>send me a copy in the evening. I re<lb break="no"/>monstrated against such conduct, but<lb/>concluded by saying that it he had re<lb break="no"/>solved upon that course, it was in vain to<lb/>protract the interview. I then left<lb/>him.</p>

            <p>The Lieutenant Governor has re<lb break="no"/>ceived from the members of His Execu<lb break="no"/>
         

            <cb/>
    

tive Council a Minute, tendering the re<lb break="no"/>signation of their seats at the Council<lb/>Board.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The reason assigned by them for this<lb/>step is a disinclination to accept the res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility of a reply made by His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency to the Legislative Council, when<lb/>requested by that body to transmit to Her<lb/>Majesty an address, praying that a scheme<lb/>for the union of the British North Amer<lb break="no"/>ican Provinces may be introduced into<lb/>the Imperial Parliament.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Several causes for this disinclination<lb/>are enumerated by the Council. They<lb/>may, however, all be resumed in the ob<lb break="no"/>jection, that the Legislative Council, in<lb/>adopting the address in question, over<lb break="no"/>stepped the limits of action prescribed to<lb/>it by constitutional principles and usage.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In this view, His Excellency cannot<lb/>at all concur, and he perceives with re<lb break="no"/>gret the name of a member of the Upper<lb/>House, for whose character and abilities<lb/>he has a sincere respect, appended to<lb/>reasoning which would, in His Excellen<lb break="no"/>cy's opinion, go far to destroy the posi<lb break="no"/>tion of that Chamber as an independent<lb/>and co-ordinate branch of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     The papers on which the address in 
     <lb/>question was founded, were laid before<lb/>both Houses of the Legislature by Her<lb/>Majesty's express command at the com<lb break="no"/>mencement of the present Session.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It had at that time long been known 
     <lb/>to Her Majesty's Government, that the<lb/>General Election in New Brunswick in<lb/>1865, had terminated unfavourably to the<lb/>cause of Union, and the communication<lb/>of these papers was made to the Provin<lb break="no"/>cial Parliament in the avowed hope that<lb/>the question might be again considered<lb/>and more favourably received there.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Address in answer to His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency's Speech at the opening of the Ses<lb break="no"/>sion, even as originally proposed, con<lb break="no"/>veyed an assurance that those papers<lb/>should receive a careful and respectful<lb/>attention from the Legislative Council.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>But the chief documents which the<lb/>Members of that body thus pledged them<lb break="no"/>selves to consider, were the Resolutions<lb/>adopted at Quebec, the approval of that<lb/>Scheme by Her Majesty, and the expres<lb break="no"/>sion of a hope on the part of Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty's Government, that its provisions<lb/>might be favourably reconsidered in New<lb/>Brunswick.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On the questions then thus submitted<lb/>to them by Her Majesty's command, the<lb/>Legislative Council was bound to form<lb/>and to express an opinion. In so doing<lb/>they have intimated their approval of a<lb/>Union of the British North American<lb/>Colonies, and indicated the basis on<lb/>which it might in their opinion be ac<lb break="no"/>complished.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>It is neither constitutional nor reason<lb break="no"/>able to maintain that the Legislative<lb/>Council is incompetent to act with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to a Scheme thus submitted to them,<lb/>until after its previous approval by the<lb/>House of Assembly, nor can it be imagin<lb break="no"/>ed that the Legislative Council alone is<lb/>debarred from that right of appeal to<lb/>Her Majesty which is accorded to all<lb/>Her subjects without distinction.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Council also take exception to His<lb/>Excellency's having delivered this Re<lb break="no"/>ply, without previously communicating<lb/>to them the terms in which it was<lb/>couched.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Without emquiring how far their Minis<lb break="no"/>terial responsibility, from which it is al<lb break="no"/>ways in their power to escape, requires<lb/>that the Council should possess a previ<lb break="no"/>ous knowledge of all the Lieutenant Gov<lb break="no"/>ernor's words and actions, His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency must observe that the non-com<lb break="no"/>munication to the Council, of the Reply<lb/>
     

            <cb/>
    

in question, was the result, not of design,<lb/>but of accident, and that it was his in<lb break="no"/>tention and desire to have submitted<lb/>the terms of his reply to the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of his Council.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The language employed by His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency to the Legislative Council was<lb/>not, however, inconsistent with the poli<lb break="no"/>cy which his Advisers had informed him<lb/>they were inclined to follow ; or, in his<lb/>judgment, with the reply which, with<lb/>the knowledge and consent of his Coun<lb break="no"/>cil, he had returned a few days pre<lb break="no"/>viously to an Address from the same<lb/>body. His words were, that he "<choice><sic>re<lb break="no"/>joiceed</sic><corr>rejoiced</corr></choice> to believe that the avowal<lb/>of the desire of the Legislative Coun<lb break="no"/>cil that all British North America<lb/>should unite in one community under<lb/>one strong and efficient Government,<lb/>cannot but tend to hasten the accom<lb break="no"/>plishment of this great measure." This<lb/>by no means conveys an approval of the<lb/>particular scheme to the provisions of<lb/>which his Council so strongly object, al<lb break="no"/>though it does express a hope that an<lb/>Union of the British North American<lb/>Provinces might shortly be accomplish<lb break="no"/>ed. But from previous communications<lb/>with the leader of the Government, His<lb/>Excellency was fully entitled to assume<lb/>that this hope was shared by his Coun<lb break="no"/>cil.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On the 8th January His Excellency<lb/>received fro the Honorable R. D. Wil<lb break="no"/>mot, a letter tendering the resignation of<lb/>his seat in the Executive Council, and as<lb break="no"/>signing as his chief reason for so doing,<lb/>the indisposition of his colleagues to en<lb break="no"/>tertain propositions for a closer Union of<lb/>the British North American Provinces.<lb/>To that resignation His Excellency de<lb break="no"/>clined to reply until after the return of<lb/>the President of the Council from Wash<lb break="no"/>ington, which took place on the 14th<lb/>February.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On the following day His Excellency<lb/>had several communications with that<lb/>gentleman, in the course of which His<lb/>Excellency observed that the resigna<lb break="no"/>tion of Mr. Wilmot, and the fact that<lb/>the Legislature had now been summon<lb break="no"/>ed for despatch of business, rendered it<lb/>necessary that a distinct understanding<lb/>on the subject of union should be ar<lb break="no"/>rived at between himself and his Ad<lb break="no"/>visers<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency stated that it would be<lb/>his duty, in accordance with his instruc<lb break="no"/>tions, to submit the question again to<lb/>the Legislature on its assembly, and to<lb/>express the conviction of Her Majesty's<lb/>Government with respect to the benefits<lb/>likely to attend the measure.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That if Mr. Wilmot were mistaken in<lb/>supposing that the Government were<lb/>hostile to all measures of union, and Mr.<lb/>Smith and his colleagues were prepared<lb/>to consent to the introduction into the<lb/>speech at the opening of the Session, of<lb/>the recommendation of Her Majesty's<lb/>Government, conveyed in Mr. Card<lb break="no"/>well's despatch of the 24th June, 1865,<lb/>it would have been His Excellency's<lb/>duty to accept the proff ered resignation<lb/>of Mr. Wilmot ; but if, on the contrary,<lb/>the statements made by him in this<lb/>connection were correct, it would be a<lb/>matter for grave consideration whether<lb/>His Excellency could accept the resig<lb break="no"/>nation so tendered, and whether His<lb/>Excellency would not be bound to en<lb break="no"/>quire whether Mr. Wilmot was prepared<lb/>to undertake the responsibility of re<lb break="no"/>commending to the people the adoption<lb/>of a measure which was, in the opinion<lb/>of Her Majesty's Government, calcu<lb break="no"/>lated to confer benefit on Her Majesty's<lb/>subjects in this Province, and the ac<lb break="no"/>

            <p>His Excellency stated his confident be<lb break="no"/>lief, that after being accepted as a<lb/>basis, it were found that the details of the<lb/>Scheme agreed to at Quebec were open to<lb/>just and serious objections on the part of<lb/>the Maritime Provinces, the representa<lb break="no"/>tion of their Legislatures to that effect<lb/>would be certain to receive a respectful<lb/>attention from Her Majesty's Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and from that of Canada. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency concluded by handing to Mr.<lb/>Smith the following Memorandum :—<lb/>

            <p>" The Lieutenant Governor has been<lb/>instructed by a despatch from the Secre<lb break="no"/>tary of State for the Colonies, bearing<lb/>date June 24th, 1865, to express to the<lb/>Legislature of New Brunswick, on its<lb/>next re-assembling, "the strong and de<lb break="no"/>" liberate opinion of Her Majesty's Gov<lb break="no"/>" ernment, that it is an object much to<lb/>" be desired that all the British North<lb/>" American Colonies should agree to unite<lb/>" in one Government."<lb/>

            <p>This Memorandum, in compliance with<lb/>Mr. Smith's urgent request, was not for<lb break="no"/>mally transmitted to the Council, but it<lb/>was carefully read by him, and its sub<lb break="no"/>stance communicated to his colleagues.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> must have perceived, al<lb break="no"/>though His Excellency abstained from<lb/>any expression calculated to wound the<lb/>susceptibility of his Council, that had the<lb/>question proposed by that Memorandum<lb/>received a negative response His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency was prepared to decline to accede to<lb/>the recommendation that Mr. Wilmot's<lb/>resignation should be accepted, and to en<lb break="no"/>trust to that gentleman the responsibility<lb/>of attempting to carry into effect the policy<lb/>on account of his adherence to which he<lb/>desired to quit the Government which, in<lb/>conjunction with Mr. Smith, he had un<lb break="no"/>dertaken to form.<lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     After several communications with the 
     <lb/>other members of the Council, Mr. Smith<lb/>ultimately informed His Excellency that<lb/>whilst unable to accept in its integrity the<lb/>Scheme adopted at Quebec, he and his<lb/>colleagues were not indisposed to meet<lb/>the wishes of Her Majesty's Government ;<lb/>and that it appeared to him that the re<lb break="no"/>quisite sanction for the adoption of such<lb/>a course might be obtained if the Mes<lb break="no"/>sage transmitting the papers on this sub<lb break="no"/>ject to the Legislature were referred to a<lb/>Joint Committee of both Houses, with an<lb/>understanding that that Committee should<lb/>report in favor of a measure of Union.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency replied that he had<lb/>no objection to such a course, provided<lb/>
         

            <cb/>
         
it was clearly understood beforehand<lb/>that this reference was to be made only<lb/>with a view of rendering it easier for<lb/>the Government to adopt a course which<lb/>they had themselves in any case re<lb break="no"/>solved to pursue, and with no intention<lb/>to cast upon the Committee the duty of<lb/>finding a policy for the Government ;<lb/>for that a reference of such a descrip<lb break="no"/>tion, besides involving an abdication of<lb/>their proper functions as a Government,<lb/>would cause much delay, and might<lb/>after all terminate in a report unfavor<lb break="no"/>able to union, in which case it was<lb/>needless to point out to him that so far<lb/>from any progress having been made in<lb/>the desired direction, the position of the<lb/>cause would have been materially in<lb break="no"/>jured.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> answered that he could not 
     <lb/>
     of course formally pledge  beforehand a 
     <lb/>Committee of the Legislature, but that<lb/>in making himself reponsible for the<lb/>recommendation, it would be with the<lb/>view of honestly carrying out the policy<lb/>so indicated.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Committee having reported, the<lb/>next step to be taken appeared to His<lb/>Excellency to be the introduction by the<lb/>Government of an Address to the<lb/>Queen, praying Her Majesty to take<lb/>steps for the accomplishment of the<lb/>union, and His Excellency drew out the<lb/>rough outline of such an Address, simi<lb break="no"/>lar in substance to that adopted by the<lb/>Canadian Parliament ; but adding a re<lb break="no"/>presentation that portions of the scheme<lb/>agreed to at Quebec were received with<lb/>apprehension and alarm by a large part<lb/>of the people of this and the adjoining<lb/>Province, and a prayer that Her Majesty<lb/>would be pleased, in the preparation of<lb/>any Imperial Act to effect the desired<lb/>union, to give just weight to the objec<lb break="no"/>tions urged against such provisions on<lb/>their behalf, and would afford the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Legislature an opportunity of<lb/>considering the scheme agreed upon,<lb/>before its final adoption. To this pro<lb break="no"/>posal His Excellency understood Mr.<lb/>Smith to assent and his impression to<lb/>that effect is confirmed by finding it so<lb/>stated in a note made at the time, and<lb/>read by His Excellency a few days sub<lb break="no"/>sequently to Mr. Smith, and in the Des<lb break="no"/>patch based on these notes, addressed by<lb/>His Excellency to the Secretary of State<lb/>for the Colonies.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> has lately, however, as<lb break="no"/>sured His Excellency that he only meant<lb/>that such an Address might " grow out<lb/>of the Committee," and did not intend<lb/>to pledge himself in the first instance<lb/>to propose it.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    

    
   
            <p>
     A controversy with respect to the 
     <lb/>words used in conversation, and the<lb/>meaning intended to be conveyed by<lb/>them, is seldom capable of satisfactory<lb/>settlement and it is not His Excellen<lb break="no"/>cy's intention to discuss the greater ac<lb break="no"/>curacy of Mr. Smith's memory, or his<lb/>own.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is sufficient to remark that what<lb break="no"/>ever the precise nature of the course<lb/>agreed to on the 17th February (for<lb/>the discussion lasted three days,)<lb/>was, it was one to which it was felt that<lb/>it would be more difficult to reconcile<lb/>the friends and supporters of the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, than its actual members, and<lb/>Mr. Smith at once left Fredericton in<lb/>order to prepare his principal adherents<lb/>for the altered policy he proposed to<lb/>pursue, asking His Excellency to ob<lb break="no"/>serve the strictest secrecy on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject until his return to report either the<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
  
acquiescence of his friends, or the fail<lb break="no"/>ure of his efforts.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> on his return informed 
     <lb/>His Excellency, on the 3rd of March,<lb/>that his party generally were willing to<lb/>assent to the course which he had con<lb break="no"/>sented to pursue. It was accordingly<lb/>agreed to insert in the Speech on the<lb/>opening of the Session, the recommen<lb break="no"/>dation of Confederation made by Her<lb/>Majesty's Government, and as early as<lb/>possible to move the appointment of<lb/>such a joint Committee of both Houses<lb/>of the Legislature as should ensure the<lb/>adoption of a Scheme of Union, whilst<lb/>the objections to the Quebec Scheme<lb/>were to be carefully weighed and ex<lb break="no"/>amined at the same time by the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>What the precise alterations in that<lb/>Scheme were which would have satisfied<lb/>Mr. Smith His Excellency was never<lb/>able exactly to learn ; but he found that<lb/>representation according to population,<lb/>to which he entertained a strong objec<lb break="no"/>tion, would not be regarded by him as<lb/>an insuperable obstacle to union, should<lb/>a larger share of representation be se<lb break="no"/>cured to New Brunswick in the Upper<lb/>Branch of the proposed Federal Legis<lb break="no"/>lature.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     His Excellency, considering that 
     <lb/>the speedy accomplishment of a mea<lb break="no"/>sure of union was now a matter of al<lb break="no"/>most absolute certainty, addressed to<lb/>Mr. Smith, on the 7th March, a letter<lb/>of which the following is an extract :—<lb/>

            <p>
     " I have been much gratified, though

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> did not contradict the pre<lb break="no"/>sumption on which this letter was<lb/>founded, and verbally acknowledged<lb/>the terms in which His Excellency<lb/>therein spoke of his conduct.<lb/>

            <p>
     Having thus, therefore, as he presum<lb break="no"/>ed, ascertained that his Council were<lb/>not indisposed in their own way, and at<lb/>their own time, to recommend to the<lb/>Legislature the adoption of an union<lb/>policy, His Excellency felt that much<lb/>forbearance was required in order that<lb/>this change of course might be accom<lb break="no"/>plished in the manner which the Coun<lb break="no"/>cil might think least injurious to<lb/>themselves, and most calculated to en<lb break="no"/>sure the ultimate success of the measure ;<lb/>and with this view he sought to secure the<lb/>co-operation of some of the leading<lb/>friends of Confederation ordinarily hostile<lb/>to the Government.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     In doing so it was His Excellency's

     of his administration in the conduct of a        
     <lb/>difficult enterprise, believing it to be of<lb/>the highest importance that this measure<lb/>should not be carried as a mere party tri<lb break="no"/>umph, but as the expression of a national<lb/>wish ; nor did he suppose that the course<lb/>he then took could be misunderstood by<lb/>those in whose interests it was taken.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     It is true that Mr. Smith, and on one 
     <lb/>
     occasion one other member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, remonstrated against this course, 
     <lb/>
     and Mr. Smith observed that it was un<lb break="no"/>necessary, as he felt that he could carry 
     <lb/>
     out his plan without any assistance from 
     <lb/>
     his political opponents, an assertion the 
     <lb/>
     correctness of which His Excellency 
     <lb/>at the time felt disposed to ques<lb break="no"/>tion, and which, even if accurate,<lb/>appeared to him of doubtful poli<lb break="no"/>cy, as it was desirable the union<lb/>should be accomplished in virtue of as<lb/>general an agreement as possible among<lb/>the leading men of every political section<lb/>in the community ; and His Excellency<lb/>more than once suggested that the prin<lb break="no"/>cipal advocates of Confederation should<lb/>be called upon to meet Mr. Smith and his<lb/>colleagues in order that a line of<lb/>action might be adopted by common con<lb break="no"/>sent on a question of such general<lb/>importance, and with regard to which,<lb/>now that the Government had adopt<lb break="no"/>ed the principle of union, it seemed<lb/>difficult to believe that a common under<lb break="no"/>standing might not be reached.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the distinct understanding, there<lb break="no"/>fore, that the Government would endeav<lb break="no"/>or to procure the passage through the<lb/>Legislature of resolutions affirmative of<lb/>the principle of union, and with the im<lb break="no"/>pression that an address praying Her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty to move the Imperial Parliament to<lb/>give effect to such resolutions was to be<lb/>subsequently adopted His Excellency felt<lb/>justified in omitting, at the request of his<lb/>Council, from his speech at the opening<lb/>of the Session the strong recommendation<lb/>of union which he would otherwise have<lb/>felt it his duty to introduce, but the res<lb break="no"/>ponsibility for which his Ministers felt<lb/>they could not then assume.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>To what extent the other members of<lb/>the Executive Council agreed with their<lb/>President, His Excellency cannot say, as<lb/>except on a few occasions in February,<lb/>he had little communication with any of<lb/>them on the subject ; but His Excellency<lb/>is convinced that when Mr. Smith return<lb break="no"/>ed to Fredericton on the 5th March, he<lb/>imagined that he would be able to<lb/>carry out the pledges he had given,<lb/>and that he fully intended to do so.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Since the commencement of the Ses<lb break="no"/>sion, however, the course of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment has shown little indication of a<lb/>movement in this direction.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency has never ceased to<lb/>urge on Mr. Smith, the expediency, and<lb/>indeed necessity of a bold avowal of his<lb/>intended policy ; not has he failed to ex<lb break="no"/>press his apprehensions as to the conse<lb break="no"/>quences of delay in doing so, believing<lb/>that until that avowal was made, Mr.<lb/>Smith would become daily more and more<lb/>entangled in contradictory pledges, from<lb/>which he would find it impossible to ex<lb break="no"/>tricate himself, and which might act<lb/>most prejudicially on the prospects of the<lb/>cause ; whilst at any time circumstances<lb/>might call for such action on the part of<lb/>His Excellency as would place him in a<lb/>position of apparent antagonism to his<lb/>Council and prove productive of very<lb/>serious embarrassment. This course,<lb/>however, the Government did not pur<lb break="no"/>sue, and it became more and more clearly<lb/>
      

            <cb/>
        
apparent to His Excellency that they<lb/>lacked the power—he will not suppose<lb/>they lacked the will—to carry out their<lb/>original intentions. Their hostility to<lb/>the particular form of union agreed to at<lb/>Quebec, was distinct and emphatic,<lb/>whilst their approval of even an abstract<lb/>union of an indefinite character, because<lb/>daily more vague and uncertain."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Declarations were publicly made that<lb/>no proposition for an Union would be<lb/>made during the present Session, and<lb/>arguments were reported to be used by<lb/>members of the Government and their<lb/>supporters, which were not only against<lb/>the Quebec Scheme, but equally directed<lb/>against any plan of whatever description,<lb/>for a closer Union with Canada.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On more than one occasion His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency noticed these facts to Mr. Smith,<lb/>who replied that the reports received by<lb/>His Excellency as to the language used<lb/>were inaccurate ; and that it was desirable<lb/>not to indicate too soon the line he meant<lb/>to take, as it would give an advantage to<lb/>his opponents and might estrange some<lb/>of his friends."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In the desire to avoid giving<lb/>cause of embarrassment to his Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, and at their request, His Excel<lb break="no"/>lency delayed for nineteen days the re<lb break="no"/>ception of the Address of the Legislative<lb/>Council, in reply to the Speech from<lb/>the Throne ; nor was it until it became<lb/>evident to His Excellency that further<lb/>delay in this respect would seriously<lb/>imperil the harmony of the relations be<lb break="no"/>tween himself and the Legislative<lb/>Council, and the Legislative Council<lb/>and House of Assembly, that he fixed a<lb/>day for its reception.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Mr. Smith</persName> frequently expressed a<lb/>hope that the Lieutenant Governor did<lb/>not entertertain any doubt as to the<lb/>necessity of his intention in carryig<lb/>out to the letter the understanding be<lb break="no"/>tween them, as to the passage of reso<lb break="no"/>lutions on the subject of union<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>At length the presentation of the Ad<lb break="no"/>dress to the Queen by the Legislative<lb/>Council brought the question to a de<lb break="no"/>cided issue.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Up to that time the Government had<lb/>given no public sign of an intention to<lb/>grapple with the question, or to substi<lb break="no"/>tute any amended scheme of union for<lb/>that adopted at Quebec, and the<lb/>Lieutenant Governor in accordance with<lb/>his instruction—and as an officer of the<lb/>Imperial Government—could not but<lb/>feel it his duty to express satisfaction at<lb/>the avowed approval, by one branch of<lb/>the Provincial Legislature, of a policy<lb/>the adoption of which had been recom<lb break="no"/>mended by him in his Sovereign's<lb/>name, and by her command, at the<lb/>commencement of the Session.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>If the Lieutenant Governor's Advisers<lb/>cannot concur in these sentiments, and<lb/>decline to become responsible for their<lb/>utterance by His Excellency, it is no<lb/>doubt their duty to tender, as they have<lb/>done, the resignation of the offices held<lb/>by them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency accepts those resigna<lb break="no"/>tions with regret. His relations with<lb/>his Advisers during the past year have<lb/>been harmonious and cordial ;—for<lb/>many among their number he enter<lb break="no"/>tains strong feelings of personal esteem ;<lb/>nor can he forget to acknowledge the<lb/>attention which his views have gener<lb break="no"/>ally received at their hands, or the<lb/>readiness with which his wishes have<lb/>on most occasions been met by them.<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
         

     But he has no doubt, as to the course 
     <lb/>which it is his duty to pursue in obedi<lb break="no"/>ence to his Sovereign's commands, and<lb/>in the interests of the people of British<lb/>America.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     His Excellency may be in error, but 
     <lb/>he believes that vast change has<lb/>already taken place in the opinions<lb/>held on this subject in New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick. He fully anticipates that the<lb/>House of Assembly will yet return a<lb/>response to the communication made to<lb/>them not less favourable to the principle<lb/>of Union than that given by the Upper<lb/>House ; and in any event, he relies<lb/>with confidence on the desire of a<lb/>great majority of the people of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince to aid in building up a powerful<lb/>and prosperous Nation, under the sover<lb break="no"/>eignty of the British Crown. To their<lb/>verdict His Excellency is ready and will<lb break="no"/>ing to appeal.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     The Council also express dissatisfac<lb break="no"/>tion at His Excellency's personal onduct<lb/>in regard to his relations with them.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     That is a matter of infinitely less im<lb break="no"/>portance to the public, and will be very 
     <lb/>shortly dealt with by His Excellency, al<lb break="no"/>though as His Excellency has met at<lb/>all times with the utmost courtesy<lb/>and consideration from the Members of<lb/>his Government, it would be a source<lb/>of sincere regret to him to believe that<lb/>he was justly liable to any imputation of<lb/>such a nature.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>That a leading member of the Oppo<lb break="no"/>sition was more than once communicated<lb/>with by His Excellency, is perfectly<lb/>true. This communication was made<lb/>with Mr. Smith's full knowledge, and in<lb/>the believe on His Excellency's part, that<lb/>it would facilitate Mr. Smith's accom<lb/>plishment of the end in view. The gen<lb break="no"/>tleman in question met Mr. Smith at<lb/>Government House on the 5th of Match,<lb/>and His Excellency believes that a very<lb/>protracted interview subsequently took<lb/>place between them ; nor was it until a<lb/>very late period that His Excellency re<lb break="no"/>linquished the hope of seeing a combina<lb break="no"/>tion effected to smooth the passage of the<lb/>contemplated Resolutions.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency things it right also to<lb/>state, that his reply was prepared by him<lb break="no"/>self alone, and that his Council are in er<lb break="no"/>ror in supposing that its terms were the<lb/>subject of advice from any member of<lb/>the Opposition.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency does not admit the<lb/>entire accuracy of Mr. Smith's report of<lb/>his conversations with him, appended to<lb/>the Minute of Council, but at the same<lb/>time readily acknowledges that the differ<lb break="no"/>ence between his own impression of those<lb/>conversations and that of Mr. Smith, is<lb/>only such as might naturally arise under<lb/>the circumstances. Mr. Smith has, how<lb break="no"/>ever, omitted to state that at his first<lb/>interview His Excellency pointed out, as<lb/>he had frequently done before, the embar<lb break="no"/>rassing results of the non-avowal of his<lb/>Union policy, and observed that the Leg<lb break="no"/>islative Council had now passed an Ad<lb break="no"/>dress, at the adoption of which he should<lb/>probably feel obligated to express satisfac<lb break="no"/>tion.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Governor of course<lb/>feels that previous communication between<lb/>himself and his Advisers as to any step he<lb/>is about to take, is, when practicable,<lb/>both desirable and essential, and it<lb/>was His Excellency's full intention to<lb/>have afforded the Council ample oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity for the consideration of his Reply,<lb/>an intention which he much regrets that<lb/>accident should have frustrated.<lb/>
