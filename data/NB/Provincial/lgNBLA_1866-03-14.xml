<!-- GL, 2016-11-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

            <!--<p> Fredericton and York would be ruined: <lb/>
unless Smith was crushed, the seat of <lb/>
Government would be lost. It might be <lb/>
thought that from the position the hon<lb/>
member had assumed it denouncing the <lb/>
Government, that he was one of the most <lb/>
extraordinary and immaculate men that <lb/>
ever lived. When he spoke
of men hold<lb break="no"/>ing on to office tor merely selfish motives. <lb/>
he should have recollected that they had <lb/>
been in Government together, and he (At<lb break="no"/>torney General) thought that the
course of <lb/>
his political life would contrast
favorably <lb/>
with that of the member for York. He <lb/>
would ask him (Mr.F.) to point out one in <lb/>
stance when he had left a
Government <lb/>
voluntarily, for conscience sake.
He<lb/>
could not. But he (Attorney General) <lb/>
could remember a time when he was oust<lb break="no"/>ed out of a Government. The mover of <lb/>
this amendment spoke of tha Govern<lb break="no"/>ment as condemned before the country, <lb/>
and holding on to office against
the wishes <lb/>
of the people. They could not if they
<lb/>
would ; they would not it they could. <lb/>
They were in the hands of the
people ; <lb/>
they must give a strict account
of their <lb/>
administration. It was the privilege
of <lb/>
the people to watch narrowly the acts of <lb/>
those in power, for the tendency of power <lb/>
was aggressive, and it was their
duty to <lb/>
look closely that these men who
held high <lb/>
positions fulfilled their trust.
If, when <lb/>
they had given an account of their actions,<lb/>
the peope should pronounce a
verdict <lb/>
against the Government, they would <lb/>
cheerfully resign office. But while it was <lb/>
the duty of the people to watch closely <lb/>
the acts of men in power, it was no
less <lb/>
their duty, when it was sought
to oust <lb/>
them out of office, to watch
narrowly the <lb/>
motives
of those men who were endeavor- <lb break="maybe"/>
ing to accomplish that object. He
put it <lb/>
to the hon. members, he put it
to the <lb/>
country, if the mover of this amendment <lb/>
was actuated by a spirit of patriotism, <lb/>
whether this was the time for
him to take <lb/>
the course he had. If it was true, as he <lb/>
hoped to God it was not true,
that the <lb/>
country was threatened with a hostile in<lb break="no"/>vasion, what would be the position
of this <lb/>
House, what would be the
position of the <lb/>
country, if this vote of want of confidence
<lb/>
was carried? There would be only two ways
<lb/>
to pursue ; one was to dissolve the House, <lb/>
or a new Government would have to come <lb/>
in, and the House would have to be pro<lb break="no"/>rogued to allow members of the new ad<lb break="no"/>ministration to stand their elections.
<lb/>
Was this the time to plunge the country <lb/>
into all the excitement of an election, or <lb/>
to leave the country without a Govern<lb break="no"/>ment when, as it had been said, the coun<lb break="no"/>try was in a state of terror and suspense,
<lb/>
in danger of invasion from lawless con<lb break="no"/>spirators? <lb/>

            </p>
            <p> He had asked the mover why he had <lb/>
struck out that portion of the Amend<lb break="no"/>ment that referred to the lawless conspi<lb break="no"/>rators from the neighboring Republic, <lb/>
and he had given as a reason, because <lb/>
some friend was afraid that the allusion <lb/>
might give offence to the United
States ! <lb/>
Was
there any one so weak and childish
<lb/>
as to believe that ? Where were the <lb/>
men who were afraid to give offence to
<lb/>
the United States ? No ; that
was not <lb/>
the reason. He had seen, when the mem<lb break="no"/>ber of Carleton (Mr. Lindsay) made last <lb/>
Saturday, that violent speech against
the <lb/>
Government in which he pictured the <lb/>
terror and alarm in the country, and de<lb break="no"/>manded to know what the Government<lb/>
were doing for its defence, what was the<lb/>
game that they were going to play.<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>  
            <p> They had shown their hands, however, <lb/>
and quickly. He (Attorney
General) was<lb/>
satisfied that what he then stated the<lb/>
Government had done to meet any dan<lb break="no"/>ger that might be
threatened, had shown <lb/>
that they were thoroughly awake
to the <lb/>
emergency and were prepared to do <lb/>
their duty. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The Attorney General then proceeded <lb/>
at length, to show that the authorities <lb/>
had kept a most careful watch over <lb/>
the safety of the Province ; that the <lb/>
Governor had been in constant communi<lb break="no"/>cation to the British Minister
at Wash<lb break="no"/>ington—Sir Frederick Bruce ;—that
the <lb/>
Government had signified their readiness <lb/>
to put the whole resources of the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince, at the disposal of the
authorities, <lb/>
to case of actual emergency. A war <lb/>
steamer had been sent from Halifax, and <lb/>
now lay at the harbor of St.
John ; steps <lb/>
had been taken to distribute
arms through <lb/>
out the Province ; that, in
Carleton— one <lb/>
whose members had so ﬁercely
denounced <lb/>
the Government— there were, at
this pre<lb break="no"/>sent time, five hundred rifles
and ten <lb/>
thousand rounds of ball ammunition ; <lb/>
and that the Governor, acting in con<lb break="no"/>junction with Col. Cole, and General
<lb/>
Doyle, were taking proper and efficient <lb/>
measures for the protection of St. John. <lb/>
He would ask the House, had the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment been recreant to their duty
? He <lb/>
would ask any hon. member to point out <lb/>
what more the Government could do than <lb/>
they had already done. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The Attorney General went on to say <lb/>
that he did not intend, that afternoon,
to <lb/>
occupy the attention of the House much <lb/>
longer, but he intended, on another occa<lb break="no"/>sion, to take up the charges in
the long <lb/>
bill of indictment preferred against the <lb/>
Government by the member of York, <lb/>
seriatim. After he had met and answer<lb break="no"/>ed those charges, he would ask
the House <lb/>
if the Government were not entitled to <lb/>
their conﬁdence ? He then proceeded
to <lb/>
refer generally to some of the points he <lb/>
intended to take up. and alluded particu<lb break="no"/>larly to the question of Union
and
the <lb/>
Quebec Scheme. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> [Mr. Desbrisay said he would like to <lb/>
know distinctly whether the
Government <lb/>
had or had not a scheme which they in<lb break="no"/>tended to submit to the House
?] <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Attorney General—If the hon. member <lb/>
of Kent had only asked that question <lb/>
before he had gone over to the other <lb/>
side, he might have answered him. It <lb/>
had been asked—he proceeded to
say—if <lb/>
he was against a Union with Canada. <lb/>
He did not know that he was against <lb/>
Union, if an equitable arrangement
could <lb/>
be made ; but this he did know, that he <lb/>
was as strongly opposed to the Quebec <lb/>
Scheme as ever. He was opposed to <lb/>
building up Upper and Lower
Canada at <lb/>
the expense of New Brunswick. He
did <lb/>
not think it was right that they should <lb/>
surrender up their independence, delu<lb break="no"/>ding them with the idea of a
grand <lb/>
nationality. He charged it against
the <lb/>
Delegates who had gone to
Quebec, <lb/>
that they refused to see any objection to <lb/>
the scheme, or to admit that it could be <lb/>
altered for the better ; it was
with them <lb/>
all " coleur de rose." <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The House
was then adjourned until <lb/>
to-morrow at ten o'clock.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> A. A. <lb/>

            <fw type="dateline"> WEDNESDAY,
MARCH 14th <lb/>
            </fw>

            <p> HON. MR.
SMITH brought in a Bill <lb/>
           
            <cb/>
           
 to revive and continue an Act in the Re<lb break="no"/>vised Statutes concerning the Export <lb/>
Duty on Lumber, and said he
was de<lb break="no"/>sirous that the Rules of the House should <lb/>
be suspended in order to enable
them <lb/>
to go into Committee on this Bill, as <lb/>
there was no provision at present
for <lb/>
collecting this duty.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
MR. MCMILLAN said, although it
was <lb/>
a matter of importance which should be <lb/>
attended to at once, yet they should
not <lb/>
go into Committee upon it in the absence <lb/>
of so many of the legal gentlemen. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON. MR. SMITH would be glad to <lb/>
see every member in his place.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
MR. WILMOT had very little
doubt <lb/>
about the power of the Legislature, and <lb/>
he thought that it was absolutely
neces<lb break="no"/>sary that this $60,000 which they
had <lb/>
collected since the old law had expired <lb/>
should not be lost. It was an oversight <lb/>
it should be brought forward and
reme<lb break="no"/>died immediately. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
Mr. MCCLELAN said this oversight <lb/>
had been brought to their knowledge <lb/>
yesterday by the hon. member for York. <lb/>
(Mr. Fisher) and as there were
legal <lb/>
questions involved in it there should be <lb/>
a call of the House, or have
the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the Bill
postponed until <lb/>
to-morrow morning, which would be <lb/>
rushing the Bill through very speedily.
<lb/>
HON. MR. SMITH said he hoped all <lb/>
political feelings would be thrown aside <lb/>
in discussing this subject,
for it was de<lb break="no"/>sirable to pass this law as soon
as pos<lb break="no"/>sible, to prevent. law-suits being enter<lb break="no"/>ed into by persons desirous of getting <lb/>
this money back. His hon. friend, Mr. <lb/>
Cudlip, had paid during the past year  <lb/>
£1100 as export duty on lumber, and <lb/>
another party in the County of Kent had <lb/>
paid £300. These men say that this
<lb/>
money does not belong to them, al<lb break="no"/>though they paid that money down ; but <lb/>
it rather belongs to every man who con<lb break="no"/>tributed to the production of the deals,
<lb/>
because the price of deals was affected <lb/>by it. This was not the ﬁrst case
of re<lb break="no"/>trospective legislation. Some years ago
<lb/>
three Commissioners were
appointed in <lb/>
the County of Westmorland to construct <lb/>a Canal, and these Commissioners, as<lb break="no"/>suming they were properly appointed, <lb/>
went on with the work, and expended <lb/>
three or four thousand pounds ; but, in <lb/>
consequence of some legal difficulty, the <lb/>
case was brought before Judge Parker,
<lb/>
and he decided the Government had no <lb/>power to appoint them. Therefore, <lb/>
every man upon whose land they had <lb/>
gone could bring an action for trespass <lb/>
against them, involving the whole
coun<lb break="no"/>try in trouble. To prevent this an Act <lb/>
was passed in this House legalizing the <lb/>
acts of those Commissioners. That was <lb/>
a case similar to the present, and al<lb break="no"/>though it was exceptional legislation, <lb/>
it should be adopted when it tends to <lb/>
the public interest. He would now <lb/>
move that the Bill be committed.
<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> MR FISHER said, passing a law for <lb/>
the future is one thing, and passing a <lb/>
law to cover all the past is
another. It <lb/>
would be better to separate these two <lb/>
propositions. They had better provide <lb/>
a law for the future and let the
other <lb/>
matter stand over a few days, until we <lb/>
have more time to consider it, for it is a <lb/>
question of great importance,
and will <lb/>
be a precedent for future legislation. If
<lb/>
this was a case of so much emergency, <lb/>
why did not they call the Legislature <lb/>
together in September, at which
time <lb/>
they state they first discovered
it ? They <lb/>
should have called the Legislature
to<lb break="no"/><pb n="15" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-03-14_Page_015.jpg"/>gether earlier, and not postponed it un<lb break="no"/>til this late period, when they
knew at <lb/>
that time that a vast amount of revenue <lb/>
was jeopardous. It was only a few <lb/>
weeks ago that he discovered it,
and it <lb/>
was no time now to go into a discussion <lb/>
regarding retrospective legislation, when <lb/>
they were already engaged in another <lb/>
discussion. If it is proper in principle <lb/>
it can as well pass five days hence. Let
<lb/>
the action of public opinion act
upon it. <lb/>
Let us have time to consider
whether or <lb/>
no by adopting an <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post facto</hi> law, we <lb/>
launch a principle that violates every <lb/>
principle of right and wrong, and may <lb/>
alter all the contracts in the country. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. GILBERT
was prepared to assist <lb/>
the Government in regard to passing
a<lb/>
law for the future ; but the consideration <lb/>
of the great principle of passing
an <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex <lb/>
post facto</hi> law, making lawful what was <lb/>
before unlawful, would take up a great <lb/>
deal of time in the discussion.
The case <lb/>
mentioned by the Attorney General was <lb/>
agreed to by all the parties interested
in <lb/>
it. He would suggest to the Attorney <lb/>
General to exclude the <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post facto</hi> part <lb/>
from the Bill, and only
legislate for the <lb/>
future, until they had time to consider <lb/>
whether this retrospective legislation
<lb/>
would not take away the rights of par<lb break="no"/>ties and lead to it great deal of com<lb break="no"/>plaint. <lb/>
            </p>
  
            <p> MR NEEDHAM
said it did not in<lb break="no"/>volve a great principle, and the
sooner <lb/>
they passed this Bill the
better. If they <lb/>
delayed this matter it might cost them <lb/>
trouble, for parties who paid
this money <lb/>
might bring an action against the Deputy <lb/>
Treasurer, or the Treasurer who received
<lb/>
it, and those officers must be protected, <lb/>
which would cause a great expense to this <lb/>
country. But they say it is not Consti<lb break="no"/>tutional to pass an <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post
facto</hi> law, as if <lb/>
there could be any thing in the Constitu<lb break="no"/>tion against it. There are
hundreds of <lb/>
laws in England, and hundreds of laws in <lb/>
our own country that are <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post
facto</hi>. <lb/>
The only thing that can be said
is, that it <lb/>
is exceptional legislation, and done only <lb/>
in extreme cases, when
the exigencies of <lb/>
the case requires it. If it was
unconsti<lb break="no"/>tutional it never could be done.
This <lb/>
Legislature has the power to pass
this <lb/>
Bill, and after they pass it the
Bill be<lb break="no"/>comes law and cannot be unconstitutional. <lb/>
If the House is going to pass
this Bill to <lb/>
legalize the collection of export
duty, it is <lb/>
their duty to do it at once. <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> HON. MR CUDLIP—If the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment have committed an error in regard
<lb/>
to this matter, they are responsible to the <lb/>
people for it. This act does not condone <lb/>
it. They were there to take care of the <lb/>
public interest, that no wrong should
be <lb/>
done to the people. A great deal of this <lb/>
money would go into the pockets of the <lb/>
men who shipped the deals, and would be <lb/>
a clear profit to them. That money when <lb/>
paid, was considered to have been paid ac<lb break="no"/>cording to law. No man will pay this export <lb/>
duty now, and if they delayed the passage
<lb/>
of this law it would open a door for itiga<lb break="no"/>tion. He did not wish to get back the <lb/>
money he had paid, but he wished to see <lb/>
this <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post facto</hi> law passed in
order to <lb/>
retain the money in the public chest. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. ANGLIN
said his hon. colleague <lb/>
had stated nearly all of what he had in<lb break="no"/>tended to say. He was happy to see that <lb/>
some of the members of the opposition <lb/>
were disposed to deal fairly, in this case. <lb/>
If they passed this Bill no man
could com<lb break="no"/>plain that injustice had been done him. <lb/>
A shipper going to ship deals will ask <lb/>
what are the charges, and adding those <lb/>
           
            <cb/> 
          
 charges to the export duty, he
will con<lb break="no"/>sider what he can afford to give
for them. <lb/>
This money does not belong to the shipper.
<lb/>
If it belongs to any one but the
Province, <lb/>
it belongs to everyone that has
been con<lb break="no"/>cerned in the transaction ; and
it would <lb/>
be impossible, by any means, to divide <lb/>
that money among them all. This export <lb/>
duty is put on in the place of stumpage.<lb/>
Suppose a man cut logs on your farm with<lb break="no"/>out an agreement to pay stumpage.
If <lb/>
you could obtain stumpage it
would be <lb/>
doing that man no wrong. The law, it <lb/>
appears, is a Revenue Bill, but it is in lieu <lb/>
of stumpage. He had no interest
in the <lb/>
matter, but he wished to have it settled. <lb/>
This oversight was very much to be
re<lb break="no"/>gretted. If the Government were
to <lb/>
blame he would take his share, for it was <lb/>
as much his business as it was the busi<lb break="no"/>ness of the President of the
Council, or <lb/>
any other member, to look into
the mat<lb break="no"/>ter. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> MR. LINDSAY
said it was admitted by <lb/>
a member of the Government that they <lb/>
knew of it in September. Why, then, <lb/>
was not this Bill brought in the first day <lb/>
of the Session. If this question
had not <lb/>
been brought up by the hon. mover of the <lb/>
amendment to the Address, it
would not <lb/>
have been taken up until the Address had <lb/>
passed. If the Government had said on <lb/>
the first day of the Session
that this law <lb/>
had expired, in consequence of being over<lb break="no"/>looked, and had brought in this Bill then, <lb/>
he would have given them credit
for it. <lb/>
for he thought no time should be
lost in <lb/>
passing this Bill. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. KERR
said it was very evident that <lb/>
every Deputy Treasurer was
liable to have <lb/>
on action brought against him for money <lb/>
received as export duty, if they delayed <lb/>
the passage of this Bill, for in many parts <lb/>
of' the Province there may be
parties who <lb/>
think they are hardly dealt with,
and <lb/>
they, discovering that something had <lb/>
been done contrary to law, may bring an <lb/>
action against the officers of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment to recover their money. The pas<lb break="no"/>sage of this Bill will not be the cause of <lb/>
any hardship to any individual. A retro<lb break="no"/>spective law in punish a man might be <lb/>
considered a hardship, but this
law to <lb/>
continue another law will do injustice to <lb/>
none. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY said he <lb/>
took a. different view in regard to this <lb/>
from any he had heard expressed. He <lb/>
was against any export duty whatever, <lb/>
for it was his opinion that no
expert duty <lb/>
should be imposed upon lumber shipped <lb/>
in this Province. He had always intend<lb break="no"/>ed when a Bill came before them
to revive <lb/>
that law to oppose it. This
country <lb/>
ought not to trammel the exportation of <lb/>
lumber by imposing an export duty at all. <lb/>
It is said that is in the place of stumpage,
<lb/>
but we have to pay mileage in place of <lb/>
stumpage ; we have to pay our £20
a mile <lb/>
for the ground on which we lumber,
be<lb break="no"/>sides the export duty. It was very well <lb/>
to hear one side of the story, but he could <lb/>
tell them of men who had shipped lumber <lb/>
for the last four years, and had received <lb/>
half price for it, and he would ask whether <lb/>
it would be a dishonor for those
men to <lb/>
take the export duty. The hon. member <lb/>
of the Government may speak of the £1100 <lb/>
he has paid, but he stands in a different <lb/>
position from the lumber merchant. He <lb/>
is a broker, and does not give his
eighteen <lb/>
months credit, as other men in the coun<lb break="no"/>try do ; he receives an order from the <lb/>
other side of the Atlantic, and
he fills it.<lb/>
That law ought to exempt logs cut on<lb/>
private lands. He would oppose this<lb/>
           
            <cb/>
          
 law on principle,
for these ought to be no <lb/>
export duty. The Government should <lb/>
raise their revenue in some
other way <lb/>
than by taxing an article, the
property <lb/>
of poor men. The lumbermen toil hard, <lb/>
and use their energies from daylight
un<lb break="no"/>til dark, and they should be protected
in <lb/>
their employment. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. CONNELL said that it was very <lb/>
evident that a different law ought
to ex<lb break="no"/>ist, which would not only be a benefit to<lb/>
the revenue but to the country ; but it <lb/>
was no time just now to create difficulties <lb/>
in regard to the matter. A law
to col<lb break="no"/>lect this export duty should be passed <lb/>
immediately, but more time should be <lb/>
given to this retrospective legislation.
A <lb/>
like circumstance occurred, he thought, <lb/>
in 1827. when the Legislature was called <lb/>
together to remedy the defect, and called <lb/>
again five or six weeks after to transact <lb/>
the business
of the Session. He then <lb/>
mentioned a case which had occurred <lb/>
some time ago, in which money had been <lb/>
paid by individuals who alleged they
had <lb/>
no right to pay it. The
controversy went <lb/>
on for some time, but after a calm review <lb/>
of the matter the principal and interest <lb/>
had to be repaid. If, after due consider<lb break="no"/>ation, we ﬁnd we have the right
to retain <lb/>
this money, we had better exercise that <lb/>
right ; but if it be wrong in
principle to <lb/>
do so, then no money consideration <lb/>
should induce us to do it. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> MR. CAIE
said the important question <lb/>
was, whether the money which they had <lb/>
paid into the Treasury last year should
<lb/>
be refunded or not. He was one of those
<lb/>
who had paid into the Treasury $1200. <lb/>
and he considered he would be
acting un<lb break="no"/>fairly to withdraw that money,
for it <lb/>
should be put on the roads and bridges. <lb/>
If they got their money back, he would <lb/>
consider it Provincial money,
and should <lb/>
appropriate it to that purpose. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. FRASER said he differed from <lb/>
the hon. member from the County of <lb/>
York (Mr. Fisher) in regard to
the law, <lb/>
in this matter. He would like to ask the <lb/>
hon. member for the County of Kent, at <lb/>
what time he became aware the law for <lb/>
collecting an export duty on lumber had <lb/>
expired. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY said he <lb/>
was not aware of it until yesterday
even<lb break="no"/>ing, when it was brought forward by Mr. <lb/>
Fisher. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. FRASER—Then at the time the <lb/>
hon. member was making his
calculations <lb/>
regarding the men he supplied, and the <lb/>
men he purchased lumber from, the ex<lb break="no"/>port duty entered into his
calculations, <lb/>
and if they paid him the money back, it <lb/>
would not be his money, and if
he does <lb/>
get it back, it ought to go on the Roads <lb/>
(Mr. Desbrisay.—Let it go so then.) <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> He would now show that although the <lb/>
principle of retrospective
legislation is in <lb/>
many cases injurious, yet that does not <lb/>
come in here at all, where men pay the <lb/>
money. It is only when a man refuses
to <lb/>
pay it, or where it subjects the
party to a <lb/>
penalty, that it becomes retrospective. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> To furnish an analagous case, he quoted <lb/>
Dwarris on Statutes, 547 : <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> “ An
Act of Parliament made to cor<lb break="no"/>rect an Error by omission in a former Sta<lb break="no"/>tute of the same Session, relates back to <lb/>
the time when the first act
passed, and <lb/>
the two must be taken together, as if <lb/>
they were one and the same act, and the <lb/>
ﬁrst must be read as containing in itself, <lb/>
in words, the amendment supplied by <lb/>
the last ; therefore goods exported before <lb/>
the second act passed, but only shipped <lb/>
           

            <pb n="16" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-03-14_Page_016.jpg"/>
          
 on board before the ﬁrst passed, were
held <lb/>
liable to duties subsequently imposed on <lb/>
the exportation of goods." <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> To shew that acts of this nature, al<lb break="no"/>though exceptional, are fully recognized <lb/>
in England, he quoted the law
bearing on <lb/>
that question.
Dwarris 548: <lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> " By an Imperial Statute it is enacted <lb/>
that where any Bill shall be introduced <lb/>
into any Session of Parliament for the <lb/>
continuance of any act which
would ex<lb break="no"/>pire in such session, and if such so shall <lb/>
have expired before the bill for
continu<lb break="no"/>ing the same shall have received the Roy<lb break="no"/>al Assent, such continuing act <hi rendition="simple:italic">shall
be <lb/>
deemed to have effect from the date of the <lb/>
expiration of the act intended
to be conti<lb break="no"/>nued—except it shall be otherwise
provi<lb break="no"/>ded in such continuing act—but nothing <lb/>
herein contained shall extend to
effect any <lb/>
person with any punishment,
penalty or <lb/>
forfeiture, by reason of anything done <lb/>
contrary to the provisions of
the act conti<lb break="no"/>nued, between the expiration of the same <lb/>
and the date at which the act
continuing <lb/>
the same shall receive the Royal
Assent.</hi>" <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> MR.
MCCLELAN said as this was an <lb/>
important matter, they should not hurry <lb/>
it on, for the passage of this <hi rendition="simple:italic">expost facto</hi> <lb/>
act might lead to litigation instead
of pre<lb break="no"/>venting it. The reason he asked for de<lb break="no"/>lay was that the legal gentleman
might <lb/>
concur in pursuing some definite
course. <lb/>
He was ready to unite with the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment in remedying the evil ; he did not <lb/>
impute improper motives to them, but
<lb/>
thought it a matter of neglect, for which <lb/>
they were responsible. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. GILBERT said that connecting <lb/>
the two bills together might have the ef<lb break="no"/>fect of preventing
their receiving the Roy<lb break="no"/>al Assent. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON.
MR SMITH said it was a matter <lb/>
of internal concern in our own jurisdic<lb break="no"/>tion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. MCCLELAN asked if any protests <lb/>
had been entered against the payment of <lb/>
these debts. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HON MR.
SMITH was not aware of<lb/>
any such case. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The resolution was then carried. <lb/>
            </p>
  <div type="section"> 
            <head> HOUSE
IN COMMITTEE ON THE BILL. <lb/>
            </head>

            <p> MR. WILMOT said he had had some <lb/>
experience in the Crown Land Office, ha<lb break="no"/>ving been in the office for a
number of <lb/>
years, and he had no difficulty in collect<lb break="no"/>ing stumpage ; he had given collectors a <lb/>
certain per-centage upon all lumber cut <lb/>
upon unlicensed land. They
brought no <lb/>
bills, and the revenue
increased. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. FISHER said he had no faith in <lb/>
the whole timber system. It had the ef<lb break="no"/>fect to encourage inordinate
lumbering. <lb/>
Every square mile they kept for lumber<lb break="no"/>ing on, brought them in four or live dol<lb break="no"/>lars a year for stumpage ; but
if they sold <lb/>
300 acres, it brought them in a principal <lb/>
that pays £4 10s. a year for ever, and if <lb/>
the man who buys it does not use it,
he <lb/>
pays the wild land tax besides. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> It has been said, In regard to this Bill,<lb/>
that it is unconstitutional, and
again, that <lb/>
it is constitutional. Every alteration <lb/>
made in the law, of any kind, alters the <lb/>
Constitution in that respect ;
for the mo<lb break="no"/>ment a new law passes, it alters the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution to the extent of that
law. We<lb/>
 know, such is the power of
Parliament, <lb/>
that it can pass any act it pleases,
and <lb/>
that act becomes law ; and when it comes <lb/>
into operation it changes, so far, the laws<lb/>
            
            <cb/>   
        
 that govern this country. The power of <lb/>
the Legislature is unlimited,
and when it <lb/>
passes a law every one must obey
it. <lb/>
My hon. friend spoke about the
United <lb/>
States. There, the people reserve to <lb/>
themselves certain powers, and
they com<lb break="no"/>municate certain powers to the State <lb/>
Legislature, and certain other
powers to <lb/>
the Federal Legislature. When an act <lb/>
infringes the rights of an individual he <lb/>
has a remedy. A gentleman in the <lb/>
United States undertook to run a steam<lb break="no"/>boat on the Penobscot River ; the Courts <lb/>
of the State of Maine decided against it. <lb/>
He took the case to the higher Courts, <lb/>
and they determined that the
passage up <lb/>
and down the Penobscot River was free <lb/>
to every citizen of the United States, and <lb/>
there was no power in the State
to limit <lb/>
that right. It is not so with Great Bri<lb break="no"/>tain, or with us. The moment a law <lb/>
passes the Three Estates and
receives the <lb/>
sanction of the Queen, it limits,
controls, <lb/>
and amends the Constitution. That is
<lb/>
the difference between the two
Constitu<lb break="no"/>tions. He did not know whether
to sup<lb break="no"/>port the Bill or not. It would
take a <lb/>
great deal to induce him to give up <lb/>
£15,000 of the public revenue ; he must <lb/>
be perfectly satisfied it was
doing right <lb/>
to the country, and that it was fair in <lb/>
principle before doing so. But, if on con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the matter, he should
feel <lb/>
that he was adopting a principle that <lb/>
would do a great public wrong,
this <lb/>
money would be no object in the matter. <lb/>
All he asked for was a little time, so that <lb/>
whatever they did should be the
result of <lb/>
deliberation, irrespective of party, or any<lb break="no"/>thing else. He was prepared to
pass a <lb/>
Bill perpetuating this act ; but, as to the <lb/>
other, it appeared to him, they were <lb/>
going to pass it without common public <lb/>
decency, in regard to all the interests <lb/>
involved, and in regard to all who had <lb/>
paid money throughout the
country. It <lb/>
might be, that, after due consideration
of <lb/>
the matter, we might say, there was no <lb/>
sufficient reason to interfere to prevent <lb/>
this money being paid back.
Common <lb/>
political decency demands us, before pas<lb break="no"/>sing a law of this kind, to take time to <lb/>
consider and hear what every one has to <lb/>
say upon it. Why did not the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment call the Legislature together when <lb/>
they discovered this early in
September ? <lb/>
It appeared to him passing
strange that <lb/>
they did not mention it in the Speech, or <lb/>
brought it up for consideration. They <lb/>
knew about it, but they thought they <lb/>
would slide along, and it would not be <lb/>
known, until the middle of the Session. <lb/>
He would now repeat : pass the act to <lb/>
impose this duty, but give a little more <lb/>
time to consider the retrospective
act. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>HON.
MR. SMITH said, that, in
consi<lb break="no"/>dering a measure of so much importance
<lb/>
to the country, they should have risen <lb/>
above all party feeling. In
bringing this <lb/>
forward, the Government had no view
of <lb/>
exculpating themselves, and they would <lb/>
not shrink from any odium that might be <lb/>
attached to them in consequence
of this <lb/>
neglect; but it was unkind and ungenerous
<lb/>
for his hon. friend to bring in politics in <lb/>
considering this question. When
he says <lb/>
we should allow this thing to stand until <lb/>
the Session is half through, he
is evidently <lb/>
trying to make use of it politically. He <lb/>
was surprised to hear that hon. gentleman <lb/>
state to them three or four times, that he <lb/>
had not made up his mind upon this ques<lb break="no"/>tion, when he knew of it last January.<lb/>
(Mr. Fisher—I did not say it—I said, a<lb/>
few weeks ago.) Well, a few weeks ago.<lb/>
Can you suppose that a man of his expe<lb break="no"/><cb/>rience—when he sees that a great mis<lb break="no"/>take has been made, involving the revenue <lb/>
to the extent of $60,000, and has not <lb/>
arrived at any conclusion as to what <lb/>
should be done—has done his
duty to his <lb/>
country ? He saw that a large
amount <lb/>
of revenue was involved, and he should
<lb/>
have turned the thing in his mind
and <lb/>
arrived at some conclusion about
it. He <lb/>
(Mr. Smith) had no direct interest in this <lb/>
matter himself, but some persons con<lb break="no"/>nected with him had. His brother-in-law <lb/>
was interested to the extent of
£600 <lb/>
or £700. The hon. member from the <lb/>
County of Kent (Mr. DesBrisay)
had <lb/>
taken a different view of the matter, as
<lb/>
his stumpage comes off
private property. <lb/>
The principle is the same ; for
if he buys <lb/>
logs, or private property, he has in view <lb/>
the export duty, and he takes it from the <lb/>
man who gets the lumber.
Therefore, it <lb/>
does not belong to him. He (Mr.
Smith) <lb/>
could not see how the hon. member, who <lb/>
had last addressed them, could hesitate, in <lb/>
justice to the matter.  He feared his <lb/>
mind was influenced by political consi<lb break="no"/>derations. This Bill, which is
for the <lb/>
public interest, should pass speedily, and <lb/>
he trusted the House would support
it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. FISHER said, that, although he <lb/>
had discovered it some weeks ago, he <lb/>
could not make up his mind ; and it was <lb/>
only on Friday last he had looked over <lb/>
the acts to see if it was really so. There<lb break="no"/>fore, in all fairness, they
should have <lb/>
more time to consider it.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR MCMILLAN said the proposition <lb/>
now before them had two points :
one was<lb/>
to continue the export duty, the
other <lb/>
was to withhold money received
as ex<lb break="no"/>port duty. He was not disposed to de<lb break="no"/>prive the country of $60,000 if
it could <lb/>
be held constitutionally. He
would vote <lb/>
for retaining this money in the Treasury,
<lb/>
although it does not relieve
the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment from the humiliating
position they <lb/>
occupy before the country. This
House, <lb/>
and the country would still hold them re<lb break="no"/>sponsible for allowing a law to expire, <lb/>
which was one of the most important <lb/>
means of collecting the revenues of the <lb/>
country. As to the principle of collect<lb break="no"/>ing this export duty, he did not endorse <lb/>
it entirely, although the results were very <lb/>
satisfactory. If they exacted a stumpage <lb/>
duty, a large portion of the lumber cut on <lb/>
the Crown Lands would be cut upon pri<lb break="no"/>vate property, causing the revenue to suf<lb break="no"/>fer largely. <lb/>
            </p>






            <p> MR. L. P. W. DESBRISAY remarked <lb/>
that he did not intend to make
any fur<lb break="no"/>ther opposition to the bill, as it seemed <lb/>
necessary for the interests of
the country <lb/>
that this bill should pass,
although he did <lb/>
think the rights and interests of the peo<lb break="no"/>ple ought to be provided for ; but there <lb/>
seemed to be a majority in the House wil<lb break="no"/>ing to ignore those rights to a certain ex<lb break="no"/>tent in imposing this duty upon lumber <lb/>
cut upon private property. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. GILBERT did not rise for the  <lb/>
purpose of opposing the bill, but
he rose <lb/>
for the purpose of expressing
his regret <lb/>
that they had to resort to ex post facto <lb/>
legislation. He also regretted that it had <lb/>
ever become necessary that a revenue <lb/>
should be raised by taxing the
products of <lb/>
the people, for hardly any
civilized coun<lb break="no"/>try ever resorted to such a mode of rais<lb break="no"/>ing a revenue. He was not aware
that it <lb/>
was so in any other part of Her Majesty's
<lb/>
dominions. If this tax does press severely
<lb/>
upon any portion of the inhabitants of <lb/>
this Province, it does so, more especially
<lb/>
upon
the constituency which he had the <lb/>
honor to
represent, as the lands in that  <lb/>
           

            <pb n="17" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-03-14_Page_017.jpg"/>
          
 County were owned by private indivi<lb break="no"/>duals, with the exception of about
three <lb/>
square miles, and those owners of pri<lb break="no"/>vate property have to submit to
the duty <lb/>
upon the lumber which they
export. But <lb/>
as this duty was absolutely necessary, <lb/>
the Government having on other means of
<lb/>
rasing a revenue, he would not make any <lb/>
opposition because this money was
neces<lb break="no"/>sary for the roads of the country. There<lb/>
was another point he would refer
to. A <lb/>
man who had paid £700 into the Trea<lb break="no"/>sury of the Province, without any law,
<lb/>
may think that this money belongs
to him, <lb/>
and as the Government have thought pro<lb break="no"/>per to pass an <hi rendition="simple:italic">ex post facto</hi> law to take
<lb/>
away what he thinks is his right, he may <lb/>
petition the Governor to withhold his con<lb break="no"/>sent and the bill go home with a suspend<lb break="no"/>ing clause attached to it, and not become <lb/>
law at all. It was for this
reason he had <lb/>
proposed dividing the bill into
two parts, <lb/>
but the Government, having thought pro<lb break="no"/>per to unite them, he should
vote for it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR.
HILL would not take up the time <lb/>
of the House, if it were not
that he should <lb/>
vote for this Bill,
while he did not believe <lb/>
in the policy of an export duty. It was <lb/>
utterly wrong, and there was scarcely
a <lb/>
civilized nation which had adopted the <lb/>
principle, not even the United States, al<lb break="no"/>though it is proposed to put an export duty <lb/>
on cotton and tobacco, because, they say,
<lb/>
they are products in which other
nations <lb/>
cannot compete with them. It is wrong <lb/>
in principle, and has been given up by <lb/>
every enlightened financier in the civil<lb break="no"/>lized world. He would rather see a <lb/>
stumpage collected, by which he thought <lb/>
the revenues of the Province
would be <lb/>
largely increased. In regard to an
<hi rendition="simple:italic">ex<lb break="no"/>post facto</hi> law, it was common to
pass <lb/>
such a law in the United States, and the <lb/>
principle was not unknown here.
If ever <lb/>
there was an <hi rendition="simple:italic">expost facto</hi> Bill that <lb/>
should be passed, it was this one. He <lb/>
should vote for the Bill, although he did <lb/>
not believe in the principle.<lb/>
            </p>
 
            <p> The House divided upon the Bill, upon <lb/>
which the Chairman reported the Bill as <lb/>
agreed to. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The House then took up the order of <lb/>
the day, viz :-<lb/>

            <head>THE
ADDRESS IN ANSWER TO THE SPEECH.<lb/>
            MR
FISHER'S AMENDMENT TO THE FOURTH<lb/>
PARAGRAPH.<lb/>
            </head>

            <p> HON. MR. SMITH
resumed—The <lb/>
House listened to me yesterday about an <lb/>
hour on this “Bill of Indictment." I <lb/>
hope the indulgence of the House
will be <lb/>
extended to me for a short time,
for I<lb/>
will be as brief as the consideration of <lb/>
what is due to myself and the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of which I am a member, will
allow. <lb/>
The House, in passing the Bill which has<lb/>
just been passed, do nothing to justify
<lb/>
the Government. They did not introduce <lb/>
that Bill in this hurried way to attempt <lb/>
to relieve themselves of that
responsibili<lb break="no"/>ty, that censure, if they were entitled to <lb/>
censure, that odium, if it ought
to fall <lb/>
upon them for this unfortunate
occur<lb break="no"/>rence. We are prepared to take all the <lb/>
responsibility of our conduct.
After we <lb/>
have offered an explanation to the House,<lb/>
we stand prepared to receive
their deci<lb break="no"/>sion. I hope I shall not fall into the same <lb/>
error which the hon. mover
of the amend<lb break="no"/>ment did yesterday; that is, he simply <lb/>
gave a re-hash of what he said the day <lb/>
before. It is well known that the elec<lb break="no"/>tion which took place last winter was one <lb/>
of the most anxious active conflicts which <lb/>
has ever taken place in this country. <lb/>
          
            <cb/>
        
 The issue
was of more importance than <lb/>
any other issue that has ever been brought <lb/>
before the people. I complain
that the
<lb/>
dissolution of the House upon the ques<lb break="no"/>tion of Confederation, last winter, was
an
<lb/>
act of tyranny perpetrated by the advisers <lb/>
of His Excellency. That question
had <lb/>
never been brought forward for the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the people—never
been dis<lb break="no"/>cussed before Parliament, and according <lb/>
to the Constitution thee people
are here <lb/>
by their representatives. The
whole <lb/>
country was convulsed by this
election, <lb/>
which took place in midwinter,
and in<lb break="no"/>volved in its results the independence, <lb/>
the rights and liberties of the people, <lb/>
which were to be surrendered up
by
the <lb/>
Government to the rule of men of <lb/>
Canada. The dissolution was an act of<lb/>
base injustice to the people, as
many of <lb/>
them were engaged during the winter
<lb/>
session in lumbering operations. In the <lb/>
County of Charlotte a
considerable por<lb break="no"/>tion of the population were far
away in <lb/>
the wilderness engaged in that
employ<lb break="no"/>ment, and it was impossible for these <lb/>
people to be at the polls. If
the day had <lb/>
happened to have been stormy, the aged <lb/>
people won, by their industry, have made <lb/>
this country what it is, would have had
<lb/>
no opportunity of going to the polls, as <lb/>
many of them had to travel twenty or <lb/>
thirty miles, and giving their vote upon <lb/>
this great question. At the
election the <lb/>
people told the Government in a voice <lb/>
that could not be misunderstood, that
they<lb/>
had forfeited the confidence of
the people, <lb/>
and they had to tender their resignation
<lb/>
to His Excellency, and a new Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was formed the 1st day of
April, <lb/>
and then some of the members had
to
<lb/>
return to their constituents for re-elec<lb break="no"/>tion. Some of them were returned
only <lb/>
one or two days
before the House met, <lb/>
and they had scarcely met forty-eight
<lb/>
hours before complaint were made that <lb/>
we had submitted no measures. I appeal<lb break="no"/>ed to the justice of this House,
and the <lb/>
reply was that we could not be expected <lb/>
to have
measures prepared at so short a <lb/>
notice. We all know that the
Provincial <lb/>
Secretary, though he had been for some <lb/>
time in political life, was experienced, <lb/>
and had no time to prepare to
meet the <lb/>
Legislature, as he was only here two days <lb/>
before the House me,; which gave
him a <lb/>
very short time to prepare the estimates. <lb/>
We were compelled to call the
House <lb/>
together at a time when it was incon<lb break="no"/>venient for the members to
leave their <lb/>
homes, and were anxious to return. <lb/>
Those are the circumstances under
which <lb/>
the Government was formed, and
I think <lb/>
they justify us in calling for
an
indulgent <lb/>
consideration and sympathy in view
of <lb/>
those circumstances. It was the
duty of <lb/>
the Attorney General, now Judge Aller, <lb/>
to see what laws were expiring, but
he <lb/>
was pressed very much by the
duties <lb/>
which devolved upon him, and this Act <lb/>
escaped his notice. We
have no desire <lb/>
to shrink from the responsibility, for we <lb/>
are all liable for whatever act is commit<lb break="no"/>ted by any one member. We all know <lb/>
that it is human to err, but " it is divine <lb/>
to forgive." I was surprised to
see the <lb/>
malicious joy, the delight, which
seemed <lb/>
to beam from the countenance of the <lb/>
learned mover of the amendment, when <lb/>
he stated this oversight. I do not ima<lb break="no"/>gine he embraces all the learning and <lb/>
policy in the country. I do not intend to <lb/>
use the language which he did,
which I <lb/>
consider to be insulting. Was it right <lb/>
for him to evince a satisfaction
yesterday <lb/>
when he thought this country would be <lb/>
        

            <cb/>

 thrown into confusion ? He pretended he<lb/>could not make up his mind regarding <lb/>
this law, retrospective in its operation,<lb/>
when he has known the circumstance for <lb/>
weeks. How different the conduct of the <lb/>
hon. member for Kent, (Mr. Caie.) He <lb/>
rose and said he had paid $1200 into the <lb/>
revenue, and he made up his mind at
once <lb/>
in favor of the Bill, although the first he <lb/>
knew of it was last night. He was ready <lb/>
to render assistance that would preclude
<lb/>
him from getting that money back. It is
<lb/>
the privilege of any member to
move a <lb/>
want of confidence in the Government ; <lb/>
but I think it is the duty of every hon.
<lb/>
member here to watch narrowly and look <lb/>
closely into the motives of the men who  <lb/>
seek
to oust the Government, and see <lb/>
whether they are animated by a spirit of <lb/>
patriotism or not ; whether it is the good <lb/>
of the country they are seeking, or their <lb/>
own aggrandizement. When the hon. <lb/>
member boasts of the way in which he <lb/>
was returned to this House,
without ever <lb/>
leaving his office, for the people rose om<lb break="no"/>nipotent
in their power to place him here, <lb/>
we know something of the agencies em<lb break="no"/>ployed to bring him here. An attack <lb/>
was made upon me ; it was represented to <lb/>
the people of the County of York that I <lb/>
was their enemy, that I was anxious to <lb/>
remove the seat of Government. In<lb/>
corroboration of that it was said, he<lb/>
has taken the Post Office away, and <lb/>
that is the first step towards remov<lb break="no"/>ing the seat of Government. It
was <lb/>
told them at the last general election, <lb/>
that by going for Confederation they <lb/>
would forever secure
the seat of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment at Fredericton. I will ask whether, <lb/>
in debating a question of so much import<lb break="no"/>ance to the people, it was proper and <lb/>
right to bring forward this argument :
"If <lb/>
you do not go into Confederation, the <lb/>
seat of Government is in peril." This <lb/>
great question should be discussed
on <lb/>
broad principles, and reasons
given why <lb/>
a charge in our condition would
be for <lb/>
our good. We find the advocates of the <lb/>
Quebec scheme saying, it is a beautiful <lb/>
scheme, there is no darkness upon it all, <lb/>
and there are no reasons in the world why <lb/>
you should not go into
Confederation. <lb/>
We were told by the hon. mover
of the <lb/>
Amendment that he made certain objec<lb break="no"/>tions to this scheme of Confederation in <lb/>
Quebec—that there were exceptions
to <lb/>
it which he thought was not right. Did <lb/>
they tell the people that there were <lb/>
exceptions to the scheme and
they <lb/>
wanted to submit those exceptions
to<lb/>
them ? Did they say, do not go into
<lb/>
this Union until you have fully
consi<lb break="no"/>dered it ? No. Everything was said
<lb/>
in favor of it. It seemed they entered <lb/>
upon this contest as paid lawyers advo<lb break="no"/>cating the interests of their clients all <lb/>
on one side without looking at the
other <lb/>
at all. If the hon. mover of the Amend<lb break="no"/>ment was seeking the beneﬁt of
the <lb/>
country, he would give us fair play ; <lb/>
that is all we ask. Give the Secretary <lb/>
an opportunity of presenting his ac<lb break="no"/>counts to the House and I do not hesi<lb break="no"/>tate to say they
will be presented in a <lb/>
way that will give satisfaction to the<lb/>
House, for he has made an improve<lb break="no"/>ment in the way in which the public <lb/>
accounts are kept. He can now show <lb/>
that the revenues are in a prosperous <lb/>
condition, and in consideration of his <lb/>
having been in the Legislature twelve
<lb/>
years, and never held a seat in the <lb/>
Government, it would be no more than <lb/>
right that he should come before the
<lb/>
House and show his account of what he <lb/>
           


            <pb n="18" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-03-14_Page_018.jpg"/>
    
has done. A majority of the Press, for<lb/>

some reasons, are against us, and abu<lb break="no"/>sing us. We have men of character
<lb/>
going about the country as
lecturers<lb/>
prejudicing the minds of the people<lb/>
against us. The Press is stating
that<lb/>
this Government has been guilty
of <lb/>
fraud, and is carrying abuse and
slander <lb/>
to every hamlet. We challenge them <lb/>
to prove it ; and we challenge this <lb/>
House to put their finger upon
an act <lb/>
of fraud, or an act of mal-administra<lb break="no"/>tion, if they dare. Let us bring
in our <lb/>
accounts before this House. We shrink <lb/>
from no responsibility, and we are glad <lb/>
to acknowledge our accountability
to <lb/>
this House. We are told by my hon. <lb/>
friend that the Surveyor General
has <lb/>
been here but a few days. The reason
<lb/>
is, that affection for an indisposed <lb/>
daughter has called him to his home.<lb/>
It may be well for my learned<lb/>
friend, who resides at Fredericton upon<lb/>
the uncertain tenure of an office in the<lb/>
Government. My hon. friend had bet<lb break="no"/>ter wait and see whether my colleague<lb/>
has done his duty in that office, and not<lb/>
condemn him before you know what he<lb/>
has done. It is an attribute of a just<lb/>
Judge, that he does not condemn a man<lb/>
before he is heard. The hon. mover<lb/>
stands in that position, and he professes<lb/>
to be entirely unselfish, but I charge<lb/>
him with wishing to prejudge the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment. The Commissioner of the <lb/>
Board of Works has occupied that posi<lb break="no"/>tion for many years and is ready, at <lb/>
any time, to resign the office up to the<lb/>
 people, and has done it ; and he is pre<lb break="no"/>pared to show that he has discharged<lb/>
his duty too. I think we have been<lb/>
treated unfairly. My hon. friend has<lb/>
said many offensive things to us, which<lb/>
I will not to him. When he talks about<lb/>
mean, low, and decency, I do not wish<lb/>
to set that gentleman up as a standard<lb/>
of decency, propriety, and honesty.<lb/>
His conduct and my conduct are before<lb/>
the people of the country, and let them<lb/>
judge, for it is not for us to sound our <lb/>
own trumpets. A great part of his <lb/>
speech is made up in setting forth that
<lb/>
our Government had made a tremen<lb break="no"/>dous attack upon Her Majesty,
the <lb/>
Queen. I cannot tell whether a tear <lb/>
dropped from his eye or not. Some<lb break="no"/>thing had been said by the Government. <lb/>
insulting to Her Majesty. He spoke of <lb/>
Her Majesty‘s Ministers as if
they were <lb/>
superior to the men of this
country. I <lb/>
respect a man occupying a high posi<lb break="no"/>tion ; but we must not forget, in our
<lb/>
admiration for a great name and high <lb/>
sounding titles, that the holders of those <lb/>
titles are but men. I have, by
the <lb/>
kindness of the people, been in
commu<lb break="no"/>nication with these men, and, while I <lb/>
paid them every respect, I never forgot
<lb/>
that I was a man myself. A man is
not <lb/>
a man who forgets himself, and will <lb/>
fall down and worship
any man. In <lb/>
regard to this Minute of Council which,<lb/>
he says, is insulting to the Queen.<lb/>
When a man stands up in his place and<lb/>
charges the Government with
delibe<lb break="no"/>rately insulting the Queen, we
throw it <lb/>
back upon him. I can speak more <lb/>
freely about this, because I was no<lb/>
party to it. The Attorney General and<lb/>
myself were in England, where we first<lb/>
saw it, and we approved of every line<lb/>
in it, and told, at the office of the Colo<lb break="no"/>nial Secretary, that it met our entire<lb/>
          
            <cb/>     
         
 appropation. I am prepared to take<lb/>
the responsibility of it. Mr. Smith then<lb/>
read the document, which was an an<lb break="no"/>swer to a despatch received from Eng<lb break="no"/>land, and which he said he did not see<lb/>
until it was answered. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>In regard to the charge made against<lb/>
us of not having published the despatch.<lb/>
We were commanded to communicate it<lb/>
to the Legislature at their next meeting.<lb/>
We did not wait for the next meeting of<lb/>
the Legislature before communicating it<lb/>
to the public. I was surprised to hear<lb/>
the hon. gentleman charge this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment will not having given information.<lb/>
I should like to have him point out to me<lb/>
how many despatches had been given to<lb/>
the public when he was a member of the<lb/>
Government before the Legislature as<lb break="no"/>sembled. Despatch after despatch was<lb/>
was never communicated to the people at<lb/>
all. This despatch was written on the<lb/>
24th of June, and published in July. This<lb/>
despatch was the opinion of Her Majes<lb break="no"/>ty's Government upon the Union of the<lb/>
Colonies, and it was our duty to respect<lb break="no"/>fully consider any opinion or suggestion<lb/>
emanating from so high a source, but at<lb/>
the same time we must not forget that we<lb/>
have a country here whose interests are<lb/>
not identical with those of England. I<lb/>
told Mr. Cardwell that the people of this<lb/>
country felt they were better able to judge<lb/>
this question than the people of England ;<lb/>
we felt, with all the deference we had for<lb/>
their opinion, that we ourselves were<lb/>
more competent to judge in regard to this<lb/>
matter, for our people had grown up with<lb/>
the country, and we knew best what would<lb/>
promote our welfare. There is not a<lb/>
member of the Cabinet of England that<lb/>
has ever been to this country, and it is<lb/>
no disrespect for the people here to say<lb/>
they understand their own interests beat.<lb/>
Mr. Cardwell said the people of England
<lb/>
favored the Scheme ; we replied we had <lb/>
only found two persons outside the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment that had ever read the Scheme; <lb/>
and we attribute a great deal of the feel<lb break="no"/>ing of the people of England to
the fact <lb/>
that they assume that after Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is carried they will be
relieved from <lb/>
some of their taxes ; but Mr. Cardwell <lb/>
was not prepared to admit that was the <lb/>
only reason for their opinion. Intelli<lb break="no"/>gent men out of the Government sup<lb break="no"/>posed that a Legislative
Union, pure and <lb/>
simple, was contemplated, and
they ex<lb break="no"/>pressed astonishment that men
could agree<lb/>
to such a Scheme as the one propos<lb break="no"/>ed. Mr. Cardwell himself acknowledged
<lb/>
that there were many objections to the <lb/>
scheme ; but said it was the best scheme <lb/>
which could be got now. We said we <lb/>
did not think it right to accept a thing <lb/>
we did not want, because it is the best <lb/>
thing that could be got ; we wanted to <lb/>
be let alone. No man denied that it <lb/>
originated in the necessities of Canada. <lb/>
The people of this country have no <lb/>
right to be made subservient to <lb/>
the political necessities of Canada. <lb/>
If we could get a scheme of union upon <lb/>
such terms as are fair, end
equitable, <lb/>
such terms as would be promotive of the <lb/>
welfare land prosperity of this country.,<lb/>
I would be in favor of it, but I
will not <lb/>
consent to ignore the prosperity
of my <lb/>
country for the sake of relieving the po<lb break="no"/>litical necessities of Canada.
Mr. Card- <lb break="yes"/>
well said the scheme emanated from us. <lb/>
We said no. A delegation went to<lb/>
Canada, but we gave them no authori<lb break="no"/>ty ; and the people hurled them from<lb/>
power and repudiated the act. They<lb/>
rejected the scheme, therefore, it could<lb/>
            
            <cb/>
         
 not be
said that it emanated from them. <lb/>
My hon friend has a great opinion of the <lb/>
               <lb/>

Canadian politicians ; but I can recollect <lb/>
the time when I tried to defend and vin<lb break="no"/>dicate the honor of Canadian statesmen
<lb/>
when the were assailed by him, and <lb/>
were charged with being guilty
of a vio<lb break="no"/>lation of public faith. The Government <lb/>
had no more right to go to Canada and <lb/>
agree upon a scheme to change the Con<lb break="no"/>stitution than the Government of Great
<lb/>
Britain has to go to France and barter
<lb/>
away their Government. The people <lb/>
decided that they had proved recreant
<lb/>
to their trust, and hurled them from <lb/>
power. The hon. gentleman talks about <lb/>
silent grumbling. I thought grumbling
<lb/>was a noise and not silent. He says <lb/>
silent grumbling was going on, and in<lb break="no"/>creasing in power, and would hurl this <lb/>
Government to the ground. When he <lb/>
says this House could not be
dissolved <lb/>
if the Government were ousted. I do <lb/>
not say it will be, but I think the Gover<lb break="no"/>nor has a right to appeal to the
people <lb/>
under the Constitution. We are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to go before the people of this <lb/>
country and let them decide whether our <lb/>
administration has not been in
accord<lb break="no"/>ance with their interests : and if they <lb/>
decide against us we will resume our <lb/>
occupations. We will not circle this <lb/>
country and hold meetings in every <lb/>
school-house. We are not professional
<lb/>
politicians,
and if I may be allowed to <lb/>
give my opinion my judgment is that the<lb/>
less professional politicians we have in<lb/>
this country the better for its welfare. <lb/>
It is put forth in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi> that not only<lb/>
the Cabinet are in favor of the scheme,<lb/>
but the whole united body of England ;  <lb/>
and thus this eroneous information is <lb/>
disseminated to the people of England.
<lb/>
They suppose that the two Canadas are <lb/>
now about to be united for the first time, <lb/>
forgetting that they had formerly
been <lb/>
under one Legislature. We are charged <lb/>
with being a Government of traitors, <lb/>
with no spirit of loyalty, that we are will<lb break="no"/>ing to submit ourselves to a man
who <lb/>
is a notorious traitor ; these
are the sen<lb break="no"/>timents put forward in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, and I<lb/>
ask whether these sentiments receive
<lb/>
your approbation.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
We wish to draw closer the ties which <lb/>
bind us to the Mother Country, although <lb/>
we are charged with being disloyal by <lb/>
those who take a different view of things <lb/>
to what we do. That is one of the agen<lb break="no"/>cies employed against us
throughout <lb/>
the country ; but I trust the intelligence <lb/>
of the people will resist any such delu<lb break="no"/>sion as that
we are disloyal and want to <lb/>
weaken the ties that bind us to the <lb/>
Mother Country. We are not sympa<lb break="no"/>thizers with the Fenians, we are ready <lb/>
ready to defend our country firesides<lb/>
and homes. We are assailed for<lb/>
not adopting sufficient precautionary<lb/>
measures for
our defence. We are pre<lb break="no"/>pared to lay down every available dol<lb break="no"/>lar for the defence of this country, for <lb/>
we expect to live and die here.
Why <lb/>
should this loyalty and love of
country <lb/>
be peculiar to the gentlemen who
occu<lb break="no"/>py the other bunches. We are as ready
<lb/>
and willing to defend our country as <lb/>
they are ; and I ask, why is it
that this <lb/>hon. mover of the amendment—in view <lb/>
of the circumstances existing
now when <lb/>
we are in hourly expectation of danger<lb break="no"/>seeks to throw the country into utter <lb/>
confusion by
leaving it without a Par<lb break="no"/>liament at all. One of the charges made <lb/>
against us was,
that the Legislature was <lb/>
called together too late, and there was a
<lb/>
       
            <pb n="19" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-03-14_Page_019.jpg"/>
          
great sympathy expressed for the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the rural
districts. I have not <lb/>
heard a single gentleman complain that <lb/>
the House was not called
together soon <lb/>
enough. In Canada it is not
called un<lb break="no"/>til the 10th of April. In Prince
Edward's <lb/>
Island the 9th of April ; in Nova
Scotia <lb/>
ten days or a fortnigh ago. He said
he <lb/>
thought one man had stopped the whole <lb/>
Legislative power of the country.
I was <lb/>
sent to Washington by my
colleagues. <lb/>
Mr. Cudlip was invited to meet the dela<lb break="no"/>gates, who expected to meet at New <lb/>
York, but he could not go. I went to <lb/>
St. John. Mr. Wilmot was not there, and <lb/>
the Government agreed that I should go to<lb/>
Washington to meet the other delegates.
<lb/>
We did not expect to how to go
into an <lb/>
eleborate discussion of the
Reciprocity <lb/>
Treaty at all. We went with a view of <lb/>
obtaining from the United States
an ex<lb break="no"/>tension of the Treaty for one year.
<lb/>
When we got there we found a Treaty <lb/>
could not be made at all, for all Treaties <lb/>
made between the United States
and <lb/>
other Governments requires the affirma<lb break="no"/>tion of the Senate, and does not require <lb/>
to be sent to the House of Representa<lb break="no"/>tives, for if they have power to make a
<lb/>
commercial treaty they ignore the func<lb break="no"/>tions of that body. In the interchange <lb/>
of commodities it was desirable
to have <lb/>
some arrangement made of a perman<lb break="no"/>ent character. They said
whatever ar<lb break="no"/>rangements were made should be car<lb break="no"/>ried out by future legislation in all good <lb/>
faith. We. entered into
negociations <lb/>
with them ; the proposition made
by us <lb/>
and their answer, hove been published . <lb/>
We felt we could not agree to
their <lb/>
terms, in justice to our own people, and <lb/>
we therefore closed our negotiations . I <lb/>
shall not say anything further
upon this <lb/>
point, as I may have an oportunity of <lb/>
explaining exactly what took
place while <lb/>
I was there. It has been said that the <lb/>
interests of the people of this
Province <lb/>
are not safe in calling the Legislature <lb/>
together at so late a period. It is very <lb/>
desirable to call the House
together <lb/>
rather, later, for we know when the <lb/>
House breaks up before the River
opens <lb/>
it makes it difﬁcult for some of
us to get <lb/>
home. Was it ever said
by a member <lb/>
of a deliberative assembly before, that
<lb/>
a Government should be ousted
from <lb/>
power because they called the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture three weeks later than
usual. There <lb/>
is a good substantial reason why
this <lb/>
Legislature should not be called
earlier. <lb/>
It was known that Canada was anxious
<lb/>
that our Session should be called. Why <lb/>
did they not call their own ; they have <lb/>
not had a Session for the last
fifteen <lb/>
months, except a short Session, which <lb/>
was called last Spring to authorise a <lb/>
loan and impose an additional  tax.
<lb/>
When treaty with the United States <lb/>
had to be made by Legislation, was it <lb/>
not sufficient to justify the
House in not <lb/>
meeting at the usual period,
because, <lb/>
if we had made an arrangement with the <lb/>
United States Government it would re<lb break="no"/>quire to be legislated upon by this
Leg<lb break="no"/>islature. It has been brought against
<lb/>
us that we brought forward no measure s <lb/>
last Session except the Military
Bill. <lb/>
Where is the Treasury Note Bill, or the<lb/>
Post Office Bill ? which has been put<lb/>
forward as a first step towards the re<lb break="no"/>moval of the seat of Government, but<lb/>
which was not thought of at all, it<lb/>
being merely to abolish the head of a<lb/>
department. It was not expected under<lb/>
the circumstances, that measures would<lb/>
be brought forward last Session, when<lb/>
        
            <cb/>   
       
 it was the desire at the Government <lb/>
and every member of the House, to
<lb/>
shorten the Session and get home as
<lb/>
soon as possible. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>My hon. friend
says, we are entitled<lb/>
to condemnation because we
brought in <lb/>

a Bill to abolish the office of Postmaster<lb/>
General, but the hon. members, fresh <lb/>
from their constituents, supported it<lb/>
thirty
to nine. There is a feeling <lb/>
throughout the country that the office
<lb/>
might be abolished without detriment to <lb/>
the
public service, and in connection <lb/>
with this, he would state that Mr. Odell <lb/>
had discharged the duties of the office <lb/>
as efficiently as any gentleman
had, <lb/>
since its creation. When the hon. gen<lb break="no"/>tleman had told the people
of York that <lb/>
they were to be destroyed, did he tell <lb/>
them that when Mr. Wilmot and
myself <lb/>
formed the Government they had not <lb/>
forgotten the interests of York? In the <lb/>
formation of the Government, they had <lb/>
selected one-third of the members from <lb/>
that County,viz : the hon. Commissioner <lb/>
Board of Works, the Attorney General, <lb/>
and the Postmaster General, who, being <lb/>
a member of the Upper House, ﬁlled <lb/>
one of the most important
offices in the <lb/>
country, and being interested in
the <lb/>
prosperity of the County of York. How <lb/>
dare they say to the people of this <lb/>
country that this Government were not<lb/>
going to give York fair play ? How<lb/>
could they expect the seat of Govern<lb break="no"/>ment could be removed with one-third<lb/>
of the entire Government from the<lb/>
Country of York ? I believe it was the<lb/>
fear of this, together with the agitation <lb/>
about
Fenianism, that had an influence <lb/>
in the election ; for I believe the people <lb/>
of this country are as  much against
the <lb/>
Quebec Scheme as ever. If you get a <lb/>
scheme that will provide for the interests <lb/>
of the people, I will go for it
;
but it is <lb/>
not in the four corners of that scheme<lb/>
to do it. My hon. friend says,
the <lb/>
Quebec Scheme is in the Speech. It is <lb/>
there because the Governor is com<lb break="no"/>manded
by the despatch to submit it to <lb/>
Parliament ; but we are not bound
by <lb/>
this. What does the Governor say in <lb/>
his Speech last Session ? He says :—<lb/>
</p>


            <p> “At the request of the Governor Ge<lb break="no"/>neral of Canada, and with the approba<lb break="no"/>tion of the Queen, I also
appointed <lb/>
Delegates to a Conference of Represen<lb break="no"/>tatives of the British North American <lb/>
Colonies, held in Quebec in the month <lb/>
of October last, with a view
of arranging<lb/>
the terms of a Federal Union of British <lb/>
North America. The
resolutions agreed <lb/>
to by this Conference appeared to me <lb/>
to be so important in their character, <lb/>
and their adoption fraught with conse<lb break="no"/>quences so materially affecting the <lb/>
future condition and well-being of Bri<lb break="no"/>tish America, that, in order to
enable <lb/>
the people of New Brunswick to give
<lb/>
expression to their wishes on
the sub<lb break="no"/>ject, I determined to dissolve
the then <lb/>
existing House of Assembly. I now <lb/>
submit these Resolutions to your judg<lb break="no"/>ment. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Did he then tell us that because he <lb/>
was going to submit those Resolutions
<lb/>
and recommend them—an expression
<lb/>
not used
in this Speech—that we are<lb/>
committed to a scheme? I will relieve <lb/>
that hon. gentleman's mind. I will in<lb break="no"/>form this House that the Government<lb/>
are not prepared to submit any scheme<lb/>
to the House. These papers will be<lb/>
submitted to the House, as we said in<lb/>
           
            <cb/>

 the Speech, and we will consider them <lb/>
with that respect which is due to any<lb break="no"/>thing emanating from so high a source, <lb/>
at the same time not forgetting that it
<lb/>
is our duty to consent to no scheme that <lb/>
does not contain within itself the
ele<lb break="no"/>ments of security for our people. If a <lb/>
scheme could be devised that would<lb/>
promote the interests of our people, I,<lb/>
for one, would go for it, and I think<lb/>
my colleagues in the Government, every<lb/>
member of the House, and every man<lb/>
in the country, would go for it too.<lb/>
               <lb/>

Whether such a scheme is attainable, is<lb/>a question for deliberation.

<!-- GL, 2016-11-16, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

            <!--<p> THURSDAY, MARCH 15. <lb/>
            </p>


            <p> After the usual routine, the House went <lb/>
into Committee—Mr. Needham in the <lb/>Chair—on a Local Bill ; a Bill to provide <lb/>
more effectually for the repairing of the <lb/>
Roads, Bridges and Streets of the Parish <lb/>
of Newcastle, in the County of
Northum<lb break="no"/>berland. Passed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. GILBERT moved that the Bill to <lb/>
provide for the better secresy
of the Bal<lb break="no"/>lot, be referred to a Committee to report <lb/>
thereon.<lb/>
            </p>




            <p> Mr. LINDSAY brought in a Bill to<lb/>
extend the jurisdiction of Justices of the<lb/>
Peace in civil suits.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR.GILBERT moved that his Bill to <lb/>
simplify the practice of law and abolish <lb/>
special bail, he referred to a
Committee. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR. NEEDHAM brought in a Bill to <lb/>
amend the practice of the
Supreme Court. <lb/>
Mr. N. said he intended to move the Bill <lb/>
just brought in in amendment to that of Mr.
<lb/>
Gilbert. It was the Bill framed by
the <lb/>
late Attorney General—the present Judge <lb/>
Allen.<lb/>
            </p>





            <p> MR. FISHER moved
the House into <lb/>
Committee—Mr. Young in the Chair—on a <lb/>
Bill further to amend the law relating
to <lb/>
Parish Schools.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> The hon. mover, explained
the object of <lb/>
the Bill was to supply a want in
the origi<lb break="no"/>nal School Bill— to extend to Counties <lb/>
the same privileges as Parishes and Dis<lb break="no"/>tricts with regard to assessment for
<lb/>
Schools. The Bill did not design to make <lb/>
any alteration in the School Law, but <lb/>
merely to make plain what was
doubtful ; <lb/>
to carry out what he considered
must have <lb/>
been
the intention of the framers of the<lb/>
law.<lb/>
            </p>






            <p> HON. ATTORNEY GENERAL thought <lb/>
the Bill would require
great consideration.<lb/>
It involved revenue, and he thought there <lb/>
would be great difficulty in carrying out <lb/>
practically the principle of assessment as<lb/>
regards Counties.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> A long discussion followed on the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple of assessment of Schools, and ﬁnal- <lb break="maybe"/>
ly progress was reported. We do not re<lb break="no"/>port the discussion on this Bill, as
the <lb/>
subject will come up again. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> MR. CONNELL said he had
under<lb break="no"/>stood the Attorney General to say that <lb/>
ample arrangements had been made with
<lb/>
regard
to defence in the County of
Carle<lb break="no"/>ton. Bu from the information he had
re<lb break="no"/>ceived, he was led to believe
that nothing <lb/>
whatever had been done. There
was very <lb/>
great alarm in the County, and a
number <lb/>
of people were selling out their property.
