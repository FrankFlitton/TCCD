<!-- GL, 2016-11-10, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day -->

 <!--<p> Thus in
manufactures we shall have <lb/>
little chance with them. But this is but <lb/>
one phase of the commercial
view. I <lb/>
have heard lectures on this subject, and <lb/>
as I have heard them talk about
free <lb/>
trade with Canada, I have asked
myself <lb/>
are these people such fools as
not to <lb/>
know that if Canada wants to get
coal <lb/>
from Pictou they are free to do it as <lb/>
they can possibly be. People forget<lb/>
that there is perfect free trade between<lb/>
us and Canada. This cry about free<lb/>
trade is not the reason why Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion is wanted, but an hon.
member of  <lb/>
the Canadian Legislature has
explained<lb/>
the whole matter, when he alleged as <lb/>
one of the advantages of Union
to Cana<lb break="no"/>da, that they would be able to say to the <lb/>
States, we will not only close
the St. <lb/>
Lawrence against you, but
prevent you <lb/>
from sending down your flour and beef <lb/>
and pork to St. John, and the other <lb/>
ports of the Lower Provinces, unless
<lb/>
you come to our terms. Are we thus <lb/>
to be made the cats-paw for Canada? <lb/>
are we to be mere make-weights
be<lb break="no"/>tween Canada and the United States? <lb/>
Are we to have all these articles shut
<lb/>
out from us just that Canada may make <lb/>
us consume her corn and pork at
im<lb break="no"/>mensely higher prices? Great
Britain <lb/>
makes treaties with the United States, <lb/>
but she always asks our opinion
about <lb/>
them, and whether they will affect us. <lb/>
When the Reciprocity Treaty was sign<lb break="no"/>ed. Parliament was called
together to <lb/>
deliberate on it, but here we are to have
 <lb/>
no voice all. Just think of our 15 <lb/>
men standing up among the 194 ; sup<lb break="no"/>pose they all stand together for their <lb/>
rights, and against a great wrong, I<lb/>
think I hear the Canadians saying, <lb/>
" you came into this great union
of your <lb/>
own free will, you have reaped the
ad- <lb break="yes"/>
advantages of the alliance, and
now when <lb/>
difficulties come you must bear
them or <lb/>
do the best you can." It is said that <lb/>
union is strength, and we had it illus<lb break="no"/>trated in different ways down in St. John <lb/>
at the last elections, but I think we al<lb break="no"/>ready have a union that is strong enough
; <lb/>
we are united to Great Britain, and I do <lb/>
not think they desire to sever the
band <lb/>
that unites us. Look at the map
and <lb/>
see how New Brunswick and Canada <lb/>
run up round the State of Maine
like an <lb/>
ox bow ; for some distance the strip of <lb/>
land is not more than twenty miles
wide, <lb/>
and is the bond that binds us to Canada, <lb/>
a link that an American troop of
dra<lb break="no"/>goons could snap in a day ; and to de<lb break="no"/>fend that place or any other there would <lb/>
be no more difficulty in turning
out an <lb/>
available force at the request
of Great <lb/>
Britain, than by a command from Otta<lb break="no"/>wa. One remark about the delegation
<lb/>
to England ; all delegations in the past <lb/>
have been subject to ridicule, and I sup<lb break="no"/>pose that others
will be, but my hon. <lb/>
friend is the first of his party who I have <lb/>
heard admit, for one moment, that the <lb/>
country has decided on the question
of <lb/>
Confederation finally and conclusively.
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Mr. MCMILLAN.—I
said the resolution <lb/>
say the country has
decided on it.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> Hon. Mr. ANGLIN—Do
you deny that <lb/>
the question is decided on conclusively?
<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. MCMILLAN.—I simply said that<lb/>
the resolution states that the
country has<lb/>
decided on it. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. ANGLIN.—Well,
if there is <lb/>
to be quibbling let it pass. The
Times, <lb/>
a paper not easy to control, states that <lb/>
in this Province there was only a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 455 against Confederation. <lb/>
We, Mr. Chairman, could not get such <lb/>
a statement inserted, and much
less <lb/>
could we get it made the basis of a
lead<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>ing article, yet inﬂuences are at work <lb/>
to bring this about, and the
Saturday <lb/>
Review reiterates the same falsehood and <lb/>
calumny ; when in the County of York <lb/>
alone there are over 900 majority
against <lb/>
it. Does this mean nothing? Is it not<lb/>
done for some sinister purpose? When <lb/>
I see Mr. Cartier stating at Fishmonger’s <lb/>
Hall that they had come to induce the <lb/>
people of England to carry out that<lb/>
scheme, I think it is time we did some<lb break="no"/>thing to counteract such scheming and<lb/>
falsehood. The Times says again,
that <lb/>
these gentlemen from Canada went <lb/>
down to Halifax and were received by <lb/>
every demonstration of respect,
and <lb/>
that several influential
gentlemen from <lb/>
New Brunswick were also there to re<lb break="no"/>ceive them. I say that is false. When <lb/>
I see Mr. Cartier, after interview
with <lb/>
Lord Palmerston, stating that
all is go<lb break="no"/>ing on well, think it is time we
were <lb/>
heard in Downing Street too. I do not <lb/>
wish to say that the feeling or desire to <lb/>
coerce us into this scheme is felt by any <lb/>
in this House, but when I hear
an hon<lb break="no"/>orable member say that Confederation <lb/>
is gaining ground, and that it may be <lb/>
carried in six months ; and when
I hear <lb/>
another gentleman in the other
branch <lb/>
say that the reason why Confederation
<lb/>
failed was on account of the sins
of the <lb/>
late Government, and was never pro<lb break="no"/>perly tested ; I say, when hear this, I<lb/>
warn these hon. gentlemen that
they are <lb/>
playing into the hands of the greatest
<lb/>
conspirators against the prosperity and <lb/>
happiness of this Province.<lb/>
            </p>

            <fw type="dateline">THURSDAY, June 1.<lb/>
            </fw>

            <p> Mr. COSTIGAN.—It
has been stated by <lb/>
the hon. member from Restigouche
(Mr.<lb/>
McMillan ) that the more the people be<lb break="no"/>came acquainted with this Confederation
<lb/>
Scheme the better
they would like it. <lb/>
Now, if the Government really thought it<lb/>
was a good
Scheme they should not have <lb/>
been afraid of having it discussed. What<lb break="no"/>ever the intention of the Government may <lb/>
have been, the facts show they
did not <lb/>
want the people to become acquainted<lb/>
with the Scheme. If that had not
been <lb/>
the case they could have brought it up <lb/>
before the House, and then referred it to <lb/>
the country at the general election : peo<lb break="no"/>ple then could have all the information
to<lb/>
be derived from the
correspondence with<lb/>
the additional information which they<lb/>
would have gained by the question being<lb/>
debated on the floors of the House. This<lb/>
would have put the matter in a fair light ;<lb/>
but I believe the Government did not<lb/>
have confidence enough in it themselves<lb/>
to bring it before the House, for they did<lb/>
not think they could carry it through. If<lb/>
the Government had been really strong,<lb/>
they would have been more cautious, but<lb/>
they were growing weaker every day, and<lb/>
unless something was done they would go<lb/>
over board. They thought this was a<lb/>
chance to keep them in a position they<lb/>
were anxious to retain. If they allowed<lb/>
the House of Assembly to meet again,<lb/>
they did not see how they could fight<lb/>
their way through the Session. In order<lb/>
to retain their power they took up this<lb/>
Scheme, and they thought it might place<lb/>
them in a higher position than before.<lb/>
There was always a bait held out to every<lb/>
man of influence, to induce him to sup<lb break="no"/>port the Scheme. A great deal has been<lb/>
said about the position we would occupy<lb/>
in the general Government. I have al<lb break="no"/>ways contended that it would be dange<lb break="no"/>rous to place ourselves in the hands<lb/>
          
            <cb/>
     
of the Confederacy. Some will say this<lb/>
is a narrow minded view, and we ought<lb/>
not to be afraid, for we would
have even<lb break="no"/>handed justice. I read in a Canadian <lb/>
newspaper the opinion of a leading
man <lb/>
in that country on a Union of the Mari<lb break="no"/>time Provinces before this Scheme was<lb/>
brought up. He said in case a
Union of <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces took place, Nova <lb/>
Scotia would absord the influence of New <lb/>
Brunswick. If that would be the case in
<lb/>
this smaller union, how much
more would <lb/>
this influence be absorbed in this greater<lb/>
majority of this grand Union ? Is it re<lb break="no"/>sonable to suppose that a better feeling <lb/>
will
exist between New Brunswick and <lb/>
Canada than among the people of New <lb/>
Brunswick themselves ? I
remember <lb/>
when a Bill was brought in
to increase <lb/>
the representation of certain Counties, <lb/>
there was a strong feeling in
the House <lb/>
to support it, because it had especial re<lb break="no"/>ference to the County of Carleton, as it<lb/>
was thought it ought to be entitled to one
<lb/>
additional representative. When
the vote <lb/>
was taken on that question, the
principle <lb/>
part of the members of the North were <lb/>
against it. That feeling of antagonism <lb/>
has always existed between the
two sec<lb break="no"/>tions of the Province, and they
are afraid <lb/>
to extend the power on either side. In <lb/>
view of this, are we prepared to give an <lb/>
overwhelming majority to Upper
Canada <lb/>
and trust to their liberality in
dealing <lb/>
with us ? In regard to trade,
when we are <lb/>
able to stock our own market, it will be <lb/>
time enough to look forward to
increase <lb/>
the market. That time has hardly arriv<lb break="no"/>ed. In reading a statement
made in re<lb break="no"/>gard to the result of the election, and <lb/>
the votes for and against the
Scheme, I <lb/>
have to state that statement does
not <lb/>
show the whole of the anti-Confederate <lb/>
vote in the Province. I think it it
due to <lb/>
myself, as well as to the
constituency of <lb/>
the County of Victoria to state that there <lb/>
was not one vote polled for
Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion in that County. <lb/>
            </p>




            <p> Hon. Mr. HATHEWAY.—I
will be very <lb/>
brief, inasmuch as I am almost
afraid to <lb/>
speak upon any subject, because every <lb/>
advantage is taken of any remarks
which <lb/>I make. I can state my reasons
for <lb/>
opposing Confederation without casting<lb/>
any more reﬂection on any gentlemen <lb/>
who may differ from me in
opinion <lb/>
than is absolutely necessary in my own <lb/>
defence. At the last Session of the <lb/>
Legislature resolutions were brought in<lb/>
by the Provincial Secretary seeking for<lb/>
a Union of the Maritime Provinces. It <lb/>
was distinctly stated here that the Pro<lb break="no"/>vincial Secretary asked for no further <lb/>
authority than to go to Prince Edward <lb/>
Island and meet the
delegates from Nova<lb/>
Scotia and they had no authority to enter<lb/>
into any negotiations,
for the matter was <lb/>
to be submitted to the House. I little <lb/>
expected when we consented to the ap<lb break="no"/>pointment of that delegation that a mi<lb break="no"/>nority of the Executive Council would<lb/>
have gone to Canada and agreed to a<lb/>
proposition to unite these Colonies. I<lb/>
take the broad ground and put it forth<lb/>
without fear of contradiction, that when<lb/>
that Conference met at Quebec, there<lb/>
could be no doubt, from the language<lb/>
used by the delegates, that it was to be<lb/>
adjudicated upon by the late Legislature.<lb/>
If the Government of which I was a mem<lb break="no"/>ber, had been sufficiently strong to have<lb/>
carried that measure through the House<lb/>
they would have done so. It has been <lb/>
said that I had foresight enough to see<lb/>
what. would be the result of the election,
<lb/>
but I assert and can prove that six hours <lb/>
after I saw the resolutions of
the Confer<lb break="no"/>ence, I took a strong objection
to them. <lb/>
            </p>

            <pb n="116" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-06-01_Page_116.jpg"/>
            

<p>On the evening of the day when I first <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>saw
those resolutions, we were summon<lb break="no"/>ed to
meet and discuss them for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of carrying out the arrangements
<lb/>
which had been entered into ; after look<lb break="no"/>ing at those resolutions, I went in the next<lb/>
morning to the Executive Council and<lb/>
told my colleagues that I met them for<lb/>
the last time, and went home and wrote<lb/>
out my resignation ; when I
returned to <lb/>
Fredericton many of my constituents
per<lb break="no"/>suaded me not to resign. I was surprised
<lb/>
that they should have known that such 
<lb/>
was my intention, for I had mentioned it<lb/>
to no one except my colleagues in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, altho' I felt I was doing injustice<lb/>
to the Government and myself, yet I re<lb break="no"/>mained because I felt it was a duty I owed<lb/>
to my country to oppose the Scheme.
In <lb/>
Regard to the Intercolonial Railroad. <lb/>
prospect we may have had under the for<lb break="no"/>mer arrangement would be swept away<lb/>
by this Confederation, for it would be the<lb/>
interest of Canada, Nova Scotia
and<lb/>
Prince Edward Island, to have it go by <lb/>
the North Shore route, and it was known<lb/>
in England and known by the Canadians <lb/>
that the line would be constructed by that<lb/>
route, and I would sooner it
would go <lb/>
there than to be put through the
centre of <lb/>
the country where nobody lives. Canada  <lb/>
has a trade with the north part of the
<lb/>
country already, and no party will remain
<lb/>
in power that does not pass the
railway <lb/>
through by that route. Let me ask my<lb/>
hon. friend from Restigouche, where is
<lb/>
the survey of Mr. Fleming ? Does he <lb/>
know why Mr. Fleming has not reported ? <lb/>
Was it not promised that this survey<lb/>
should be published before the
election ? <lb/>
Why is it that his report is kept
back ?<lb/>
It is kept back for a particular
purpose,<lb/>
hence it is necessary to move this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion. It was attempted to be urged that<lb/>
there was no necessity for us to appoint<lb/>
delegates ; that there was no necessity<lb/>
for telling the British
Government that<lb/>
we were loyal. I we find men occupying
 <lb/>
the position that Judge
Haliburton does <lb/>
in England, charging the men and Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment of this Province with
disloyalty ;<lb/>
telling the people in Halifax that the ma<lb break="no"/>jority against Confederation in
this coun<lb break="no"/>try is only 400, and that something should<lb/>
be done to bring about a reaction. It  <lb/>
was urged by the promoters of this <lb/>
Scheme, that we must go into Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion to defend ourselves against the Yan<lb break="no"/>kees who were going to gobble us up ; to<lb/>
defend ourselves against a nation who <lb/>
have proved to the world that no
two na<lb break="no"/>tions are able to compete with them,  <lb/>
while the advocates of the Scheme admit<lb/>
that Canada is the most vulnerable point,<lb/>
and that we were placing ourselves in a<lb/>
position that they could, under the Con<lb break="no"/>script Act, take our young men
out of the<lb/>
country to ﬁght her battles. We have <lb/>
never shown anything else but allegiance <lb/>
to the Sovereign ; we hare never burnt<lb/>
our Province buildings, or
professed any<lb break="no"/>thing but respect for the Queen's repre<lb break="no"/>sentative. If they have got into difficul<lb break="no"/>ties let them protect themselves, and not<lb/>
call upon us to support them. If there <lb/>
was no other Section of the Scheme that<lb/>
would condemn it this Section
would,<lb/>
which allows the Government of Canada<lb/>
to make any advance which they may<lb/>
deem necessary for the Militia defence of<lb/>
the country, and the debt would be as<lb break="no"/>sumed by the General Government. I  <lb/>
was amused at the remarks made here<lb/>
that if the constituents had an
opportu<lb break="no"/>nity of speak out there would be a majori<lb break="no"/>ty of the people of the country in favor of<lb/>
Confederation. It might be so in the <lb/>
County of Albert, or the County
of Resti<lb break="no"/><cb/>gouche,
where, I believe, one of my hon.<lb/>
friends was returned by 400 votes, and<lb/>
the other by 300. In those little counties<lb/>
influences are brought to work in regard<lb/>
to their mines and minerals, but after all<lb/>
they could carry but a bare majority, and<lb/>
this is not criterion to judge or base an<lb/>
opposition to this resolution. The Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment expected to come in with a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of no less than twenty-six. I say<lb/>
this question was not fairly tried, the<lb/>
Opposition had to contend with the pro<lb break="no"/>mises of nine or ten million dollars that<lb/>
was to be expended in the country ; these<lb/>
strong influences were brought to bear on<lb/>
the tradesman and mechanic. We, on the<lb/>
other side, could draw no picture of the<lb/>
future ; we could not go out and tell the<lb/>
candidates to come out in favor of Anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederation, and we would secure their<lb/>
seats ; we could not go out and promise<lb/>
mean that we would do this and that for<lb/>
them. It, therefore, comes with a bad<lb/>
grace for the other party to say that these<lb/>
elections were carried by the side issues. I<lb/>
have heard it stated that the Scheme of<lb/>
Confederation was not tried at all at the<lb/>
election, but that it was rejected because<lb/>
the Government had made themselves<lb/>
obnoxious to the people. When I left<lb/>
that Government we were in a ma<lb break="no"/>jority, and could have carried that mea<lb break="no"/>sure—if Dr. Dow, Mr. Fisher and
my<lb break="no"/>self had been united—through the
House<lb/>
of Assembly by a majority of twenty-two.<lb/>
When I hear it put forth to the country<lb/>
that the dissolution was caused in con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the necessity that existed,<lb/>
inasmuch as Canada and Nova Scotia<lb/>
were going to pass the measure, and time<lb/>
would be lost if we waited another year.<lb/>
When did that occur to the Government?<lb/>
If that was correct, then was the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of which I was a member guilty of<lb/>
an outrageous fraud upon the public in<lb/>
the County of Northumberland, in issu<lb break="no"/>ing a writ for the return of one member.<lb/>
There was no such intention or determi<lb break="no"/>nation on the part of the Government to<lb/>
dissolve the House. It was not dreamed<lb/>
of, until it was made known that I intend<lb break="no"/>ed to resign. We were told that Nova<lb/>
Scotia was going to carry the Scheme by<lb/>
an overwhelming majority ; Canada was<lb/>
going to carry it, and that New Bruns<lb break="no"/>wick would be left out in the cold. Why<lb/>
did not Nova Scotia carry it? No states<lb break="no"/>man there dare run the risk of losing his<lb/>
position by bringing it forward, in view<lb/>
of New Brunswick having rejected it.<lb/>
They had honesty enough to admit that<lb/>
they could not carry it. We were told<lb/>
that by the assimilation of our tariffs the<lb/>
people were to grow rich and that we<lb/>
had no field for the operations of the me<lb break="no"/>chanics, unless we went into Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion ; while the fact was, that Canada had<lb/>
abundance of every thing with which we<lb/>
could supply her ; and we would have to<lb/>
depend upon her for all time to come for<lb/>
the necessaries of life. Then it was said<lb/>
we would get the railway at one-<lb break="yes"/>
twelfth of its cost ; but was it no be<lb break="no"/>hind the scenes that it could not be built<lb/>
without going on with the simultaneous<lb/>
construction of the Canal system. It had to<lb/>
be built with our own money, but under the<lb/>
direction of the Government in Canada.<lb/>
If we believe that there are strong repre<lb break="no"/>sentations made to the British Government<lb/>
which might cause them to take action<lb/>
against us—is it not our duty to
appoint<lb/>
a delegation to check that influence ? In<lb/>
the report of a speech of a leading states<lb break="no"/>man in England, that the Scheme was<lb/>
rejected in Prince Edward Island, in<lb/>
consequence of religious disaffection,<lb/>
every one that knows the Island, 

            <cb/>
       
knows that
it is not the case. The<lb/>
Government put forth all its influence<lb/>
to carry this Scheme. They told the<lb/>
people of Fredericton that in view of the<lb/>
Intercolonial railway coming near them,<lb/>
the seat of Government would be estab<lb break="no"/>lished there for all time to come, and they<lb/>
would derive advantages which no other<lb/>
County would ; they had a great portion<lb/>
of the talent of the country in their favor.<lb/>
The delegates were men of great talent,<lb/>
and they had within their means promises<lb/>
of elevation to the other branch of the<lb/>
Legislature. I met in my canvas, letters<lb/>
calling upon men to vote for Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion. If I have done no other service<lb/>
in opposing this Scheme than bringing<lb/>
out the talent of the late Surveyor Gene<lb break="no"/>ral, which, but for this Scheme, would<lb/>
have remained hidden ; for this I feel I<lb/>
am entitled to the thanks of the constitu<lb break="no"/>ency of Restigouche. In the reply made<lb/>
to the move of the resolution, he had<lb/>
evinced the ability of an able financier,<lb/>
and when the House knew that he had<lb/>
none to assist him, that his own fertile<lb/>
brain, they were entitled to every con<lb break="no"/>sideration. If this Confederation Scheme<lb/>
had been carried, it would have brought<lb/>
our Legislature down to a mere munici<lb break="no"/>pality, and no man of any standing would<lb/>
have accepted a seat in it. It may be<lb/>
that there is a hidden hand somewhere,<lb/>
and it may be that they are sincere in<lb/>
their motives, or it may be a desire to get<lb/>
back into their positions again. I would<lb/>
rather lose my position to-morrow than I<lb/>
would do an act which I believed would<lb/>
bring a stain upon the Legislature or a<lb/>
stigma upon the country which gave me<lb/>
birth. I am not prepared to give the<lb/>
people's rights to Canada, knowing their<lb/>
former history. We have nothing to gain<lb/>
by this connection, while Canada has<lb/>
every thing to gain ; they could come into<lb/>
the Province and take thirty thousand<lb/>
seamen to man their boats. I am not<lb/>
going to say that our safety consists in<lb/>
our helplessness ; but I believe that there<lb/>
is no more danger of the United States<lb/>
declaring war against New Brunswick<lb/>
than there is of our declaring war among<lb/>
ourselves. Heaven forbid that I should<lb/>
be an annexationist ; yet, in any at<lb break="no"/>tempt to force this measure upon up, I<lb/>
could have my own choice which of the<lb/>
two evils to take (Mr. Connell.—You<lb/>
would force others.) I would force you<lb/>
to remain where you are for the next<lb/>
three years, if my voice would help to<lb/>
keel down Confederation. I shall not<lb/>
take up any more time, but having made<lb/>
these few hurried remarks in reference to<lb/>
it, I shall take my seat.</p>
            <p>Mr. MCCLELLAN.—I rise to reply only<lb/>
to that portion of my hon. friend's speech<lb/>
which has referenc to the County of Al<lb break="no"/>bert. The Chief Commissioner has com<lb break="no"/>plained of the members attacking him in<lb/>
the House ; we have done so because he<lb/>
was the only organ of the late Government<lb/>
in the present. Although there may be a<lb/>
great gulf between the present and late<lb/>
bridge over that gulf, it must be the Chief<lb/>
Commissioner himself. I have not at<lb break="no"/>tacked him unjustifiably, because in my<lb/>
remarks that have been made he has been<lb/>
generally the aggressor ; he has on seve<lb break="no"/>ral occasions alluded to the influences<lb/>
which were at work in the County of<lb/>
Albert to secure my influence in favor of<lb/>
Confederation. At the last Session of the<lb/>
Legislature, a motion was made to ap<lb break="no"/>point a delegation to confer on the Union<lb/>
of the Maritime Provinces ; if  he had<lb/>
         

            <pb n="117" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-06-01_Page_117.jpg"/>

 listened to
me then, he would
not have <lb/>
been ignorant of my views in regard to <lb/>
Intercolonial Union. I understood the<lb/>
commission
to refer to outside inﬂuence.
<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>(Mr. Hatheway.—I alluded to a paper <lb/>
published in the County of Albert,
and <lb/>
from his card in it I concluded that altho'<lb/>
he was in favor of Confederation, he was <lb/>
not in favor of the Scheme.
What sur<lb break="no"/>prised me was, that, knowing that it was <lb/>
distinctly stated that the Scheme
could <lb/>
not be altered by the dotting of an I, or <lb/>
the crossing of a T —any
person could be <lb/>
in favor of Confederation.) If he read my<lb/>
card published in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Eastern Advocate</hi>,
it <lb/>
made no such statement. I stated in my <lb/>
card that I was in favor of a Union of
the <lb/>
North American Colonies based
upon fair <lb/>
and equitable principles, and
went on <lb/>
showing the benefits
of uniformity in our <lb/>
tariffs and postal arrangements,
whichh <lb/>
could be brought about by a Union. I<lb/>
did not say a word about this Scheme, for <lb/>
I held it derogatory for a member to com<lb break="no"/>mit himself to the details of an
arrange<lb break="no"/>ment which only a few months before had <lb/>
been laid before him. I was at that time <lb/>
attending to my own business,
and had no <lb/>
time to fully consider the merits
of the <lb/>
Scheme ; therefore, I did not explain that <lb/>
I was prepared to commit myself to every
<lb/>
detail, but so far as I had examined the<lb/>
Scheme, I saw nothing objectionable
in <lb/>
it. The Chief Commissioner has on two <lb/>
occasions allude to the influence of the <lb/>
Government in respect to the election in <lb/>
the County of Albert. I say I do not feel<lb/>
myself in a position to acknowledge any  <lb/>
favor from the Government ; there was<lb/>
no expenditure of money came from out<lb break="no"/>side of the County of Albert to influence<lb/>
the election there. The Banking influ<lb break="no"/>ence of men who make money out of poor<lb/>
people, who wished to retain their power<lb/>
of discounting notes, and securing money<lb/>
from the poverty of the country, helped<lb/>
to defeat Confederation. I was returned<lb/>
to represent the County of Albert without<lb/>
any influence being brought to bear<lb/>
either directly or indirectly ; but there<lb/>
may be other constituencies in the<lb/>
Province which are not so pure, on which<lb/>
money influence may be brought to bear.<lb/>
To prove the fearful existence of bribery<lb/>
at elections in some places, arising proba<lb break="no"/>bly from the fact of there being in a small<lb/>
Legislature so many prizes and so few<lb/>
blanks, I have only to refer to the testi<lb break="no"/>mony of Mr. Allen, one of the representa<lb break="no"/>tives of York in 1857, now Attorney Gen<lb break="no"/>eral. I presume matters may not have<lb/>
changed much, and it is therefore easy to<lb/>
conceive how Confederation was defeated<lb/>
in York.<lb/>
            </p>
        
            <p> Mr.
NEEDHAM.—What authority do you<lb/>
refer to?<lb/>
            </p>

            <p>  Mr.
MCCLELLAN.—Speech of Attorney<lb/>
General delivered in this House in 1857, <lb/>
in reply to Mr. Hatheway, then opposed to<lb/>
him. I referred to this the other day,<lb/>
when the people of Albert were charged <lb/>
by the Hon. Chief Commissioner of Works,<lb/>
of their elections being influenced by<lb/>
money of the wealthy, &amp;c. Mr. Allen<lb/>
stated, among other things, " that the<lb/>
most unhappy desecration of the franchise
<lb/>
prevailed, not among the men who labor<lb break="no"/>ed with their hands, but the most influ<lb break="no"/>ential men in York would sell their votes<lb/>
at elections, and the evil had really become<lb/>
fearful. What is found at elections but<lb/>
the grossest frauds and corruptions prac<lb break="no"/>tised by the wholesale purchase of votes.<lb/>
Come to this House and you find it little<lb/>
better.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p> Mr. LEWIS.—I
do not think there was <lb/>
         

            <cb/>
    
one dollar expended
in the County of Al<lb break="no"/>bert to influence the votes on that occa<lb break="no"/>sion, neither was there any promises of<lb/>
preferment ever given in any
shape or<lb/>
form. (Mr. Anglin.—Why
was it then <lb/>
that a member of the Government was<lb/>
there at the time, and afterwards boasted<lb/>
that he had carried the County ?) If he<lb/>
did say so, it was not the case ; his pre<lb break="no"/>sence in the County had no inﬂuence upon<lb/>
the election.<lb/>

            </p>
            <p> Mr.
CUDLIP.—In reference to the
re<lb break="no"/>marks made by the hon. member from <lb/>
the County of Albert. I feel bound to say<lb/>
that extraordinary efforts were put forth<lb/>
by the Government to carry this election. <lb/>
Suppose two candidates start even to run<lb/>
an election, they will both spend money ; <lb/>
but
if one has the support of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment he has a prospective advantage, for <lb/>
there is always an indirect tendency to go <lb/>
with the strongest side. When my col<lb break="no"/>leagues and myself were elected
it was <lb/>
put forth that we were elected by the rab<lb break="no"/>ble. The hon. member for Albert said<lb/>
Confederation was defeated on account of <lb/>
the Banking influence. It is a strange<lb/>
thing that the men holding the money of<lb/>
the country can be the rabble.<lb/>

            </p>
 

            <p> Dr.
THOMSON.—I
thought it was my <lb/>
duty as a British subject, with British <lb/>
feelings, to strive to retain our privileges<lb/>
from the grasp of parties
who tried to <lb/>
sweep away the rights of our Province. <lb/>
At one time we were united with
Nova <lb/>
Scotia, but were separated by the consent <lb/>
and direction of the British Government, <lb/>
because it was thought it would
be condu<lb break="no"/>cive to our welfare. This proposed<lb/>
Union is not for thepurpose of having <lb/>
one Legislature, but is a Federal Union<lb/>
where the dominant party will have power<lb/>
to tyrannise over us if they think proper.<lb/>
It is an old saying that we should "Give<lb/>
glory to God, honour to the King, and live<lb/>
honestly with all men." The Liberals<lb/>
have not done this, for they have taken all<lb/>
the glory to themselves, and have honored<lb/>
neither King, country, nor anything else.<lb/>
This country was not big enough for<lb/>
them, and they wanted to extend it, like<lb/>
the fable of the frog and the horse. The<lb/>
frog enlarged himself until he burst, and<lb/>
so it was with these delegates, they would<lb/>
not act in such a sway as was commensurate<lb/>
with their means;this country was too small<lb/>
for them, and they must get up this big<lb/>
scheme ; but the  " hand writing was<lb/>
upon the wall," and their place knew<lb/>
them no more. If we went into this Con<lb break="no"/>federation we would have to put up new<lb/>
buildings, and it would cost us as much<lb/>
to keep up this Central Parliament as it<lb/>
would be to keep a standing army of thirty<lb/>
thousand people. We would gain nothing<lb/>
by going into Confederation either direct<lb break="no"/>ly or indirectly ; we are in the habit of<lb/>
importing more dutiable goods than the<lb/>
Canadas, more particularly Lower Can<lb break="no"/>da ; therefore, we would contribute to<lb/>
the general revenue about double the<lb/>
amount that they do. The delegates may<lb/>
have thought that it was a good move for<lb/>
us to enter this Union, but they did not<lb/>
were over-ruled by the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince. If there are any influences at<lb/>
work in England in regard to legislating<lb/>
for this Province, we should send a dele<lb break="no"/>gation home to counteract it ; we must<lb/>
protect ourselves, for " self-preservation<lb/>
is the first law of nature," This delega<lb break="no"/>tion is not for the purpose of annoying<lb/>
others, but for the purpose of setting our<lb break="no"/>selves right before the people and Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of England, for oftentimes a small<lb/>
matter, if allowed to remain, will grow to<lb/>
something worse ; upon this ground I<lb/>
    

            <cb/>

 would
like to see this delegation. The <lb/>
same delegation that are to go
to
Halifax <lb/>
might as well be appointed to go to Eng<lb break="no"/>land,to save the expense of appointing <lb/>
two delegations. The expenses of
this <lb/>
Scheme would have been enormous, inas<lb break="no"/>much an we would have had to have kept<lb/>
up our own Legislature, and a union of <lb/>
all the Legislatures in Canada, and we<lb/>
give
them the power to tax us as much as <lb/>they please ; if there was any necessity for <lb/>
this Union it would be better to
have one <lb/>
Parliament for all ; by this means we <lb/>
would save a great deal of expense. I <lb/>
believe, instead of this
Union, we should <lb/>
try to get a Union with Britain, by getting<lb/>
a few members in the British Parliament ;<lb/>
there they could do us some service ; there<lb/>
should be a few members in the British <lb/>
Parliament for every Colony that is,
of <lb/>
British descent. If there is any change <lb/>
to be made in our Constitution we should <lb/>
have a two-third vote before we adopt it, <lb/>
and that vote should be given fairly ; every <lb/>
man above twenty-one years of age <lb/>
should have a fair vote, let it
be for An<lb break="no"/>nexation or whatever it may be. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. SMITH.—As I feel an anxious <lb/>
desire to close the Session as speedily as <lb/>
possible. I shall make
a very short speech. <lb/>
I stated during the canvas at the election, <lb/>
that the delegates which discussed this <lb/>
Scheme of a Union of the North
Ameri<lb break="no"/>can Province was wholly
unauthorised, <lb/>
and I am prepared to assert now in my<lb/>
place, that in my judgment their whole<lb/>
proceedings were entirely unauthorised.<lb/>
               <lb/>

History will be searched in vain to ﬁnd a <lb/>
parallel to this case. If it was
necessary <lb/>
for the delegates appointed to discuss a <lb/>
Union of the Lower Provinces, to have
<lb/>
Legislative authority, how much more<lb/>
necessary was it to have authority to dis<lb break="no"/>cuss this larger Union ? I do not think<lb/>
another case can be found of a Go<lb break="no"/>vernment meeting in Conference and<lb/>
agreeing to a Scheme, making an organic<lb/>
change in the Constitution of a coun<lb break="no"/>try. I think before they gave their con<lb break="no"/>sent to a Scheme, and pledged themselves<lb/>
to carry out that Scheme with all the in<lb break="no"/>fluence their high position gave them,<lb/>
they should have first consulted the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. These delegates who assembled on<lb/>
Prince Edward Island for a particular<lb/>
purpose, abandoned their business and<lb/>
arrogated to themselves powers that did<lb/>
not legitimately belong to them, and un<lb break="no"/>dertook to alter the Institutions of the<lb/>
country and surrender the independence<lb/>
we have so long enjoyed. Is it not the <lb/>
duty of the Government to exercise their<lb/>
functions within the four corners of the<lb/>
Constitution ? Is it not their duty to<lb/>
preserve inviolate the independence of<lb/>
the people ? In my opinion these gentle<lb break="no"/>men transcended entirely their powers :<lb/>
they should not have gone ; or if they<lb/>
went upon the invitation of the Governor<lb/>
General, they should have gone and lis<lb break="no"/>tened to the proposition and returned, be<lb break="no"/>fore pledging themselves to use all their<lb/>
power, with all the agency the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment could wield, to sustain this Scheme.<lb/>
How did this originate ? Did not you<lb/>
hear in the early part of the canvas that<lb/>
it had emanated from the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment ? How fraudulent was that ; noth<lb break="no"/>ing the kind had taken place. It was<lb/>
concocted in Canada. I will call Mr. Galt<lb/>
to show how it originated. Did it origi<lb break="no"/>nate in Canada for the benefit of the<lb/>
Maritime Provinces ? Did it not ori<lb break="no"/>ginate from their own political neces<lb break="no"/>sities? I can prove it out of the mouth of<lb/>
Mr. Galt himself. He says : "The circum<lb break="no"/>stances under which the Government<lb/>
found itself the last Session of Parlia<lb break="no"/><pb n="118" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-06-01_Page_118.jpg"/>ment were
these : One Government had<lb/>
 resigned from inability to
obtain Parlia<lb break="no"/>mentary support enough to govern the<lb/>
country. Another of which, he (Mr.<lb/>
Galt) was
a member, had been defeated<lb/>
by a majority of two ; and it did not
ap<lb break="no"/>pear possible to form any
Government <lb/>
under which any material difference in <lb/>
this
respect could have been produced.<lb/>
Under these circumstances it was the du<lb break="no"/>ty of those administering
the public af<lb break="no"/>fairs to make sacrifices of their interests <lb/>
and of their
personal position, and to <lb/>
unite to seek a remedy for the evils
that <lb/>
existed ; and he was happy to say that
<lb/>
men were found willing to undertake
this <lb/>
responsibility. He desired in this connec<lb break="no"/>tion to allude more particularly
to his friend<lb/>
and colleague, the Hon. George Brown, <lb/>
who, feeling that the period had
arrived <lb/>
when extreme views should no longer
be <lb/>
pressed, in the most patriotic and straight<lb break="no"/>forward manner approached the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment of the day when they were
consid<lb break="no"/>ering what course
to take, and suggested <lb/>
that some basis should be found on which <lb/>
a common platform could be raised.
This <lb/>
consideration resulted in an undertaking <lb/>
on the part of the Government, into which<lb/>
the Hon. George Brown and two other <lb/>
gentlemen representing the Liberal party <lb/>
of Upper Canada had entered, to address
<lb/>
themselves to the preparation of a mea<lb break="no"/>sure that would partake of a federal cha<lb break="no"/>racter as far as necessary with re<lb break="no"/>spect to local measures,
while it would <lb/>
preserve the existing Union in respect to <lb/>
measures common to all ; that
they would <lb/>
endeavor,
if necessary, to strike
out a Fede<lb break="no"/>ral Union for Canada alone ; but that at <lb/>
the same time they would
attempt, in con<lb break="no"/>sidering a change in the Constitution of <lb/>
this country, to bring the Lower Provin<lb break="no"/>ces in under the same bond, as they were <lb/>
already under the same Sovereign. It <lb/>
was highly proper that before
touching<lb/>
the edifice of Government that had been<lb/>
raised in Canada, they should address the <lb/>
statesmen of the Lower Provinces, and
<lb/>
try to induce them to form a common sys<lb break="no"/>tem. If it were found impossible to have
<lb/>
a Legislative Union of all the British <lb/>
American Provinces, then they could re<lb break="no"/>serve to the local Governments of the <lb/>
several Provinces the control of such sub<lb break="no"/>jects as concerned them, while the rest <lb/>
should be committed to the care
of <lb/>
the General Government." Now do
we <lb/>
want any further testimony to
show that <lb/>
this did not emanate from the British
Go<lb/>
vernment. These delegates were assem<lb break="no"/>bled in session before they had any com<lb break="no"/>munications from the British Government<lb/>
at all. This Scheme arose from the poli<lb break="no"/>tical embarrassing necessities
of Canada,<lb/>
and not from the philanthropy of
Cana<lb break="no"/>dian statesmen for the beneﬁt of the<lb/>
Lower Provinces, but to enable
them to<lb/>
obtain power. I made a statement in dif<lb break="no"/>ferent speeches which I delivered upon<lb/>
the electioneering tour. I
ventured to <lb/>
suppose that the authors of this
new Con<lb break="no"/>stitution, framed in a short time
might be<lb/>
biased in their views by the
prospect of<lb/>
personal aggrandisement ; for
this I was <lb/>
taken to task, and was told I was imput<lb break="no"/>ing motives. I say it is our duty to watch <lb/>
those in power, for the tendency of power <lb/>
is to be aggressive. This Conference
<lb/>
held their meetings at Quebec to frame
<lb/>
a new Constitution, with closed doors. It <lb/>
was different in the United States,
the <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>public
there were admitted, and some of <lb/>
the speeches made on that occasion have<lb/>
been handed down as model of eloquence.<lb/>
It was curious that in connection with<lb/>
this Conference there was a geographical<lb/>
sketch made, pointing out the particular<lb/>
        
            <cb/>      
  
adaptability of persons for the different<lb/>
offices to be created by the
resolutions of<lb/>
this Conference ; although it may be,
that <lb/>
the gentlemen who went from this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince and Nova Scotia had‘no
idea of go<lb break="no"/>ing into any office under this new admin<lb break="no"/>istration. This Scheme, which
was the <lb/>
most ingeniously contrived piece of poli<lb break="no"/>tical machinery that was ever planned<lb/>
by any set of men, was to be pressed<lb/>
through the then existing Legislature<lb/>
without any reference to the people<lb/>
Keeping that fact in view, and allowing<lb/>
this Scheme all the elements necessary to<lb/>
bring it into existence, how were the<lb/>
Legislative Council to be appointed ? ten<lb/>
of them were to be taken out of the Le<lb break="no"/>gislative Council of this Province, irre<lb break="no"/>spective of party politics. This would<lb/>
have the effect of neutralizing any oppo<lb break="no"/>sition there, for they are men, and like<lb/>
ourselves are susceptible of these influ<lb break="no"/>ences. How are their places to be filled<lb/>
up ? Would there have been no mem<lb break="no"/>bers in the House who could have been<lb/>
fonnd ten men in the House who would<lb/>
be influenced by considerations like these.<lb/>
Then there were seven men in the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, that would make seventeen, and<lb/>
there would be only four more wanted to<lb/>
carry the Scheme. I think those four<lb/>
men could be found. It might be, they<lb/>
would be animated by patriotism ; but if<lb/>
not they could be prevailed upon by some<lb/>
influence which the Government could<lb/>
wield, and thus twenty-one members<lb/>
could be found to carry the Scheme. This<lb/>
was my view, and for stating that view I<lb/>
was criticized and maligned. I intend to <lb/>
condense my remarks, because to notice<lb/>
all the points would take hours. If I had<lb/>
consulted my own feelings I
should not<lb/>
have spoken at all, as I have become<lb/>
tired of the subject ; it is like addressing<lb/>
a jury after they have rendered their ver<lb break="no"/>dict.
When I hear the hon. member for<lb/>
the County of Albert put forward the bold<lb/>
proposition that if the people of the coun<lb break="no"/>try were better informed, they would sup<lb break="no"/>port the Scheme, and the ex-Surveyor<lb/>
General says the same thing. I want to<lb/>
ask that gentleman, and through
him the<lb/>
members of the late Government,
why it<lb/>
was, if they courted enquiry or discussion, <lb/>
that they dissolved the House, after Mr.<lb/>
Tilley had distinctly
stated to the people <lb/>
of Carleton that a dissolution would not<lb/>
take place. I characterize it as an act of<lb/>
tyranny and cruelty to the people of this<lb/>
country to dissolve the House in the win<lb break="no"/>ter season, when, if they had not been<lb/>
especially favored with fine weather, not<lb/>
one-half the aged men could have got to<lb/>
the polls to render their voice against<lb/>
this question, in which was involved the<lb/>
rendering up of their rights which they<lb/>
had so long enjoyed. When this question<lb/>
first came up, I asked for information on<lb/>
the subject ; but official etiquette forbid<lb/>
its being known to the people of this<lb/>
country until after it had been shown to<lb/>
Her Majesty the Queen, and we were in<lb break="no"/>debted to Mr. Palmer, of Prince Edward<lb/>
Island, for the details of the Scheme.<lb/>
These delegates kept back this informa<lb break="no"/>tion, but called an assemblage of the<lb/>
people in St. John, and condescended to<lb/>
tell them what they had done for them<lb/>
but would not allow them to see the<lb/>
agreement by which their country was<lb/>
sold. Was it right for Mr. Tilley to pro<lb break="no"/>claim to the people that a dissolution<lb/>
would not take place until after the House<lb/>
had met, and thus lull the people into a<lb/>
false security. That was the effect upon<lb/>
        
            <cb/>

 my mind,
for I thought the first place in<lb/>
which the subject would be discussed<lb/>
would be in Parliament. You may search<lb/>
history in vain, to find a case in which,<lb/>
when the Constitution of a country was<lb/>
changed, it was first discussed at a public<lb/>
meeting before it was discussed in Par<lb break="no"/>liament. They should have told the people<lb/>
of the country whether they were going<lb/>
to dissolve the House or not. While we<lb/>
were lulled into a false security, those<lb/>
delegates were impressing their views<lb/>
upon the people of the country, and tell<lb break="no"/>ing them that they would become rich,<lb/>
because millions upon millions of money<lb/>
were to be expended among them, while<lb/>
their taxes were to be reduced. I do not<lb/>
see how any man could believe it possible,<lb/>
when looking at our condition, and the<lb/>
condition of Canada, and the enormous<lb/>
sums of money to be spent, that our taxes<lb/>
can be reduced, unless it can be proved<lb/>
that the more a man owes the less it will<lb/>
take to pay his debts ; yet, many did be<lb break="no"/>lieve that statement to be true that a large<lb/>
expenditure of money was to be made, and<lb/>
our taxes were to be less. How could<lb/>
Mr. Tilley, or any other man, say what<lb/>
this Confederation would do? after it was<lb/>
once organized they could not control it.<lb/>
How then could they say how much per<lb/>
head our taxes were to be nuder Confed<lb break="no"/>eration ? These delegates might be there,<lb/>
and they might not. Men die and pass<lb/>
away, but the Constitution would live<lb/>
after them, and Mr. Tilley or anybody<lb/>
else could not say what they would do,<lb/>
and what they would not do, after the<lb/>
Constitution was once adopted. This<lb/>
taxation must be inevitable, for any man<lb/>
that knows anything of the history of this<lb/>
country for the last forty years, knows<lb/>
that our wants increase as our population<lb/>
increases. Then what must be the dernier<lb/>
resort ? what must be the remedy for that<lb/>
state of things ? It will be direct taxa<lb break="no"/>tion. I will call the testimony of Mr.<lb/>
Galt : " If they increased their expenses<lb/>
in proportion to the growth of population.<lb/>
they would be obliged to resort to direct<lb/>
taxation." This is a statement from Mr.<lb/>
Galt, unquestionably true. Then, in re<lb break="no"/>gard to this Intercolonial Railway. You<lb/>
are aware of the fact that Mr. George<lb/>
Brown has always been opposed to the<lb/>
construction of this work, and he was the<lb/>
cause of that railway scheme not being<lb/>
accepted by the people of Canada. But<lb/>
now Mr. George Brown says, that rather<lb/>
than not have Confederation, he would<lb/>
consent to build half a dozen such rail<lb break="no"/>ways. Has he such a care for this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince that he willing to tax his own<lb/>
people to give us better terms that was<lb/>
provided two or three years ago ? Mr.<lb/>
George Brown, through the consummation<lb/>
of this Scheme, will accomplish the object<lb/>
which he has advocated all his life—that<lb/>
is, representation by population, which<lb/>
will give Canada, by the rapid increase of<lb/>
her population, the controlling power of<lb/>
this whole Confederacy By adopting this<lb/>
Scheme we surrender our independence,<lb/>
and become dependent upon Canada, for<lb/>
this Federal Government will have the<lb/>
veto power upon our legislation. The<lb/>
51st section of the Scheme says: " Any<lb/>
Bill passed by the General Parliament<lb/>
shall be subject to disallowance by Her<lb/>
Majesty within two years, as in the case<lb/>
of Bills passed by the Legislatures of the<lb/>
said Provinces hitherto ; in like manner<lb/>
any Bill passed by a local Legislature<lb/>
shall be subject to disallowance by the<lb/>
Governor General within one year after<lb/>
the passing thereof." Here is a written<lb/>
Constitution with certain rights given and<lb/>
accorded to the local Legislatures, and<lb/>
        
            <pb n="119" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-06-01_Page_119.jpg"/>
 
 certain
rights are given to the General
<lb/>
Government. Suppose there is a con<lb break="no"/>fliction between the two Governments<lb/>
where is the appeal? In, the United
States <lb/>
they have an appeal to
the Judges of the <lb/>
land ; but here the General
Goeernment <lb/>
has an arbitrary veto and we have to sub<lb break="no"/>mit. I think this is a very
serious defect <lb/>
in the Constitution. Then in regard to<lb/>
this representation by
population.We<lb/>
should look simply to the passing hour<lb/>
when framing a Constitution, but should<lb/>
look into the future, and lay the founda<lb break="no"/>tions broad and deep, in order to meet the<lb/>
requirements of coming time. How is<lb/>
this eighty cents per head on the present<lb/>
population going to provide for our local<lb/>
wants fifty years hence, for we know that<lb/>
the wants of a country increases with the<lb/>
population ? We will have to resort to<lb/>
direct taxation. We will now see the<lb/>
amount we pay for Roads and Bridges,<lb/>
and what Canada pays ; for when we are<lb/>
invited to join our interest with Canada,<lb/>
we should see how she provides for her<lb/>
own people. We know that we have to<lb/>
pay $119,000 a year for our Roads and<lb/>
Bridges, and that it is insufficient to pro-<lb break="yes"/>
vied for them ; but the Canadians pay, on<lb/>
an equal amount of population, only $15,<lb break="no"/>000 for that purpose. For Education we<lb/>
give $13,000 ; in the same proportion<lb/>
Canada gives $5,000 or $6,000. The late<lb/>
Surveyor General says this taxation is a<lb/>
" great bugbear." Bugbear, forsooth !<lb/>
It may be for those who occupy high po<lb break="no"/>sitions and get their ?600 a year,
and do<lb/>
not much for it ; but it is of
vital import<lb break="no"/>ance to those who have to labor, and it is<lb/>
a question that affects
the great mass
of<lb/>
the people in this or any other
country. <lb/>
Then in reference to this Intercolonial
<lb/>
Railway. Was it stated by those who <lb/>
advocated this Union that, as a compen<lb break="no"/>sation for
the advantages we were to de<lb break="no"/>rive from this road, we were to
contribute<lb/>
to the Canal system ? Do you
think
Mr. <lb/>
George Brown would change his mind on<lb/>
this Railway question, unless he
felt there<lb/>
was an advantage to be gained
for this <lb/>
Canal system, for he is a man that has
<lb/>
ever been characterized as having an eye<lb/>
single to the interests of Upper Canada.<lb/>
Those Canals will not only be of no ad<lb break="no"/>vantage to the people of the Lower Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, but will be an injury to them if<lb/>
the Intercolonial Railway is built, because<lb/>
they would take the traffic in another di<lb break="no"/>rection instead of going on this Railway<lb/>
to Halifax. We will have to pay our<lb/>
share for extending those Canals, which<lb/>
are going to be an injury to us. Hon.<lb/>
members say there will be two parties in<lb/>
Canada, and the Lower Provinces will<lb/>
hold the balance of power. I am pre<lb break="no"/>pared to admit that, in general politics ;<lb/>
but when we come to matters of local ex<lb break="no"/>penditure they will be united in one. By<lb/>
way of illustration, we will say : my hon.<lb/>
colleague and I are in opposition, and take<lb/>
different sides in politics ; but when a<lb/>
Bill comes before the House for an ap<lb break="no"/>propriation of money for the County which<lb/>
we represent, we work side by side. If<lb/>
$20,000,000 or $30 000,000 was to be<lb/>
levied upon the people of the Confederacy<lb/>
for the extension of those Canals, those<lb/>
parties would be united as one ; their po<lb break="no"/>litical differences would not divide them,<lb/>
but they would act together and form one<lb/>
unbroken phalanx. In seventeen years Up<lb break="no"/>per Canada—taking the ratio of increase<lb/>
for the last twenty years—would have a nu<lb break="no"/>merical majority of representatives over all<lb/>
the rest, whereas we get no increase, but<lb/>
are liable to decrease ; because if Lower<lb/>
Canada increases faster than we do, our<lb/>
number will be reduced. Numerical<lb/>
       
            <cb/>

 strength is power, and they will use that<lb/>
power whether it be for our advantage or<lb/>
disadvantage. We are told we enter<lb/>
this Confederacy upon the most favor<lb break="no"/>able terms, and that Canada is going to<lb/>
build our railway. Where is the money<lb/>
to come from if they are not able to pay<lb/>
the interest on their own debts ? Their<lb/>
expenditure has been more than their re<lb break="no"/>ceipts except last year ; they have ex<lb break="no"/>hausted every resource ; they have their<lb/>
toll gates on the roads, and they resort to<lb/>
the most obnoxious taxes to which no<lb/>
country resorts, except in the last extre<lb break="no"/>mity ; they have imposed their stamp du<lb break="no"/>ties, which are never imposed until every<lb/>
other means of raising money has failed.<lb/>
If we entered this Confederation we would<lb/>
have these stamp duties, and our taxes<lb/>
would be increased and applied to the<lb/>
Canal extension in Canada, and the open<lb break="no"/>ing up of the North Western Territory. It<lb/>
is provided in the Scheme that " the com<lb break="no"/>munications with the North-Western Ter<lb break="no"/>ritory, and the improvements required for<lb/>
the development of the Trade of the<lb/>
Great West with the seaboard, are re<lb break="no"/>garded by this Conference as subjects of<lb/>
the highest importance to the Federated<lb/>
Provinces, and shall be prosecuted at the<lb/>
earliest possible period that the state of<lb/>
the Finances will permit." Who is to<lb/>
determine when the state of the Finances<lb/>
permit ? Who is determine when the<lb/>
North West Territory is to be opened up ?<lb/>
It will be Canada, for she has the unlimi<lb break="no"/>ted power of taxing the Confederacy, and<lb/>
her part of the taxes will be more than<lb/>
made up by the increased expenditure.<lb/>
Who then can say we go into Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion under more favorable circumstances<lb/>
than Canada ? She can make the Canals<lb/>
entirely free in order to attract the trade<lb/>
within her own bosom ; her debt being<lb/>
contracted for rebel losses, and the expen<lb break="no"/>diture on these Canals will never be pro<lb break="no"/>ductive, which will never yield two per<lb/>
cent. Our debt is incurred in construct<lb break="no"/>ing Railroads in the Province which<lb/>
would become the property of the Con<lb break="no"/>federation. We go into this Union with<lb/>
a debt of $7,000,000, and if our railroad<lb/>
pays six per cent, which it may do after<lb/>
Western Extension and the connection<lb/>
with Nova Scotia are built, we will go in<lb/>
without any debt at all ; we will give up<lb/>
our revenue of $700,000, and receive $0<lb/>
cents a head, amounting to $201,000.<lb/>
The control of our railroad will be in Otta<lb break="no"/>way, and any man who has a charge<lb/>
against the road will have to go to Cana<lb break="no"/>da to get redress. That accounts to my<lb/>
mind why it was that public officials con<lb break="no"/>nected with the Railway became active<lb/>
partizans in favor of this Scheme ; never<lb/>
did I see the powers of Government so<lb/>
completely prostrated ; they used their<lb/>
influence upon all persons who held of<lb break="no"/>fice, and all those who expected to get<lb/>
office ; they controlled thousands and<lb/>
thousands of votes in this country ; but<lb/>
the people of this country were true to<lb/>
their own interest, and resisted the influ<lb break="no"/>ences brought to bear, and rose in their<lb/>
power and rejected the Scheme with in<lb break="no"/>dignation. I should like to have some<lb/>
one here to speak on behalf of that dele<lb break="no"/>gation ; they have two of the delegates in<lb/>
the Upper House, for the people could not<lb/>
reach them, but every one of them the<lb/>
people could reach they hurled from place<lb/>
and power. Everything that was in the<lb/>
power of the Government to do, was done<lb/>
to carry the election ; they told the people<lb/>
of Fredericton they would secure the seat<lb/>
of Government for ever. Was that fair<lb/>
to appeal to people's prejudices and local<lb/>
feelings in order to influence them on this<lb/>
      
            <cb/>
   
 great
question ? Why was it that the offi<lb break="no"/>cers in the Post Office Department took an<lb/>
active part in this election? It was because<lb/>
every man connected with the Post Office<lb/>
would become independents of the people<lb/>
of this country. When the Custom House<lb/>
officers in this Province were appointed<lb/>
in England, the people were not treated<lb/>
as well as they are now. Neither would<lb/>
the people of this Province be satisfied<lb/>
or their interests served by having their<lb/>
officers only responsible at Ottaway. It<lb/>
is said now that our Legislature is too small<lb/>
to work out the principles of Re<lb break="no"/>sponsible Government ; for after it is
di<lb break="no"/>vided into two parties it is difficult to<lb/>
find men competent to discharge the du<lb break="no"/>ties of these offices. Let us imagine this<lb/>
Legislature reduced to a mere Munici<lb break="no"/>pality. Would any man of talent accept<lb/>
a seat in it ? and this Legislature would<lb/>
have to keep up all the officers in the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, as they have now in conduct<lb break="no"/>ing the administration of the country.<lb/>
To do what ? To issue <hi rendition="simple:italic">Tavern Licenses<lb/>
and fix bells on sheep</hi>, as the hon. member<lb/>
for York has remarked. Under the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of this Bill they have agreed to<lb/>
give Newfoundland $150,000 per annum.<lb/>
According to that, the people of this Pro<lb break="no"/>vince will have to pay Newfoundland<lb/>
twelve or thirteen thousand dollars a-year;<lb/>
that is our portion of what is paid for her<lb/>
mines and minerals. I can conceive<lb/>
Newfoundland refusing to go into Confe<lb break="no"/>deration, and this was a bribe offered her<lb/>
to induce her to enter. I put it distinct<lb break="no"/>ly to the country, whether they are will<lb break="no"/>ing to invest to the extent of $13,000,000<lb/>
a-year for ever in those mines and mine<lb break="no"/>rals which are utterly valueless. Then<lb/>
again, it was agreed that all engagements<lb/>
entered into for defence, should be as<lb break="no"/>sumed by the General Government. It<lb/>
is well known that a delegation went<lb/>
home from Canada, and it was supposed<lb/>
they went in connection with this busi<lb break="no"/>ness, and we would be bound to contri<lb break="no"/>bute our share towards any expnse so in<lb break="no"/>curred. Is it not surprising that this Go<lb break="no"/>vernment should give its consent to a pro<lb break="no"/>position of that kind, that they should go<lb/>
blind fold into an arrangement when they
<lb/>
had no voice in regard to how much
<lb/>
should be expended. Then again we
<lb/>
could derive no advantage commercially,
<lb/>
because
Canada can manufacture articles<lb/>
much cheaper than we can. I will state
to <lb/>
you the reasons which Mr. Annand
gives <lb/>
why Nova Scotia did not accept the offer <lb/>
of free trade from Canada. Some two or <lb/>
three years ago when it was pressed upon <lb/>
Mr. Tilley and himself by the Canadian <lb/>
Finacne Minister :-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>“ BECAUSE WE FELT <hi rendition="simple:italic">that as in <lb/>
Brunswick and Nova Scotia there
ex<lb break="no"/>isted a number of infant manufactures, it<lb/>
would be unfair to the manufactures,<lb/>
without notice or opportunity to invest their <lb/>
means in other pursuits, to bring them
into <lb/>
competition with the more advanced manu<lb break="no"/>factures of Canada ;</hi> and secondly, be<lb break="no"/>cause the Provinces had agreed to assume <lb/>
heavy liabilities, viz 3 1-2 12ths each of <lb/>
the cost of the Intercolonial
Railway, we <lb/>
felt it would be unwise to jeopardise so<lb/>
large amount of revenue. The following<lb/>
memorandum, under date 18th Sep., 1862,<lb/>
signed by the Premiers of the three Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, is conclusive on this point :<lb/>
            </p>





            <p> The delegates of Nova Scotia and <lb/>
New Brunswich, and the Government
of <lb/>
Canada, having under consideration
the <lb/>
report of the Hon. the Finance Minister,
<lb/>
ofCanada, of the 8th September instant,
<lb/>
on the subject of Intercolonial Recipro<lb break="no"/>city, agree—
            <pb n="120" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1865-06-01_Page_120.jpg"/>
           
1. That the free interchange of goods,<lb/>
the growth, produce, and manufacture of<lb/>
the Provinces, and uniformity of tariff, are<lb/>
considered to be an indispensible conse<lb break="no"/>quence of the Intercolonial Railway.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>2. But in consequence of the recent <lb/>
dimunition of the revenues of the respect<lb break="no"/>ive Provinces arising out of the war in<lb/>
the neighboring republic and increased<lb/>
liabilities incurred by the additional obli<lb break="no"/>gations necessary to the construction of<lb/>
the proposed road, the
delegates from<lb/>
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia regret<lb/>
that they are not at this moment in a<lb/>
position to adopt measures to carry this<lb/>
important principle into practical effect."<lb/>
            </p>

 
            <p> This
memorandum was signed by Messrs.<lb/>
McDonald, Howe and Tilley. That was<lb/>
a distinct proposition for free trade
made<lb/>
by Canada, and declined by those gentle<lb break="no"/>men because it was thought unfair for the<lb/>
infant manufactures of these Provinces<lb/>
to enter into competition with the more<lb/>
advanced manufactures of Canada. What<lb/>
extraordinary change has taken place in<lb/>
the minds of these men that induces them<lb/>
now to think that we are to become rich<lb/>
by this free trade which was declined in<lb/>
1862. I did think this delegation which<lb/>
we propose sending to England could have<lb/>
been avoided, for these delegations should<lb/>
not exist except public interest require<lb/>
them ; but judging from what we see<lb/>
around us, I think this delegation is re<lb break="no"/>quired, for after the Scheme had been<lb/>
rejected by the people of this Province by<lb/>
an overwhelming majority — in Prince Ed<lb break="no"/>ward Island almost unanimously —
the<lb/>
leading statesmen of Nova Scotia, afraid<lb/>
to submit it to the Legislature—referred<lb/>
in Newfoundland to the next general elec<lb break="no"/>tion—we find Canada has passed in
her<lb/>
Legislature a memorial or petition to the<lb/>
Queen, asking the Queen and the British<lb/>
Parliament to take steps to confirm this<lb/>
Scheme. They have also sent a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to England for the same object, and<lb/>
these gentlemen are misrepresenting the-<lb break="yes"/>
state of affairs in this Province. I think<lb/>
that statesmen of Canada have not treated<lb/>
us well, in sending a delegation to Eng<lb break="no"/>land to impress upon the Colonial Secre<lb break="no"/>tary the desirability of his using some<lb/>
measures to force us into this Union after<lb/>
we have rejected it. I do not think the<lb/>
Government of England will attempt any<lb/>
means of coercion ; if it does it will pro<lb break="no"/>duce a feeling of alienation from that<lb/>
Government with which we desire to live<lb/>
in connection as we have done in times<lb/>
past, as freemen and not as slaves; any at<lb break="no"/>tempt to force us into this Union we will<lb/>
resist even to the death. I regret that a<lb/>
delegation is necessary, but I am satisfied<lb/>
that it is our best policy to contradict<lb/>
those statements which are circulated in<lb/>
England that a strong reaction has taken<lb/>
place here favorable to Confederation.<lb/>
When I hear my hon. friend say that in<lb/>
six months after the people become en<lb break="no"/>lightened they will have a majority in<lb/>
favor of Confederation, and that we only<lb/>
represent the rabble and ignorance here;<lb/>
this has also been stated in the news<lb break="no"/>papers. In reply I can say that this<lb/>
House compares favorably with any House<lb/>
that has ever assembled here before.<lb/>
They say the public are not sufficiently<lb/>
enlightened. Some gentlemen say that<lb/>
they will spend two years enlightening<lb/>
the public mind. Do you think there is<lb/>
nothing but pure patriotism and love of<lb/>
country in this ? It is an arrogance which<lb/>
no man ought to assume ; to state that the<lb/>
people are steeped in ignorance, only one<lb/>
or two being able to grasp the mighty<lb/>
Scheme of Confederation, and it is neces<lb break="no"/><cb/>sary
for them to go forth and enlighten<lb/>
the people.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> Mr. CONNELL —I rise to address you at<lb/>
a great disadvantage after the eloquent<lb/>
oration which you have heard from the<lb/>
President of the Council. I know that<lb/>
there are but few on the floors of this<lb/>
House that are in favor of the great prin<lb break="no"/>ciples of Confederation, but it is not so<lb/>
throughout the country, for those princi<lb break="no"/>ples are gaining ground. I will make a<lb/>
few observations in reference to the im<lb break="no"/>propriety of appointing this delegation.<lb/>
I am one of those who believe it is the duty<lb/>
of the Government of the day to initiate the<lb/>
various measures desirable and necessary<lb/>
for the country, and to bring them before<lb/>
the Legislature. I believe the Quebec<lb/>
delegation acted in a constitutional man<lb break="no"/>ner, and had proper authority to act in re<lb break="no"/>gard to this Intercolonial Union. I find<lb/>
that in 1862, this despatch was sent by<lb/>
the Earl of Mulgrave to the Duke of New<lb break="no"/>castle :—</p>
            <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">Downing
Street, 6th July, 1862.</hi><lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MY LORD,-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I have duly received Your Lordship's<lb/>
despatch, No. 47, of the 21st of May, ac<lb break="no"/>companied by a copy of a Resolution<lb/>
which was passed in the House of Assem<lb break="no"/>bly on the 15th of April 1861, relative to<lb/>
an amalgamation of part, or all, of the<lb/>
British Provinces in North America. The<lb/>
resolution points out that the question<lb/>
might be considered either of a distinct<lb/>
Union of the Maritime Provinces, or of a<lb/>
general Union of them with Canada ; and<lb/>
suggests that it might be desirable, upon<lb/>
so important a subject, to ascertain the<lb/>
policy of her Majesty's Government, and<lb/>
so promote a consultation between the<lb/>
leading men of the Colonies.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship explains that, for vari<lb break="no"/>ous reasons, your Government were of<lb/>
opinion that it would inexpedient to<lb/>
act on this resolution last year, but they<lb/>
now wish it to be brought under conside<lb break="no"/>ration.</p>
            <p>No one can be insensible to the impor<lb break="no"/>tance of the two measures which are al<lb break="no"/>luded to : and I am far from considering<lb/>
that they do not form a very proper sub<lb break="no"/>ject for calm deliberation. They are,<lb/>
however, of a nature which renders it es<lb break="no"/>sentially fit, that if either of them be pro<lb break="no"/>posed for adoption, it should emanate in<lb/>
the first instance from the Provinces, and<lb/>
should be concurred in by all of them<lb/>
which it would affect. I should see no<lb/>
objection to any consultation on the sub<lb break="no"/>ject amongst the leading members of the<lb/>
Governments concerned ; but whatever<lb/>
the result of such consultation might be,<lb/>
the most satisfactory mode of testing the<lb/>
opinion of the people of British North<lb/>
America, would probably be by means of<lb/>
resolution or address, proposed in the Le<lb break="no"/>gislature of each Province by its own<lb/>
Government. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond this expression of the views<lb/>
of Her Majesty's Government as to the<lb/>
preliminary steps which might be taken<lb/>
towards the decision of this great ques<lb break="no"/>tion, I am not prepared to announce any<lb/>
course of policy upon which an invita<lb break="no"/>tion proceeding from one only of the<lb/>
British North American Provinces, and<lb/>
contained in a resolution of so general<lb/>
and vague a character as that which you<lb/>
have transmitted to me. But if a Union,<lb/>
either partial or complete, should here<lb break="no"/>after be proposed, with the concurrence<lb/>
of all the Provinces to be united, I am<lb/>
sure that the matter would be weighted<lb/>
in this country, both by the public, by<lb/>
Parliament, and by Her Majesty's Go<lb break="no"/>vernment, with no other feeling than an<lb/>
   
            <cb/>
         
anxiety to discern and promote any<lb/>
course which might be the most con<lb break="no"/>ducive to the prosperity, the strength,<lb/>
and the harmony of all the British com<lb break="no"/>munities in North America.</p>

            </p>


            <p> There was authority to the different<lb/>
Legislatures to act in reference to this<lb/>
subject. What better course could they<lb/>
have taken to come to a common agree<lb break="no"/>ment than the course they did. I find<lb/>
also a despatch from the Colonial Sec<lb break="no"/>retary to the Governor of Nova Scotia :<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> " I have your despatch of the 15th of<lb/>
Sept., communicating such details as<lb/>
you have been able to learn of the recent<lb/>
Conference which has been held at<lb/>
Charlottetown on the subject of Inter-<lb break="yes"/>
colonial Union of the British North<lb/>
American Provinces. I have to thank you<lb/>
for the interesting intelligence you have<lb/>
conveyed to me and to state with refer<lb break="no"/>ence to your request for authority to<lb/>
permit certain members of your Execu<lb break="no"/>tive Council to repair to Quebec, there<lb/>
to resume the discussion of this subject,<lb/>
that I have received an intimation from<lb/>
Lord Monek, that he intends communi<lb break="no"/>cating with me upon it, and as time is<lb/>
important, since it is proposed that the<lb/>
meeting shall take place early in Oct.,<lb/>
I have no hesitation in giving you at<lb/>
once the required permission."</p>
            <p>
Here is distinct authority from the Home <lb/>
Government. The Government have a <lb/>
right to initiate and prepare measures <lb/>
for the benefit of the
people, and when <lb/>
certain measures come before
them so <lb/>
desirable for the
interest of the country, <lb/>
it is the duty of the Government
to pre<lb break="no"/>pare them to lay before the Legislature <lb/>for their approval or rejection.
The re<lb break="no"/>port made by the delegates
from Nova <lb/>
Scotia, in my view, affirms the desira<lb break="no"/>bility of such a course. They go on to<lb/>
say-<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" After deliberating daily at great<lb/>
length until Thursday, the 27th Oct., <lb/>the Conference adjourned to Montreal,<lb/>
where a final meeting was held on the<lb/>
29th Oct. At this meeting it was unani<lb break="no"/>mously resolved that the various dele<lb break="no"/>gates should present the annexed re<lb break="no"/>port, as the common result at which the<lb/>
Conference had arrived, and which it<lb/>
was agreed should be authenticated by<lb/>
the signatures of all the members.<lb/>
Dealing, as this report does, with every<lb/>
branch of the subject, it is not necessary<lb/>
that any elaborate remarks should be<lb/>
added in order to place the whole ques<lb break="no"/>tion fully before your Excellency, but<lb/>
we have much gratification in stating<lb/>
that nothing was more conspicuous in<lb/>
the discussions of the Conference than a<lb/>
unanimous sentiment of devoted loyal<lb break="no"/>ty to the Crown, ardent attachment to<lb/>
British institutions, and a uniform de<lb break="no"/>sire to adopt such a constitution as would<lb/>
united the resources of all the Provinces<lb/>
represented in a common effort to pre<lb break="no"/>serve the rights and liberties which their<lb/>
inhabitants now enjoy as British subjects,<lb/>
and to ensure their continued connec<lb break="no"/>tion, with the Parent States.</p>
            <p>The undersigned cannot conclude this<lb/>
report without placing on record their<lb/>
lively appreciation of the uniform good<lb/>
feeling which marked the deliberations<lb/>
of the Conference, and the extreme<lb/>
courtesy and kindness manifested on<lb/>
every occasion by the Government and<lb/>

 people of
Canada to the delegates from <lb/>
the Maritime Provinces."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> I merely refer to this to show the ﬁrst<lb/>
statesmen in these Provinces, who were <lb/>
nominated by the several Lieut. Gover<lb break="no"/>nors to meet at Quebec to confer,
not for<lb/>
the purpose of taking away the liberties<lb/>
of the people, and for the purpose of <lb/>
acting tyrannically in the matter, but for<lb/>
the purpose of considering a union that<lb/>
would be for the good of all the differ<lb break="no"/>ent Provinces, and we ﬁnd by the Co<lb break="no"/>lonial Secretary's despatches that the<lb/>
course pursued by them met with the<lb/>
highest commendation of the British<lb/>
Government and people. It is said Her<lb/>
Majesty the Queen and her advisers de<lb/>
sire to force upon the people of
this <lb/>
country a union which will take away<lb/>
their liberties. This is a direct charge<lb/>
against the British Govemment and<lb/>
against her Majesty the Queen.
Al<lb break="no"/>though there are but few in favor of this <lb/>
union in the House, yet I am happy to<lb/>
know that throughout the country there
<lb/>
is now a large majority in favor of it.<lb/>
The hon. member for St. John (Mr.<lb/>
Cudlip) talks about rebelling ; is that a<lb/>
proper position to take, because
a <lb/>
change of opinion takes place?
In re<lb break="no"/>ference to this subject not having been <lb/>
discussed in the Legislature, Ican say I<lb/>
always was of opinion that the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment was wrong in dissolving the
As<lb break="no"/>sembly before this
question was dis<lb break="no"/>cussed. Before the dissolution of the<lb/>
House I took no part in this
question on<lb/>
account of my health, being
unable to <lb/>
leave my room the whole winter, and I <lb/>
would not have been in my place
now <lb/>
only that I considered the question of  <lb/>
such vast importance to the
country.<lb/>
If this question had been fully discussed<lb/>
in the House, the people of the country<lb/>
could not have complained that
the ques<lb break="no"/>tion was not fairly settled. As it was<lb/>
the people did not give a fair expres<lb break="no"/>sion of opinion upon it. Those opposed <lb/>
to the scheme took advantage of the<lb/>
prevailing opinion among emigrants<lb/>
from the old country of the unfairness <lb/>
of the union between England and
Ire<lb break="no"/>land, and argued that because
that  <lb/>
union was the means of
depopulating<lb/>
and bringing a tax upon Ireland, the  <lb/>
same state of things would exist
here if<lb/>
we entered upon this
union. It
was <lb/>
argued that it would bring a tax upon <lb/>
every thing they had, and
ﬁnally
they<lb/>
would lose their Parliament, which<lb/>
would be carried away to Ottawa.<lb/>
Was not this unfair to represent these <lb/>
things in the most
odious light and cir<lb break="no"/>culate them where they
would have <lb/>
most effect, in order to
alarm
the peo<lb break="no"/>ple. The President of the
Council says<lb/>
how very convenient it was for the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment to state there
would be
twenty <lb/>
four seats in the Legislative Council at <lb/>
Ottawa for the members of
the Legisla<lb break="no"/>tive Council in the Lower
Provinces, <lb/>
and this would have a great influence<lb/>
upon their votes. That may be the<lb/>
opinion of the hon. member,
and
it may<lb/>
be the opinion of those who are anti-<lb break="yes"/>
Confederates, but it may
not be a
cor<lb break="no"/>rect opinion after all, for they have al<lb break="no"/>ways been characterized as an
indepen<lb break="no"/>dent class of men. The President of the <lb/>
Council has also discussed
the great<lb/>
bug-bear of taxation. I believe,
under  <lb/>
the arrangements made by the
delegates, <lb/>
we would be in a far better
position
than<lb/>
we are now ; under that arrangement<lb/>
we would have had the Inter-colonial<lb/>
railway built at cost? of “$14,000.000
or<lb/>
$15,000,000, of which we
would
have <lb/>
            
            <cb/>       
           
 to have paid but the one thirteenth part,<lb/>
we would be relieved of our debt on<lb/>
which we now pay about £90,000 a year<lb/>
interest, and would have a large amount<lb/>
of money at our disposal for our roads,<lb/>
bridges and schools, and other local<lb/>
purposes, then we now have.</p>
            <p>House adjourned until 10. A. M., to<lb break="no"/>morrow.</p>

<!-- GL, 2016-11-10, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

           <!-- <p>FRIDAY MORNING, June 2.</p>
            <p>Mr CONNELL resumed.—The minori<lb break="no"/>ty in this question of Confederation have<lb/>
been denominated " conspirators," and<lb/>
it has been said that they are using " se<lb break="no"/>cret influences" to force it yet upon the<lb/>
country, that there is a " hidden hand"<lb/>
at work. What, I would ask, is the ob<lb break="no"/>ject of sending a new delegation to Eng<lb break="no"/>land? Is it to overcome the action of<lb/>
those who, though defeated and in the<lb/>
minority, have still a greater influence<lb/>
over the English mind and the English<lb/>
Parliament than those who hold power<lb/>
in the present House? Is this the "hid<lb break="no"/>den hand" spoken of? They were not<lb/>
afraid to submit the question to the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of this Province, and dissolved the<lb/>
House that no other issue than this great<lb/>
question might be before the people's<lb/>
minds. That dissolution was called for<lb/>
by the hon. President of the Council,<lb/>
although he now condemns the late Go<lb break="no"/>vernment for it. And who brings for<lb break="no"/>ward this resolution ? Is it not done at<lb/>
the instigation of the Government? If<lb/>
they are convinced that the interests of<lb/>
this country are in peril, why not take<lb/>
the responsibility of appointing this dele<lb break="no"/>gation upon themselves? It is said that<lb/>
owing to the dissolution this resolution<lb/>
has been found necessary to bring these<lb/>
resolutions forward. It seems some<lb break="no"/>thing very extraordinary that at this<lb/>
late period of the session, when hon.<lb/>
members are all anxious to get home,<lb/>
that another week should be given to<lb/>
debate this question, and all to justify<lb/>
the Government in appointing a delega<lb break="no"/>tion to go to England to tell the Im<lb break="no"/>perial Parliament that we are still a loy<lb break="no"/>al people. It has been put forth here<lb/>
and elsewhere that there was no autho<lb break="no"/>rity for the action taken by those in<lb/>
favor of Confederation. But I think the<lb/>
despatches of the Secretary of State<lb/>
have settled that question, and he, it is<lb/>
to be presumed, is pretty good authori<lb break="no"/>ty : he says it was done " with the sanc<lb break="no"/>tion of the Crown." But I want to say<lb/>
a few words on these " conspirators."<lb/>
I have here an extract from a speech<lb/>
made by a gentleman, who is a French<lb/>
Canadian, and who was said to be con<lb break="no"/>cerned in the difficulties in Canada some<lb/>
years ago. It was said that the people<lb/>
of Canada at that time were guilty of<lb/>
rebellion, because they stood out for cer<lb break="no"/>tain rights which they supposed they<lb/>
had, and the leaders were termed " re<lb break="no"/>bels." But the people of England have<lb/>
see that the rights claimed were just,<lb/>
and two who were charged with being<lb/>
leaders of that rebellion have since re<lb break="no"/>ceived much honor, and Her Majesty has<lb/>
seen fit to reward them, and their conduct<lb/>
has been justified more I think than the<lb/>
professed loyalty of Anti-Confederates ever<lb/>
will be. One of these, Sir H. LaFontaine,<lb/>
has gone to his rest, the other, Sir E<lb/>
Tache, who in 1812 shouldered his musket<lb/>
in defence of his country, and was ap<lb break="no"/>pointed Aid-de-Camp to Her Majesty, is<lb/>
still living, and giving his influence and<lb/>
energies to the forwarding of this great<lb/>
Scheme. When the Scheme was first<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p> brought forward, as the Hon. President of<lb/>
the Council knows, I regarded it with dis<lb break="no"/>gust, but the fact that it would give us the<lb/>
Intercolonial Railway, and on terms which<lb/>
were most favorable, my mind became<lb/>
convinced that the Scheme was good, and<lb/>
this impression has become stronger the<lb/>
more I have looked into the matter. One<lb/>
honorable member has said that an insigni<lb break="no"/>ficant body in St. John—the Chamber of<lb/>
Commerce—was at the bottom of the <lb/>
whole affair, as they invited the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture of Canada to come down and visit us.<lb/>
If this is the case, then the hon. mover of<lb/>
these Resolutions (Mr. Cudlip) must be<lb/>
regarded as one of the "conspirators,"<lb/>
as he, I believe, was the President of that<lb/>
body. But I think the term applied to<lb/>
such men as the Hon. John Robertson<lb/>
and Lauchlan Donaldson, Esq., men of the<lb/>
highest respectability in this Province, and<lb/>
who are leading members of that body, is<lb/>
unjust and uncalled for. At that very<lb/>
time when the Canadians were with us, in<lb/>
those festivities of which we have heard<lb/>
so much when men's minds were not in<lb/>
train to say and do the things they would,<lb/>
the sam hon. gentleman who now charges<lb/>
those favorable to Confederation with be<lb break="no"/>ing " conspirators," said that " we must<lb/>
have a Union of these Colonies or drift<lb/>
into Annexation."<lb/>

            </p>


            <p> I will now read the extract from a<lb/>
speech delivered by Mr. Cartier, Attorney<lb/>
General of Lower Canada, now in London<lb/>
as one of the delegates who have gone<lb/>
home from that Province. He says :<lb break="no"/>
            </p>
            <p>" I, however, avail myself of this oppor<lb break="no"/>tunity of remarking that if we in Canada<lb/>
take our share in the defence of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, that will necessarily involve a great<lb/>
expenditure ; but I may add that you need<lb/>
not fear what you have been told will hap<lb break="no"/>pen—an increase in the duty on the goods<lb/>
imported from England into Canada.<lb/>
( Hear. ) Assertions to that effect are not<lb/>
warranted ; and as they are causing a<lb/>
great deal of mischief, I am glad of the<lb/>
opportunity of making the statement that<lb/>
there is no foundation for them. (Hear,<lb/>
hear.) It has been stated in speeches in<lb/>
both Houses of Parliament, as well as in<lb/>
certain newspapers in this country, that<lb/>
since Canada is so vulnerable it would be<lb/>
better for the security of England that<lb/>
Canada should be left either to assume a<lb/>
position of independence or to be annexed<lb/>
to the United States. (" No, no.") We<lb/>
understand in Canada that a cause of war<lb/>
can scarcely arise from ourselves. War<lb/>
in Canada must arise from an Imperial<lb/>
cause. We understand that we are vul<lb break="no"/>nerable ; but we are willing that our coun<lb break="no"/>try should be the battlefield in order that<lb/>
the honour of England may be vindicated.<lb/>
(Loud cheers.) We have no desire to be<lb/>
independent of this country, and still less<lb/>
have we any desire to be annexed to the<lb/>
United States ; we have no desire to be<lb break="no"/>come a portion of the American republic.<lb/>
(Cheers.) Such an idea we view with<lb/>
horror—(renewed cheers)—but from Her<lb/>
Majesty's speech on the opening of the<lb/>
present session of Parliament we know<lb/>
that our scheme of confederation is ap<lb break="no"/>proved by her Majesty's Government, and<lb/>
by the sense of the English people. (Hear,<lb/>
hear.) Subsequent proceedings have<lb/>
shown that it has the approval of both<lb/>
Houses of Parliament, and we feel that,<lb/>
under such a system, we can aid England<lb/>
in any struggle she may have with the<lb/>
United States. (Cheers.) if the falla<lb break="no"/>cious argument prevailed that, because<lb/>
the defence of a particular colony was<lb/>
likely to become expensive to the mother<lb/>
country at a particular juncture, that<lb/>
