<!-- GL, 2018-02-21, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

   
          <!--  <p>
     was but the beginning of the end. It   
     <lb/>was chiefly laid down during the late cam<lb break="no"/>paign that no large sums should be grant<lb break="no"/>ed for this purpose, as insignificance was<lb/>our best defence. While he belonged to <lb/>as loyal a section of the Province as any,<lb/>he would ask, what could $30,000 do for<lb/>our defence? Before entering into this <lb/>matter the Hill should have been laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, but not till that moment<lb/>had it been laid on his desk. He held<lb/>that the calling of the people out for their <lb/>yearly inspection, was a waste of time <lb/>and money.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. Gillmor said it was intend<lb break="no"/>ed to change that.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. McClellan.â€”That was just what 
     <lb/>
     he wanted to see the Bill ; for, he certainly 
     <lb/>
     was not in favor of such a scheme being 
     <lb/>
     carried out or retained in the country, 
     <lb/>
     aithough he considered the putting down 
     <lb/>
     of a grant of $30,000 for Militia purposes 
     <lb/>
     as a concession to the principle of Con<lb break="no"/>federation ; yet he thought it was ill-timed, 
     <lb/>
    as we were not in a position to provide 
     <lb/>for ourselves. Here there is little or 
     <lb/>nothing to defend. If the Government 
     <lb/>expect an invasion, it must be from the 
     <lb/>States ; and he would ask what could we 
     <lb/>do against their great armies? I do not 
     <lb/>wish the House to understand that I am 
     <lb/>opposed to this grant, for I think that the 
     <lb/>provision for military defence should be 
     <lb/>the first object of the country, but 1 am 
     <lb/>opposed to filling up the blank with any 
     <lb/>such sum as that named. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. Wilmot said he was against 
     <lb/>
     the abolition of the old Militia law. If a 
     <lb/>
     Colony was willing to assist in its own 
     <lb/>
     defence, it was valuable to the Empire ; 
     <lb/>
     but if it was not willing, it became only a 
     <lb/>
     burden. He was one of those who had 
     <lb/>
     the honor to be a private in the Aroostook 
     <lb/>
     war, and he remembered, when a little 
     <lb/>
     boy, in the war of 1812, when the 104th 
     <lb/>
     regiment was raised in this Province. 
     <lb/>
     There was no talk about Confederation 
     <lb/>
     then, although the men went and fought 
     <lb/>
     in Canada as bravely as any there. lt 
     <lb/>
     might be true that our weakness was our 
     <lb/>
     best strength ; but in case of extremity, 
     <lb/>
     he was sure the people would be willing 
     <lb/>
     to do what they could, and when the pal<lb break="no"/>try sum of $30,000 is asked for, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the Province and of hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on the floors of the House would 
     <lb/>
     uphold it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     Mr. L. P. W. DESBRISAY, after some 
     <lb/>
     introductory remarks on Confederation in 
     <lb/>
     reply to those from other members, said . 
     <lb/>
     He was surprised to hear the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Westmorland ask what great 
     <lb/>
     change had transpired. He had gone 
     <lb/>
     through  a campaign in an adjoining Coun<lb break="no"/>ty to his own, and he ought to know what 
     <lb/>
     had transpired. In Nova Scotia they 
     <lb/>
     have given $81,000 for Militia purposes, 
     <lb/>
     and he was sorry-this Government had 
     <lb/>
     not been able to put down pound for 
     <lb/>
     pound for our Sister Province, and to 
     <lb/>
     stop the assertion put forth that we are 
     <lb/>
     not as loyal as she. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     statement put forth as to the feelings of 
     <lb/>
     the people of England being for cutting 
     <lb/>
     us off, those who talk in  this way are a 
     <lb/>
    people who began cutting us off by  im<lb break="no"/>posing upon us with regard to our lum<lb break="no"/>ber ; they have no care for the greatness 
     <lb/>the country, save to turn it into a 
     <lb/>workshop. And there was one thing, 
     <lb/>that he felt our Government did not do 
     <lb/>their duty to the English Government at 
     <lb/>the time of the Trent affair. When they 
     <lb/>sent out regiments of soldiers, and the <lb/>best blood of the country too, to provide<lb/>for our defence, our Government should<lb/>have taken them by the hand and passed<lb/>them through the Province free of charge.<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     He was certain we could have passed 
     <lb/>them through at one-third less than what<lb/>it did cost the Imperial Government. I<lb/>am sorry to see the grant so small, as I<lb/>think we should make it in accordance<lb/>with the benefits we receive from the<lb/>protection of England, although he was<lb/>sure the feeling there is such that whe-<lb break="maybe"/>there we spend $300 or $30,000, they will <lb/>continue to protect us.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>Mr. Needham had somewhere read<lb/>that it was excellent to have the strength<lb/>of giants, but tyrannous to use it. He<lb/>thought they could afford to be easy with<lb/>the poor unfortunates who were left out.<lb/>He was quite willing they should glory<lb/>in what they could, even in being beaten.<lb/>He was not going to vote for the $30,-<lb break="maybe"/>000, to show England that we are loyal, <lb/>but because the Government informs<lb/>the House that it is necessary for the <lb/>wants of the country. As to letting <lb/>England know we are loyal, it is what<lb/>she knew long ago. When the old <lb/>104th Regiment was raised, and they<lb/>went to Canada, they did not go to fight<lb/>for this country, but to defend the flag. <lb/>We once voted every shilling out of the <lb/>Treasury in a time of danger ; and what<lb/>for? To defend the flag. They know<lb/>we are loyal ; but the Government say<lb/>they want it : therefore I am willing they<lb/>should ; but if they do not use it right, <lb/>he would call them to account for it. He <lb/>did not believe we are called on to de<lb break="no"/>fend ourselves : for we are an integral<lb/>part of the empire. If England needs <lb/>to build fortifications on every headland <lb/>on our shores, or elsewhere, all we are<lb/>called on to do is provide well for our<lb/>militia. The hon. member for West<lb break="no"/>morland (Mr. Gilbert) had said, no man<lb/>dare stand up in the House of Commons <lb/>and say we are disloyal. Why? where<lb/>was Sam Slick, or in other words, where <lb/>was Judge Halliburton? He charged<lb/>us with disloyalty, and Nova Scotia too ; <lb/>and no man there to contradict him. <lb/>He wished he had been there, Sam Slick <lb/>wouldn't have written any more novels. <lb/>With regard to insignificance being our<lb/>best defence, it was sad to admit it-<lb break="yes"/>but true. He did not believe in the <lb/>United States coming to swallow us up :<lb/>for the fact was, the war there was dead, <lb/>and here confederation was dead ; they <lb/>both died together, only one died a little<lb/>while before the other, that was all ; as <lb/>to the latter he hoped never to see the <lb/>ghost of it again. The ghost of it was <lb/>bad enough, but he hoped that it would <lb/>never come back ; if it did he hoped the <lb/>Lord in His infinite mercy would take<lb/>him away from here.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>Mr. Thompson did not know what this<lb/>$30,000 would do, but he thought the <lb/>House should study by putting ourselves<lb/>in a proper state of defence, to preserve<lb/>the connection with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try. Those who talked in the House of<lb/>Commons about our going off from them <lb/>were only radicals. We never hear of<lb/>men like Lord Palmerston making use<lb/>of such expressions, but that the coun<lb break="no"/>try might be preserved in its integrity. <lb/>This is as much a part of the country as<lb/>the County of Antrim, where he came <lb/>from. He should support the grant, as<lb/>he believed it was required.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    
   
            <p>
     Hon. Mr. ALLEN reviewed the various 
     <lb/>objections that had been made against<lb/>the grant, exposed the disposition of <lb/>some Canadians to place our Province<lb/>in a false light with England, and read<lb/>an extract from a paper for which the<lb/>country pays Â£60 a year, in which it was<lb/>attempted to be proved that we desire<lb/>annexation. He showed that the amount<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>granted would be properly expended,<lb/>and explained at considerable length <lb/>the provisions of the new Militia Bill<lb/>about to be brought before the House.<lb/>Some further remarks were made chiefly<lb/>on the contents of the bill by different<lb/>members, but as they will be given <lb/>more fully when the bill is under debate<lb/>they are omitted here.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The question was put to the House on <lb/>Mr. Gilbert's amendment for $10,000,<lb/>which was lost. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. LINDSAY then proposed that the <lb/>blank be filled with $20,000, which was<lb/>rejected 31 to 6.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On the resolution being submitted, it<lb/>was sustained by an opposite result.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The other items of supply were then<lb/>passed without debate, and the House <lb/>adjourned to meet to-morrow morning at<lb/>9 o'clock, a.m.<lb/>J.M.<lb/>

            <head rendition="simple:right">FRIDAY, May 19.</head>

<p><persName ref="pers:GILL1">Hon. Mr. GILLMOR</persName> brought in a Bill to<lb/>provide for paying certain expenses of the <lb/>civil government of the Province. Also-<lb break="yes"/>a Bill to provide for repairs and improve<lb break="no"/>ments on Roads and Bridges and other<lb/>public works. <lb/>
</p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> moved that the House go<lb/>into Committee to resume the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of a Bill to cheapen and simplify the<lb/>practice of the law, and to abolish special<lb/>bail.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. Mr. HATHEWAY</persName> thought that as<lb/>there was not the slightest chance of<lb/>getting this Bill passed by the House, it <lb/>was no use to take up the timv in the dis<lb break="no"/>cussing it, particularly as the Attorney<lb/>General had prepared a Bill on the same<lb/>subject.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> said the Bill before the<lb/>House was not of a complicated nature,<lb/>and could be easily understood. Fifteen<lb/>sections of the bill had already passed the<lb/>House, and he should like to have the <lb/>question decided.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. NEEDHAM</persName>-The Attorney Gener<lb break="no"/>al's Bill and the Bill which I prepared,<lb/>are the result of the joint labors of the<lb/>late Hon. Mr. Sireet, Mr. Kinnear and<lb/>Mr. Charles Fisher, and I presume, having<lb/>the result of their labors, we would be<lb/>hardly justified in adopting a Bill of this<lb/>kind, which changes our whole system of <lb/>common law procedure, the provisions of<lb/>which it would be impossible to carry <lb/>out. I move that the law bills now on the<lb/>fyles of the House, together with the Bill<lb/>to be introduced by the Attorney General,<lb/>be referred to a Select Committee of this<lb/>House, in order that they may bring in a<lb/>Bill at the next Session of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture to reform the Common Law Pro<lb break="no"/>cedure of this country.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:OTTY1">Mr. OTTY</persName>.-I shall withdraw my mo<lb break="no"/>tion in favor of that which Mr. Needham<lb/>introduced.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName>.-I expected the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the legal profession would oppose<lb/>this Bill ; it will, therefore, have to rest<lb/>upon its own merits. It does not change<lb/>the course of law procedure, but does<lb/>away with unnecessary labor. The coun<lb break="no"/>try requires this Bill, and the House by<lb/>passing fifteen sections of it has adopted <lb/>its principles. It has been drawn up<lb/>with a great deal of care, and if there is <lb/>anything wrong in it, let the legal gentle<lb break="no"/>men point it out. It would be an act of<lb/>injustice to refer it to a Select Committee,<lb/>for that would be an end of it.<lb/>

      Â <fw type="num">73</fw>
         

     time is taken up in unnecessary proceed<lb break="no"/>ings, and in consequence has to have<lb/>heavy fees. There are a great many of<lb/>the members of this House in favour of<lb/>the Bill, provided there is no difficulty in<lb/>its working. It may bear hard upon some<lb/>individuals, but there is no law passed<lb/>that bears equally upon all. The House<lb/>has had a long time to consider the merits<lb/>of this Bill, and should come to a decision<lb/>either to adopt or reject it.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
       Â  <persName ref="pers:LIND1">Mr. Lindsay</persName>. - I think we have hadÂ  
     <lb/>enough of law commissions ; to put this<lb/>Bill in the hands of a law commission<lb/>would make it cost hundreds of pounds,<lb/>and then it would soon want to be amend<lb break="no"/>ed. The President of the Council thought<lb/>the fees were too small when the amount<lb/>to be collected was large, being only ten<lb/>shillings for making out a writ ; but in<lb/>that case the lawyer would have a retain<lb break="no"/>ing fee. I shall support the principle of<lb/>the Bill, without they could show some<lb/>absurdity in it.<lb/>
     
     
            </p>
            <p>  Â  <persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. Kerr</persName>. - If I thought there was anyÂ <lb/>chance of getting the Bill through this<lb/>Session, I would be in favor of it ; but I<lb/>do not think there is the slightest chance,<lb/>and, therefore, in order to get on with the<lb/>business, I shall vote to place it in the<lb/>hands of a Committee.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
       Â  <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName>. - It is getting to be tooÂ  
     <lb/>common a practice to delegate our power<lb/>to a Committee. It is better to dispose of<lb/>it this Session, and if there should be<lb/>anything in it that was wrong, the other<lb/>branch of the Legislature could point it<lb/>out.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
       Â  <persName ref="pers:DESB2">Mr. L. P. W. DesBrisay</persName>. - The BillÂ    
     <lb/>will have to be thrown out or referred to <lb/>a Committee, for the House has no time<lb/>to attend to it at this season of the year.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>  Â  <persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. McMillan</persName>. - I hope the Bill willÂ <lb/>not be dealt with in that summary way.<lb/>The Bill is not a new one, for we had it<lb/>before us at the last meeting of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature, when it was fully discussed. If<lb/>there are any objections to the Bill, now<lb/>is the time to make them, so that they<lb/>can be discussed.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>  Â  <persName ref="pers:WILL1">Mr. Williston</persName>. - I was not in theÂ <lb/>House when this discussion arose, but I<lb/>understand that a motion has been made<lb/>to refer this with two other Bills to a<lb/>Select Committee. I think that is the<lb/>proper mode of disposing of them. This<lb/>is an important measure, and should be<lb/>carefully considered; because it may, and<lb/>I think it will, work with great injustice.<lb/>The Bill to be brought in by the Attorney<lb/>General has all the elements of success<lb/>within itself ; it follows out the law pro<lb break="no"/>cedure in England, which has been found<lb/>to work extremely well ; persons at law<lb/>are confined to the point at issue, and are<lb/>not compelled to summon unnecessary<lb/>witnesses ; for instance, an action is<lb/>brought on a note of hand, the person<lb/>coming to defend the suit has to state the<lb/>ground of defence; whatever the ground of<lb/>defence is, he is bound to set it forth ;<lb/>therefore, the Plaintiff does not have to<lb/>summon witnesses to meet an imaginary<lb/>defence. I have not had an opportunity<lb/>to examine the Bill introduced by my hon.<lb/>friend from York, but I suppose there will<lb/>be some good features in it. It is impos<lb break="no"/>sible for us at this season of the year to<lb/>give this question the consideration it de<lb break="no"/>serves, for it is a matter of the greatest<lb/>importance, and may be a curse to the<lb/>country instead of remedying the evils of<lb/>which we complain. We should refer the<lb/>question to two or three hon. members of<lb/>this House, and they could give their at<lb break="no"/>tention to it and bring a Bill into the<lb/>House next winter, which would be a<lb/>benefit to the Province.<lb/>
            </p>

    
            <cb/>
            <p>
       Â  Â Mr. Needham. - The hon. mover of this 
     <lb/>Bill challenges the legal profession to<lb/>show where it is wrong. I challenge him<lb/>to show any provision made for trespass<lb/>and replevin ; that is one defect and no<lb/>small one either. My hon. friend from<lb/>Carleton talks about the cost of a law<lb/>commission ; it is not the intention to re<lb break="no"/>fer the matter to a commission, but to a<lb/>Select Committee ; how can a Select<lb/>Committee charge for taking care of these<lb/>Bills ? The motion is not to refer them<lb/>to a commission at all. I was on a law<lb/>commission once where I worked and was<lb/>not paid for it, through political trickery<lb/>and chicanery, but I am going to have it,<lb/>for what I earn I have a right to. I tell<lb/>my hon. friend he may be a good judge<lb/>of some things, but he is no judge of law,<lb/>and that is nothing to his discredit, for it<lb/>is not his profession. I do not hesitate<lb/>to say that that Bill is a complete jumble<lb/>of nonsense, and it would be impossible<lb/>to carry it out. Talk about carrying it up<lb/>to the other branch of the Legislature!<lb/>It would be laughed at. It will not cheap<lb break="no"/>en law, but will increase litigation, put<lb break="no"/>ting money in the lawyers' pockets. It is<lb/>not necessary that we should take up<lb/>every Section of that Bill and show its<lb/>absurdity, for there are some principles<lb/>there that are perfectly right, and lawyers<lb/>are willing to go for them. Lawyers get<lb/>the credit of getting more cost than they<lb/>actually do ; take for instance eight or<lb/>nine pounds cost on a judgment by de<lb break="no"/>fault, and how much does the lawyer get ?<lb/>He gets four or five pounds; all the rest is<lb/>paid into the Province, except a few shil<lb break="no"/>lings paid to the Judges ; about two-thirds<lb/>of the whole cost goes into the lawyer's<lb/>pocket. Is it fair that you should leave<lb/>those other costs, while you cut down the<lb/>lawyers and leave them nothing at all ?<lb/>In this Bill you have 11s. 8d. charged for<lb/>a writ; 2s. 6d. for a copy ; Clerk of the<lb/>Court 1s. 6d. - making 15s. 8d. If the<lb/>defendent settles this before the return of<lb/>the writ the lawyer gets ten shillings, be<lb break="no"/>ing 5s. 8d. less than he would have re<lb break="no"/>ceived if the suit had gone on. If it is<lb/>right the lawyer should get 15s. 8d., why<lb/>should he be robbed of part of it, as an<lb/>inducement to the parties to settle, and<lb/>pay the 1s. 6d. to the Clerk out of his own<lb/>pocket? If the House is anxious to do<lb/>what is lawful and right they will refer<lb/>this Bill to a Select Committee. People<lb/>seem to forget that law is a science, and to<lb/>perfect that science and make it what it<lb/>ought to be requires the united wisdom of<lb/>all engaged in it. Therefore, it should<lb/>be the lawyer's place to consider the pro<lb break="no"/>visions of this Bill. The hon. member<lb/>from St. John has said, this Bill would<lb/>prevent litigation in cases where the<lb/>amount to be collected is small. The<lb/>truth is, even now lawyers would rather<lb/>do nothing than collect Bills that are un<lb break="no"/>der Â£20 by the summary process, for it<lb/>does not pay them for their trouble.<lb/>

       Â  <persName ref="pers:CUDL1">Mr. Cudlip</persName>. - If the reduction of feesÂ  
     <lb/>would induce parties to come to a settle<lb break="no"/>ment, would it not be patriotic for the<lb/>lawyers to throw off a shilling or two of<lb/>their fees to accomplish that object, when<lb/>they consider the expense of juries and<lb/>witnesses, and allow them, by shortening<lb/>the business of the Court, to go home<lb/>sooner than they otherwise would.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>  Â  <persName ref="pers:NEED1">Mr. Needham</persName>. - That is very goodÂ <lb/>doctrine. I wonder if that gentleman has<lb/>not patriotism enough to supply the Poor<lb/>House, because that would save the<lb/>trouble and expense of the Collectors<lb/>going round to collect the poor rates. He<lb/>has just as much right to do so as the<lb/>lawyer has to give his labor for nothing.<lb/>

     Let me tell that hon. gentleman that the 
     <lb/>lawyers, as a body in this country, throw<lb/>away and give away more costs than<lb/>would feed ten poor houses. It is a com<lb break="no"/>mon thing for a man when presented with<lb/>a very heavy bill by his lawyer, to ask him<lb/>to give off something ; and he can afford<lb/>to do so, because there are costs charged<lb/>in it that the lawyer never worked for.<lb/>I believe if this House would refer this<lb/>Bill to a committee, they would prepare<lb/>a Bill to lay before the next Session of<lb/>the Legislature of which the House would<lb/>not be ashamed.<lb/>

       Â  <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. Wetmore</persName>. - I fully agree withÂ  
     <lb/>many of the remarks made by the hon.<lb/>member from the County of York. This<lb/>Bill has been an annual offering, and it<lb/>doubtless had a beneficial effect at the<lb/>last election in the County of Westmor<lb break="no"/>land. It seems to be my hon. friend's<lb/>hobby, for it is always uppermost in his<lb/>mind, being a species of monomania.<lb/>There may be some necessity for law re<lb break="no"/>form in this country. I am not prepared<lb/>to deny this, but I am prepared to say<lb/>that it is unfair for hon. members, and for<lb/>him, to make the attack which he did<lb/>upon the legal gentlemen of the Province.<lb/>I am prepared to take any stand as one of<lb/>those legal men, and challenge any other<lb/>profession.<lb/>

            <p>
       Â  <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. Gilbert</persName>. - I did not make an at<lb break="no"/>tack upon the profession. I said that in<lb/>some cases members of that profession<lb/>might be found to be unscrupulous. I<lb/>did not make a general attack.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     
       Â  <persName ref="pers:WETM1">Mr. Wetmore</persName>. - I heard my hon.Â  
     <lb/>friend deliberately say that he would not<lb/>suppose that a majority of the legal pro<lb break="no"/>fession were men of no character. If that<lb/>is not an insinuation against a body of<lb/>men, I am at a loss to know how you<lb/>can make an insinuation against them.<lb/>Probably he did not intend to make this<lb/>assault ; and I think he ought not to have<lb/>done so, occupying the position which he<lb/>does, for there is an old adage which says,<lb/>" It is a dirty bird which will foul its<lb/>own nest." My hon. friend may have<lb/>found some members of the legal pro<lb break="no"/>fession who are not men of such sterling<lb/>integrity as they ought to be ; but I as<lb break="no"/>sert that the lawyers of this country, as a<lb/>body, are entitled to as much credit for<lb/>integrity of character as any other class<lb/>of men in the community, and the people<lb/>of this country repose confidence in them.<lb/>Large sums of money are placed in their<lb/>hands without any security, for not<lb/>one man in fifty will ask for the<lb/>scratch of a pen to show for it. I<lb/>have heard a great deal said about the<lb/>Government being disposed to maintain<lb/>vested rights. Now, I ask if it is fair<lb/>play for men who have spent their time<lb/>and talents in getting a profession to have<lb/>their means of living wrested from them<lb/>without an hour's notice, without even<lb/>consulting the members of that profession,<lb/>some of whom may have arrived at that<lb/>time of life that they cannot earn a living<lb/>by any other means. He (Mr. Wetmore)<lb/>then proceeded to show the absurdity of<lb/>the Bill in reference to the fees, and con<lb break="no"/>tinued. - There is no originality in the<lb/>Bill ; it was a section picked up here, and<lb/>another there, and where there was an<lb/>attempt made to originate anything, it<lb/>amounted to an absurdity. Now, I might<lb/>ask him where is the necessity of plead<lb break="no"/>ing the general issue. Suppose a man<lb/>has sued an endorser of a promisory note,<lb/>and his defence is that he did not receive<lb/>notice that the note had been dishonored,<lb/>where is the necessity in this case for the<lb/>party to plead the general issue, and the<lb/>plaintiff having to prove everything con [...]
