<!-- GL, 2018-02-27, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

<!--<p> Committee
: Messrs. Williston, Young, <lb/>
Otty, Boyd. L. P. W. Desbrisay. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR.
MCCLELAN moved that a Com<lb break="no"/>mittee be appointed to whom shall be re<lb break="no"/>ferred all matters relating to
the mining<lb/>
interests. Committee : Messrs. McCle- <lb break="maybe"/>
lan, Bailey, Thompson, Connell, Wilmot. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR.
GILBERT</persName> read the report of the<lb/>
Committee appointed to provide for the <lb/>
Reporting and Printing the
Debates, and <lb/>
said the Committee had taken
great trou<lb break="no"/>ble to carry out the arrangements, and <lb/>
had done their best to
economise, and se<lb break="no"/>cure the services of competent Reporters.
<lb/>
The terms of the arrangement
were simi<lb break="no"/>lar to those that had been made last year. <lb/>
As the present Session promised to be <lb/>
one of the most important that had taken <lb/>
place in the Province, and as it
would be <lb/>
desirable that the proceedings
of the <lb/>
House should be circulated abroad, he <lb/>
proposed that 7000 copies of the Debates <lb/>
should be printed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The report was then adopted. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. SUTTON
moved that a Commit<lb break="no"/>tee be appointed to whom shall be refer<lb break="no"/>red all matters relating to the
agricultu<lb break="no"/>ral interests of the Province. Commit<lb break="no"/>tee : Messrs. Sutton, McClelan, Meehan,
<lb/>
Kerr, Caie, Landry, Lewis, Scovil, Per<lb break="no"/>kins, Cudlip, Hatheway, W. E.
Perley, <lb/>
Costigan, and Thompson. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. WETMORE moved that the ap<lb break="no"/>portionment of the Debates should be ac<lb break="no"/>cording to the population of 1861. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. MCMILLAN contended that it was<lb/>
not in the city that the hon. mover of the <lb/>
resolution represented that the Debates <lb/>
were wanted to circulate, it was outside <lb/>
places. In St. John they had a daily sy- <lb break="maybe"/>
nopsia of the proceedings of the House <lb/>
in the newspapers, and it was found that <lb/>
the people there did not properly appre<lb break="no"/>ciate the Debates. He hoped the hon. <lb/>
mover would not object to give each mem<lb break="no"/>ber of the House an equal portion. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> After
a few observations from Messrs. <lb/>
Boyd and McClelan. Hon. G. L. Hathe- <lb break="maybe"/>
way said if the resolution was carried
out <lb/>
St. John would get the sixth of
the De<lb break="no"/>bates, as its population was a sixth of that <lb/>
of the entire Province. He agreed with<lb/>
the ex-Surveyor General that it
was out<lb break="no"/>side places—in such Counties as
Glouces<lb break="no"/>ter and Restigouche, where the people in <lb/>
the back settlements did not receive the <lb/>
newspapers—that the circulation
of the<lb/>
Debates was needed. He would much<lb/>
prefer that the arrangement for the dis<lb break="no"/>tribution of the Debates should remain as <lb/>
it was. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> spoke in favor of the <lb/>
resolution. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. CAIE said that the golden rule <lb/>
" to do unto others as we would be done <lb/>
by," should govern them in this
matter. <lb/>
He did not consider it fair play that Glou<lb break="no"/>cester or Restigouche should receive as <lb/>
great a portion as Kent, whose popula<lb break="no"/>tion was so much greater. He would ask <lb/>
if it was a question of supplying mate<lb break="no"/>rial wants, if it would be fair
play to give <lb/>
Restigouche as many barrels of
flour as <lb/>
Kent ? It was equally necessary to pro<lb break="no"/>vide food for the mind as the body, and <lb/>
the same rule should apply.  <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>MR.
MCMILLAN said the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber who had just spoken seemed deter<lb break="no"/>mined to stand up for Kent : yet if he <lb/>
was so determined to have fair play—as <lb/>
half of the population was French in that <lb/>
County—why did he not move that
the <lb/>
Debates be printed in French ?
He would <lb/>
move, as an amendment, that the distri<lb break="no"/>bution of the Debates be an equal num<lb break="no"/>ber to each member of the House. <lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
            <p> MR. WETMORE
contended that if<lb/>
many of the people in St. John did get<lb/>
information of the proceedings of the<lb/>
House from the newspapers, for those<lb/>
newspapers they had the supreme felicity<lb/>
of paying. The only fair and reasonable
<lb/>
way was distribution by population. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. CORAM
said that it was only the <lb/>
people of the city that got the advantage <lb/>
of the papers published in St. John ; <lb/>
there was a large number of people
<lb/>
throughout the County in the backwoods <lb/>
who did not see a paper. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> MR. KERR supported the amendment, <lb/>
and argued if St. John, with its popula<lb break="no"/>tion of between thirty and forty <lb/>
thousand people, could make good <lb/>
its claim to a distribution of Debate <lb/>
on that basis, they might, if the prin<lb break="no"/>ciple was allowed, seek to apply it <lb/>
also to the distribution of bye-road
<lb/>
money, which had not been dreamt
of yet. <lb/>
In St. John, papers were issued
daily <lb/>
ly, morning and evening—there
the great <lb/>
bulk of the people received
them, and <lb/>
read the synopsis of the Debates ; but in <lb/>
the country the people could not get them, <lb/>
and in many cases, if they
could, they <lb/>
were too poor to pay for them. He
<lb/>
thought that each member should
have <lb/>
equal rights with other members, and re<lb break="no"/>ceive an equal number. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> The amendment being put to the vote, <lb/>
was carried. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> On motion, the House was adjourned <lb/>
until to-morrow at 10 o'clock. <lb/>
            </p>

THE DEBATES. <lb/>
            </head>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said that the Commit<lb break="no"/>tee appointed at the last Session of the <lb/>
House, to make arrangements for publish<lb break="no"/>ing the Debates, had no power delegated <lb/>
to them to make arrangements for folding <lb/>
and addressing the Debates, but they had <lb/>
received an offer from Mr. Day, who <lb/>
would mail and address them for $5
for <lb/>
each member. It would be
attended with <lb/>
great delay to have them sent up here by <lb/>
the publisher, therefore he hoped the <lb/>
House would make some arrangements <lb/>
about having them addressed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">COL. BOYD</persName> said they had better adopt <lb/>
the same mode of having them addressed <lb/>
as they did last year ; bu: he would not <lb/>
agree to paying $5 for each member. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:SUTT1">MR. SUTTON</persName> said they were address<lb break="no"/>ed last year in St. John for $4 apiece. If<lb/>
they were sent to Fredericton they would<lb/>
be under their own supervision.<lb/>
            </p>
            <cb/>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">MR. CAIE</persName> said the amount to be paid <lb/>
the publisher should be a little more
than
<lb/>
it was last year, as there are 7,000 instead <lb/>
of 6,000 copies to be addressed ; but he
<lb/>
did not think they should all be addressed <lb/>
in St. John.<lb/>
            </p>


            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said that last Session<lb/>
part of them were addressed here and <lb/>
part in St. John. For some Counties <lb/>
there would be a great loss of time in <lb/>
having them come to Fredericton, al<lb break="no"/>though he thought the work could be
done <lb/>
better under their own supervision, or the <lb/>
work might be done under the Post Office
<lb/>
Department, as they would know best how <lb/>
to direct them to the Way Offices. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:CONN1">MR. CONNELL</persName> believed that the work <lb/>
could be done best under the Post Office
<lb/>
Department. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">COL. BOYD</persName> said, that in the good old <lb/>
times, thirty years ago, every member used <lb/>
to address his own debates, and he had <lb/>
kept to that old fashioned way
for a num<lb break="no"/>ber of years. He believed t cost £70 <lb/>
when they were addressed under the Post <lb/>
Office Department. He would like to <lb/>
have his Debates addressed in St.
John, <lb/>
as they would be delayed one or two days <lb/>
by coming up here. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:BEVE1">MR. BEVERIDGE</persName> observed that the <lb/>
arrangement of last year gave satisfaction
<lb/>
in his County, his Debates being address<lb break="no"/>ed here by a person in the employ of the<lb/>
House. <lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> said he could hardly <lb/>
credit that the addressing of the Debates, <lb/>
cost £70 If they had the privilege of <lb/>
having the head of the Post Office De<lb break="no"/>partment in the
House, they could get in<lb break="no"/>formation of what the labor would cost. <lb/>
Having the Debates addressed in
St. <lb/>
John is sometimes the cause of delay, for <lb/>
if you received a notice from any of your <lb/>
constituents that they do not receive the <lb/>
Debates, you have to write to the pub<lb break="no"/>lisher, and several days must elapse
be<lb break="no"/>fore it can be rectified ; but if they were <lb/>
addressed here it could be corrected at <lb/>
once. Half of the Debates have to come <lb/>
here, and the rest would be delayed but <lb/>
a day and night. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:ANGL1">MR. ANGLIN</persName>
said there was one ob<lb break="no"/>jection to this arrangement for
addressing <lb/>
the Debates in St. John which had been <lb/>
overlooked, that was, that they had no <lb/>
security that they should get the 7,000 <lb/>
copies for which they paid. They
had to <lb/>
depend upon the honor of the
person who <lb/>
published and addressed them. There <lb/>
should be something like a receipt of de<lb break="no"/>livery. In whatever way the arrange<lb break="no"/>ments may be made there will be
innume<lb break="no"/>rable complaints ; but in this
case there <lb/>
is no security against fraud. This House <lb/>
should, through some officer, obtain a de<lb break="no"/>livery of the whole, and then have them <lb/>
distributed ; by this means persons through <lb/>
the country would receive them
earlier <lb/>
and more regular. He did not value the <lb/>
Debates, so therefore cared little about <lb/>
it ; but the whole cost of
addressing them <lb/>
should not exceed £50 or £60. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:LIND1">MR. LINDSAY</persName> said, that Hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers who made out their lists,
would cer<lb break="no"/>tainly know whether they received the De<lb break="no"/>bates or not. In his district they received <lb/>
them pretty regular. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:WILM1">Mr. WILMOT</persName>
remarked,
that to ensure <lb/>
their being received, they should be ad<lb break="no"/>dressed by the Post Office Department, <lb/>
for if they were not properly
directed they <lb/>
would go to the wrong Post Office. <lb/>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:CORA1">MR. CORAM</persName>
observed that on the <lb/>

<!-- GL note, 2017-02-27, this is where the text begins, there was elipses added to it which I placed in square brackets, I assume this was an editorial decision by DH. -->

<p>
     [...] Mr. LINDSAY. The country re<lb break="no"/>quired information upon this subject.<lb/> 
            The people were crying out what was<lb/> 
            being done for the defence of whe coun<lb break="no"/>try ? and yet when a question was put<lb/>
            to the leader of the Government as to<lb/>
            what was doing, honorable members<lb/>
            could get no information. If the coun<lb break="no"/>try could not get information it<lb/>
            wanted the members had better go home<lb/>
            at once. They had heard a great deal<lb/>
            about the Fenians—he had read it in the<lb/>
            papers that these Fenians claimed affi<lb break="no"/>nity with the Anti-Confederates was<lb/>
            the country to be kept in a state of alarm<lb/>
            and suspense and unprepared to meet<lb/>
            any invasion because it was cursed<lb/>
            with an Anti-Confederate Government?<lb/>
            Away with such an idea! Some men<lb/>
            might pooh, pooh, and laugh at the<lb/>
            threats of these Fenians, but it was dif<lb break="no"/>ferent in the country—different with<lb/>
            the people, with families living on the<lb/>
            frontier—where they were open to the<lb/>
            attacks of cut-throat raiders and assas<lb break="no"/>sins. Members ask what proceedings<lb/>
            had been taken to repel invasion and<lb/>
            they were told they could not get infor<lb break="no"/>mation! He thought the country had<lb/>
            arrived at a crisis when the people<lb/>
            would be required  to show on what side<lb/>
            they were, and to rally for the defence<lb/>
            of their country, for the preservation of<lb/>
            British Institutions, for the protection<lb/>
            of these British colonies. As for him<lb break="no"/>self he was willing, when the time<lb/>
            arrived, to give his money, and his<lb/>
            means and himself if it wsa necessary.<lb/>
            
            </p>
<cb/>
            <p>
   <persName ref="pers:SMIT1">ATTORNEY GENERAL</persName> did not see<lb/>
   what occasion there was for the hon.<lb/>
   member of Carleton to work himself<lb/>
   into such a fury. What did he want?<lb/>
   Did he wish to get information of what<lb/>
   the Government were doing—which<lb/>
   would be copied into all the papers—<lb/>
   and be the means of directing attention<lb/>
   to what it was necessary to keep secret?<lb/>
   He would tell the hon. member that the<lb/>
   Government were taking proper pre<lb break="no"/>cautionary measures to meet any danger<lb/>
   that might be threatened. The insinua<lb break="no"/>tion that he (Mr. Lindsay) had made,<lb/>
   that there was a connection between<lb/>
   the Fenians and the Anti-Confederates<lb/>
   in this Province, was false and calum<lb break="no"/>nious. It was unworthy his palce as a<lb/>
   member of that House; it ws unwor<lb break="no"/>thy himself as a mean thus to traduce the<lb/>
   chracter of the Anti-Confederate party<lb/>
   by insinuating that they had a sympathy<lb/>
   with the designs of a band of marauders.<lb/>
   As for himself he had as much stake in<lb/>
   the country, as much pride in British<lb/>
   connection, as much desire to maintain<lb/>
   it, and he would sacrifice as much to<lb/>
   preserve it as the member of Carleton<lb/>
   himself. He would ask the House, he<lb/>
   would ask the country, if it ws not<lb/>
   entirely unworthy of his (Mr. L.'s)<lb/>
   place to make such an insinuation?<lb/>
   What object had he in making such an<lb/>
   attack upon the Government if it was<lb/>
   not for some party purpose in order to<lb/>
   damage them in the eyes of the coun<lb break="no"/>try? The hon. member of St. John<lb/>
   (Mr. Wilmot) had asked what was cer<lb break="no"/>tainly a proper question; but he ap<lb break="no"/>pealed to the hon. member of Carleton<lb/>
   himself, he appealed to the House, he<lb/>
   appealed to the country, if the Fenians<lb/>
   were preparing to make a raid upon our<lb/>
   borders, would it be prudent to direct<lb/>
   the attention to what we were doing—<lb/>
   would it be right to point to the very<lb/>
   spot where the Government were send<lb break="no"/>ing men? Did not he (Mr. L.) believe<lb/>
   when he (Attorney General) stated that<lb/>
   the Government were taking every pro<lb break="no"/>per step to repel invasion? He could<lb/>
   assure him, and he could assure the<lb/>
   country that energetic measures, and as<lb/>
   effective as the resources of the Province<lb/>
   would justify, were being taken by the<lb/>
   Government at this present time. 
 </p>
            <p>
    <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName> thought that the lan<lb break="no"/>guage of the Attorney General was quite<lb/>
    as emphatic as that of his colleague (Mr.<lb/>
    Lindsay). He (Mr. C) was not at all sa<lb break="no"/>tisfied with what the Attorney General<lb/>
    had said. The country demanded to<lb/>
    know what danger was threatening the<lb/>
    Province, and what preparation the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment was making to meet it. It was<lb/>
    but right that he (Mr. C.) should be fur<lb break="no"/>nished with information to send to the<lb/>
    people of the country—those who lived<lb/>
    alnog the upper St. John river. He be<lb break="no"/>lieved the time had come when the re<lb break="no"/>sources of the country should be placed<lb/>
    in the hands of an Administration in<lb/>
    whom the people had confidence. He<lb/>
    would put all the resources of the coun<lb break="no"/>try at their disposal, because he felt<lb/>
    that the danger was imminent. He<lb/>
    thought the Government had fallen very<lb/>
    far short of their duty in this matter.<lb/>
    Why had not preparations been made<lb/>
    months ago. Those who lived in the<lb/>
    city and town knew little chil<lb break="no"/>dren had come to him crying, and saying<lb/>
    "something should be done to protect<lb/>
    us." The Attorney General might laugh,<lb/>
          

            <pb n="8" facs="final/images/NB_LA_1866-03-09_Page_0008.jpg"/>
          
but those who lived on the borders <lb/>
would know that what he said was
<lb/>
true, he was not afraid that an
invasion <lb/>
would be made on the frontier by any <lb/>
very large number of these Fenians, but<lb/>
small parties of them might make a dash<lb/>
and rob and slaughter. This was a very<lb/>
serious matter, and he was not satisfied<lb/>
with what the Attorney General had said.<lb/>

            <!--<p>MONDAY, MARCH 12th.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> After the Minutes were read, the <lb/>
Rules of the House were suspended in <lb/>
order to allow Mr. L. P. W. Desbrisay<lb/>
to bring in a Bill to place certain<lb/>
roads in the County of Kent on the list<lb/>
of Great Roads in this Province.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> moved that — co<lb break="no"/>pies of a Bill to make better provision <lb/>
for the secrecy of the Ballot. &amp;c., be <lb/>
printed. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p> HON. MR. GILLMOR said every hon. <lb/>
member could have access to the Bill<lb/>
without going to the expense of printing<lb/>
it. They should not go on increasing<lb/>
their expenses when they could avoid it.<lb/>
            </p>

            <p> <persName ref="pers:GILB1">MR. GILBERT</persName> replied that the pro<lb break="no"/>per exercise of the franchise was of <lb/>
great importance to the welfare
of this <lb/>
Province ; that the printing would not <lb/>
cost much, as it was not a long Bill, <lb/>
but it was one that required go
be look<lb break="no"/>ed at frequently and attentively, in<lb/>
order that hon. members might become<lb/>
acquainted with its merits. race.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
MR. HILL said that every unnecessary<lb/>
expense should be avoided. The Bill<lb/>
would be upon the fyles of the House<lb/>
where it could be examined by
every<lb/>
hon. member ; and the clear and
lucid<lb/>
explanation, which would be given
by<lb/>
the hon. member who introduced it,<lb/>
would enable them to understand its<lb/>
merits. The House should not order<lb/>
any Bill to be printed unless it was <lb/>
absolutely necessary—unless it was a<lb/>
Bill of great importance and had many<lb/>
provisions which required to be
con<lb break="no"/>sidered section by section.</p>
            <p>This resolution was carried and one<lb/>
hundred copies ordered to be printed</p>
            <p>COL. BOYD, by leave, brought in "A<lb/>
Bill to incorporate the St. Andrew's<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/> 
 

            <p>Friendly Society" and a petition for the<lb/>
same.</p>
            <p>MR. OTTY brought in "A Bill to<lb/>
alter the Polling place in the Parish of<lb/>
Hampton," and a petition for the same.</p>
            <p>ADDRESS IN ANSWER TO HIS EXCELLEN-<lb break="maybe"/>
CY'S SPEECH.</p>
            <p>COL. BOYD moved the order of the<lb/>
day, viz :—The consideration of the<lb/>
"Address in answer to His Excellency's<lb/>
Speech," and said that he fully endorsed<lb/>
every word and paragraph in it, for it<lb/>
suited his views exactly. He could not<lb/>
see anything to amend in it. A vote of<lb/>
want of confidence was another matter ;<lb/>
and whether the hon. member who in<lb break="no"/>tends moving his Amendment will<lb/>
benefit the country by doing so, time<lb/>
alone will tell. For his part, he thought<lb/>
this Government, which they said they<lb/>
had no confidence in, had stood re<lb break="no"/>markably well, considering the opposi<lb break="no"/>tion it had met with.</p>
            <p>MR. FISHER would like the hon.<lb/>
member to give some exposition of the<lb/>
last paragraph but one, for he would<lb/>
like to understand what was the design<lb/>
of that paragraph.</p>

            <p>COL. BOYD said, he believed the Go<lb break="no"/>vernment meant by this paragraph :—<lb/>
"* * * but in any scheme for a<lb/>
Union of the British North American<lb/>
Colonies which may be proposed, it is,<lb/>
in the opinion of this House, absolutely<lb/>
essential that full protection should be<lb/>
afforded to the rights and interests of<lb/>
the people of this Province ; and no<lb/>
measure which fails to obtain these<lb/>
objects should be adopted." That they<lb/>
have no objection to go into union with<lb/>
the other Provinces, provided good and<lb/>
full protection is afforded to our rights<lb/>
and interests, but they did not intend<lb/>
to swallow Confederation as concocted<lb/>
in Canada. They knew how well they<lb/>
were off, but he was not going to say<lb/>
they could not do better. They were<lb/>
perfectly willing to go into Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion upon fair and equitable terms. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>HIS HONOR, THE SPEAKER, then<lb/>
read the Address by paragraph. Upon<lb/>
the reading of the 4th paragraph, which<lb/>
is as follows :—</p>
            <p>4. We learn with feelings of deep in<lb break="no"/>dignation the existence of a conspiracy,<lb/>
having for its avowed object the dismem<lb break="no"/>berment of the British Empire. We<lb/>
would hope that no attack will be made<lb/>
on any portion of Her Majesty's North<lb/>
American Dominions ; but in that event,<lb/>
we rejoice in being able to assure Your<lb/>
Excellency that but one sentiment of loy<lb break="no"/>alty animates the whole people of this<lb/>
Province ; and its inhabitants of every<lb/>
race, creed, and station, are alike ready to<lb/>
repel lawless aggression and to punish un<lb/>
provoked hostility ; and Your Excellency<lb/>
can confidently rely upon our cordial co<lb break="no"/>operation and support in the adoption of<lb/>
any measures of a precautionary charac<lb break="no"/>ter, that may be necessary to avert a cal-<lb break="maybe"/>
lamity so serious as that of the occurrence<lb/>
of an armed conflict within our borders.</p>
            <p>MR. FISHER moved the following<lb/>
Amendment, viz :—To strike out all that<lb/>
part of the said 4th paragraph from the<lb/>
words " and Your Excellency," &amp;c., to<lb/>
the end inclusive, and insert as follow :</p>
            <p>"And Your Excellency may rely with<lb/>
confidence upon our cordial co operation<lb/>
and support in the adoption of such<lb/>
measures as may be deemed necessary<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>for the protection of the country. But<lb/>
we respectfully state to Your Excellency<lb/>
that your constitutional advisers, by<lb/>
their general conduct, are not entitled<lb/>
to our confidence."</p>
            <p>In moving this Amendment, MR.<lb/>
FISHER said that some of his friends<lb/>
thought that the Amendment, of which<lb/>
he had given notice on Saturday, was a<lb/>
reflection upon the United States ; there<lb break="no"/>fore, he had altered it by striking out<lb/>
the last section. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">HON. MR. SMITH</persName> objected to any<lb/>
alteration being made to any Amend<lb break="no"/>ment of which previous notice had been<lb/>
given.</p>


            <p>MR. FISHER said, no power in the<lb/>
world could prevent him putting for<lb break="no"/>ward any proposition he pleased, if it<lb/>
was seconded. This Amendment con<lb break="no"/>tains all the elements of the other, but<lb/>
in order to meet any captious objec<lb break="no"/>tions, he had struck out a portion of<lb/>
it, although he intended to make that<lb/>
part of his argument. He was not<lb/>
bound to give notice at all, though<lb/>
courtesy required him to do it. He<lb/>
was there to express his opinion, and<lb/>
it was the peculiar beauty of their insti<lb break="no"/>tutions that they could discuss these<lb/>
questions ; and when they were over,<lb/>
whatever the result might be, it would<lb/>
not make them enemies to each other, for<lb/>
they were all there to advance the inter<lb break="no"/>ests of their common country. He com<lb break="no"/>plained of the Government that they had<lb/>
not called the House together sooner, for<lb/>
it was unfair to the representative of the<lb/>
people of this country, who will, after four<lb/>
or five weeks Session, require to go to<lb/>
their business occupations, especially<lb/>
those in different parts of the country.<lb/>
His friends in the Government knew it<lb/>
well. This was a deliberative body, and<lb/>
if the ordinary business of the country<lb/>
required sixty or seventy days to perform<lb/>
it, how can they get through the business<lb/>
of the Session in four or five weeks, when<lb/>
they have a new Confederation scheme<lb/>
foreshadowed in the Speech, with all the<lb/>
other great measures of that speech ?<lb/>
This was itself sufficient ground of<lb/>
complaint that they had no confidence in<lb/>
the Government. The newspapers said<lb/>
the absence of the Attorney General at<lb/>
Washington was the cause of the delay.<lb/>
In 1856 he was a member of the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, in which they were all new hands.<lb/>
He was in England at that time for two<lb/>
or three months, for the purpose of raising<lb/>
money for the construction of Railways ;<lb/>
but it never entered their heads, nor dare<lb/>
they protract the meeting of this Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture. They were called together on the <lb/>
14th day of February, only nine or <lb/>
days after he returned. In a few
days<lb/>
after the House opened they were met by <lb/>
a vote of want of confidence, but
they <lb/>
were sustained. He had then to
prepare <lb/>
four or five Railway Bills ; there was a <lb/>
precedent for this Government. If they <lb/>
were inspired with a desire to advance <lb/>
the interests of this country, they would
<lb/>
have called the Legislature to meet at the <lb/>
usual time. Why have they not done so ?
<lb/>
Because they knew the public
opinion of <lb/>
the country was against them, and they <lb/>
wished to get through with the
Session <lb/>
in as quiet a manner as possible. There <lb/>
was no time to do the business of this<lb/>
country in that deliberate
manner in  <lb/>
which it should be done. He would ask
<lb/>
the members from the rural districts <lb/>
could they leave their farms just
about <lb/>
seed time, and attend to the business of <lb/>
            </p>-->
