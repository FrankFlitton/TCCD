<!-- GL, 2018-02-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the preceding debate day --> 

           <!-- <p>
     Mr. Connel.—lf those steamers get              
     <lb/>
     aground coming to Fredericton, how are                
     <lb/>
     steamers to get to Woodstock ? It is but               
     <lb/>
    a small part of this money that is required          
     <lb/>at the mouth of the Tobique, perhaps not         
     <lb/>more than two or three hundred dollars.             
     <lb/>This is a small amount, but it will do a             
     <lb/>vast amount of good. I shall perform                 
     <lb/>my duty and move this resolution, for I do               
     <lb/>not think it is fair for all the money to be                 
     <lb/>expended below Fredericton.            
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. Kerr</persName>.—The people of Carleton             
     <lb/>have had a large amount of money ex<lb break="no"/>pended for their benefit in the St. An<lb break="no"/>drews and Woodstock Railway, so they                
     <lb/>need not complain if their steamers are           
     <lb/>not subsidized, or their navigation im<lb break="no"/>proved. The people of the North Shore<lb/>contribute $30,000 a year to the railway<lb/>from imports, and derive no direct bene<lb break="no"/>fit from the road. The Government<lb/>should take the cost of one and a half<lb/>miles of railroad, and invest the amount<lb/>in the purchase of a steamer, and place it<lb/>under the management of the railway com<lb break="no"/>missioner, or let the Board of Works be<lb/>the head of that branch of the public ser<lb break="no"/>vice, and let the steamboat be in connec<lb break="no"/>tion with the railroad, in order when any<lb break="no"/>thing is put upon either end of the line<lb/>somebody may be responsible for it ; for<lb break="no"/>merly when anything was put on board<lb/>the steamboat to go to St. John and was<lb/>lost, nobody was to blame. They would<lb/>tell you on board the steamboat that the<lb/>railway was to blame, and vice versa. I<lb/>think we have a fair claim upon the Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, having paid $30,000 a year for<lb/>imports alone, for a reasonable amount to<lb/>provide a steamer for the North Shore.<lb/>I think a steamer would in time become<lb/>self-sustaining, from the fact that the<lb/>"Lady Head" receives no subsidy for run<lb break="no"/>ning between Quebec and Shediac, but it<lb/>does not stop at any other port in the Pro<lb break="no"/>vince except Miramichi. I think the sub<lb break="no"/>sidy should be offered for a number of<lb/>years to induce parties to put a steamer<lb/>there.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. McClellan</persName> called the attention of<lb/>the House to the fact that Sackville and<lb/>other villages on the Bay of Fundy, which<lb/>had contributed to the building of the<lb/>Railway, had in consequence of its con<lb break="no"/>struction been deprived of the steamboat<lb/>communication which they used to have.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>A resolution was then passed granting<lb/>$1,600 to the Madras School ; $2,400 to<lb/>the Wesleyan Academy ; $1,000 to the<lb/>Batist Seminary ; $600 to the Roman<lb/>Catholic School at Fredericton ; $600 to<lb/>the Milltown Academy ; $150 to the<lb/>Presbyterian School at St. Stephen ; $600<lb/>to the Roman Catholic School at Saint<lb/>John ; $400 to the Varley School.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. Connell</persName> advocated the claims of a<lb/>Roman Catholic School at Woodstock,<lb/>showing how it had increased in efficiency,<lb/>but the annual grant had been decreased<lb/>from £92 10s. to $150.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Landey also advocated the claims<lb/>of a School of the same denomination in<lb/>Westmorland.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Lindsay would like to do away<lb/>with sectarian schools altogether, because<lb/>the grants to those Schools are not equal<lb break="no"/>ly distributed.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Several resolutions passed, the Com<lb break="no"/>mittee granting $200 to the Fisheries ;<lb/>$1200 for the maintenance of the Lunatic<lb/>Asylum ; $4,540 Public Health ; $400 <lb/>Pensions ; $1,000 for the relief of dis<lb break="no"/>tressed Indians ; $200 for a Missionary<lb/>for them. $30,000 was then proposed for<lb/>the Military and Militia.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Col. Boyd thought $30,000 was not<lb/>enough for this purpose. Nova Scota<lb/>had set us an example by giving $81,000,<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    

    
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
     and we should at least give $50,000. He 
     <lb/>then quoted from an English paper, shew<lb break="no"/>ing that the limits of British liberality had<lb/>been reached, and we must do something<lb/>for ourselves, if we wished them to help<lb/>us. He then stated that we should show<lb/>the largest amount of liberality, and<lb/>though we had to retrench in other ways,<lb/>we chould give a large amount for this<lb/>purpose to show out liberality, and if it is<lb/>not required it could lie in the treasury,<lb/>and need not be drawn. When the Mili<lb break="no"/>tia Bill comes up we will see how it will<lb/>be expended. If the money was to be ex<lb break="no"/>pended only for the purpose of making a<lb/>display, he would vote against it.<lb/> <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. McClellan</persName> thought they should<lb/>report progress, as it was a very large<lb/>amount compared with former years,<lb/>which they were required to appropriate<lb/>for this purpose ; he did not say it was too<lb/>large because he did not know the object,<lb/>or to what purpose this money was to be<lb/>applied.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. Connell</persName> said, the Militia Bill<lb/>ought to be brought in first, so that they<lb/>could know for what purpose they were<lb/>granting this money, and he would ask<lb/>why it was kept back?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. Smith</persName> said the proper me<lb break="no"/>thod was to pass the appropriation first,<lb/>and take up the Bill afterwards.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:ANGL1">Hon. Mr. Anglin</persName> said it was only a<lb/>question whether they should expend $30,-<lb break="maybe"/>000 for that purpose or not. The Bill was<lb/>not kept back from any desire to conceal<lb/>anything, but because it was found impos<lb break="no"/>sible to have it ready at the moment ; it<lb/>has been in the hands o the Attorney<lb/>General, who had been to work at it, and<lb/>had received the proof sheets yesterday.<lb/>They could make any number of altera<lb break="no"/>tions in the Bill after passing the appro<lb break="no"/>priation for that purpose. The hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber from Charlotte thought the amount<lb/>to small. He (Mr. Anglin) thought it<lb/>was a larger sum than they could afford,<lb/>if they could otherwise help themselves ;<lb/>he would rather have seen the amount ex<lb break="no"/>pended on the Bye Roads. To say they<lb/>should wait for the Militia Bill, was to<lb/>talk entirely beside the question, which<lb/>was simply to appropriate the sum named<lb/>for this purpose or not.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Lindsay said they ought to wait<lb/>until they had the Bill before them, and<lb/>then they could judge how much they<lb/>should expend upon it. If the country<lb/>should require all the available resources<lb/>of the Province, he would be prepared to<lb/>vote for them to be granted that pur<lb break="no"/>pose, but they should know how the money<lb/>was to be spent, whether it was to<lb/>strengthen the defenses of the country or<lb/>not. He did not believe in training and<lb/>drilling men at the expense of the coun<lb break="no"/>try, and then allow them to go to the Uni<lb break="no"/>ted States—merely for the sake of show<lb break="no"/>ing their loyalty to the British Crown.<lb/>He was fully convinced that it was use<lb break="no"/>less fot his purpose, unless these North<lb/>American Colonies were united, and he<lb/>believed " Mr. Cardwell " would fully<lb/>endorse that sentiment. There were mem<lb break="no"/>bers here who last Session objected to<lb/>spending $10,000, and now would vote<lb/>for $30,000. It would be better to give<lb/>half that amount to induce people to set<lb break="no"/>tle in the country, than to provide for<lb/>imaginary dangers ; but if they really re<lb break="no"/>quired all the resources of the country for<lb/>the purpose of defence, he was prepared<lb/>not only to give them but to go and<lb/>serve his country himself. He did not<lb/>say he was going to oppose this grant, but<lb/>he should like to know whether it was go<lb break="no"/>ing to increase the defences of the coun<lb break="no"/>try.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Progress was reported on this resolu<lb break="no"/>tion, and discussion to be resumed at half-<lb break="yes"/>past 2 p. m. to-morrow.<lb/>T. P. D.<lb/>

            <p>Some conversation ensued on the<lb/>propriety of allowing the Commission<lb break="no"/>ers to assess certain parties to carry on<lb/>the work, and on the appointment of the<lb/>Commissioners by Government rather<lb/>than by parties interested in the adjoin<lb break="no"/>ing marshes ; after which the Bill passed<lb/>by striking out the fourth section. <lb/>

     <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> 

     <fw type="num">67</fw> 
  

     drawn up I have received a Petition 
     <lb/>
    drawn up and signed by the principal 
     <lb/>Stockholders. praying that they may be 
     <lb/>allowed to close up their affairs. After 
     <lb/>more than thirty- five years' operation 
     <lb/>there is but some £1300 or £1400 now  
     <lb/>afloat. and it is probable that the greater 
     <lb/>part of this has been destroyed or lost. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:KERR1">Mr. KERR</persName>. — I think if we pass this 
     <lb/>
     Bill we shall be laying down a principle 
     <lb/>
     that is dangerous. It asks that the 
     <lb/>
     Stockholders shall be released from pay<lb break="no"/>ment of such notes as may yet be afloat. 
     <lb/>
     We cannot say how much of the £1300 
     <lb/>
     may yet be in the hands of the people 
     <lb/>
     and notes are held to be good till demand 
     <lb/>
     is made for their payment. The Stock<lb break="no"/>holders can, if they have paid off all 
     <lb/>
     their known existing notes. lay aside a 
     <lb/>
     small amount of the stock to bear inter<lb break="no"/>est, against any notes that ma yet come 
     <lb/>in ; but to debar any one who holds notes 
     <lb/>from receiving payment for them would 
     <lb/>be establishing a dangerous principle. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CUDL1">Mr. CUDLIP</persName> —I believe there was in 
     <lb/>
     the Charter of this Bank a| provision pro<lb break="no"/>viding that on a vote of the Stockholders 
     <lb/>
     the Bank might close up their affairs. I 
     <lb/>
     am anxious that all the note- holders 
     <lb/>
     should be secured, but there should be 
     <lb/>
     some limitation to the time when notes 
     <lb/>
     may be received and payment demand<lb break="no"/>ed. I think the whole ground may be 
     <lb/>
     covered, and the gentlemen interested 
     <lb/>
     be allowed to wind up their affairs. In 
     <lb/>
     England, if notes are lost and prove to

     be so, a sum is vested in the three per 
     <lb/>
     cent consuls, in case they might turn up 
     <lb/>
     within a certain time. If a provision of 
     <lb/>
     this kind were introduced, say by invest<lb break="no"/>ing the sum still our, £1300 or £1400, 
     <lb/>to bear interest, and give notice that 
     <lb/>within three years all notes unclaimed 
     <lb/>must be handed in for payment, or the 
     <lb/>Stockholders will not be responsible, 
     <lb/>the object would be gained and they 
     <lb/>could wind up their affairs.

     <persName ref="pers:BOYD1">Mr. BOYD</persName>. —The fact is, the Bank has 
     <lb/>
     no money to invest; they have only a 
     <lb/>
     little real estate. They gave e notice two 
     <lb/>
     years ago that they would pay all notes 
     <lb/>
     that were handed in. At first they re<lb break="no"/>ceived a large amount some bringing 
     <lb/>
     as much as $1000, but now they do not 
     <lb/>
    take into the office more than £3 a 
     <lb/>month. I do not think they own more 
     <lb/>than £60 worth of property. It is im<lb break="no"/>possible that after thirty -five years any 
     <lb/>of the money now out should come in. 
     <lb/>I am willing to allow some plan to be 
     <lb/>introduced so that they can wind up in 
     <lb/>a year or so, but I do not think it should 
     <lb/>go longer than that time.

     to any one by allowing this Bill to pass. 
     <lb/>
     The Bank has been in operation nearly 
     <lb/>
    forty years, and there must have been a 
     <lb/>per centage of loss every year. Then 
     <lb/>when we consider the perishable nature 
     <lb/>of paper money, the quality of notes 
     <lb/>that are destroyed by fires from time to 
     <lb/>time, and the many other ways in which 
     <lb/>notes may be destroyed. I think we may<lb/> 
               <lb/>come to the conclusion that there is lit<lb break="no"/>tle if any of them now afloat. In four 
     <lb/>years of business I have not seen a Char<lb break="no"/>lotte County Bank note. The Bank has

     RESOLUTION RELATING T0 THE MILITIA. 
     <lb/>
            </head>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName> —This is a matter of the 
     <lb/>
     highest importance to the interests of this 
     <lb/>
     Province. I have not brought forward 
     <lb/>
     this resolution for the purpose of making 
     <lb/>
     a speech, or of hearing the sound of my 
     <lb/>
     own voice or that I expect the result to 
     <lb/>
     has any influence on my position in this 
     <lb/>
     House or before the country. But I in<lb break="no"/>troduce it that it may go abroad. and that 
     <lb/>
     the Mother country may know what our 
     <lb/>
    position and feelings are on this great 
     <lb/>subject. If the granting of a small sum 
     <lb/>of money for Militia purposes, to be wasted 
     <lb/>in impracticable experiments, is to be the 
     <lb/>extent of the proof of our loyalty, I think 
     <lb/>the sooner we cease to boast of it the bet<lb break="no"/>ter. The portion of that country where I 
     <lb/>reside, and which I represent, would be 
     <lb/>the first to feel the effect of any troubles 
     <lb/>which might arise with the United States. 
     <lb/>Not long since I was present at a review 
     <lb/>of the Volunteers, at which the Com<lb break="no"/>mander-in-Chief of this Province, after 
     <lb/>praising the men for the efficiency shown 
     <lb/>in the use of their arms and in general 
     <lb/>drill, warned them that they would be the 
     <lb/>first that would be called on in case of 
     <lb/>difficulty to defend their homes. It is 
     <lb/>because of this fact that I feel a deep in<lb break="no"/>terest in this matter. In twenty- four 
     <lb/>hours after war broke out, that whole 
     <lb/>section of country would be a scene of 
     <lb/>devastation, and what power have we to 
     <lb/>prevent it. It has been remarked to me 
     <lb/>by hon members, since I gave notice of 
     <lb/>this motion, that it looks like dictating to 
     <lb/>the British Government what they should 
     <lb/>do. It does not do so, but I think it right 
     <lb/>they should know our position, what we 
     <lb/>intend to do, and what we expect of them. 
     <lb/>In looking to the mesage laid before this 
     <lb/>House on the state of the Militia in New 
     <lb/>Brunswick. I, and in a dispatch received 
     <lb/>from Mr. Cardwell, dated 1st Oct., 1864, 
     <lb/>the statement "that the progress of the 
     <lb/>Militia in New Brunswick does not at 
     <lb/>present in any degree correspond with the 
     <lb/>spirit of patriotism and spirit of loyalty 
     <lb/>by which the inhabitants are known to be 
     <lb/>animated, " and again, "the Militia ex<lb break="no"/>ists chiefly on paper, being undrilled, and 
     <lb/>
      

    
            <cb/>
         

     meeting for muster (only) one day in a 
     <lb/>
     year, whilst the Volunteers, who form 
     <lb/>
     an integral part of the Militia though 
     <lb/>
     they drill more frequently, number only 
     <lb/>
     1,738." And he closes by saying: " I 
     <lb/>
     should sincerely rejoice to hear from you 
     <lb/>
     that, on the re- assembling of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture, your advisers will be prepared to take 
     <lb/>
     effective measures for remedying a state 
     <lb/>
     of things, so little suited to the importance 
     <lb/>
     of the subject. and corresponding so little 
     <lb/>
     with the well known spirit of the Prov<lb break="no"/>ince. " Are we to be told that the British 
     <lb/>
     Government is not urging us to do some<lb break="no"/>thing in this branch of the public service? 
     <lb/>
     Of what advantage will be the small 
     <lb/>
     amount we grant in case we are attacked; 
     <lb/>
     could it enable us to defend ourselves, 
     <lb/>
     and what use would be our present Mili<lb break="no"/>tia organization in such a case? Might 
     <lb/>
     we not just as well lie down and submit 
     <lb/>
     at once? It is certain we are not in a 
     <lb/>
     position to make the first attempt at resist<lb break="no"/>ance. We need only refer to the report 
     <lb/>
     of Colonel Jervoia to see in what position 
     <lb/>
     we stand. What does he say? He in<lb break="no"/>forms the British Government that it 
     <lb/>
     would be utterly useless to go to the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of erecting fortifications on the 
     <lb/>
     Canada boundary, for their defence, far 
     <lb/>
     West of Montreal. If this be true of 
     <lb/>
     Canada. how does it apply here? We are 
     <lb/>
     perfectly open and defenceless;  we have 
     <lb/>
     no fortifications, and what is worse, we 
     <lb/>
     have no money to give any effectual aid 
     <lb/>to the British Government in erecting<lb/>
    them. And then as to the troops: we are 
     <lb/>told distinctly, that in case of war all the 
     <lb/>available forces the Government could 
     <lb/>spare would be put on board war vessels 
     <lb/>and sent to the cities on the seaboard of 
     <lb/>the neighbouring States. From this it is 
     <lb/>evident that we are to be left in a large 
     <lb/>measure to ourselves . His Excellency, in 
     <lb/>a despatch on page 41 of the Journals, 
     <lb/>dated 21st Nov., 1864, says : " I regret to 
     <lb/>perceive that Her Majesty' s Government 
     <lb/>are dissatisfied with the progress which 
     <lb/>has ben made towards the re-organiza<lb break="no"/>tion of the Provincial Militia." In speak<lb break="no"/>ing of the efficiency of Officers, he says: 
     <lb/>" The Head Quarters Staff was in a by 
     <lb/>no means efficient state; the officers upon 
     <lb/>it have long held their posts, and being 
     <lb/>but imperfectly acquainted with modern 
     <lb/>systems of drill and organization. " In 
     <lb/>the same dispatch he goes on further to 
     <lb/>say that " since the passage of that Act, 
     <lb/>I can truly say that my attention to the 
     <lb/>condition of the Militia. and my endeavors 
     <lb/>to carry out its re-organization to the 
     <lb/>furthest extent which the means at my 
     <lb/>disposal permitted, have been unremit<lb break="no"/>ting." I acquiesce in that, for it is a fact ; 
     <lb/>but His Excellency goes on further to say 
     <lb/>on page 44 : " I perceive that you labor 
     <lb/>under a mistaken impression, in supposing 
     <lb/>that the sum annually allotted d to the 
     <lb/>Militia is fixed in the Militia Law. It is 
     <lb/>annually voted by the Legislature, and 
     <lb/>may be indefinitely diminished or increas<lb break="no"/>ed. The grant is always opposed, and 
     <lb/>opposed with energy. *  *  *   It is my 
     <lb/>intention to propose to my advisers before 
     <lb/>the next meeting of the Provincial Par<lb break="no"/>liament a scheme, the details of which I 
     <lb/>hope shortly to lay before you, and which 
     <lb/>will have for its object the training of a 
     <lb/>certain portion of the Militia for several 
     <lb/>consecutive days in each year." From 
     <lb/>this it would seem that the Commander- 
     <lb break="yes"/>in-Chief evinces a greater interest in the 
     <lb/>matter of defence than either his advisers 
     <lb/>or the people. I do not think, however, 
     <lb/>that the people are so much to blame. I 
     <lb/>believe that seven-eighths of them want 
     <lb/>to know what the British Government in<lb break="no"/>tend to do; to know if it is their intention 
     <lb/>

     to go on and erect foritications in this 
     <lb/>Province. The Government of Canada<lb/>have, I think, acted wisely; they have<lb/>sent home delegates to see Her Majesty's <lb/>advisers face to face, and there tell them<lb/>what they are prepared to do if England<lb/>will aid the. The people of Canada<lb/>have granted a million of dollars to milli<lb break="no"/>tary purposes, to be used, in case an ar<lb break="no"/>rangement can be made with the British<lb/>Government on fair and equal principles.<lb/>What is our Government doing? They<lb/>propose a grant of $30,000 to show their<lb/>loyalty. I believe if the British Govern<lb break="no"/>ment saw it was for the interests of the <lb/>people of this Province, they would guar<lb break="no"/>antee the loan to carry on the fortifica<lb break="no"/>tions and other necessary works. They<lb/>know there is no danger of our coming in<lb break="no"/>to contact with the United States by our<lb/>own actions. What was the case in the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Trent</hi> affair? <lb/>Who were looked upon as <lb/>responsible for the depredations of the <lb/><hi rendition="simple:italic">Alabama</hi>? What were the feellings of the <lb/>North towards England on account of her<lb/>early recognition of the South as belliger<lb break="no"/>ents? These were all Imperial interests, <lb/>and out of difficulties like these war often <lb/>comes. If, then, to defend these interests, <lb/>it is found necessary to have fortifi<lb break="no"/>cations erected in our Province, is it not<lb/>reasonable that they should guarantee the<lb/>funds for carrying on the work? I are<lb/>not at issue with this Government on the<lb/>appropriation of $30,000 for Militia pur<lb break="no"/>poses ; but I do believe that sum could<lb/>be best employed in bringing the Staff,<lb/>the Militia officers, into an efficient state,<lb/>all over the Province for a day or three<lb/>days in a year, with no beneficial result.<lb/>Look at the case in the States. When<lb/>the war broke out had they any effective<lb/>organization out of which to make their <lb/>armies? they had not at least in Maine,<lb/>and where were men ever found who<lb/>more nobly distinguished themselves ? If<lb/>this amount is to be spent under the sys<lb break="no"/>tem heretofore puraued, I think we might<lb/>as well throw the money into the river.<lb/>When we look back on the war in the<lb/>United States, which is just now subsid<lb break="no"/>ing, when we remember that one month<lb/>before the firing of the first gun at<lb/>Fort Sumpter, all was peace and quiet ;<lb/>who did, who could have imagined,<lb/>what scenes of devastation and woe,<lb/>what rivers of blood, what widows<lb/>and orphans would so soon be developed<lb/>and brought about, as have been since<lb/>then. And what might be the case here?<lb/>In arriving at an opinion it may be well<lb/>to consider the position of affairs on this<lb/>continent and by the ideas of others ar<lb break="no"/>rive at conclusions with respect to our<lb break="no"/>selves. The London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Morning Advertiser</hi><lb/>of April 21st, contains the following:—<lb/>" On receipt of the news of the fall of<lb/>Richmond, Louis Mapoleon proposed to<lb/>Lord Cowley that England and France<lb/>should, by a treaty offensive and defen<lb break="no"/>sive, make common cause against the<lb/>United States of America ; that in the<lb/>event of Canada being attacked by them,<lb/>France should assist England with all her<lb/>land and sea forces ; and that in the event<lb/>of the United States openly or covertly<lb/>attacking the Emperor Maximilian or in<lb/>anywise endangering his throne, England<lb/>should, in conjunction with France, de<lb break="no"/>fend Maximilian." There are rumours<lb/>too of expeditions to Mexico, and that the<lb/>Mexican President Juarex is acting offen<lb break="no"/>sive agains France. We are told that<lb/>" President Juarez of the Mexican Re<lb break="no"/>public, has issued letters of marque for<lb/>reprisals against French commerce." Now<lb/>what will be the natural result of this ?<lb/>
       
<cb/>

Is it not collision with France? And then<lb/>from Boston we learn that, "The Mexi<lb break="no"/>can emigration excitement increases ; the<lb/>officers fro the enrolment are unable to<lb/>accommodate applicants ; two more offices<lb/>are to be opened. It is said that the <lb/>West has subscribed large sums of money<lb/>for the enterprise ; 26,000 men are to be<lb/>raised there." And again, the next day<lb/>we are told that in New York, " A recruit<lb break="no"/>ing office was opened for Mexican sol<lb break="no"/>diers ; there was quite a rush to the office<lb/>all day, and the large number of 4555 men<lb/>were recruited." The excitement on this<lb/>subject has even shown itself in the Capi<lb break="no"/>tal, for we hear that, "A Mexican emi<lb break="no"/>gration expedition has just been organized<lb/>in Washington. A general eagerness to <lb/>join it is manifested. A liberal bounty in <lb/>gold is offered to able bodied emi<lb break="no"/>grants." Now, when we hear of these<lb/>kind of things going on, we may very<lb/>naturally look for results that will affect<lb/>us sooner or later.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName>.—Is it not desirable<lb/>then that we should be in a state of de<lb break="no"/>fence ?<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.—Exactly so, and if the<lb/>Government had brought down a resolu<lb break="no"/>tion that would have proved for the good<lb/>of the country, I should have given them<lb/>my support, and will now, if they do as<lb/>they have done in Canada. This is not a<lb/>matter of pounds, abillinga and pence, but<lb/>one of the greatest importance that comes<lb/>before this House. I think if the Govern<lb break="no"/>ment were to enter into communication<lb/>with the British Government, and show<lb/>them our willingness to do all we can for<lb/>ourselves, and that in the matter of de<lb break="no"/>fence we desired to meet their just wishes<lb/>it would result in good. This is what I<lb/>desire, and if followed out would show<lb/>that we have some gratitude for the bless<lb break="no"/>ings conferred on us in the past, not by <lb/>words only, or bare expressions of loyal<lb break="no"/>ty, but by such action as coming from the<lb/>highest authority of the Province, will<lb/>carry wright with it. But instead of this,<lb/>what is proposed to be done? I see by<lb/>a report in the Journals of information<lb/>forwarded to the Colonial Secretary, res<lb break="no"/>pecting our future action, it is proposed to<lb/>establish a camp of Instruction, where men<lb/>who have been drafted from the different<lb/>parts of the Province, are to be drilled for <lb/>twenty-eight days in each year ; and that<lb/>a resolution has been agreed to by the<lb/>Military commission to call out the bal<lb break="no"/>ance of the Militia force of the Province<lb/>for three day's drill, and one day inspection<lb/>in each year, and to embrace all the male<lb/>inhabitants between the ages of 16 and<lb/>60. Of course, in view of the present<lb/>emigration to Mexico, this plan will be<lb/>very acceptable. Our young men who<lb/>volunteer to come forward and get this<lb/>instruction, will be the ones most likely to<lb/>go off and be accepted to join the Mexi<lb break="no"/>can expedition. But I should like to see<lb/>where the people have mede a move in<lb/>this matter. The only ones I ace, who<lb/>show any activity, are the officers who are<lb/>to get pay for these twenty-eight days<lb/>drill. I am not a military man, I never<lb/>have been, but if anything is to be done <lb/>in this matter I am willing to contrbute<lb/>my quota forwards furthering its interest ; <lb/>but this mode of spending money to fit<lb/>men to join the Mecican expedition is<lb/>what I don't agree with. In Canada,<lb/>where they have a Military School, a great<lb/>complaint has been that some of the offi<lb break="no"/>cers when frilled went off to the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can war, and what reason have we to <lb/>suppose that the same will not be the case <lb/>here. Yet, notwithstanding all the ru<lb break="no"/>mours that are afloat, I have not much<lb/>

The <lb/>people of England are interested in this<lb/>matter ; the strong feeling there is that<lb/>these Colonies should bear the expence<lb/>of erecting the fortifloatious for defence.<lb/>There are some of all shades of politics<lb/>who think we are a burden to them.<lb/>When we read of a member of the House<lb/>of Commons rising in his place and say<lb break="no"/>ing that no ministry could stand who<lb/>would make a grant for Military purposes<lb/>in these Colonies ; and that the Colonial <lb/>Secretary stands up and affirms it ; I say<lb/>when we see this, we must be convinced<lb/>that the feeling of dissatisfaction in Eng<lb break="no"/>land is gaining ground with regard to<lb/>these Provinces.

            <p>"The grant of 50,000 for the defence<lb/>of Quebec is the opening of a question<lb/>as various in its incidents and doubtful<lb/>in its issues as if the armies had already<lb/>appreared before that fortress, shots had<lb/>been exchanged, and new positions<lb/>taken. It already transpires that we<lb/>are expected to do a great deal more,<lb/>and that what the Canadians do them<lb break="no"/>selves, as their side of the bargain, if a<lb/>bargain there be, is to be done with<lb/>money borrowed on the credit of the<lb/>Empire—that is of the British Treasury<lb/>—as being for Imperial purposes. As<lb/>even the interest of this loan would have<lb/>to be paid by fresh duties upon imports,<lb/>chiefly from this country, it would<lb/>amount to our paying, in one shape<lb/>or another, every sixpence of the cost.<lb/>From speeches in the Canadian Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture it appears to be thought entirely our <lb/>affair, in so much that it is England, her <lb/>extravagant pretensions, her infatuated<lb/>pride, and her quarrelsome temper, that<lb/>have produced the apprehension of an<lb/>American invasion. The Canadian mean<lb break="no"/>while are most creditably beforehand with <lb/>us in a just anxiety to know how we are<lb/>to stand, who is to do it all, who is to<lb/>pay, and how the defences is to be con<lb break="no"/>ducted A deputation of the most dis<lb break="no"/>tinguished men in the Province is on its<lb/>way to this country, and we can only re<lb break="no"/>gret the deputation does not represent<lb/>all out Provinces, or even one of those<lb/>accessible at all seasons to our fleets and<lb/>armies.

     from Halifax to Quebec. The deputation, 
     <lb/>
    however, is purely Canadian. and it has 
     <lb/>come to obtain guarantees of political and 
     <lb/>commercial value. We cannot think the 
     <lb/>era of its arrival is so improper a tim to 
     <lb/>re-open the question as far as the ques<lb break="no"/>tion is still open, and to warn those whom 
     <lb/>it may concern against rash concessions 
     <lb/>and precipitate pledges. Wa hail, then the 
     <lb/>opportunity which now offers for asking 
     <lb/>some light on these questions. The de<lb break="no"/>putation asks for light, and will be ready 
     <lb/>to give some in return.
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     " In the first place, what is that we are 
     <lb/>
     to defend—a soil or a people? All the 
     <lb/>
     sentiment of the question goes for the 
     <lb/>
     people. In these days territorial pride is 
     <lb/>
     renounced, and people are cared for. Our 
     <lb/>
     Imperial relations are with the inhabi<lb break="no"/>tants. But by far the greater part of the 
     <lb/>
     Colonists themselves are far away from 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, utterly out of our reach. and ab<lb break="no"/>solutely dependent on themselves for in<lb break="no"/>dependence. Mr. Laird, of course, would 
     <lb/>
     be glad to receive an order to build 
     <lb/>
     twenty gunboats. and place them on any 
     <lb/>
     lake we pleased to mention—Victoria 
     <lb/>
     Nyznsa if required—and no doubt he 
     <lb/>
     would fulfill the order, barring the inter<lb break="no"/>ference of Governments or the contingen<lb break="no"/>cies of war. But colonial audacity itself 
     <lb/>
     does not venture thus far to invite our 
     <lb/>
     engineers higher up than Quebec, and th'l 
     <lb/>
     merest glance at the great lakes is enough 
     <lb/>
     to show that we cannot go there. So by 
     <lb/>
     far the greater part of the people are out 
     <lb/>
     of the reach of our defences and could 
     <lb/>
     hardly obtain the least benefit from them. 
     <lb/>
     But it is even a more serious considera<lb break="no"/>tion that another large portion of the 
     <lb/>
     (Colonists does not ask for our assistance, 
     <lb/>
     or show any anxiety about the matter. 
     <lb/>
     The Maritime Provinces, in declining to 
     <lb/>
     join the Confederation, thereby indicate, 
     <lb/>
     what had been fully anticipated, that they 
     <lb/>
     will not commit themselves to any plan of 
     <lb/>
     defence or any policy whatever. They 
     <lb/>
     will not entangle themselves before their 
     <lb/>
     time in either Colonial or Imperial quar<lb break="no"/>rels. Commercially they have much more 
     <lb/>
     to do with the States than with their own 
     <lb/>
     fellow-Colonists, and they would rather be 
     <lb/>
     friends with both, if it be possible. Here, 
     <lb/>
     then, is our case as regards the people. 
     <lb/>
     Those whom we could defend do not want 
     <lb/>
     our defence; and the greater part of the 
     <lb/>
     rest are utterly out of our reach. England 
     <lb/>
     is asked, in the first instance to strengthen 
     <lb/>
     Quebec, chiefly by works on the opposite 
     <lb/>
     point, which happens to command it. We 
     <lb/>
     have said above how little way that will 
     <lb/>go. Perhaps, the deputation will be able<lb/>to say more in favor of this outlay; but<lb/>with their own shore of the river above<lb/>Montreal, and with half lake Ontario,<lb/>we cannot see why an obstruction at<lb/>Quebec should be so serious an incon<lb break="no"/>venience to the Americans.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"If, however, it be not the soil, or a<lb/>fortress , or a river, that is to be defend<lb break="no"/>ed, but a people, then, whether we can<lb/>reach them or not, and whether they<lb/>choose to be defended or not, we really<lb/>do not see why they should not defend<lb/>themselves on their own frontier and their<lb/>own soil. By all ordinary estimates<lb/>they ought to be able to tun out <lb/>400,000 armed men, which would proba<lb break="no"/>bly ge as great a force as the Americans<lb/>could bring against them for some time<lb/>to come. Of course we suppose them to<lb/>be in earnest. The Canadians have only<lb/>to let it be known that they are really in<lb/>earnest, and we are disposed to hope they<lb/>will have no occasion for our aid. As to<lb/>the plan and manner of that aid there<lb/>cannot be two opinions. Whatever earth<lb break="no"/>works we make at Quebec we shall be<lb/>
   

            <cb/>
     

     cut off from that place for many months     
     <lb/>
     of the year. Even the Railway recom<lb break="no"/>ended by General Peel is too near the      
     <lb/>
     States to he depended on. All that we     
     <lb/>
     can do in the event of war is against the    
     <lb/>
     ports on the shipping of the foe. It is a 
     <lb/>
     weary work, we know, and England is the     
     <lb/>
     very last nation in the world to hint at   
     <lb/>
     such horrors before their time; but we    
     <lb/>
     are obliged to mention it, for it is all we     
     <lb/>
     can do. Soldiers of course we should    
     <lb/>
     require, for we could not attempt the de<lb break="no"/>struction of an American dockyard or ar<lb break="no"/>senal without having a large force ready 
     <lb/>to land if necessary; and the twenty or 
     <lb/>thirty thousand we could keep on hand 
     <lb/>for such purposes would be much better 
     <lb/>employed on that kind of service than 
     <lb/>five hundred miles up the St. Lawrence. 
     <lb/>But we should want men elsewhere. So 
     <lb/>far, then, as regards the frontier and the    
     <lb/>soil, this must be left to the people, and  
     <lb/>they are safe enough if they are ready to      
     <lb/>defend their hearths resolutely. They    
     <lb/>are as good men as the Americans; bet<lb break="no"/>ter, they  often say. The Americans boast   
     <lb/>to have enlisted more than 40,000 Cana<lb break="no"/>dians into the Federal army, so there can       
     <lb/>be no question as to the stuff they would    
     <lb/>have to deal with. It only rests with     
     <lb/>themselves to say to whom whom they will be-    
     <lb/>long."

     AFTERNOON SESSION—2.30 P.M.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName> resumed.—From this ex<lb break="no"/>tract we see what is the feeling of the    
     <lb/>
     people of England with regard to us. In      
     <lb/>
    case of difficulties arising the soldiers    
     <lb/>would be sent to the seaports of the ene<lb break="no"/>my rather than to our immediate assist<lb break="no"/>ance. But  they not only go thus far;      
     <lb/>there is evidently a desire in the minds of     
     <lb/>many that we should be cut off from all      
     <lb/>connection with England. Agentleman    
     <lb/>of distinguished abilities, A. Allison, Esq,     
     <lb/>author of the Philosophy and History of      
     <lb/>Civilization, has recently issued a <choice><sic>pam<lb break="no"/>hlet</sic><corr>pamphlet</corr></choice> on the Independence of Canada, in     
     <lb/>which he says :—     
     <lb/>
            </p>

    
   
            <p>
     "I am of opinion that England should  
     <lb/>
    not only interfere with the civil war now 
     <lb/>raging in America, but that she should 
     <lb/>retire altogether from the North American 
     <lb/>Continent by declaring Canada an inde<lb break="no"/>pendent state. So long as Canada belongs 
     <lb/>to us we hold out a bait to the United 
     <lb/>States to go to war with us with a view to 
     <lb/>its annexation. That being so, it is mani<lb break="no"/>festly the interest both of England and     
     <lb/>      Canada to separate. The press and all    
     <lb/>our leading statesmen are unanimous in   
     <lb/>expressing their readiness to give up  Ca<lb break="no"/>nada if the Canadians themselves are will<lb break="no"/>ing to accept independence, and if these    
     <lb/>liberal professions on our part are sincere   
     <lb/>there will be no difficulty in effecting that    
     <lb/>object.   
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"If Canada should prefer dependence,   
     <lb/>that would be no reason why we we should    
     <lb/>not make her independent. We must   
     <lb/>look to our own interest as well as to the    
     <lb/>interests of others, and if it can be shown    
     <lb/>that it is the interest of all parties that    
     <lb/>Canada be independent, we ought not to    
     <lb/>hesitate in making her so even although     
     <lb/>she should object to it. Two great na<lb break="no"/>tions like England and the United States    
     <lb/>meet each other in every quarter of the     
     <lb/>globe, and all the disputes which are ever     
     <lb/>occurring between them must eventually   
     <lb/>be settled on Canadian ground. But let   
     <lb/>Canada be an independent state and she    
     <lb/>wtll be a neutral power in the event of a   
     <lb/>war breaking out. Let this view of the    
     <lb/>question be clearly explained to the Ca-    
     <lb/>nadians in a despatch properly drawn up<lb/>from the Foreign Office, and the object<lb break="no"/>
      

            <cb/>
       
tions which they have hitherto had to in<lb break="no"/>dependence will be removed."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"Now is the time for us to make up<lb/>our minds to give up Canada, for that step<lb/>will not only save us a world fo money<lb/>for the armaments which are now called<lb/>for, but it will prevent the danger of war<lb/>with the united States. To postpone the<lb/>consideration of this important question<lb/>until after we have spent the money, or<lb/>until we have drifted so far into war that<lb/>it is impossible to give up Canada consist<lb break="no"/>ent with honor, would be the height of <lb/>folly. I trust therefore that this import<lb break="no"/>ant question will be taken up at once with<lb/>a view to its immediate settlement."<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>I make this quotation to show that the<lb/>attention of public men is being called to<lb/>this matter, and stirring up their minds<lb/>to consider the result, and so far do they<lb/>go as to speak of cutting the Colonies off<lb/>altogether! There must be some cause<lb/>for this, or it would not be spoken of.<lb/>

Mr. ANGLIN</persName>.— I beg the hon.<lb/>member's pardon, but I have in my hand<lb/>a quotation from the London <hi rendition="simple:italic">Times</hi>, which<lb/>he considers so good an authority, and as<lb/>I may have to send it away in a few min<lb break="no"/>utes, I wish to read— <lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:CONN1">Mr. CONNELL</persName>.— I wish to go on, and if<lb/>the hon. member is anxious to read it he can<lb/>do so after I am done. I was about to say<lb/>that with this writer, I think that the time<lb/>has arrived hat something should be done.<lb/>Canada is taking up the matter in earnest,<lb/>and why should we be left behind? We<lb/>are told that in case of war the only pro<lb break="no"/>tection we should be likely to receive<lb/>would be such relief as a man-of-war could<lb/>afford at Halifax, or Quebec. If this is<lb/>the case it is fully for us to devote $30,<lb break="no"/>000 to the Militia purposes; it would be much<lb/>better to lay it out on the public roads<lb/>I hope, however, that whatever amount is<lb/>granted it will be appropriate in such a<lb/>way as will be of real benefit to the coun<lb break="no"/>try. And now in closing, I will refer the<lb/>hon. members of this House to a dis<lb break="no"/>tinguished authority—a name known<lb/>throughout the world—Sir. F. Williams,<lb/>of Kars; a gentleman, who, holding a seat<lb/>in the English Parliament, and having<lb/>performed actions in the field as great as<lb/>any recorded in modern times, at once a <lb/>soldier and a politician, may be regarded<lb/>as good authority in military and legisla<lb break="no"/>tive matters. In an address delivered by <lb/>him in Toronto, he said:—<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"The principal object of my visit to<lb/>this Western district was to inspect the<lb/>Military Schools in Toronto and in Hamil<lb break="no"/>ton, and I regret a similar institution in<lb break="no"/>tended for London is not yet organized.<lb/>It would be impossible to conduct these<lb/>establishments without drill-shed, and I<lb/>was much gratified in seeing the spacious<lb/>edifices which Toronto and Hamilton have<lb/>recently erected. they do thee two<lb/>cities great honour and credit. Never<lb/>was money better spent.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>When you hear and read the various<lb/>conflicting opinions daily expressed as to<lb/>the defences and armaments which are<lb/>proposed for the safety of these great Pro<lb break="no"/>vinces, you will call to mind former simi<lb break="no"/>lar discussion as regards the defence of<lb/>the United Kingdom - begun by the fa<lb break="no"/>mous letter of the Duke of Wellington to<lb/>Sir John Burgoyne. In the midst of that<lb/>controversy and apparent indecision, the<lb/>Imperial Government steadily matured its<lb/>plans; and England with its present de<lb break="no"/>fensive works and 170,000 volunteers is<lb/>no long menaced with invasion.

     works and organization which are intend<lb break="no"/>ed to guard your frontiers, and to enable 
     <lb/>
     you to rally and defend your homes in 
     <lb/>
     future times. And when I express an 
     <lb/>
     opinion as to the absence of danger at the 
     <lb/>
     present montent, I counsel you not to 
     <lb/>
     neglect any department of the military 
     <lb/>
     art.  In other words, I firmly believe that 
     <lb/>
     every national born soldier in the Ameri<lb break="no"/>can army yearns for his home and the de<lb break="no"/>lights to be found there, and that he has<lb/>
    no wish, after having vindicated the 
     <lb/>honour of his own country, to carry the 
     <lb/>horrors of war into Canada. Yet, as time 
     <lb/>passes, complications may arise, and now 
     <lb/>is the moment to guard against future 
     <lb/>contingencies. I address these friendly 
     <lb/>admonition to this city, the capital of that 
     <lb/>portion of the Empire which lies farthest 
     <lb/>from the ocean."  
     <lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Here is the opinion of a gentleman who 
     <lb/>
     was born among us, and who has raised 
     <lb/>
     himself by his great abilities and untiring 
     <lb/>
     energy to a proud position as a soldier 
     <lb/>
     and a statesman. He is Commander-in- 
     <lb break="yes"/>
     Chief of the Forces of British North Ame<lb break="no"/>rica. I feel this is no idle matter. It re<lb break="no"/>quires that some action should be had 
     <lb/>
     upon it. As I said at the first, I do not 
     <lb/>
     speak for the love of hearing myself, but 
     <lb/>
     because the people in that part of the 
     <lb/>
     country which I represent are anxious to 
     <lb/>
     know. and from their position should 
     <lb/>
     know, whether in case of difficulty they 
     <lb/>
     would be defended by England, or left to 
     <lb/>
     themselves .

     Hon . Mr. SMITH.—As the hour has

     the late Government had increased the 
     <lb/>
    grant for Militia from $10,000 to $20,000,
     <lb/>yet after that, Mr. Cardwell pronounces 
     <lb/>that the Militia exists only on paper. 
     <lb/>This Government proceed to add $10,000 
     <lb/>more to the grant, and as yet the Bill is 
     <lb/>no introduced. He had no objection to 
     <lb/>put the whole resources of the country 
     <lb/>into the hands of the Government if they 
     <lb/>are required, but seeing the low state of 
     <lb/>the finances, the large amounts that would 
     <lb/>be needed to repair the damage done by 
     <lb/>the late freshet to bridges and roads, the 
     <lb/>appropriation should not be so much 
     <lb/>His Excellency had suggested the idea of 
     <lb/>training the officers, so that they could 
     <lb/>
       

            <cb/>
         

     easily instruct a large body of men when 
     <lb/>
     needed. He thought the plan a good 
     <lb/>
    one, and suggested that the men in the 
     <lb/>rural districts could meet in tha evening's 
     <lb/>to be instructed in the drill. 
     <lb/>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:HATH1">Mr. HATHEWAY</persName> was surprised and 
     <lb/>
     gratified to hear the very eloquent speech 
     <lb/>
     of the hon. member for Carleton (Mr. 
     <lb/>
     Connell). It would have done honour to 
     <lb/>
     the House of Commons. He thought 
     <lb/>
    there was no necessity to go into the con<lb break="no"/>sideration of ths Bill before making the 
     <lb/>grant. If the Bill was defeated the 
     <lb/>amount would not be issued. He inform<lb break="no"/>ed the hon. member for Carleton, (Mr.<lb/>Lindsay) that the addition of $10,000 to 
     <lb/>the grant was not the work of this Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment, but of the late one, and, there<lb break="no"/>fore, they should not be blamed for it. 
     <lb/>He believed that if we do our duty, we 
     <lb/>need not fear that England will leave us 
     <lb/>to the mercy of a foe . When he looked 
     <lb/>at what other Sister Colonies were doing 
     <lb/>in the matter, he thought it was time we 
     <lb/>should do something more than we have 
     <lb/>done in the past, and the passing he was 
     <lb/>sure was no more than England would 
     <lb/>look to us to give. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. McMILLAN</persName> said they did not yet 
     <lb/>know for what purpose the sum was to be 
     <lb/>expended. He understood some great 
     <lb/>changes were to be made in the old law, 
     <lb/>although what they were, he had not 
     <lb/>yet learned. The freedom which England 
     <lb/>gave to us was the first step towards the 
     <lb/>position we occupy, and we should now be 
     <lb/>willing to do something for our own de<lb break="no"/>fence, and no longer throw ourselves on 
     <lb/>the poor clssaes of England, who are 
     <lb/>heavily taxed to support the troops here. 
     <lb/>If there was any one thing that should be 
     <lb/>under one's eye and mind and Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, it was the Militia of all these Pro 
     <lb/>vinces. But the majority of the people 
     <lb/>had decided that this was. not to be at<lb break="no"/>tained for the present; ; still he was will<lb break="no"/>ing to go to the utmost of the means we 
     <lb/>possess in our isolated position to show 
     <lb/>our determination do something for 
     <lb/>ourselves, and to prove our loyalty to 
     <lb/>Great Britain. The principle of the Colo<lb break="no"/>nies supporting their own soldiers is be<lb break="no"/>coming very general. The troops in In<lb break="no"/>dia are supported there, and in Australia 
     <lb/>each soldier receives £40 per year from 
     <lb/>the public chest. It was not to be <choice><sic>sup<lb break="no"/>prised</sic><corr>surprised</corr></choice> at that these Colonies should be 
     <lb/>asked to do something more than they 
     <lb/>have, under these circumstances. He was 
     <lb/>willing to go for a large grant for this 
     <lb/>purpose, and to show England that we de<lb break="no"/>sire our connection with our Mother 
     <lb/>Country—our glorious Mother Country—<lb/>to continue.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> moved that the blank be<lb/>filled with $10,000. The hon.

The<lb/>House and the people would ask why<lb/>the Government, knowing, as he sup<lb break="no"/>posed, their strength and the policy they<lb/>intended to adopt.

            <cb/>
      

     purpose a sum three hundred fold more 
     <lb/>
     than former grants . When the hon. 
     <lb/>
     President of the Council had opposed a 
     <lb/>
     former grant he was with him, for he 
     <lb/>
     did the same. He failed to see why it 
     <lb/>
     was necessary for the descendants of 
     <lb/>
     the loyalists, and those who came from 
     <lb/>
     England, Ireland and Scotland, to need 
     <lb/>
     to show their loyalty to the British 
     <lb/>
     throne by voting $30,000 for our de<lb break="no"/>fence. Did the people of England doubt 
     <lb/>
     our loyalty? No; there was not a man 
     <lb/>
     in the House of Commons who dared to 
     <lb/>
     stand up in his place and say the people 
     <lb/>
     of New Brunswick are not loyal. This 
     <lb/>
     reason was not given when the grant 
     <lb/>
     for $10,000 was made, and what has oc<lb break="no"/>curred since to cause such a change 
     <lb/>
     and to call for such an argument to be 
     <lb/>
     put forward? He thought this Govern<lb break="no"/>ment would not follow in the steps of 
     <lb/>
     the last; but he doubted, if even the late 
     <lb/>
     Government had known the position in 
     <lb/>
     which we are now placed, they would 
     <lb/>
     have increased the expenditure 300 per 
     <lb/>
     cent. This Government. however, know<lb break="no"/>ing the revenue is falling off, and that 
     <lb/>
     they have to come to the House and ask 
     <lb/>
     for extraordinary means in the form of 
     <lb/>
     revenue notes to carry on the public 
     <lb/>
     works, do come and ask us to grant for 
     <lb/>
     militia purposes 300 per cent. on former 
     <lb/>
     grants, or one-twentieth of the whole 
     <lb/>
     revenues of the Province. Was it to 
     <lb/>
     show their loyalty? was it for defence? 
     <lb/>
     Look at our coast. Would the whole 
     <lb/>
     revenue of the. country be sufficient to 
     <lb/>
     defend it? No, it would all be but as a 
     <lb/>
    drop in a bucket. We could not erect 
     <lb/>any fortifications that would prove of 
     <lb/>any effect. It has been found that no 
     <lb/>fortifications can prevent Canada from 
     <lb/>invasion from theUnited States; and 
     <lb/>how much more applicable the remark 
     <lb/>would be to New Brunswick. What 
     <lb/> we want is population to bring our our 
     <lb/>resources, open up our roads and deve<lb break="no"/>lop the bone and sinew of the country, 
     <lb/>and that would be our best defence. 
     <lb/>Canada does not do as we are doing, 
     <lb/>but goes to the British government and 
     <lb/>says, guarantee us this money. and then 
     <lb/>we will go to work and erect our forti<lb break="no"/>fications. Does this Government do 
     <lb/>anything of this kind ? Not at all; but 
     <lb/>they put their hands in the public purse, 
     <lb/>and take $30,000 out of the hard work<lb break="no"/>ing people of the Province. He was in 
     <lb/>favor of a grant of $10,000 to keep up 
     <lb/>some organization, to show how many<lb/>men are really available in case of diffi<lb break="no"/>culties arising, and to drill the officers 
     <lb/>so that they may be fitted to command 
     <lb/>the men; but. he could not go for $30,<lb break="no"/>000, which was $10,000 beyond what 
     <lb/>the late government granted. The Go<lb break="no"/>vernment should first have exhausted all 
     <lb/>argument and all diplomacy with the 
     <lb/>British Government, before they decid<lb break="no"/>ed to ask for this sum If they had done 
     <lb/>his; if they had told them our position, 
     <lb/>tthat revenues were falling off, that 
     <lb/>we wanted to extend our public works, 
     <lb/>that the roads were in a shocking state, 
     <lb/>and the backwoodsmen were crying out 
     <lb/>for a little money to keep them passable; 
     <lb/>if they had assured them of our contin<lb break="no"/>ued loyalty, and our readiness in case 
     <lb/>of trouble to vote the whole of our rev<lb break="no"/>enues for this one purpose of defence, 
     <lb/>I do not believe they would have failed, 
     <lb/>or that. they would have needed to come 
     <lb/>to this House and ask for such a sum 
     <lb/>for this purpose.

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> referredt to the present 
     <lb/>
     Government. He knew they had but 
     <lb/>
    lately come into power, but they could 
     <lb/>have taken the coming summer to look 
     <lb/>into the matter, and do what they could 
     <lb/>to secure an arrangement with the Mo<lb break="no"/>ther Country. It is now a time of peace, 
     <lb/>amicable relations are existing between 
     <lb/>England the United States, there are no 
     <lb/>signs of war or rumours of war, and it 
     <lb/>has been distinctly stated that if any dif<lb break="no"/>ficulties arise they will be such as can 
     <lb/>only be settled by diplomacy. There 
     <lb/>was a time when forebodings of war 
     <lb/>might have taken possession of the 
     <lb/>minds of hon. members; the difficulties 
     <lb/>with regard to the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Alabama</hi> seemed im<lb break="no"/>minent, but that had passed away, and 
     <lb/>the feelings of the two countries now 
     <lb/>are friendly and amicable. Under these 
     <lb/>circumstances he could not see any ne<lb break="no"/>cessity for the grant to be increased. 
     <lb/>He had read the dispatches from Col. 
     <lb/>Winter, but he believed if this country 
     <lb/>were set right there would be no diffi<lb break="no"/>culty . The new militia law, it was said, 
     <lb/>was to contain a clause for the men to 
     <lb/>be taken and drafted into the militia. 
     <lb/>He was sure this would not go down 
     <lb/>with the people of this country . He 
     <lb/>supposed the grant would pass, but he 
     <lb/>did not believe it would be endorsed by 
     <lb/>the people of this Province. It might 
     <lb/>be all very well to let men see who was 
     <lb/>the best marksman by shooting at a 
     <lb/>bull's-eye or a target, but the' money 
     <lb/>could be expended  a| more profitable 
     <lb/>manner. He hoped that at any rate ar<lb break="no"/>rangements would  not be made with an 
     <lb/>eye the position a man occupied in 
     <lb/>the militia. He did not see why the 
     <lb/>money should be taken from the bye- 
     <lb break="yes"/>roads, and he hoped hon. members, 
     <lb/>whether they were colonels or lieuten<lb break="no"/>ant-colonels, would pause before they 
     <lb/>took the funds that should go to this 
     <lb/>purpose, and allow it to be blown about 
     <lb/>the country with no benefit to any one.

            <p><persName ref="pers:SMIT1">Hon. Mr. SMITH</persName> said his hon. col<lb break="no"/>league seemed to think he was the ex<lb break="no"/>ponent of the minds and feelings of the 
     <lb/>whole country, and asks what change 
     <lb/>has taken place that so much money 
     <lb/>should be granted for militia purposes. 
     <lb/>Was he not aware of the change? Did 
     <lb/>he not know that the country had passed 
     <lb/>through a great change within a very 
     <lb/>short time? Did he not know that he 
     <lb/>had fought through, side by side, with 
     <lb/>men he how took to task, a cam<lb break="no"/>paign that involved the prosperity or 
     <lb/>the destruction and ruin of this country ? 
     <lb/>His hon. colleague had remarked that a 
     <lb/>change had taken place in his feelings, 
     <lb/>and he woul say that he had changed, 
     <lb/>that he had felt that the pressure of the 
     <lb/>times called for a change. Reference 
     <lb/>had been made to those gentlemen who 
     <lb/>had gone from Canada to England; and 
     <lb/>he would ask: is it their intention to 
     <lb/>force upon as a scheme that this coun<lb break="no"/>try has refused ? When we see how no<lb break="no"/>bly Nova Scotia has acted in this mat<lb break="no"/>ter, and at a time when Canada is striv<lb break="no"/>ing to show that this country not 
     <lb/>willing to do her share toward defence, 
     <lb/>he thought. seeing this, that. it was time 
     <lb/>to put forth greater exertions than or ever 
     <lb/>to vie with our sister Province in show<lb break="no"/>ing to England that we still are attached 
     <lb/>to her, and are willing to do what we 
     <lb/>can to defend her interests if the emer<lb break="no"/>gency demands. He believed the peo<lb break="no"/>ple of the country would uphold the Go<lb break="no"/>

vernment in the course. pursued, and 
     <lb/>
     see that they were acting in the service 
     <lb/>
     of the country, and to show the Mother 
     <lb/>
    Country that we were willing to maintain 
     <lb/>ourselves as tin integral portion of the 
     <lb/>British empire. He would call the at<lb break="no"/>tention of the House to a speech made 
     <lb/>by Mr. Fitzgerald in the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons, on the 13th of March, on the grant 
     <lb/>of £50,000 for the defences of Quebec. 
     <lb/>He said- <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>"He did not believe there were the 
     <lb/>
     men in the House or in this countr who 
     <lb/>
     would say that they would gravely de<lb break="no"/>termine to abandon the Canadas to their 
     <lb/>
     own defence to lend them no assistance, 
     <lb/>
     to withdraw our troops for fear they 
     <lb/>
     should be defended or taken prisoners of 
     <lb/>
     war. He did not believe there was a 
     <lb/>
     single man in the House out of it who 
     <lb/>
     would assent to a course so disastrous 
     <lb/>
     and so disgraceful to the British name. 
     <lb/>
      His belief was that if Canada 
     <lb/>
     were independent to-morrow she would 
     <lb/>
     run not the slightest danger of a contest. 
     <lb/>
     There were impediments, financial, in<lb break="no"/>dustrial and political, which would in<lb break="no"/>terfere with any project on the part of 
     <lb/>
     the American Govt. for annexing Cana<lb break="no"/>da. His belief was that they would be 
     <lb/>content to see the colony, if indepen<lb break="no"/>dent. growing up side by side with them. 
     <lb/>She was united to this country, and 
     <lb/>wished to remain so." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Another gentleman, Mr. W. E. Forster, 
     <lb/>also said: 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" There was a question raised as to the 
     <lb/>respective shares of expense to be borne 
     <lb/>by this country (Great Britain) and by 
     <lb/>Canada, for defending the latter. Into 
     <lb/>that question he was not disposed to en<lb break="no"/>ter, because the principle was becoming 
     <lb/>every day more established that the rela<lb break="no"/>tions between this country and the Colo<lb break="no"/>nies of British North America was very 
     <lb/>much on the basis of a defensive alliance 
     <lb/>between two self-goverining communities 
     <lb/>united together by an allegiance to one 
     <lb/>legitimate sovereign. Therefore we had 
     <lb/>a right to call on the North American 
     <lb/>Colonies by organization and union to as<lb break="no"/>sist in their mm defence, and to prove 
     <lb/>their patriotism by a willing contribution 
     <lb/>of money and men." 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Cardwell, the Secretary of State 
     <lb/>for the Colonies, in speaking of what the 
     <lb/>Government proposed to do, said: -<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>" The report laid on the table (that of 
     <lb/>
     Col. Jarvis on the defenses ot Canada) 
     <lb/>
     points to the fortifications of Montreal 
     <lb/>
     and Quebec, positions of the greatest <choice><sic>mi<lb break="no"/>portance</sic><corr>importance</corr></choice> for the defence of Canada. The 
     <lb/>
     defence of Quebec we engage to under<lb break="no"/>take ; the defence of Montreal we called 
     <lb/>
     on the colony to undertake. Then arma<lb break="no"/>ment of both we are willing to undertake, 
     <lb/>
     so that the division of expense will be 
     <lb/>
     about two-fifths to the mother country and 
     <lb/>
     three-fifths to the Colony.   *     *     *     * 
     <lb/>
     As long as Canada made no exertions, 
     <lb/>
     and showed no readiness to prepare for 
     <lb/>
     her own defence, we felt it would be 
     <lb/>
     wrong in us (the Government) to come to 
     <lb/>
     the House, and ask for Imperial money to 
     <lb/>
     defend Canada;   but the moment that 
     <lb/>
     spirit was shown which was manifeseed 
     <lb/>
     in the autumn of last year, it became our 
     <lb/>
     duty to come and ask the House of Com<lb break="no"/>mons to enable us to give assistance to 
     <lb/>
     Canada.  *  *  *   A war with Canada 
     <lb/>is a war with England. The Imperial 
     <lb/>forces will be brought to the aid of Cana<lb break="no"/>da, and wherever it will be most effective 
     <lb/>in destroying the power of the enemy, 
     <lb/>there will the Imperial power be exer<lb break="no"/>cised." 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

    

            <p>
     When we seee that this the spirit of the 
     <lb/>
          

            <cb/>
    

     
     British Government, and the despatches 
     <lb/>
     which have passed; when we find that it 
     <lb/>
     wwa the men who favored Confederation 
     <lb/>
     and who stated that we were not doing 
     <lb/>
     what we ought to do In this matter, who 
     <lb/>
     virtually pressed upon the British Gov<lb break="no"/>ernment the necessity of urging us to do 
     <lb/>
     more in our own defence: he said when 
     <lb/>
     we see all this, and that England is will<lb break="no"/>ing to help us in the hour of our necessi<lb break="no"/>ty, they should be willing to pass such a 
     <lb/>
     sum as this for the Militia. If this were 
     <lb/>
     done. and England saw we were in ear<lb break="no"/>nest, he had no doubt but that a much 
     <lb/>
     larger sum than ever before would be ex<lb break="no"/>pended on fortifications, although they 
     <lb/>
     already spent for Military purposes in this 
     <lb/>
     Province over $100,000 a year. His hon. 
     <lb/>
     colleague spoke of the cry of the back<lb break="no"/>woodsman; he wished his hon friend to 
     <lb/>
     know that he had a heart to feel for the 
     <lb/>
     back-woodsman too, and he knew that 
     <lb/>
     money was needed for the bye roads, but 
     <lb/>
     he would tell his hon. friend that the back<lb break="no"/>woodsman could tell what was bunkum 
     <lb/>
     and what was not. Looking at surround<lb break="no"/>ing circumstances he was aura that if they 
     <lb/>
     did not pass the grant they would not be 
     <lb/>
     doing their duty. 
     <lb/>
     
     </p>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MCMI1">Mr. MCMILLAN</persName> said it seemed that the 
     <lb/>reason why the hon. President of the 
     <lb/>Council had changed his opinions and mili<lb break="no"/>tary feeling from nothing to $30,000 was 
     <lb/>that we had had an election. He thought 
     <lb/>it must have been something outside of 
     <lb/>the British Government. Was it on ac<lb break="no"/>count of them that fears arose ? Is not 
     <lb/>our position as amicable now as it was 
     <lb/>when his hon. friend opposed any grant 
     <lb/>to the Militia. The hon. President of the 
     <lb/>Council had spoken of bunkum in con<lb break="no"/>nection with the bye-roads; did not he 
     <lb/>last year ask for $10,000 to be granted to 
     <lb/>bye-road? Was that bunkum? There 
     <lb/>certainly was not the same hostile feeling 
     <lb/>evinced now as last Session when the 
     <lb/>grant was but $20,000. 
     <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. McCLELLAN</persName> quite agreed with the 
     <lb/>hon. member for Westmorland, (Mr. Gil<lb break="no"/>bert), that this sum of money could be 
     <lb/>used for a better purpose than this. But 
     <lb/>then the hon. member did not know how 
     <lb/>soon he might be in a Government, and 
     <lb/>find that from outside influence he might 
     <lb/>be driven to go for just such grants, in 
     <lb/>opposition to his wishes, and against his 
     <lb/>own ideas of what was right. His Ex<lb break="no"/>cellency, in one of his despatches, had 
     <lb/>said that the money appropriated to Mili<lb break="no"/>tia purposes was not fixed by law, but 
     <lb/>annually voted by the House, although 
     <lb/>not without opposition. The grant will 
     <lb/>be voted now, no doubt without any diffi<lb break="no"/>culty. seeing the great changes that have 
     <lb/>taken place. He agreed with the hon. 
     <lb/>member for Carleton that the bill should 
     <lb/>have been laid before the House before 
     <lb/>passing the grant. The hon. President 
     <lb/>of the Council had said that the scheme 
     <lb/>of which he was opposed, was likely to 
     <lb/>enslave the country. It is well that they 
     <lb/>make the first step, the first concession 
     <lb/>to the principles upheld by those who fa<lb break="no"/>vored it, namely. the policy of putting 
     <lb/>ourselves in a better state of defence. It 
     <lb/>is said that on account of what they are 
     <lb/>doing in Canada a large grant is to be 
     <lb/>made. This is the cause, the pressure 
     <lb/>from abroad and from the Home Govern<lb break="no"/>ment, that causes them to grant such a 
     <lb/>large sum in opposition to their own feel<lb break="no"/>ings in the matter. It is a source of con<lb break="no"/>gratulation to the friends of Confedera<lb break="no"/>tion, that if such a change comes over the 
     <lb/>Government on the great ground-work of 
     <lb/>the scheme that a further change may 
     <lb/>ensure; and he was from the 
     <lb/>speeches he had heard to-day, that this<lb/>

   <fw type="num">72</fw>  <fw type="running">DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY FOR 1865.</fw> 
   

     was but the beginning of the end. It   
     <lb/>was chiefly laid down during the late cam<lb break="no"/>paign that no large sums should be grant<lb break="no"/>ed for this purpose, as insignificance was<lb/>our best defence. While he belonged to <lb/>as loyal a section of the Province as any,<lb/>he would ask, what could $30,000 do for<lb/>our defence? Before entering into this <lb/>matter the Hill should have been laid be<lb break="no"/>fore the House, but not till that moment<lb/>had it been laid on his desk. He held<lb/>that the calling of the people out for their <lb/>yearly inspection, was a waste of time <lb/>and money.<lb/>
     
            </p>
   
    

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. Gillmor said it was intend<lb break="no"/>ed to change that.   
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Mr. McClellan</persName>.—That was just what 
     <lb/>
     he wanted to see the Bill ; for, he certainly 
     <lb/>
     was not in favor of such a scheme being 
     <lb/>
     carried out or retained in the country, 
     <lb/>
     aithough he considered the putting down 
     <lb/>
     of a grant of $30,000 for Militia purposes 
     <lb/>
     as a concession to the principle of Con<lb break="no"/>federation ; yet he thought it was ill-timed, 
     <lb/>
    as we were not in a position to provide 
     <lb/>for ourselves. Here there is little or 
     <lb/>nothing to defend. If the Government 
     <lb/>expect an invasion, it must be from the 
     <lb/>States ; and he would ask what could we 
     <lb/>do against their great armies? I do not 
     <lb/>wish the House to understand that I am 
     <lb/>opposed to this grant, for I think that the 
     <lb/>provision for military defence should be 
     <lb/>the first object of the country, but 1 am 
     <lb/>opposed to filling up the blank with any 
     <lb/>such sum as that named. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>
     Hon. Mr. Wilmot said he was against 
     <lb/>
     the abolition of the old Militia law. If a 
     <lb/>
     Colony was willing to assist in its own 
     <lb/>
     defence, it was valuable to the Empire ; 
     <lb/>
     but if it was not willing, it became only a 
     <lb/>
     burden. He was one of those who had 
     <lb/>
     the honor to be a private in the Aroostook 
     <lb/>
     war, and he remembered, when a little 
     <lb/>
     boy, in the war of 1812, when the 104th 
     <lb/>
     regiment was raised in this Province. 
     <lb/>
     There was no talk about Confederation 
     <lb/>
     then, although the men went and fought 
     <lb/>
     in Canada as bravely as any there. It 
     <lb/>
     might be true that our weakness was our 
     <lb/>
     best strength ; but in case of extremity, 
     <lb/>
     he was sure the people would be willing 
     <lb/>
     to do what they could, and when the pal<lb break="no"/>try sum of $30,000 is asked for, the ma<lb break="no"/>jority of the Province and of hon. mem<lb break="no"/>bers on the floors of the House would 
     <lb/>
     uphold it. 
     <lb/>
            </p>

            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:DESB2">Mr. L. P. W. DESBRISAY</persName>, after some 
     <lb/>
     introductory remarks on Confederation in 
     <lb/>
     reply to those from other members, said . 
     <lb/>
     He was surprised to hear the hon. mem<lb break="no"/>ber for Westmorland ask what great 
     <lb/>
     change had transpired. He had gone 
     <lb/>
     through  a campaign in an adjoining Coun<lb break="no"/>ty to his own, and he ought to know what 
     <lb/>
     had transpired. In Nova Scotia they 
     <lb/>
     have given $81,000 for Militia purposes, 
     <lb/>
     and he was sorry-this Government had 
     <lb/>
     not been able to put down pound for 
     <lb/>
     pound for our Sister Province, and to 
     <lb/>
     stop the assertion put forth that we are 
     <lb/>
     not as loyal as she. With regard to the 
     <lb/>
     statement put forth as to the feelings of 
     <lb/>
     the people of England being for cutting 
     <lb/>
     us off, those who talk in  this way are a 
     <lb/>
    people who began cutting us off by  im<lb break="no"/>posing upon us with regard to our lum<lb break="no"/>ber ; they have no care for the greatness 
     <lb/>the country, save to turn it into a 
     <lb/>workshop. And there was one thing, 
     <lb/>that he felt our Government did not do 
     <lb/>their duty to the English Government at 
     <lb/>the time of the Trent affair. When they 
     <lb/>sent out regiments of soldiers, and the <lb/>best blood of the country too, to provide<lb/>for our defence, our Government should<lb/>have taken them by the hand and passed<lb/>them through the Province free of charge.<lb/>
        

            <cb/>
       

     He was certain we could have passed 
     <lb/>them through at one-third less than what<lb/>it did cost the Imperial Government. I<lb/>am sorry to see the grant so small, as I<lb/>think we should make it in accordance<lb/>with the benefits we receive from the<lb/>protection of England, although he was<lb/>sure the feeling there is such that whe<lb break="no"/>ther we spend $300 or $30,000, they will <lb/>continue to protect us.<lb/>
            </p>
   
    

    

            <p>Mr. Needham had somewhere read<lb/>that it was excellent to have the strength<lb/>of giants, but tyrannous to use it. He<lb/>thought they could afford to be easy with<lb/>the poor unfortunates who were left out.<lb/>He was quite willing they should glory<lb/>in what they could, even in being beaten.<lb/>He was not going to vote for the $30,<lb break="no"/>000, to show England that we are loyal, <lb/>but because the Government informs<lb/>the House that it is necessary for the <lb/>wants of the country. As to letting <lb/>England know we are loyal, it is what<lb/>she knew long ago. When the old <lb/>104th Regiment was raised, and they<lb/>went to Canada, they did not go to fight<lb/>for this country, but to defend the flag. <lb/>We once voted every shilling out of the <lb/>Treasury in a time of danger ; and what<lb/>for? To defend the flag. They know<lb/>we are loyal ; but the Government say<lb/>they want it : therefore I am willing they<lb/>should ; but if they do not use it right, <lb/>he would call them to account for it. He <lb/>did not believe we are called on to de<lb break="no"/>fend ourselves : for we are an integral<lb/>part of the empire. If England needs <lb/>to build fortifications on every headland <lb/>on our shores, or elsewhere, all we are<lb/>called on to do is provide well for our<lb/>militia. The hon. member for West<lb break="no"/>morland (Mr. Gilbert) had said, no man<lb/>dare stand up in the House of Commons <lb/>and say we are disloyal. Why? where<lb/>was Sam Slick, or in other words, where <lb/>was Judge Halliburton? He charged<lb/>us with disloyalty, and Nova Scotia too ; <lb/>and no man there to contradict him. <lb/>He wished he had been there, Sam Slick <lb/>wouldn't have written any more novels. <lb/>With regard to insignificance being our<lb/>best defence, it was sad to admit it-<lb/>but true. He did not believe in the <lb/>United States coming to swallow us up :<lb/>for the fact was, the war there was dead, <lb/>and here confederation was dead ; they <lb/>both died together, only one died a little<lb/>while before the other, that was all ; as <lb/>to the latter he hoped never to see the <lb/>ghost of it again. The ghost of it was <lb/>bad enough, but he hoped that it would <lb/>never come back ; if it did he hoped the <lb/>Lord in His infinite mercy would take<lb/>him away from here.<lb/>
            </p>

    

            <p>Mr. Thompson did not know what this<lb/>$30,000 would do, but he thought the <lb/>House should study by putting ourselves<lb/>in a proper state of defence, to preserve<lb/>the connection with the Mother Coun<lb break="no"/>try. Those who talked in the House of<lb/>Commons about our going off from them <lb/>were only radicals. We never hear of<lb/>men like Lord Palmerston making use<lb/>of such expressions, but that the coun<lb break="no"/>try might be preserved in its integrity. <lb/>This is as much a part of the country as<lb/>the County of Antrim, where he came <lb/>from. He should support the grant, as<lb/>he believed it was required.<lb/>
            </p>

    

    

    
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:ALLE2">Hon. Mr. ALLEN</persName> reviewed the various 
     <lb/>objections that had been made against<lb/>the grant, exposed the disposition of <lb/>some Canadians to place our Province<lb/>in a false light with England, and read<lb/>an extract from a paper for which the<lb/>country pays £60 a year, in which it was<lb/>attempted to be proved that we desire<lb/>annexation.

            <p>The question was put to the House on <lb/>Mr. Gilbert's amendment for $10,000,<lb/>which was lost. <lb/>

<!-- GL, 2018-02-14, Commented out below, as it will appear in the following debate day -->

            <!--<p>-FRIDAY, May 19.<lb/>Hon. Mr. GILLMOR brought in a Bill to<lb/>provide for paying certain expenses of the <lb/>civil government of the Province. Also-<lb break="yes"/>a Bill to provide for repairs and improve<lb break="no"/>ments on Roads and Bridges and other<lb/>public works. <lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> moved that the House go<lb/>into Committee to resume the considera<lb break="no"/>tion of a Bill to cheapen and simplify the<lb/>practice of the law, and to abolish special<lb/>bail.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:HATH1">Hon. Mr. HATHEWAY</persName> thought that as<lb/>there was not the slightest chance of<lb/>getting this Bill passed by the House, it <lb/>was no use to take up the timv in the dis<lb break="no"/>cussing it, particularly as the Attorney<lb/>General had prepared a Bill on the same<lb/>subject.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName> said the Bill before the<lb/>House was not of a complicated nature,<lb/>and could be easily understood. Fifteen<lb/>sections of the bill had already passed the<lb/>House, and he should like to have the <lb/>question decided.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. OTTY moved that the Bill be post<lb break="no"/>poned for three months.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. NEEDHAM-The Attorney Gener<lb break="no"/>al's Bill and the Bill which I prepared,<lb/>are the result of the joint labors of the<lb/>late Hon. Mr. Sireet, Mr. Kinnear and<lb/>Mr. Charles Fisher, and I presume, having<lb/>the result of their labors, we would be<lb/>hardly justified in adopting a Bill of this<lb/>kind, which changes our whole system of <lb/>common law procedure, the provisions of<lb/>which it would be impossible to carry <lb/>out. I move that the law bills now on the<lb/>fyles of the House, together with the Bill<lb/>to be introduced by the Attorney General,<lb/>be referred to a Select Committee of this<lb/>House, in order that they may bring in a<lb/>Bill at the next Session of the Legisla<lb break="no"/>ture to reform the Common Law Pro<lb break="no"/>cedure of this country.<lb/>

            <p>Mr. OTTY.-I shall withdraw my mo<lb break="no"/>tion in favor of that which Mr. Needham<lb/>introduced.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:GILB1">Mr. GILBERT</persName>.-I expected the mem<lb break="no"/>bers of the legal profession would oppose<lb/>this Bill ; it will, therefore, have to rest<lb/>upon its own merits. It does not change<lb/>the course of law procedure, but does<lb/>away with unnecessary labor. The coun<lb break="no"/>try requires this Bill, and the House by<lb/>passing fifteen sections of it has adopted <lb/>its principles. It has been drawn up<lb/>with a great deal of care, and if there is <lb/>anything wrong in it, let the legal gentle<lb break="no"/>men point it out. It would be an act of<lb/>injustice to refer it to a Select Committee,<lb/>for that would be an end of it.<lb/>
