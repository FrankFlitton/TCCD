     pose any Bill till there was a revision of   
     <lb/>the whole law.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BARBITT agreed with the re<lb break="no"/>marks made. There was much dissatis<lb break="no"/>faction existing with regard to the pre<lb break="no"/>sent law. The average attendance princi<lb break="no"/>ple he thought had worked badly in the<lb/>back settlements. The system of in<lb/>spection he thought was worthless, and<lb/>denominational grants he did not believe<lb/>in. He thought the best plan was to give<lb/>the amount to a general seat of learning<lb/>and improve the status of the Parish<lb/>Schools.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. WETMORE also called the atten<lb break="no"/>tion of the Attorney General to the sub<lb break="no"/>ject and while he could not oppose the<lb/>passage of the present Bill, he thought it<lb/>necessary that the whole School Law<lb/>should be revised.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of Mr. SKINNER the fur<lb break="no"/>ther consideration of the Bill was post<lb break="no"/>poned till the next session of the Legis<lb break="no"/>lature.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. FISHER moved the House<lb/>into Committee of the Whole on a Bill to<lb/>provide for defraying of expenses of the<lb/>civil Government. Mr. LEWIS in the<lb/>chair.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill was agreed to.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BECKWITH moved the House<lb/>into Committee of the Whole on a a Bill<lb/>relating to the City of Fredericton. Mr.<lb/>CHANDLER in the Chair.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill was agreed to with certain<lb/>amendments.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. QUINTON moved the House<lb/>into Committee of the Whole on a Bill to<lb/>enable the Corporation of St. John to<lb/>effect certain improvements in the streets<lb/>of said City on the Eastern side of the<lb/>Harbor. Dr. DOW in the Chair.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill was agreed to.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. ATTORNEY GENERAL moved<lb/>the House into Committee of the Whole<lb/>on a Bill to provide for the repairs and<lb/>improvement of the Roads and Bridges,<lb/>and other public works and services<lb/>Mr. J. FLEWWELLING in the Chair.<lb/>

            <p>Mr. SKINNER submitted the follow<lb break="no"/>ing Report :<lb/>

            <p>The Committee to whom was referred<lb/>the Bill to incorporate the Internationa-<lb break="maybe"/>Telegraph Company submit the follow<lb break="no"/>ing Report :<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Committee have taken the matter<lb/>into consideration, and whilst they are<lb/>in favor of the Bill with some amend<lb break="no"/>ments, they find that certain persons and<lb/>interests are opposed to the passage of<lb/>the Bill, and desire to be heard in oppo<lb break="no"/>sition thereto, and there being not suffi<lb break="no"/>cient time to hear them during the pre<lb break="no"/>sent session of the Legislature, the<lb/>Committee recommend the further con<lb break="no"/>sideration of the Bill remain over until<lb/>next Session, and the Committee ask<lb/>that in the meantime their organization<lb/>may remain with power to them to make<lb/>a further report at the next session of<lb/>the Legislature.<lb/>

            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>
      Mr. SKINNER moved for leave to     
     <lb/>bring in a Bill to permit the annexation<lb/>to British America upon certain condi<lb break="no"/>tions, by and with the consent of the<lb/>Imperial Parliament, of the States of<lb/>Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and Con<lb break="no"/>necticut, with provisions for the organiza<lb break="no"/>tion of Territorial Government for Penn<lb break="no"/>sylvania, Nantucket Island and New<lb/>York.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SKINNER stated that this was<lb/>intended as a set off to the Bill intro<lb break="no"/>duced into the Congress of the United<lb/>States to annex these Provinces to them.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>The Bill caused much laughter, but<lb/>was not received.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SKINNER moved the House into<lb/>Committee of the Whole on a Bill rela<lb break="no"/>ting to Marriage. Dr. Dow in the Chair.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SKINNER explained that this Bill 
     <lb/>contemplates the reduction of the time<lb/>for publishing banns, and the reduction of<lb/>the license fees, and the remission of the<lb/>fee demanded from the clergy for regis<lb break="no"/>tration by the Clerk of the Peace. It<lb/>would be better to take the fee for re<lb break="no"/>gistration at the time of issuing of the<lb/>license.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. SMITH was opposed to the short 
     <lb/>ening of the time of publication of<lb/>banns ; he thought three weeks was<lb/>quite little enough time. He should<lb/>therefore oppose that section, although<lb/>he was in favor of the other two.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     Mr. McQUEEN thought the two por- 
     <lb break="maybe"/>visions would clash ; he was of opinion<lb/>that it would be better to make the time<lb/>of publication three months.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. BABBITT was in favor of the Bill,<lb/>especially of the section relieving the<lb/>minister officiating from paying to the<lb/>Clerk of the Peace a fee of three and<lb/>nine pence for registration.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. TILLEY thought that great<lb/>inconvenience would arise if the party<lb/>were compelled to produce to the clergy<lb break="no"/>man a certificate from the Clerk of the<lb/>Peace that the fee of fifty cents had<lb/>been paid for registration. Many mar<lb break="no"/>riages that take place in the back set<lb break="no"/>tlements are by the publication of banns.,<lb/>and then the party would have to go<lb/>the county town to get the certificate. He<lb/>was afraid that this Section would not<lb/>work.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Hon. Mr. FISHER was opposed to the<lb/>shortening of the time of publication of<lb/>banns, and thought it best to lay the Bill<lb/>over till next Session.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. STEVENS, Mr. LINDSAY, and<lb/>others, also spoke on the Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. TILLEY moved that the further<lb/>considerations be postponed three months<lb/>House divided on postponement—Yeas<lb/>13, Nays 18.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>A further discussion then ensued with<lb/>regard to the propriety of making the al<lb/>terations proposed by the Bill.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>Progress was reported, without leave<lb/>to sit again.<lb/>
            </p>
            <milestone type="unknown"/>
            <p>House adjourned till tomorrow morn<lb break="no"/>ing at 9 o'clock.<lb/>

            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Hon. Mr. McCLELEN</persName> presented sev<lb break="no"/>eral petitions from the inhabitants of the<lb/>County of Westmorland, praying that a<lb/>more central line of railway may be<lb/>constructed through that County than<lb/>the one now proposed to be built by the<lb/>International Railway Company<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:YOUN1">Mr. YOUNG</persName>, the House<lb/>passed a Resolution authorizing the<lb/>Government to expend the sum of $2.000,<lb/>(being a grant made for that purpose in<lb/>1863.) In the improvement of Bethurst<lb/>Harbor, provided the expenditure of<lb/>that sum would produce a correspond<lb break="no"/>ing benefit.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p>On motion of <persName ref="pers:CAIE1">Mr. CAIE</persName>, the House<lb/>went into Committee on a Bill to pro<lb break="no"/>vide for the more effectual repairing of<lb/>Roads and bridges in the Parish of<lb/>Carleton, County of kent.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:CAIE1">Mr. CAIE</persName> said the Bill was similar to<lb/>one passed for the Parish of Richibucto<lb/>some years ago, and which had been<lb/>found to work well, for a great deal<lb/>more work had been done since it went<lb/>into operation than was done formerly.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:MCCL1">Hon. Mr. McCLELAN</persName> said the princi<lb break="no"/>ple of the Bill was very good, but it was<lb/>not fair to make a distinction between<lb/>different sections of the country ; under<lb/>this Bill persons would have to pay<lb/>twenty-five cents in lieu of a day's work,<lb/>but under the general law they would<lb/>have to pay fifty cents. He thought that<lb/>if they exacted a money tax, instead of<lb/>having the present absurd law, more<lb/>work would be done than at present.<lb/>
            </p>
            <p><persName ref="pers:TILL1">Hon. Mr. TILLEY</persName> said they should<lb/>not select one or two Parishes, and<lb/>make them an exception to the general<lb/>law. If they found that more work was<lb/>done, when a tax of twenty-five cents<lb/>was exacted they had better make it ap<lb break="no"/>plicable to the whole Province.<lb/>
            </p>
   
            <p>
     <persName ref="pers:YOUN1">Mr. YOUNG</persName> said there were laws 
     <lb/>similar to this in operation in some dis<lb break="no"/>tricts in Northumberland, and they had<lb/>been found to work well. When it was<lb/>made compulsory that persons should<lb/>pay twenty-five cents in lieu of a day's<lb/>work, more work was done than under<lb/>the present system.<lb/>
